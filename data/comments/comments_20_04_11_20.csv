2020-04-12 11:25:29,"A beautifully and tenderly reported story about incredible doctors, medical staff, patients, their babies and their families. Thankyou to these people and to the NYT. And to all those who've lost loved ones, we all over the world grieve with you. It is terrifying, even numbing, to see so many deaths reported as cold statistics , yet each death represents a personal tragedy and terrible loss to family and friends.......we hope your pain, along with these bad times, will soon come to an end......."
2020-04-12 11:27:44,A wonderful story highlighting the dedication of the nurses and physicians at Brooklyn Hospital.  And of the fears of patients at this time.
2020-04-12 11:28:42,So glad to hear how this family’s story has progressed- she’s been in my thoughts since the first article.
2020-04-12 12:22:38,"This story is so moving and beautifully told with such amazing details and photos.  And at the end it left me in tears -- tears of joy and relief seeing the amazing photo of the beautiful, healthy baby boy and the nurse's words that he is doing well. Best wishes to these families and healthcare workers!"
2020-04-12 12:40:38,"Thank-you, Sheri Fink for this wonderfully told and reported story, again from the font-lines. One of the biggest, but noblest goals for us as health care providers is to elevate the humanity in this crisis. These folks are doing there part. You are doing yours by bringing it poignantly to light."
2020-04-12 12:44:51,Great journalism. Thank you NYT.
2020-04-12 12:52:30,"I'm glad the staff in this article have been able to help these mothers and newborns during this terrible time.  We are in the middle of a worldwide health crisis, and sadly our national leadership has not taken it seriously enough.

This article should serve as a reminder to all:  Hospitals are for sick people, not birth.  People have been giving birth for as long as there have been people, but hospital births have only become the norm in the last hundred years or so.  The U.S. leads the world in maternal and infant mortality, and while hospital births are part of the problem, the chase for money and our broken health care system are the real culprits.

My wife had both of our children at home, our youngest just three weeks ago in the middle of this pandemic.  Everyone is healthy and happy, and the midwives were much better at treating us like people than any hospital worker we've ever met.  We never left the comfort of our home, so everyone's stress levels were low and no one's immune system was at risk of exposure to contagion.

We need to educate people more about this safe and healthy way of bringing life into the world.  Choosing home birth with certified midwives should be promoted and encouraged whenever possible."
2020-04-12 13:17:20,These stories about the Brooklyn Hospital are just stunning investigative reporting. Beautifully done!
2020-04-12 13:21:15,"I am glad to see that the moms and babies are doing well.

The picture of Dr. Byer walking alone in the corridor symbolizes the great burdens the medical staff carry to the benefit of all the rest of us.

This story surely reminds us that heroes walk among us..."
2020-04-12 14:02:03,"Pregnant women are one of the most challenging groups of patients to serve and protect in hospitals during the pandemic. This is in part because there are many of them, and most of them will be certainly be cared for in hospitals.  There have already been many critically ill pregnant women with COVID-19 in the US, some still on ventilators in ICUs.  Ventilator care for many COVID-19 patients lasts for more than 2 weeks, in some cases much longer.  Doctors and families are facing very difficult decisions about the need for C-sections to protect baby and mother as their infections and need for critical care drag on, often for weeks. Hospitals generally have set up dedicated COVID-19 units, staff, and equipment, which helps to protect expectant mothers and other non-COVID-19 patients. 

Before they are hospitalized, however, pregnant women may face an elevated risk of illness from COVID-19. We do not yet know.  It is sobering to recall that at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, on average, more than one pregnant women died every day during the 6-week pandemic of influenza -- a horrific toll. 

From what we know now, as for all of us, it is important to continue to self-isolate if you are pregnant.  SARS-CoV2 is a real threat to all of us, but it may be particularly devastating when it infects a pregnant woman."
2020-04-12 13:22:00,"yet another reason for more health education in poorer, and/or communities of color. esp. for pregnant women of color, who its known dont have enough access and get shoddier care then their white counterparts. even adjusted for income and education. pregnant white women get coddled, brown women get treated like pain free, complication free baby machines."
2020-04-12 13:20:23,"Why are babies not born at home in the U.S. Hospitals medicalize births. We are so behind the globe, I wish we followed the Danish model. Message to the times. WOMEN DELIVER their own babies, medical staff attend, deliver, is a word for Moms - attend, or another verb can be used for medical, midwives, or attending."
2020-04-12 15:01:47,"Bernie Sanders, Tony Fauci and Chuck Schumer were all born and bred in Brooklyn without a daddy who was a Queens real estate baron."
2020-04-12 15:05:22,"God bless these men and women for caring for these women and babies at their most vulnerable and terrifying times in their lives. I can’t imagine the pressure of knowing your choices affect the outcome of not just one, but two lives! And they do it with such compassion. They are heroes and angels, and I hope one day when the world gets back to normal we can have a big parade and celebrate their hard work and dedication!"
2020-04-12 15:08:44,"For those who illusorily expected a better job by Trump please consider this: Trump signed the law providing $1,200.00 on March 26. Today, April 12, almost three weeks later no one has received a single cent.  More ineptitude impossible!"
2020-04-12 15:27:29,"Thank you, Sherri Fink and your camera person for the courage it took to simply do your job and bring to us this story of joy through tears. So much is so dark and sad these days. This story of quiet bravery - by the health care workers (all of them), the pregnant women and the journalists - is an enduring testament to the power of life in a time of death and peril. A fitting story for Easter morn."
2020-04-12 15:34:36,"When my niece announced she was pregnant with her fourth child back in Autumn, my first thought was wondering if she and her husband were concerned at all about climate change and the need to limit population. Having four kids in the age of climate change seemed rather extreme and selfish. I can only imagine what the future lies in store for my great-nieces and great-nephews.  But my niece is comfortably middle class and will inherit a considerable sum of money when my brother and sister-in-law pass on. Her parents are in the top 5 percent for sure.

Now, my niece is very distraught at the thought that she might get covid-19 and pass it on to her unborn child.  She is inside all day or in her backyard, no contact with anyone other than her husband and children. I can only imagine her worry and distress. Her C section is scheduled for mid-May. I wish her and the child only good health.

This pandemic is a great equalizer in the way that the thought of climate change - seemingly so distant and happening to poor people the most - never was."
2020-04-12 15:35:49,"Thank you for this article. I hope we get more information on the risks for COVID-19 in pregnant women, as well as recommendations for best practices. From an immunology perspective, pregnancy is a fascinating and still not well-understood time. The mother's immune system has to tolerate the presence of the placenta and fetus, without attacking either as non-self ""invaders"". I wonder if this makes pregnant women more vulnerable to COVID-19, less vulnerable, or something else, depending on the individual woman's immune system and/or underlying health issues. 

It sounds like Dr. Byer and his staff are doing the very best they can under extremely complex circumstances. My hat is off to all of them and especially to the women enduring COVID-19 during their pregnancies. Hoping for the best possible outcome for these women and their babies."
2020-04-12 15:49:45,A beautifullly written account of the dedication of the medical staff to have achieved these outcomes and of their patients for fighting for survival. Being a first time mother is daunting enough without this additional worry. I wish these mothers and their babies a bright future ahead.
2020-04-12 15:49:56,"Pregnant women are thought to be at a similar risk for severe illness from Covid-19 as other people. But Dr. Byer said that more research was needed, particularly in communities, like Brooklyn, where obesity, diabetes and hypertension are common among expectant mothers. The medical community should advise these women against pregnancy because in their cases they are high risk pregnancies with possible cognitive delays for their children."
2020-04-12 15:51:36,"Heartwarming and heart wrenching. We cannot express our thanks and gratitude enough to these medical practitioners. They are all heroes, bringing new life into this world as we witness the horrific losses from this monstrous virus."
2020-04-12 15:54:41,"Interesting.  I am curious as to what COVID-19 does to the fetus.  My understanding is that ANY virus is not good for a fetus, but each is different."
2020-04-12 15:57:16,"Thank you for this story. I gave birth a month ago in New York. OBGYN’s, Labor & Delivery nurses, neonatologists, and NICU nurses are not receiving the recognition they deserve during this crisis. 

The lack of coverage and the lack of information and lack of guidance from the CDC on pregnancy and on what pregnant women should do during this pandemic is shocking and appalling. 

Pregnant women are not, as of yet, classified as “vulnerable” but that’s unstudied and unknown and if — when — we contract the disease, then we are then considered extremely serious cases. This makes no sense at all and it’s extremely scary and stressful."
2020-04-12 15:40:50,"These are hard times for all of us. G-d bless all the nurses and doctors and all workers, who are part in fighting Covid-19"
2020-04-12 15:55:26,"I had been struggling with continuing with my subscription to the New York Times. But the old saying “don’t kill the messenger” holds true. With political situations around the world. False profits name’s on Universities,people’s faith based on corporations, their net worth and the suit’s in Silicon Valley. This article is why I’m staying on board it has renewed my faith in the good guys and that our energies aren’t being wasted. Keep reporting and keep holding those accountable feet to the fire.  Thank you"
2020-04-12 16:10:33,"Thank you, Sheri. Amazing reporting, as always. 

Thank you to the doctors and nurses and every staff member at all our hospitals. You inspire us all and give us the courage and motivation to do our part in doing what’s best for public health — and these adorable babies!"
2020-04-12 16:17:17,"Please, let there be choice in the world!  If the prospect of having a baby at home is your desire, fine but let those of us who desire or need the support of hospital services do so without guilt tripping.  When I had my baby 24 years ago, I was 41 with other medical conditions - there was NO WAY I wasn’t going to be in a hospital.  I don’t think there is any other condition that is “guilt tripped more than maternity - from the use of pain blocks to the decision to breast feed.  Leave moms alone to make the best decision for themselves and their baby."
2020-04-12 16:37:40,Dr. Byer - you are an inspiration. i can’t imagine the stress - your community is so lucky to have you and your colleagues. And best wishes to the women in this story and their babies and families.
2020-04-12 16:41:50,"A beautiful, beautiful statement.  God Bless each and every one of the people involved in this, not excluding the hospital's service staff, and, yes, from Dr. Byers to the newborn child.   Truly amazing!"
2020-04-12 16:42:03,"200 babies born since March 1 - life continues no matter what else is happening.  I am happy Ms McKenzie recovered and went home, and that Ms Anderson and Baby David are both doing well.  Many thanks to Drs Byer and Gasperino and all of the nurses for their service.    Please be safe."
2020-04-12 16:47:02,Thanks be to everyone everywhere in the world who is providing any kind of care and succor to those in need of it.
2020-04-12 16:57:33,"I'm an L&D RN in a busy urban hospital. 
My experience mirrors that of, 30 year veteran nurse, Angela Lewis RN who also has had no specific COVID-19 training aside from the use of PPE.

Due to social-distancing, all daily L&D team meetings have been eliminated. Now, at the beginning of each shift there are no updates, no notifications of changes in practice/policy nor situational-awareness generated through knowing what patients are on the unit. I understand there are still many ""unknowns"" about COVID-19; especially regarding pregnancy. However, I find it unconscionable that there has been ZERO education about COVID-19 pathophysiology, best practices from other hospitals or information about the evolving research related to this special population. Not only does this lack of real-time communication create safety issues it also maintains ignorance regarding a gravely serious health threat and increases anxiety among staff. Rumors are the way information is being spread these days; NOT safe.

To the home-birthers:
 
First, I am not opposed to home-births. However, in relation to this article, promoting home-births is irrelevant and inappropriate. COVID-19 patients can barely BREATHE much less labor and deliver at home; regardless of the experience of the provider."
2020-04-12 17:11:05,"BRAVA! BRAVA! BRAVA! & BRAVO to all these wonderful people who have given new hope to the world - new hope in the person of an infant; and new hope in the person of the doctors and nurses who, in spite of all the difficulties they must face daily, are at the ready to care for, attend to, and help with all of their skills these patients.  All love to all of them!"
2020-04-12 17:08:43,It is irresponsible and reckless to flippantly argue that more women give birth at home.
2020-04-12 17:29:26,"What a wonderful story with a beautiful ending!!! With all these atrocious stories, the babies being born by these amazing, wonderful, heroic, and brave doctors and nurses are angels!!! Hope you feel good and David III brings you lots of love and prosperity during these hard times ahead. xo"
2020-04-12 17:29:35,"Resurrection of hope and new life not just in Brooklyn, NY but the entire country should trigger the reopening of the rest of America before every adult below 60 gets used to either being in bed longer or drinking and smoking more than usual or sitting idle. Those not in the front line of health care delivery or in the outdoor construction business or in the take away restaurant business or emergency services business or remotely working or politics, start your engines tomorrow or let lethargy take over. 

Aside from densely populated areas of the country that is more likely to acquire herd immunity, Americans across out vast beautiful land living in bubblettes inside their homes for weeks are unlikely to acquire immunity to COVID-19 and should continue to do their distancing and follow guidelines for hygienic practices. 

Air is cleaner, rivers and lakes are cleaner and pollution and emission are reduced to levels they should be even without COVID-19. Ganga Mata (Mother Ganges river) is so clean now it seems one can stick a an empty glass and fill it and drink it with without an elaborate purification process. The second most populated country in the world, India has heard several promises from politicians before their election, that they will clean the Ganges. It has taken a pandemic to really clean the Ganges. 

It is good to get some good news that doctors are winning battles for lives and children's of some pregnant women. It is that cycle of life and renewal continues."
2020-04-12 17:31:50,"Wonderful, timely read for Easter morning!
Giving birth was the most fulfilling experience of my life, and I know others have different peak moments in their lives.
  Since we are all different, so too will be our pregnancies; let us acknowledge that and as humans, as women empathize with each other."
2020-04-12 17:56:27,This is the kind of story we all need to see today. Thank you so much NYT!
2020-04-12 18:01:54,"These photos are amazing.  Thank you Victor J. Blue. 
You show us the extraordinary in the ordinary, the spiritual in the worldly.  Dr. Byer seems to be in prayer at times, drawing on a higher power, as does the nurse by the window in the NICU.  
And the expressions you caught - babies, mothers, medical staff - feelings so real it hurts."
2020-04-12 18:14:30,"Many nurses and doctors who are on the front line saving lives are in this country from around the world with a working visa. It’s time for the government to consider and give them permanent status and citizenship. In addition the $1,200 stimulus check."
2020-04-12 18:24:35,"Beautifully written article.  I'm a respiratory therapist and thought the medical and personal descriptions here were both accurate and incredible poignant. I have a son, daughter in law, and new baby in brooklyn. I'm sure they will be moved, like I have been by your incredible reporting on patient's and medical professionals on the front line."

2020-04-12 18:35:04,"In about nine months, the economic shutdown and stay-at-home orders will produce a mini-baby book that will more than make up lives lost to Covid-19. 

Meanwhile the virus appears to be preventing more deaths than it is causing.  According to the CDC, fewer Americans than normal have died since the initial COVID-19 outbreak during the week ending 2/1/2020. There have been 551,424 deaths recorded being the period, but that’s only 89 percent of expected deaths. 

Precautions against COVID-19 also protect Americans against other infectious diseases, including flu, which last season killed at least 61,000 Americans. Fewer Americans are shooting each other in bars. Fewer Americans are being killed by drunk drivers There are fewer road rage incidents.

2020-04-12 18:46:18,"Like Ms. Anderson, I am 31, due in June, and planning to give birth in an NYC hospital. This story brought me to tears. I have nothing analytical to add, but so much respect for the medical staff and good wishes for Ms. Anderson and her family -- especially the newest member."
2020-04-12 18:55:42,"Americans at their best. And it comes from a selfless commitment to one another.

The single biggest difference between our two political parties is that one holds that our government should reflect this notion of a commitment to one another. That ""we're all in this together"". Whereas the other believes in a governmental that's best expressed in a ""you're on your own"" approach.

One believes in the Social Contract - that we all have an obligation to one another. The other doesn't. They believe that everyone is an island, and that no one has any real responsibility to anyone else.

The natural end-result of these two differing views is obvious. In one case, we end up getting to the future together - all of us - together. In the other, a few people own and control everything - leaving the vast majority of us to simply act as cogs in a machine we have no control of, no stake in, and, from which, we derive no benefit.

I leave you to figure out for yourselves which party is which."
2020-04-12 19:00:55,"As a companion to this piece, there was a story on NPR this morning about some women who are upset because their IVF is being postponed due to COVID-19. This included one woman who already had two children but wanted a third and was past 40. I try to be empathetic, but I frankly don't get the selfishness and/or lack of awareness for their own safety. Healthcare is in a crisis and people are gravely ill and dying in a global pandemic. If these folks want a child so bad, maybe try adopting one who is already in the World."
2020-04-12 19:09:22,"I have to comment on the fabulous photos that accompany this moving story.  The photo of the doctor leaving the isolation ward and that last one of that darling baby really captured my attention.  Well done!
  This precious story of two expectant mothers fighting a deadly illness as childbirth approaches and their dedicated and loving doctors and nurses extends a ray of light through these dark days.  Thank you."
2020-04-12 20:05:29,"What an uplifting story! much needed amidst the grim news cycle. 

 One detail in this article caught my attention,  though.  that pregnant women are still allowed to have a visitor accompanying them into maternity ward.  Seems a bit dangerous at the moment, if it's hard for even medical staff to stay healthy.  What if both parents should fall ill?  I know we had a picture in our minds of what labor and delivery would be like.  We want our partners to be part of that special moment or support us throughout the process.   But is it really worth the risk?  Ladies, in the current circumstances,  we must be tough."
2020-04-12 20:19:57,Seeing the eyes of little David III was very moving and uplifiting. Thank you for a wonderful story and photos.
2020-04-12 20:40:56,"My daughter just delivered a healthy baby girl in a hospital outside of Boston. The care was terrific. My daughter and her partner had their temps taken as they entered the maternity ward and the nurse that would stay with them escorted them to their room which they never left. We were so worried they would hit the ""surge"" but did not. We are so grateful for the care they received and for our new granddaughter. Everyone was wearing masks and were extremely careful the entire time."

David III is indeed one handsome boy. My goodness, that straight-on gaze just melts one's heart ...

To Ms. Anderson and Ms. McKenzie, be well, get well, know that all the very best is wished and hoped and prayed for you. 

To Dr. Byer and his entire extended family of AH-MAZING health professionals, and to the entire maternity staff at the Brooklyn Hospital Center ... you are doing God's work on earth and I wish you every blessing evermore."

Kudos to all medical staff who make that possible. Awe inspiring."
2020-04-12 11:12:37,"I am a practicing obstetrician/gynecologist in MA and was born in Brooklyn, NY so this story is significant to me on many levels. I have not yet cared for a pregnant woman with COVID-19, but my hospital and others in the area are preparing. There is much anxiety around maternity care due to the limited data on best practices. The need to restrict visitors at a time that is supposed to be joyous for families is upsetting to all- families and staff.  This article, however, leaves me with hope and a few tears. I wish all the mothers and babies in the article good health!"

2020-04-12 20:53:20,"It is heartbreaking to see the suffering. Even the uplifting stories like this makes me sad. The pain these people went through is all avoidable. This President becomes President because of hate and greed and lack of conscience and people suffer as consequence. What saddens me more is there are still supporters of this President despite the pain and suffering he causes. At this point, there is nothing one can say or do now. All stories have an ending and our story on earth too. Let God be the judge."

2020-04-12 23:48:43,Newborn babies give big hope not only to parents but also to ordinary people especially in hard time. People can become brightly and be encouraged by seeing babies on TV or the net. I hope hospitals give priority to pregnant women in their treatment.

2020-04-13 01:02:38,This is a story of human strength. I was transformed into the hospital. My heart beat faster with each word. I actually cried when I realized what all involved was going through. This story makes the tragedy of COVID-19 so real. I hope they will share the outcomes for all characters because I am actively praying for all. Thanks so much for sharing.
2020-04-13 03:50:18,"This has been one of the nagging things in my mind as I have watched New York from a far.  If I were an expecting mother right now I would be a basket case.  Or, maybe not - I remember a calm that washed over me throughout my pregnancy.  It was 16 years ago but I still recall how that singular force was all I was focused on and pushed through. I ache for the mothers who have fallen ill and how taxing that must be on their bodies and minds. They are truly doing some of the hardest work imaginable.

2020-04-13 04:12:44,Beautifully written. Thank you for not “coding” them. Your writing gave them their humanness and made each participant apart of the human family. Their struggles became all of our struggles not separate and apart. Thank you.

The pressure on the medical team to ensure best possible outcome for each mother and baby is palpable and humbling, at a time when there are so many unknowns.  I remember receiving a thumbs up from a doctor once, reading about that simple gesture and knowing that it would have meant the world to an anxious pregnant woman.  We need a new word, thank you, just isn’t enough!"

Andy reminded Red that ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""  

Good news has seemed hard to come by lately and hope has been in scarcer supply than two-ply toilet paper.  Kudos to the brave men and women of Brooklyn Hospital Center for providing both, not simply to their patients, but to anyone reading this story."

for this article.

The stories of these brave doctors, and moms/moms-to-be

gives us confirmation 
(- in the midst of a self-centered White House whose selfish President's daily spew of poisonous insults degrade what Americans look to for a national medical briefing-)

that despite that political poison --- 
this face of America has wonderful people striving in the midst of a pandemic

to give their all.  To do so much for so many.
To save lives.
To be so very selfless

Never mind the Olympics, Masters, and Kentucky Derby.

Importantly, 200 patients, zero covid-19 deaths. Credit all, and wonder if healing wounds competed with the virus well enough to give the doctors the winning edge? A story to remember.

In the beginning of the article, there's a reference to the womb, ""nor the child in her womb."" The correct term is uterus. Womb is a medieval term, heavy with religious implications, fraught with paternalism. There's no need for such a euphemism in the 21st century."
2020-04-13 10:19:23,"Of course the doctors haven't tried to kill Basharrie McKenzie. They are heroes, angels with hands for wings.

Non-invasive oxygen help appears to promise a higher survival rate. Interestingly one seldom hears that a member of the class of the rich and privileged and powerful gets intubated. Why would that be?

According to this comprehensive overview <a href=""https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19"" target=""_blank"">https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19</a>/ it still remains to be seen how many people are dying from other factors (though with coronavirus) instead of from coronavirus. It still remains to be seen if there is an actual uptick in overall mortality anywhere or if it is all a hype caused by fabricated panic optics and antics while overall mortality is actually slightly less! Nobody has explained why Sweden is not seeing more deaths than elsewhere in Europe even as they have kept them all open: their schools, their restaurants, their shops, their factories and workplaces.

Crash prophets calculated years ago already that the financial system would inescapably collapse by mid or end 2020 the latest, as a slow-motion and inevitable after-effect from the 2008 crash and the dysfunctional remedies chosen. Now the real culprits got themselves a faux panic and propaganda pandemic as cover. Funny how that works."

2020-04-12 19:21:15,"Just want to get it out there. It is very dangerous to allow a family to sue the nursing home in Kirkland Washington for negligence in letting a nursing home resident get coronavirus. This has implications for the re-opening of all businesses who would then presumably have liability if an employee then gets coronavirus during the weeks they are back to work. To enable the recovery from this economic disaster, the 50 states and the federal government must declare that there is no such liability for coronavirus cases, because the virus could also be caught while trying to use best practices with no negligence. It cannot in most cases be proven when the virus was caught, by what mechanisms exactly. So no liability should be allowed. That will get our country back to work much quicker."
2020-04-20 20:57:28,"Of course Turkey is hiding the true number of cases, as are China, North Korea and Russia.   Dictators do that.  The US is hardly clean on this either; Trump has encouraged states to under report deaths, he has established no protocols to get death data, many deaths end up attributed to other causes, and on and on.  None of those leaders want to be associated with so many deaths so they will under count; decades from now the true damage will be revealed as researchers dig into the underlying data.  For now, assume you aren’t getting the whole story."

2020-04-20 20:56:15,"I've enjoyed reading your articles from Afghanistan and its neighboring countries.

It seems like many govts have either intentionally suppressed the amount of Covid-19 in their countries or just not bothered to count at all.  Any country with much travel back and forth to Iran would seem to be at very high risk of a lot of infection.   

I saw a recent Associated Press article that estimated a similar inexplicable rise in deaths in Jakarta, Indonesia.   The April 10 article said the 4400 burials there were 40% higher than any other month within the past 2 years."
2020-04-20 21:44:46,Strongmen of the world rejoice. Whether your name is Erdogan or Putin or Trump or Bolsonaro or Modi or Duterte this crisis is the time when you are showing your power over the matter of the life and death of your citizens. You can play god which is your natural instinct or wonder of wonders you can show empathy and be transparent but I am not betting on the latter.
2020-04-20 22:13:37,"I cancelled my flight to Istanbul on May 15th and flew from Nairobi to California through London instead using my miles on American Airlines.  Turkish Airlines wanted $4,000 to change our two tickets to fly direct to Los Angeles without the two-day layover we planned in Istanbul (we booked the trip in early January). We did not believe that they had no reported cases.

I'll never fly Turkish again. They were obviously protecting their airline and tourist industries; and price gouging. A one-way ticket from Nairobi to Los Angeles was going for about $800 on Emirates and Qatar Airlines."
2020-04-20 22:46:11,"Excess mortality (more deaths than in similar period in prior years) is a well-established tool for estimating deaths from an epidemic where the death certificates don’t show the correct cause.  We will see after-the-fact estimates from all around the world once the epidemiologists have a chance to review official figures.  The numbers will increase by some amount everywhere, because it’s almost impossible that every case was detected by an attending physician or an autopsy, even in the best of circumstances."
2020-04-20 22:34:48,"The Turkish government is not the most trustworthy. For some time now trust has been risky at best because deceit is the game. 
We can thank all those engaged in rank policies and practices as well as the media and the internet. 
Even well-informed, educated and conscientious citizens face the serious challenge of finding the truth. 
One issue contributing to this dilemma is the anti-scientific attitude of the present administration and its deluded supporters. 
Another problem is the bipartisan gamesmanship which leads to opposing views. 
Facts are either garbled or fully denied, but opinions are based upon predetermined positions which are fed by emotional motives , not reason. 
When faced with life or death decisions, good judgment must be based upon facts and as much objectivity as possible."
2020-04-20 22:38:20,"Like Trump, Erdogan has an unquestioning base that will buy anything he’s selling. At first he was promising that the virus couldn’t possibly penetrate the barriers they have erected against it. So, while the country collectively buried its head in the sand the virus spread in all major metropolitan areas. Now that the truth is difficult to hide he is underreporting the actual statistics. If the states didn’t upset his plans Trump would have done the same thing."
2020-04-20 22:40:05,"Unfortunately but not surprising the Turkish government decided early on to willingly put its citizens in harms way with this disease. I was living in Istanbul until the mid-March. Since the beginning of February I knew Covid was there and by the beginning of March I knew it was bad. How? Common sense. It was impossible that Turkey didn’t have an official covid case by the beginning of February. Forget by the beginning of March. It was a running conversation amongst my group of friends that surely no one in the world would believe this huge country in the middle of the world map remained one of the last countries without an infection. Frankly it was embarrassing to see such a lie every time I looked at the NYT map tracking the virus. The Istanbul airport is a huge global transit hub. Everyone from everywhere flies through there. My husband worked in hospitality and they were still checking in guests from Iran, Italy and China in mid-February. Most obvious and urgent was in early March before the “first“ death was announced. We lived on a main avenue two blocks from a major hospital and the ambulance sirens were four, five and then more  a day by the day we left. Compare that to the same time last year where’d I’d be surprised to hear a siren at all. I applaud Carlotta Gall’s work every time a new article is published. I’m glad this story is out in the open now. How it will help my friends and family in Turkey now I don’t know but at least the data and facts are out there."

2020-04-20 23:36:59,"""But by then, the statistics compiled by The Times show, the damage was done."" 
Can we see those statistics to begin with? 

Covid-19 test doesn't work with 100% accuracy in anywhere in the world. When a patient with negative test result dies because of covid-19, it's considered as non-corona death since nothing else can (officially) diagnose the patient with covid-19. I'm pretty sure there are more deaths caused by covid-19 than official numbers for every country going through this including Turkey. Thus, I agree on that part. What I don't agree is the lack of positive facts in this article such as medical supplies being sent to many countries including the U.K. by Turkey when even EU countries didn't help each other for a long time (Germany was the only/first country accepting Italian patients) and Turkey's great health care system which is not even close to be overwhelmed. Of course politics will be involved with this fight, that's not news. Politics are the very reason this article is written for. It's everywhere. Having political opinions when mentioning a crucially important topic such as Covid-19 makes me question the trustworthiness and purpose of this whole article. Seriously, what does this article solve? Nothing. I hope we'll come together more as humanity rather than using politics for one's favour."
2020-04-21 04:46:41,"“Number of deaths” is not an  independently assessable data, especially for this Covid outbreak. Let me assess with ICU data...
- After months, we know improvement of disease towards death. It gets serious, needs intensive care, then intubation and then death comes for some proportion of them. Data for patient numbers with intensive care and incubation is being declared daily by officials transparently. 
- In Turkey, thanks to robust social security system, there is no barrier to ICU care. It is free even for non-citizen Covid patients.
-  ICU occupancy rates are not higher than %70 in Istanbul. That is a fact easily can be confirmed. Even Istanbul Cerrahpaşa University hospital have not needed enhancing ICU bed capacity. BBC Turkish had a broadcast from this ICU last week.
SO;
- If we know that this disease could cause death after ICU,
- If there is no financial or any other barrier to reach ICU services and no one is dying in houses, rejecting from hospitals,
- If ICU bed occupancy rates are in %70s a and this can be seen simply by visiting,
- If the country we talk about is known with tight family relationships and homeless - alone seniors are so rare
...
Who are those thousand numbers causing these missing death data? Where is people who did not have free health and ICU service and died. Data needs to depend on some logic. 
A number with no explanations, no source declaration is not a data. Please be more responsible and have your evidence and references. Prejudice harms."
2020-04-21 08:11:46,"Don't forget Erdogan's costly military adventures in Syria and Libya, which are also draining Turkish coffers and hurting it's standing in the international community.  Unfortunately,  Mr. Erdogan and his AKP are turning Turkey into a pariah state with no allies.
The Turkish military has been purged of it's most effective officers who have been replaced by political appointees at the very time Turkey is ramping up military ops in several countries.  This is not a recipe for success and if the lira collapses it will be hard for Erdogan to recover. I wish the Turkish people luck against this authoritarian and his delusions of grandeur."
2020-04-21 09:26:31,Sorry but Turkey is far more better than all EU countries in terms of health system except from Germany. I don't believe that an academician from US could easily check The Turkey's statistics so easily. We live here and see and experience everything and there are not gigantic death rates and figures here. You should turn your face to Trump's unbelieavable Corona strategy and criticize him rather than Turkey.
2020-04-21 07:58:24,"In normal times, the bodies of the death person is transferred to the home town and is not burried in Istanbul. The increase in burrial numbers reflecting this since the burrials are in Istanbul cemeteries. 

Another fact is that İstanbul has 60% of all cases thus doesn't generalises for all Turkey."
2020-04-21 02:03:12,"Even if the claim of fifty percent of increase of mortality is true, that makes our death toll at 3000  ten times lower than the European countries n way lower than the States.
I'm not an Erdogan supporter but as always this media outlet shows it's ugly head of propaganda."
2020-04-21 03:29:25,"From the ONS here in England and Wales we also have a 15% of excess of deaths which most likely are covid related 
A statician said “The 16,387 deaths that were registered in England and Wales during the week ending 3 April is the highest weekly total since Week 2 (early January) 2000.”
 
We say around 4000 NHS deaths were recorded as CoViD but we have a surplus of close to 7000 surplus compared to the 5 years average. Might be worth writing an article abiut the UK . Don’t you think ?"
2020-04-21 08:21:38,"First, I am definitely against Erdogan and his crew under all circumstances.
I am paying/reading NYT because I can not reach source of truth in my country. I want to trust on diligent reporting.
However, I really think this news is just based on claims: ""statistics Times collect"". I read the article twice to check whether I missed the statistics but there were no data. This type of reporting is really not helpful at during this times.  We really need diligent reporting based real data interpreted by experts.
The only fact in this article is that all European countries need to go back to records and work out the numbers again. But this is not a news to share in first page. Waste of time."
2020-04-21 11:26:29,"It should be fairly easy to figure how many actually died in these countries that controls both the message and press.  By American and other western democracies being truthful about statistics, they can be used as a bench mark to figure out realistic deaths even in countries that have dictators and progressive communist parties running things.  At times like this freedom of the press minus opinionated TV entertainment news shows the importance of having truthful information."
2020-04-21 15:19:12,"""Personal protection equipment has been lacking in some places, and testing was only ramped up to a sufficient level in April, according to Dr. Sinan Adiyaman, head of the Turkish Medical Association. 
Yet the Turkish – pro-regime – paper, The Daily Sabah touted on April 14 that ""Turkey is a pioneer in humanitarian aid in coronavirus era.” 
Giving the impression that Turkey has done its homework, and can afford to be benevolent,  Erdogan said on April 13: ""So far, we have delivered medical equipment to 34 countries.” 
While seeking to boost his country’s soft power, he suppresses the Covid-19 related statistics, because he can’t afford an economic meltdown – closing businesses and keeping tourists away. 
“The virus has already revealed the gathering strength of Mr. Erdogan’s opponents.” 
He is going to join Hungary’s Viktor Orban, who has imposed  an emergency law that enables him to rule by decree without time limits.  
Critics say Erdogan seems to be using the crisis as a pretext to get rid of the few critical media outlets left in his country."
2020-04-21 14:49:48,No doubt that authoritarians have many traits in common.
2020-04-21 21:53:27,"So many Turkish objecting this piece of news, just showing how propoganda affects people in Turkey, even to opposition people:))). I think this article just reflects the situation in my country both in health and politics sense. It just doesnt draw an intentionally black picture of Turkey. We are a big and crowded nation experiencing the expected hit of COVID. We aretaking our share. We are not any significantly better than comparable EU countries, neither are we worse. We may end up similar to our group of nations later this year if real numbers are made public. We cannot be compared to Sweden, Finland, Norway, they are very different countries with so few people."
2020-04-21 20:14:47,"Another important aspect in istanbul (burial) figures which can be misinterpreted is that people with roots outside istanbul are normally (to 80-90%) buried in their home towns and not in istanbul.
After corona measures it is not possible,
which increases the burials in istanbul.
This may misled some people in interpreting the figures on corona deaths and over increase in burials in istanbul."
2020-04-21 20:33:00,"The turkish medical system is excellent, proven by the number of people visiting Turkey from the UK for private treatment and avoiding the NHS. Secondly, Turkey has excellent medical equipment production ie the request by the UK for turkish supplies. Credit where credit is due."
2020-04-21 14:32:37,"I'm from İstanbul, definitely not a follower of Erdoğan and believe that the gov't hasn't done as well as it claims and worried that authorities may be hiding the real figures. However, this article misses a criticle point that explains why the number of deaths are higher. People living in metropolitan cities like Istanbul are generally buried in their hometowns and now it is not allowed which definitely should have been taken into consideration when writing such strong claims."
2020-04-21 20:39:27,"Mr NYTimes, there is one vital point that you overlooked in this article. It is customary in Turkey to take your diseased and bury them in their home town or village. As a result of curfew, quarantine, and restricted travel across cities, in this case from Istanbul, people could not transport and bury their relatives into their  hometowns, but had to bury in Istanbul. This should not be overlooked, as I believe at least partially explains the increase in the number of burials in Istanbul."
2020-04-21 16:53:52,it is more than misleading (from NYT) to say Turkey is hiding some Corona death figures as all countries had some difficulties on identifying/counting at the very beginning. The only way for full control would be to autopsy all deaths countrywide. Which country did this ? None !!
2020-04-21 18:56:23,"This reporter and ppl who believe the ""story"" should explain how this can happen logistically ?? It is a well-known fact in Turkey that vast majority of doctors, say at least 70% , oppose this government. A good number of them hate Erdogan to their guts.

Now tell me, how will this under counting happen ? Erdogan, through his health care minister, tells all these doctors that they need to ignore 90% of the deaths and report only 10% to make it look good. And no doctor will leak this directive ? nobody will slip this to the media or speak up ?? 

no wonder you are called fake-news.."
2020-04-21 13:26:45,"I read the article first, then directly I was interested in the author to check his/her background to know the reason for this biased and negative propaganda against Turkey. I am not supporting individuals but I completely support my country and I believe that Turkey is doing its utmost in managing these difficult times and I hope all other countries the same. The article has, without success, mixed and diluted its purpose by adding a lot of political criticism and bias to the opposition rather than being an objective health topic which also lacked the accredited sources of numbers."
2020-04-20 12:25:55,"The ""start-stop"" pattern described here seems unlikely to work in the USA. It might work for one round of restart then stop, but after that I suspect many people will just ignore it one way or the other.

Consider the example mentioned to send kids back to school for a couple weeks at the end of this academic year. Who would participate in this who had a choice? Seems like the ""germ to learn"" ratio would be enormous."
2020-04-20 12:41:30,"One does have to wonder just what would have happened if something ten times worse than Coronavirus had emerged inside the US, with Trump as ""leader"".
Would he have allowed even the Black  Death to stop the flow of business, to stop Wall Street in its digital tracks, to turn America into a communal state to organize and survive massive death totals. A National Health System would imply an equality between Americans, black and white, rich and poor, and the only passports that would be available would be in the hands of the rich. 
There is no doubt that one day soon just such an event will rear its brutal head, and it is terribly apparent that the US is not only not prepared, it is mostly designed to help the independent American state of the very rich stay in power.
One has to wonder what a nursing home for the very rich looks like, compared to what the very poor have to endure.
Does anyone doubt that the future holds the greatest health safety for the 1%, and the most horrible suffering for the bottom of the economic ladder?

McNeil paints one picture -- and, sure, if you work from the comfort of home which a steady paycheck that is not impacted by COVID-19 -- I can see how you get to this analysis.

Be safe people - I have a friend (in his 30s) he has recovered so far from it and he told me it's something you ""do not want to get"". There are many unknown issues with this virus still waiting to be discovered, I would not be so keen to let it spread until we know all the long-term health consequences of this (and according to the recent papers it might be not an easy as it seems). We will make it through, but I would stay on a safe side for now...."
2020-04-21 05:48:19,"Best informative info I’ve heard in awhile. I think the “dance” is just like brand new music. It hits the port cities (New Orleans, LA, San Fran, Seattle, NYC). Just like a new song moving across the country from largest to smallest and more central markets, the numbers will rise and fall, the wide open farming central US, being the last."
2020-04-21 17:02:11,"The siege metaphor speaks to me and helps frame the feelings I've been having lately, both in my perception of others and their behavior and in my own decision making (cost/benefit of leaving the house). I'm afraid we need to lean in to a network of global solutions guided by experts, not entrench ourselves in isolation."
2020-04-21 02:54:58,"At no point is there talk about what may be a rate of death that we may be wikling to tolerate. What is that rate? Everytime deaths start rising the hammer cannot go down. We tolerate enormous rates of deaths with the flu, we put up with high death rates of strokes, of cancer, of overdoses, of accidents. Those are risks we take, they are part of life. We are not inmortal so we cannot dodge death. Yes, a 32 year old man died, and that is unfortunate, but it is not a trend. He may have died of an accident, probably even more likely so. And he will not stop driving because of his risk of having an accident. There are some blind spots here, some very narrow way, in which epidemiologists talk about this. We do not know much about coronavirus yet, but we do not know much about cancer either and we put up with it without stopping the world. And /i do not think this is the big one. Imagine if we could get contaminated by water or airborne radiation. Keeping a distance of 6 ft is not such a big deal. And we can see a lot of friends and family via Zoom. It is not the end of the world."
2020-04-21 01:51:02,"The problem is that ""experts"" are working in compartmentalized ways: epidemiologists and public health sector on the one hand, with their models and  assumptions. On the other hand economists. There may need to be some direct dialogue. They are talking past each other. The ripple effects of a pandemic may affect food production and distribution, our most basic sector. Is that possible? I don't mind lowering my standard of living, it may be good to get rid of all the excess and waste that corrodes this society. But I wonder to what extent the production of fundamental goods will be disrupted. There needs to be some cost analysis here. Also, the rates of contagion are widely different throughout the country. Why can't localities (middle states) where the population is more dispersed and there is still a minimal level of contagion not take on industries (say production of masks) or continue operating as usual. In some places this will be like the flu, nobody stops the economy for the many annual deaths caused by the flu or heart attacks. What would be a tolerable level of contagion and death comparable to that of other causes of death?"
2020-04-21 20:42:29,"I believe this episode comes across as alarmist. The scenario being presented is bleak, and perhaps a worst-case scenario? However, it is not clearly presented as such. It is presented as fact because of the lack of other voices.
Presenting something like ""not seeing my granddaughter for 2 years"" is a reaction that seems more personal than journalistic. 
As a listener, I am properly panicked by these predictions, but have no idea what to do with the information. In a time of crisis like this one, I need more support or context to digest these predictions.
If these social distancing orders were to go on for 2-4 years, what will happen to all the jobs in the entertainment industry? Amusement park industry? Museum industry? Suggesting that this is a ""likely"" possibility does not feel flushed out. I would like other opinions and deeper analysis."
2020-04-21 06:53:20,"This episode repeatedly mentions the term ""immunity"" (19 times!) It is too soon to determine if those who were infected are immune to covid-19. Yes, they will have antibodies in their blood but for how long? There is no evidence at this point that there is such a thing as long term immunity to Covid-19, yet.
If vaccines are years away and no medication is known to work, it seems that the suggestion is that we all need to be infected and hope for survival. According to the metaphor, it is all Hammer and no Dance.
We know that the flu virus mutates fast and so does Covid-19. It takes a long time to determine how our immune system will react to Covid-19 not just once but multiple times. 
Suggesting a two-tier society with an ""immune"" valuable population and a ""non-immune"" one is irresponsible. How many pleople will now risk their health and lives to be part of this exclusive hypothetical club?"
2020-04-21 01:05:30,"I hear two thirds support the lock-down. When you check here around how many people wear a mask in public - we have a mask wearing ordinance in place - that percentage seems about right. 

The hammer may seem hard, but it remains a toothless tiger without enforcement. Today at the grocery store about a third of the customers proudly did not wear any, a smirk of defiance in their faces. The climax was a guy in an EMT outfit without a mask. 

Pass by our DIY market/garden center, the parking lot is full as on any balmy spring day. Six feet distancing at the check-out maybe, inside not so much. My wife and I concluded, we may be already immune by now. It's a shame there is no public testing.

With this giant corona party in progress, it may take another month before we see consistent decline in infections. The governor, a physician, was right to reevaluate the crisis not earlier than May. The road to normalcy may be a long one here.

Our social lives will be changed until we are immune enough which, as the guest points out, may take some years. Who would go out and eat at a restaurant where we need to sit six feet apart and the waiter wears blue rubber gloves, goggles and a face mask? Naw, it's take-out until we are safe.

Some things may change forever. Come fall colleges will have figured out how to replace adjunct teaching with online courses. Dorms will close, jobs will be cut, and they will try charge more for the costs the accommodation of the new normal will create."
2020-04-21 21:00:24,"I sit here and wonder. Why were the pandemic models so far off? Even the ones including mitigation? Also, how can the scientific community be so confident on this dire and negative outlook when there's no reliable data? There's no scientific consensus on anything, not death rate, not range of infection, not ratio asymptomatic to symptomatic. Most importantly, one cannot overcome a challenge if one believes it isn't possible to begin with. Where is the Manhattan Project for a vaccine? We don't have 18 months to wait around. There will be anarchy in the streets and the republic likely wouldn't survive it. Let's please stop pretending this is just a matter of locking down and ""being safe."""

2020-04-21 16:04:23,"i find the way things are presented on ""the daily"" to be tedious and overhyped...with the breathy stop-start style of barbaro, i just want to say, spit it out, already! the information may be reliable but useless to me because i have to turn off the radio."
2020-04-20 23:42:35,"I love the daily and particularly the conversations with Don McNeil. I re-subscribed to the NYT because they so enrich my day. Till today. I was so disappointed to hear both Don and Michael speak from their white privilege and miss a golden opportunity to underline that, to move into a future where we can care for each other we must understand and repair the damage done in the past. McNeil spoke of the generation of people who made it through WWII and worked together to bring about change. They asked and got the G.I. Bill, federally-sponsored mortgages to build wealth, better health care, etc.  Today they can say, ""We did this incredible thing, we did it all together, we got through it."" We can do it again.
This 'we' obviously does not include minorities, indigenous groups who are to this day living with the consequences of sustained, historical racially motivated and explicit public policy that amounted to state-sponsored residential segregation, engineered poverty and intentional placed barriers to opportunity. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in these communities is a direct result of the many injustices of the past. How do we move forward together if the past is preventing us to feel like a solid we and it's making the starting point so uneven?"
2020-04-21 20:25:45,"Great podcast, but I didn't understand the last line:
""If we don't go into a dance, it means there's going to be more infections and more deaths.""
But dance in this context means dancing out of quarantine, becoming free of the restraints of isolation.
Shouldn't it read
""If we DO go into a dance (i.e. significantly loosen up the quarantine) it means there's going to be more infections and more deaths.""
Please advise"
2020-04-25 22:33:46,"I am confused why they didn't talk about the way that ramped-up testing, combined with contact tracing, could let us (eventually) only have it so that only people who are or might be sick have to be locked down. Isn't it easier to identify every sick person than it is to develop a vaccine?"

2020-04-20 13:09:07,"As someone who knows Russian history, there is nothing new here in terms of the dysfunctional nature in which Russian leaders and institutions have always functioned.  This has been going on for hundreds of years with accountability and the truth being less important than status and nepotism.

What shocks me however, is to see how Trump and the ''Republicans'' are undertaking the same practices in one of the world's greatest democracies!  Everything seems so fragile now.  The truth, the law, our belief in justice and individual worth are under constant attack.  Everyone should be deeply concerned that our norms do not degrade into those of the Russians."
2020-04-20 12:30:33,"The US response to COVID-19 looks more like Russia than like countries that actually have responded and mitigated the pandemic (at least so far).   

The SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot be fooled by lying and lack of testing.  In fact, it finds weak spots in the response (contact tracing-testing-quarantine) and exploits it.  

The US is essentially doing zero contact tracing.  Opening up before contact tracing is established, with serial testing of all contacts (including those who are asymptomatic) is a delusion that the virus will likewise exploit."

2020-04-20 12:33:51,"Yes this is what we would get with Biden, first and foremost a man who believes in the power of government. What scares me more than coronavirus is more concentration of power in the federal government. Remember this crisis of testing is because of the CDC and then they hid their problems from both the administration and the people. This crisis is also from the WHO, government funded, which hid this crises from the world. Lastly this crises was started with the regional government of Wuhan hiding the coronavirus from the government of China, who then hid it from the world's people.
    If you can't see the pattern here you aren't looking."
2020-04-20 13:11:24,"Russia, the sequestered-from-fact regime, run by the criminal mastermind Putin, is one of Trump's best friends. Or maybe not. Maybe someday we will yet learn about whatever evil influence Putin had over Trump, making him a servile accomplice to Putin's goals."

2020-04-20 14:34:36,"""Local officials lie...It is a habit.""

During the Leningrad siege, state officials worked tirelessly to track down rumormongers and others badmouthing the state, while millions starved to death. Covering up bad news is an intrinsic trait of Russian officialdom. (witness the Kursk submarine disaster). Putin need not feign shock and surprise, as it is a management style he benefited from, and fostered. What a beautifully-written article on a heartbreaking story."
2020-04-20 14:41:42,"All totalitarian regimes try to hide the truth. The Chinese are masters of this, the Russians are not. With the Chinese, however, their government always lies about everything that is why coronavirus statistics from China are unbelievable."
2020-04-20 12:51:08,"In front of the world the United States president’s obfuscation, with Republican consent and backing, does the same thing. Double yawn.

Besides I’d like to get back to solving the worlds problems from my social distanced perch on the couch. Triple yawn. I’d like to read articles without an antigovernment clown constantly berating good journalism. I don’t care what clowns say. Clowns ought to be running around in a circus. In the era of the wasted journalist, I’m hoping we get back to New York real estate and international crime."
2020-04-20 15:08:38,The problem with fascist dictators like Putin is that their disinformation departments can't hide dead bodies.  People notice when their loved ones end up dead.  No smiling minister of disinformation on the evening news will convince them the person isn't actually dead.
2020-04-20 15:51:38,"Countries such as China, North Korea, Russia and America all have leaders trying to keep the truth about the corona virus from their people. No matter how strong their iron hands are, the truth will always come out. These leaders think they will outsmart the virus, but the virus, as horrible as it is, is far smarter than any of them."
2020-04-20 15:43:20,"Once again Trump’s actions prove that he is not a very smart businessman or president. If he was and he really cared for someone other than those closest to him he would have called President Xi and President Putin and asked if they would like to join the USA in helping the rest of the world deal with this, to be the worst epidemic in this century so far. Just think each nation could easily find they overspend in military aggressiveness, that which will not add much to their cultures, and they could match each other with a new commitment to the W.H.O. of around $.5 billion a year. Then maybe down the road they could also learn that Mother Nature has far more power that all three of them combined and if they really care for the future of their nations they will work to deal with the worst which is yet to come and that military aggression will not be able to reverse that no matter how much they spend on their killing machines."
2020-04-20 15:51:59,"I don't know how anyone can read this article without thinking of how the Trump administration has defunded scientific research that shows results that they do not like in broad areas related to climate change, public health, the effects of environmental toxins resulting from air, water, and earth pollution and many other areas they seek to keep secret. According to CNN on 12/17/17, they have silenced scientists in numerous fields even going so far as telling policy analysts in the Center for Disease Control that they were not allowed to use 7 words in their reporting: ""vulnerable, diversity, entitlement, transgender, fetus, evidence-based, science-based"". All you have to do is research information scrubbed from the White House website to see that this administration is following Putin's determination to keep people from knowing what they are doing or not doing in terms of scientific knowledge and willful harm to the populace."
2020-04-20 18:21:13,"This is part of a larger pattern in Russia, going back to the USSR.  During the Chechen wars, the governments tried to hide the numbers of dead Russian soldiers,  but their mothers knew. They formed the Soldiers’ Mothers committee, which is still trying to find the truth of what happened to their sons, and has suffered constant threats and harassment ever since. A diseased system can’t deal with a massive onslaught of disease."
2020-04-20 17:24:20,"If people die of the coronavirus, but nobody knows how many, then it never happened. If thousands of people die of the coronavirus, and the governors are made responsible, then it's their fault.  It's straight out of the dictator's playbook.

Unfortunately, we have something similar going on here in the United States.  If tens of thousands of people die of the coronavirus, then it's the fault of the governors. After all, as Trump has said, he's not responsible. If there aren't enough tests to show exactly how many more have the virus, then the crisis is over. Time to reopen. It fits Trump's happy talk mantra to a tee.

Dictators, and dictator wanna be's, always benefit when no one knows the truth. The people always lose."
2020-04-20 21:30:50,"The dynamic described in this article reminds me of Chinese officials' initial attempts to suppress of news about the virus. In a paranoid hierarchy, where mid-level bureaucrats fear delivering bad news (even if it's true), there are strong incentives to sugarcoat the situation until it gets really dire, and becomes impossible to hide. Accordingly, those at the top have little idea what's really going on.

Of course, once the problem became clear, the Chinese addressed it with their usual brutal efficiency. The Russian response is looking more haphazard."
2020-04-22 14:13:09,"Wearing a face mask may be OK before an effective and safe vaccine for coronavirus becomes available.  Once that happens, the ""new normal"" should be that everyone is vaccinated, rather than everyone wear a mask.  And if the law is going to get involved by requiring people to wear masks in certain settings, I'd rather see a law requiring people to get vaccinated instead."
2020-04-22 14:34:14,"Now that regular surgical masks are becoming available, everybody should be wearing them in public not bandanas, scarfs and home made masks.
 
1.  Do not touch the mask material.  Hold them using the straps.
2.  Make sure the open edges of the mask is closed.
3.  These masks can be reused if washed gently in hot water, laundry detergent and BLEACH."
2020-04-22 14:40:45,"Funny--I was just thinking the same thing last night, when, on Instagram, local people from my town (including me, finding myself starting to inevitably lose patience with a lot of things!) were complaining that, in spite of our very proactive and communicative mayor's (Ravi Bhalla, of Hoboken) leadership and daily pleading with residents to stay inside or--if that's not possible--to wear face-coverings outdoors, people are still out blithely running, etc., with no masks and often little thought of social distancing.
When I was a caseworker for people with AIDS in NYC in the late '80's, someone used to come around and put office supplies on our desks--pens, paper, folders, paper clips...and condoms (and, later, dental dams and bleach kits for syringes as well). We kept them like bowls of candy on our desks for our clients to take. No one thought twice about it (although there was a lot of second-thinking about needle-exchange programs, which infuriated me!).
If condoms and bleach kits and dental dams could be taken for granted as means to stay and keep others safe back then, surely at least a bandanna or a homemade mask shouldn't be that much of an inconvenience--except, perhaps, for those who are perennially certain that the rules were not made for them."
2020-04-22 14:44:42,"If people with no symptoms are spreading the virus?

We’ve known since before the first cases arrived in this country that there was asymptomatic spread. 

We should have been wearing masks for months now."
2020-04-22 14:20:53,"The obvious parallel that I see here is that if face masks are treated—from a marketing standpoint—like condoms, many won’t see it as their responsibility to wear them. We’re already seeing the rhetoric of, “If you want to be protected, YOU can wear a mask, because I won’t.”"
2020-04-22 15:20:53,"Around here face masks that offer real protection are a kind of black market item,  not to be found in drugstores,  but only in other kinds of businesses, and informally.   I saw pictures of them on sale on the street in NYC.   Something is really, really wrong here."
2020-04-22 15:11:52,"Willingness of people to wear face masks is currently a secondary problem relative to the ability of people to find face any face mask for purchase.   Ideally, the USA would be like Singapore which texted each of its citizens with a place and time to pick up a good quality face mask to protect themselves during the COVID pandemic."
2020-04-22 14:11:47,"This is all fine and dandy. But unlike condoms where you can buy them everywhere, the only place to get face masks is Amazon from Chinese sellers that “certify” their masks are FDA approved, and take six weeks to deliver."

2020-04-22 14:56:10,"A coronavirus is 120 nano-meters.  Visible light is 400-700 nano-meters and thus, a virus cannot be seen with a microscope.  N95 face masks have a pore size of 300 nano-meters, larger than a virus.  What the masks do protect against are respiratory droplets, .5 micrometers – 10 micrometers if you happen to be within the sneeze boundary when it occurs.

2020-04-22 16:39:39,It is both easy and cheap to buy condoms. Face masks? Not so much. I ordered some from China. They will arrive around the end if May.
2020-04-22 18:03:00,"The difference between masks and condoms is that there is sound scientific evidence that condoms reduce the spread of disease in the general population. 

There have been many, many studies of masks, and the evidence is inconclusive. That is why masks have not been recommended for the general public to wear during flu season, for example. 

The CDC has changed their guidance at the moment, but this seems to be as much due to public pressure as anything else.  

We need to rely on science, and until there is sound science that masks prevent the spread in the general population, we should not have policies that are based on ""common sense"" or speculation."
2020-04-22 18:04:34,"If only CDC had not burst out of the gate with misinformation about the effectiveness of masks in slowing COVID-19 transmission, public compliance might be much higher. Their dishonesty will also add to the distrust Americans feel about vaccine safety. Effective public health efforts depend on the credibility of public health officials. CDC has eroded its own credibility."
2020-04-22 19:49:01,"If masks were effective, why did the CDC wait to recommend them? Why do other countries with comparable or better health care systems than the US's still not recommend them?

I believe wearing a mask gives people the impression that they're being protected and allows the CDC to look proactive and adaptable. It's a P.R. move for the government. It's a comfort item for people.

And it's also a power trip for the local politicians who have ordered people to wear them in a few cities in Texas when out in public.

Such a fearful and inept response to the coronavirus from every side."
2020-04-22 19:28:41,Face masks are definitely the new bumper stickers.
2020-04-22 20:39:00,"As with all things in this pandemic response, I worry about the fact that we’re flying blind. We need studies on the effectiveness of masking in public before we start preaching that they should become ubiquitous. I’d caution that there are often unforeseen consequences of seemingly benign interventions. A simplified example, do we damage our microbiome by stopping the practice of entering the outside world unencumbered by PPE? This might be necessary right now given the current situation, but it seems irresponsible to be writing about the need to do this indefinitely absent convincing data."
2020-04-22 22:44:12,"i certainly endorse the wearing of the masks, however being of an age when hearing has dropped off and hearing aids are popped in, I am surprised at how much I have learned to depend on lip reading, now that I no longer can see the lips to read."
2020-04-22 22:40:52,"If a face mask protects me from one single  projectile  mass of goo flying from anyone’s sneeze or cough , whether they have the virus or not, then as far as I am concerned , it has done me a great service."
2020-04-22 22:55:35,Trying to get prepared for my organization to open with social distancing restrictions in the next few weeks (we hope) and googled “face mask” to see what I might need to supply our front line staff.  Nearly all the studies that came up (from reputable sources) said they don’t help much if at all. That led me to wonder if it isn’t all for show.
2020-04-22 23:02:26,Only when Trump puts one on.
2020-04-23 01:58:49,"There is no real analogy between masks and condoms. Condoms are used for a very specific act, one that - unlike work or school - usually doesn’t take up the majority of one’s day, or even occur every day (for most of us).  Additionally, there is a hugely important OTHER REASON that people use condoms, one that has nothing to do with stopping the spread of disease.  

It is my hope that once there is a vaccine, I never see another face mask again unless I’m in a hospital or at the dentist.  Where I live, I get the pleasure of seeing used masks and gloves lying all over the sidewalks and streets. Ironic that items supposedly being used to keep us “healthy” and “safe” just end up as a particularly disgusting form of litter.  I also love seeing people on the street with their face masks pulled down so they can smoke their cigarettes.  The hypocrisy embodied in every facet of our response to this pandemic is absolutely staggering."
2020-04-23 03:02:19,"The CDC, the WHO and the public health department of my state, CA, all say that there is no evidence to prove that wearing cloth mask masks do anything to stop the spread of disease. If everyone is wearing a face mask, we are then assuming that every single person in this country is infected? This is a ridiculous assumption. There isn't a disease in the history of this planet that has infected every person who lives. It would be helpful, and reduce a lot of stress, if people took the time to do some research on cloth face masks before deciding that they are doing anything to keep themselves safe. Unfortunately, cloth face masks, particularly the cutesy homemade ones, are now as popular as the latest fashion trend that a Kardashian family-member is promoting--a ""must-have"" to get through one's day."

These brand ambassadors and influencers like Garance Dore- not even in the US right now- claim to be in the same boat as us all and then tell us that they are dressed in Vince and Co while on corona-induces vacation!!! At a time when many are wondering where their next meal will come from, and mourning losses, we have so call morale boosters asking people albeit implicitly to buy products at home!!! Where is the ethical standing of that? I understand we have an economy to boost but our first aim at this time should be asking difficult questions about why the US has this crazy mortality rate and where are the masks. Then we should think of helping others, acknowledging hunger and grief, and celebrating those who are risking their lives for us. Honestly I do not think people who are working in grocery stores and driving trucks are wearing Vince!!!!! It boggles my mind that we are still deaf to our hideous insensitive noises. Garance Dore, Leandra Medina Cohen, even designers like Ulla Johnson who sells 500 dollar blouses for work from home- get real! Not influencer fake real but real real!"

Time for these agencies to go back to the fundamentals."
2020-04-20 19:11:26,"I wouldn’t know any of these “influencers” if I got within a socially acceptable 6 feet of them, and I don’t endorse this line of marketing to begin with. But I do understand the need for companies to keep selling - we all know where the economy is heading - and for the need of influencers to stay relevant to their audiences. I don’t see this, or their messages, as worse than pre-pandemic “you’ve got to get these shoes or you won’t look sexy.” And what the one influencer in CA is posting may be helping with some money now that her waitressing job is gone. (The sadness of that is worth a separate story). So everyone please just be kind, and if you can’t afford to buy things right now, try to stay strong. None of these people did anything wrong, and they’re just trying to make it to the other side, healthy, safe and as whole as possible."

For god's sake, at least be real. 

In most cases, ""influencers"" are not authentic, and should take a silent seat at this time.

Plus, I was barely recovered from a hip stress fracture, so I didn't train as I would have liked. But I managed to finish, though with my worst marathon time ever of 4:04.

2020-04-20 17:41:23,"Thank you for this article!

As much as I initially supported shelter-in-place recommendations, as they have continued without concrete end dates or exit strategies (difficult to determine without sufficient data, I know) I have become more and more concerned about these ""hidden victims"". What those advocating shelter-in-place until a vaccine is developed years in the future seem to forget is that other aspects of life will continue to go on: babies will be born, children will age, cancers will develop, organs will fail - with or without COVID-19.

We're already seeing ""hastened"" deaths from those not receiving chemotherapy or somewhat-elective surgeries. Children with developmental delays are regressing because they are unable to receive their therapies. Well-adjusted children may soon develop developmental delays if they are prevented from interacting with other children their own age for a prolonged period of time. As the article states, life-saving organ transplant procedures have drastically decreased. And large groups of children are being placed at an increased risk of measles and other future outbreaks since many parents have been avoiding bringing their children to get vaccinated during this pandemic.

Yes, completely ""re-opening"" the economy 100% right now seems foolish. But so does having tunnel vision focused on only COVID-19. Everyone deserves appropriate medical care and the right to the best possible quality of life."

She was admitted to a major NY hospital (I will not name them but they failed her), did not get her hip replaced until 2 days later.  Because of COVID-19 she did not get admitted to an orthopedic  floor (half of which was prioritized for COVID-19 patients). Consequently she spent much of the next 5 days in bed, becoming more and more deconditioned.  One week after her injury she was transferred to a rehab facility but got no PT for 48 hours.  And, the day she was transferred, visitors were restricted, so our family could not help in her recovery.  In a facility where 1/3 of the staff was already out, with a patient who needed lots of individual encouragement, this was her death sentence.  She passed 2 weeks ago."

In times of uncertainty and serious illness, I hope patients and families are making the best use of social workers, psychologists, chaplains and palliative care teams. Each of these professionals can help people prioritize what they value, and find the balance between their hopes and worries, clearly define their personal healthcare goals and ensure patients can navigate the health care maze as best they can.

These are patients who if they had been seen and diagnosed 2 weeks ago, would not have come into ICU gravely ill.  i suspect this ""catch up"" effect will go on for another few months.

2020-04-20 19:17:46,"Almost all of us are living through an epidemic which is nothing like anything we have experienced. On top  of this, boomers  and younger people  lived a long time with implanted expectations that, with few exceptions, diseases could be cured or at least pushed into remission. With drugs, usually. We never experienced TB or the cholera spread by unsanitary water supplies and sewage handling, for instance.  It took a while to absorb that this time things were really different. And that we did not have an infrastructure or plans in place ready to deal with it.

Hit hard with what may be a new reality, maybe we will be able to reinvent acute care, chronic treatment  and elective surgery ( some of which aren't really all that voluntary)  in some way so that hospitals and outpatient clinics can flex with the demands being made.  Perhaps they can cooperate instead of competing for patients - as happens in some areas ( that competition hasn't lowered prices, after all). In large urban areas, perhaps there could be tradeoffs in types of treatment or surgery specialties between different medical centers.    

We were worried about bioterrorism after 9/11, and some of the attacks, say, in Japan,: this wasn't even a planned attack and it landed a massive blow, and showed how unprepared we were: not only in a medical response, but simply in generating necessary supplies.  Either we will come up with a better response, or face worse in the future."
2020-04-20 19:20:06,"As a physician treating cancer patients, I have had this exact concern for almost a month now as I witness many hospital services postponed and cancelled as care and resources are shifted to fighting the outbreak. In addition, patients themselves are scared to come to the hospital. 

We need an urgent conversation around how to deal with the outbreak without compromising other hospital services so we don't reflect in retrospect about the harm and worsened patienr outcomes that occured secondary to concentrating all care and attention on ONE disease (COVID-19) of many serious conditions patients face. 

I think decentralizing some decision-making to hospital departments instead of central administration so that each department can decide what services it should continue to offer in the outbreak is one way to identify the scope of care that should continue to be offered during the outbreak. In addition, we need medical professionals to encourage patients to continue to seek care for medical conditions that shouldn't be postponed so that patients aren't dying at home or facing increased complications because they are scared to seek care at the hospital."

Her health has declined so much in these past few weeks, I’m really at a loss for words. I knew our health care system was less than stellar. But this crisis laid open how broken it truly is.

Doctors postponing treatments, leaving us in insolation to fend for ourselves. I’m teleworking full time, taking care for mom full time and dealing with hospice is incredibly difficult. 
We have a totally broken healthcare system that prioritizes profit and efficiency over our humanity. And please make no mistake, what our society and the healthcare system are telling people like my mother is very loud and very clear:  “your life has less value.

My mother, in her 60s, has had a strange neurological event that left her in pain a few months ago, but that hasn’t been successfully diagnosed when covid started to take off. Now, in NY, she’s not able to get additional testing or care. It’s terrifying that we don’t know what she has and we’re both living in pain every day for our different reasons.

2020-04-20 18:11:56,"I had a stent put in my heart in 2004.  Then a triple bypass in 2016.  My cardiologists have all said ""You know what the symptoms of heart disease are like.  If they persist to the point where it is too painful and your blood pressure is high, you call 911 or get yourself to the ER.  Don't wait to make an appointment to see me next week.""

On March 24, 2020 some persistent symptoms (left arm pain, shortness of breath, three high blood pressure readings in an hour) led me to ask my wife to drive me to the ER, a trip that took 12 minutes.  I was 10 minutes into triage and being wired up for an EKG when I went into cardiac arrest and did a face plant on the ER floor.  Skilled technicians used the nearby defibrillator  paddles to try and shock my heart.  The first attempt did not work.  But the second one did.

Surgeons then implanted a device known as an ICD in my shoulder to help with my arrythmia.  I am home now and my recovery is going well.  

A shoutout needs to go to those who went to work on me not knowing if I was positive or negative for Covid19.  A test was administered post-op and I proved negative.

So a narrow escape.  Many people who go into cardiac arrest die in just a few minutes or less.   My message to readers is to pay attention to what your body is telling you.  Heed your physicians warnings about what to do.  

And have a positive attitude about your recovery and your good mental state can help you keep your physical health too."

Dentist offices are closed. Alternative wellness centers are closed. But if I used pot, I would be able to smoke all I wanted. 

I fully understand why everything is shut down. I had SARS 2003. It was horrible and wouldn't want anyone to get it.

It’s as awful as it is today because of months of willfully ignorant denial, choreographed by the White House; and an abject failure of leadership from the Oval Office.

2020-04-20 19:23:18,Three weeks ago my father was preparing for an important medical procedure. He was in the hospital room waiting for the nurse to bring him a gown and take him for surgery when a doctor entered the room and said” we have bad news”. He proceeded to tell us that the hospital administration had pulled by father from the schedule and he would not receive the procedure because the hospital could not risk the masks. He was told to return if he developed an infection or became septic. Days later he did in fact did develop an infection and a case of appendicitis. Whether the two conditions were directly related we do not know but he received emergency surgery in the middle of the night and the endoscopic procedure he had been denied the following day. As a cancer patient my father’s chemotherapy has been delayed for over a month as a result of this situation.

A week before lockdown, he got a procedure that we think has fixed the bleeding.

We are super thankful for this timely procedure that saved his life, and the medical staff that continue to risk their lives daily for us.  We could not imagine what it would be like for him to go in and out of the hospital now."

As an MD, I have been telling friends and family who tell me they are sick with other illnesses to call their doctors/ healthcare systems and relay their symptoms.  Much of the media - rightly so - has focused on the pandemic and its impact on the areas like NYC/ NJ but not every healthcare system is overwhelmed to the same degree in the country. 

Some docs and healthcare systems are set up to take telemedicine visits and others have precautions in place to see non-COVID-19 patients.  Heatlhcare professionals can also advise on nonpharmacologic treatments and call in prescriptions. 

I'm also a bit concerned that people with ""mild"", presumptive COVID-19 symptoms are so worried about overburdening the system that they don't seek help until late in their illness. I found myself advising a friend - who is a retired MD with chronic health issues - to seek help last week as he did not seem at all to be doing well. He did decide to seek help and wrote me back his own doc told him it was a good thing he came in."
2020-04-20 20:33:57,"Most of these people are not dying from corona virus.  They are dying, or having their lives shorted, by the lockdowns.

In a minority of locations, including New York City, the virus has resulted in tremendous strain on the health system, forcing non-essential care to wait.

But in most parts of the country, this is not case. Hospitals are not overwhelmed by care for corona patients.  In fact the reverse is true: they are laying off employees off because the Draconian regulations imposed by the lockdowns are requiring that they defer most medical care. It is reported that many hospitals are facing bankruptcy as a result. When the lockdowns are phased out, much vital care will resume, but there will be further delays because of pent up demand.

As this article suggests, these delays in essential medical care are resulting in deaths; at least as noteworthy is a shortening of life for many.  Cancer patients with tumors that are curable today are being forced to delay surgery, in some cases until their disease has grown beyond the point of surgical curability.

The lockdowns are flattening the curve. They are saving lives, but perhaps not as many as we think because they do not allow immunity to develop.  But they are also costing lives, and given our collapsing world economy, this loss of life will escalate, as essential medicines, food, and supplies become unavailable.

We need to find a balance, and it is time for overly broad lockdowns to be mitigated."

The same story with a friend's trusted gynecologist: she's out of town, won't come back, and the doctor to whom she refers patients isn't seeing anyone! As I told the receptionist, is it better to die of ovarian cancer than of the covid virus?

My internist finally agreed to see me, and she has scheduled me for a CAT scan. What a relief! My sister in Florida, who has multiple myeloma, has had appointments canceled by her infectious disease specialist, the cardiologist who monitors her pacemaker, and her local cancer treatment physician.

We haven't had a real health care system for decades.  Dealing with health insurance companies, monthly premiums, high deductibles, co-pays, denial of care notices, balance billing is not health care. It's stressful and it wastes valuable time and resources that could be diverted to caring for patients and their families.  

36 years ago my father nearly died from a brain abscess.  We were panicked about the possible costs then.  Now we'd be having heart attacks over the costs, the denials, the co-pays, and all the rest of it.  And my father had good insurance.  It's gotten much more complex to deal with the wealth care system since 1984.  We weren't balance billed, there were no out of network costs, and my father wasn't denied the care and tests he needed.  

It's a disgrace to our country that people feel they can't go for care in normal times.  It's even worse that this lockdown and the lack of PPEs has forced other, less than extremely ill patients to miss appointments, to be unable to receive regular care they require.  What's it going to take for our politicians to realize that access to medical care when and where it's needed is a human right and that serving is a privilege?"

A follow-up procedure I need is on indefinite hold. Just told today that a neurology appointment has been postponed as well.
The VA has cancelled all in-person appointments and testing. No chance for health care workers to personally monitor health of fellow veterans or identify potential onset of medical problems.

Corporations only involved in making money off of the Americans  don't know what to do when one day the economic  earth shifts and their world becomes unglued.  The pandemic has forced that shift.  The government, the public refused to listen to  Obama,Warren, Sanders  sounding this alarm  years.  
 Big pharma CEO's knew that all the drugs were made in China, the hospital CEO's knew that they didn't have the medical equipment to address a pandemic.  Everyone from the president to every CEO knew and did nothing.

Maybe its a lack of understanding how people actually die and unlike a move they don't get up when the director yells cut.

America is a country based on greed and ignorance from our  CEO's and political leaders.  Every hospital has rounds in the morning they know how many potential patients are awaiting transplants, chemotherapy etc there is no reason except not having the will to address the needs of people who come into the hospital for medical care.  Once again the CEO's had no plans to address people with illnesses

Finally, last Friday, they  harvested the cells from her, which are needed. She came out of it with severe chills and sweats, the doctors telling her that this was the cancer, not the procedure. Because of the corona virus, when the cells are ready to be transplanted back,  she must endure the dangerous several weeks when her body tries to adapt to this transfer, at home. She should be in the hospital.  Her doctors say she must at all times be monitored at home, and be located no more than 1 hour from the hospital in case of serious negative reactions. Also she will have to travel to/from the hospital frequently for tests. This dangerous situation is only because of the coronavirus. The plan had been for her to be hospitalized for 2-4 weeks, with my sister able to stay and support her. The family is scared they will infect her. Her children ages 9 to 15 haven't been outdoors for 3 weeks, for fear they will bring germs back to their mother.

I know of a woman who needed gallbladder surgery, she was put on an elective surgery list, and died that night. My former wife's husband needs surgery for cancer, but the Mayo Clinic put him on the back burner, and they are in a holding pattern. This goes on and on. I don't mind sheltering at home, but we need serious testing to get the necessary knowledge to see where we really are. Indeed, the health care in America has been expensive and in the dark for decades.

Rent in cities where the costs of living totally are much higher than the residents and the workers can afford need to have GOOD housing for everyone that does not exceed a certain measure of their income.
Food is a must for everyone. But half of our country depends on ""food stamps"", donations, or gifts from family and friends. This must change for sure.

And finally under our Constitution, how can states deny people from gathering together to improve their ""life, liberty, safety, and wellbeing"" (often called Unions) instead they are allowed to violate the true meaning of the Constitution through word smithing, lies, propaganda, etc.

America is an idea, not just a country but should not be a country where  ""more people are more equal than others"""
2020-04-20 22:16:56,We need to compartmentalize care. Separate care for non corona patients with separate staffing and physical locations. Might be easier for hospital systems with multiple locations/affiliates in the same area where different care can be delivered at these separate entities.
2020-04-20 22:17:15,"We were told that we have the best health care in the world. Unfortunately, we don't even have a health care which insurance premium can buy.(I have insurance but I am sure - if me or my family to get sick - there is no guarantee to get the right care we need at this time).

We have health care only for uber rich, rest all will have to be queued in.. and if you're lucky you can get a bed and you may survive.
There is no guaranteed best try care for regular Americans if you're part of 99%."
2020-04-20 22:25:48,"'We understand Covid patients are the priority' says Dr. Martinez, and that's exactly the problem. There didn't seem to be any coordinated effort by locale or metropolitan area to facilitate care for non-Covid emergencies. Covid patients, who have yet to arrive in many places or arrived in much smaller numbers than originally anticipated, were placed at the front of the line - beds were cleared and kept open for them rather than for non-Covid patients needing care right away. In fact, non-Covid patients have been completely removed from the line. Hospitals and medical facilities have made it clear that Covid is their priority."
2020-04-20 22:33:26,"No doubt this is sad if not disturbing. If the health care system has ""cracked open"" as stated, the issue is not availability of healthcare , but poor Hospital management of understanding needs and where to apply. By all accounts, not a single hospital as been beyond the point of capacity, and all these spare facilities to include ships, conference calls are basically vacant. Poor administrators at Hospitals, city and state level......"
2020-04-20 22:49:23,"At the beginning of the pandemic, when it seemed like the seriousness of the situation was just beginning to increase, this is exactly what I was worried about. I can be a pretty anxious person, and become worried over nothing, but with this I've been able to sort out reality from unrealistic scenarios. Unrealistic being the world turning into Steven Soderbergh's movie ""Contagion"", and reality being a lot of elderly and already sick people facing many issues.

My brother had cancer when I was 6 and he was 9, and I can't imagine my family going through that during a global pandemic. My parents and brother were making a 2 1/2 hour commute to Chapel Hill's pediatric oncology center at least once a week, sleeping in a hospital more nights than at home, and my brother was going through treatments I imagine would be hard to have access to right now. He went through a couple of surgeries, and needed a blood transfusion like Mrs. Kefalas' husband. 

As much as it hurts me to know that there are thousands and thousands of people lacking care because of Covid-19, there's nothing I can think to suggest to fix that would solve that issue. I don't think it's any better to take the blood supply rations and ventilators away from Covid-19 patients, but what about the patients who have been fighting a battle against cancer for years? This is a topic I would like to do more research on to further understand options and what oncology patients are currently doing to fight their battles."
2020-04-20 22:51:09,"All the deaths that occur as a result of this pandemic are tragic.  Of course care was delayed across the USA when it became clear that the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading across the USA at an extremely rapid rate.  Because of the lack of testing and coordinated preparation from the federal government, the medical system had to plan for the worst. 

The initial projections suggested that the the healthcare system would be totally overwhelmed.  Thankfully this not did occur, but the only reason it didn’t was the implementation of strict social distancing.  

This isn’t a failure of the healthcare system.  It is a failure of the federal government and public health system to prepare for and contain the virus.  We knew what was happening in China by early January but steps weren’t taken to protect us. This was not the case in South Korea where proper preparations were made.

We are still in the initial response to the pandemic and many resources have been depleted.  Our frontline healthcare workers are reusing N95 masks designed to be used for short periods of time when sweeping dusty warehouses.  

We are all going to pay the price for the lack of preparation in one way or another. Despite this, we are fortunate that our country had the ability to respond.  Many developing countries will be completely overwhelmed over the coming months and millions of people will die.  

When assigning blame for our current situation look first to our leaders who ignored the warnings."
2020-04-20 22:52:05,"My grandmother was recenly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. 

I will almost certainly never see her again. At 92, she is refusing chemotherapy. She lives in California, I live in Washington. By the time it is safe for me to travel to California again, it will likely be too late.

I hope I am wrong. She is lonely, and a little bitter about it. When my wife's grandmother died a decade ago (also of the same rare blood cancer), I remember the months of family coming to town to see her. We all had a chance to say goodbye. My grandmother is missing that.

I am glad when I heard of the diagnosis in February, I visited."
2020-04-20 22:57:51,"My brother-in-law's sibling was isolated in a rural area. He had phone service, but no internet. He lived alone. He was a very social man--until coronavirus required him to stay home from his multiple jobs and stay home from sports and social activities. He committed suicide a couple days ago. He is an indirect victim of the virus. And so is his family. The repercussions from this virus are many and will never fully be accounted."
2020-04-20 23:02:11,"It’s very possible that looking back in several years we realize the devastation we caused by trying - in good intention - to save every patient with covid-19. There will be a surge of mortality of other diseases we neglected or patient did not dare to be seen with. There will be people who lost their insurance and ran out of life saving medications. There will be patients whose cancer was detected too late because we suspended screening. And there will be people who in desperation took their own life and that of others (however some statistics say that suicide diminishes during recession). We have submitted ourselves to a great experiment and unfortunately we did this with very little knowledge. We talk a lot about herd immunity, but we should talk more about herd instincts. It is well known from behavioral science that people in crisis tend to follow what others do without deliberation. Often the harm outweighs the benefit by a lot. This brings to mind again one of the deepest wisdoms every doctor swears to follow: first do not harm."
2020-04-20 23:02:37,"So we have a situation where demand exceeds supply as we have been told time and time again. There are not enough doctors, and other healthcare professionals to handle a large demand. Healthcare has always been a problem of rationing because to handle the demand that results from an epidemic or some other factor that increases demand, such as free healthcare, on the limited facilities and professionals available 
In Europe and Canada where socialized medicine is the the system to offer healthcare these rationing situations such as reported here (surgeries, transplants, chemo treatments, etc.) are typical. Those systems are great for non critical situations (colds, flu, broken bones, etc.) but when you get to the need for specialized, hospitalization, surgery, etc. rationing becomes an issue. In a desperate situation some metric is needed to prioritize care. Age is obviously one metric to consider. 
We ration care in America as well. We do it by affordability. Insurance was a solution chosen decades ago to address the need for care. For example when I was a boy I saw a doctor once when I injured my knee. I never saw a dentist until I was drafted into the army when I also discovered I needed glasses. Most people couldn’t afford the type and quantity of care we take for granted today."

2020-04-20 22:19:12,"Keeping hospital beds to fight the pandemic in a ""hot zone"" is one thing, and is often out of the control of hospitals. Many doctors and hospitals would like to keep scheduling and performing surgeries that are crucial for them to make a living, but are forbidden by states.

However, a lot of private practice just shut down because doctors would rather sit out this pandemic.
Here in San Antonio, it is impossible to see a GP or a dentist. We have very few cases thanks to a stay-home order that was enforced way before the pandemic settled in.
One can see a GP through telehealth visit but how is that any better than self-diagnosing online? How does it help a child with ear infection, an adult with an unexplained sore belly, an elder with kidney disease? 

It is impossible to get mental health support even online, and many many kids in middle and high school with no prior history of depression need help right now. I can only imagine the distress of mental health patients ""left alone"" at the moment. 
I really feel that the pathetic state of our health care system has been exposed, and so has the gap between health professional who're trying to help vs these who happily take your money year long but hide as soon as they're asked to honor their wows.
Sad!"

I remember very well that when I first read him, in the 60s, I thought: wonderful how he can evoke in his authentic way this morbid atmosphere. But the stories were dated, outlandish, improbable, over the top. Due to modern science and medicine, all such horror would obviously have become a thing of the past! 

How mistaken I was. 

The overt lying and bragging, so shameful, while all these terrible events incessantly continue, are especially hard to take."
2020-04-20 22:48:01,"The hidden victims will be coming to light for years to come, unfortunately. Do a little digging on how few cases of child and elder abuse are now being reported in your state. Domestic violence, spikes in suicides, the list will continue to grow. 

I'm fortunate to live in a sparsely populated state where shut down happened early. I had surgery last week to remove cancerous reproductive organs and it could have waited a few months, but I was eager to be done with it. I can't imagine the anxiety women with breast cancer and no access to treatment are facing. The morning I was released from the hospital, the hospital announced it was going to furlough 300 workers. 

Meanwhile, what's happening in Indian Country a few hours away is a national crime and shame with seemingly no end in sight. We throw so much money at our healthcare system and can't even manage the very simple task of targeting and redeploying resources (people and PPE) in a time of crisis."
2020-04-20 22:26:30,Maybe fixating on just 1 illness was a bit myopic.
2020-04-20 22:22:23,"Yup... being refused for all care at the moment, no clinic visits, no surgeries. God help us..."
2020-04-20 23:06:49,"OK great article. As a physician practicing in primary care in Chicago land I completely see other medical conditions been totally neglected due to COVID.  Just to name a few:

Heart attacks: people are afraid to go to the ER

Substance abuse: there are no live Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Not everybody has online capabilities to do a virtual support group. I worry a lot of alcoholics will relapse.

Delayed elective surgeries that fall into the gray area as described in the article: examples include breast cancer surgery transplantation surgery.

Telemedicine visits: although they seem to be the right thing to do right now in most cases we are certainly going to miss  things such as pneumonia , critically high blood pressure which we might even find is an incidental finding.


So there is no doubt that the quarantine was the right thing to do. The benefit in my opinion outweighed the risk. However how long do we keep this up for? There will be data that shows mortality of other non-Covid related illnesses￼ will dramatically rise this year￼. 
For example I will not be surprised if there are more deaths from heart attacks,  Cancer due to delayed treatment￼, And a dramatic rise in substance abuse and mental health issues. I would not be surprised if suicide rates dramatically skyrocket this year.

So in short we have to ask ourselves, “is the cure worse than the disease? “"
2020-04-20 23:16:32,"A week ago my uncle, age 61, ended up in the hospital with pneumonia and multiple organ failure where he remains in ICU struggling for his life.  Despite my uncle's underlying condition (diabetes), his doctor decided not to see him or ask him to get tested when my uncle called him several times over 2 weeks reporting a bad, dry cough.  Instead, he was prescribed Z-Pak presuming that he was positive for COVID-19.  When he was admitted, the hospital staff kept treating him as a COVID-19 patient to explain his condition but he tested negative for the virus multiple times.  Had testing been widely available and his doctor not been fearful of exposure to the virus, I believe this debacle could have been prevented."

Several clinics providing care considered nonessential closed a month ago and there is no idea when they will open. My eye surgeon who operated on my eye following a routine cataract surgery that resulted in retinal detachment blinding me in one eye, asked me over a month during a followup visit, knowing I know a little bit more than most in the medical profession about viruses, when I thought this COVID-19 will pass over and things could open. I said thinking that he was asking me when the virus will be eradicated,  I said not until every human or animal on our planet is virus free. He said I get that but when will it be practically possible for clinics to safely open. I said June or July and that is not because it will be summer then, but because we could acquire ""herd immunity"" by then. He then scheduled my followup appointment in June which is fine but sometimes I wish I was wrong. The clinic is closed until further notice and what if there is a reason to see him, will I have to go to emergency where I will be turned back because I do not confirm positive for COVID-19 or I go to the emergency and get infected with COVID-19. 

My dental clinic is closed too after routine cleaning and X-ray and there was a procedure to fix a problem that was identified. Time to reopen"

We would have had a team on the ground in Wuhan. We would have actually stopped inbound flights from China. And we would not be subjected to daily ego parades slash temper tantrums disguised as press conferences. 

I’m just so sorry for everyone who needs surgery etc but can’t have access to it due to the fact that Republicans nominated the most immoral, incompetent man in our nation’s history. As someone who voted Republican up until 2016 when I absolutely could not stomach Trump, I will tell you that I’ll never vote for another Republican for as long as I live. They built this disaster.

Doctors seem to be going to effort to avoid seeing or treating regular people until their symptoms are severe.  Here is Oregon, regular people apparently cannot even get tested unless they have severe symptoms.  The Times just yesterday reported how one gentleman was sent home from ER and told not to return unless his symptoms got more severe.  When he did they still refused to admit him.  When he finally was near death they relented and admitted him.  He soon accommodated their desire for bed space by dying.

It would be one thing if this avoidance of treatment was because capacity was already reached.  But capacity has not been reached.  It is just that the doctors and hospitals want to keep people away because they fear capacity of the hospitals (or even of doctors time for seeing people out of hospital) will be reached in the future."

Round two of a different antibiotic seems to have worked but I am still worried the infection is not quite clear. Hard to say.

 Indeed we should make every efforts to combat the coronavirus. But it is true there are a lot of patients except the coronavirus cases. It is time for us to change the atmosphere in society.

Tens of thousands of younger people and hundreds of thousands of seniors have died from the flu in the last decade with no daily headlines and no government action. If the state can tell your employer to close and tell you to stay home due to COVID, why isn't the flu shot mandatory and free? Many, many lives would be saved. Hey, do you get the flu shot every year? I guess some diseases are more exciting than others--in this case to the tune of well over 5 trillion dollars and counting. Now that we apparently all agree that no cost is too high and no burden too great to save a life we'll surely be reducing speed limits and deploying automated traffic law enforcement.

2020-04-21 06:13:39,"Exactly what we're going through... My son, 13 yr old with autism has been having a lot of GI issues since last fall.  We've seen his pediatrician; an allergist (a ton of blood tests); an ENT (rhino-scope) and two different GI docs (lots of blood and stool tests) all in NYC... everything not conclusive. But lots of prescriptions and eliminating foods, etc.
     But he's still losing weight, not much of an appetite, throwing up a cpl times a day, complaining of throat hurting, stomach ache etc.  
     At our last GI visit at Langone on 3/10, the doc said he def  needed to have an upper endoscopy procedure... her office would call within a day to schedule it. By 3/15 the office called to say all elective procedures would be postponed. 
     It's now a month and five days later and we've had two tele-visits with a GI doc at Stony Brook.  She agrees that his weight is a big problem, but she can't schedule an upper endoscopy procedure either, because her space where she'd do the 20 minute outpatient procedure is being used for Covid-19 patients.  
     So our son looks like a concentration camp survivor (not an exaggeration) and we've got one foot out the door to the ER, probably risking getting Covid-19, because it'll be the only way he can get a simple exploratory procedure... a procedure that might find something significant.
     Or if we don't go to the ER, whatever is going on in his esophagus/stomach might progress to the point where it's not fixable."
2020-04-21 07:07:34,"The same thing happened in Italy. 
When this surreal story ends, our politicians will have to answer some questions: 1) Did more people die because of the cononavirus or because of the lockdown? 2) How many people have become severely disabled due to the sine die shift of medical therapies? 3) How many people have suffered more or will suffer more in the future because of the delay in medical treatment? 4) Were there alternatives to lockdown? 5j Are we prepared to face new emergencies in the future without cancelling the rights of ALL patients?"
2020-04-21 07:40:30,"I think this largely depends on where you live, TBH.

Weeks ago, I could not get tested for COVID-19, not for love or money. Still can't. I'm still sick with the same chest cold I've had since March 2. 

But about 10 days ago, I got an excruciatingly painful *something* wrong with every lymph node in my body. At first, my family doc thought it might be a blood clot, and sent me off to the ER. They cleared me for that in short order and ran labs which showed no infection and normal blood counts. 

But then doc brought me into the office, because my arms began to swell and my lymph nodes in my arms and chest began to swell and get hard. So next, it was off to the Diagnostic Center for a mammogram (I'm years overdue). That was also clear. By that time, I was in so much pain, I was unable to sleep, my hands were getting numb, I was becoming frightened. Doc said everything was looking fine, and she was unconcerned, but the next thing she suggested was a CT scan of my chest. I gotta level with ya, that simply *doesn't* sound like something you order when there's nothing wrong. 

Yet all these things have happened in relatively short order. A little weirdness and sharing of PPE. Some telemedicine. But the fact may be that this is a small, affluent city on the outskirts of a metro area which has an outbreak, but ourselves, we are not overrun with COVID-19 cases. 

It may just be where ya live."
2020-04-21 08:40:48,"And so it begins. There will be more and more peole who die because of the obsession with suppressing the coronavirus rather than a mitigation strategy. As the global economy stalls out because of a misplaced subjective mania for lockdowns, more and more people will die. Of course the governments responsible will NOT admit or even accept that these people are vicitims of the lockdowns, nor will they take responsibility for killing MILLIONS.

Here in France, Macron's government just admitted that the lockdown will cost the French economy 120 billion euros (US $132 billion). With a population of 67 million, that means the lockdown here in France will cost each French resident 1800 euros for the two months of lockdown, or roughly 30 euros per day. How many of the elderly and poor will die because they cannot make ends meet? It is more difficult to evict someone in France than in the US, but the homeless problem is likely to increase. There are many factors to consider, but what is missing in most analyses by well-meaning people is that shutting down the economy will kill far more people than the coronavirus. We are not back in 1920, when more people worked the land and could get some sort of food directly. Now globalization has put us all in a situation of depending on global supply chains for even the most basic necessities of life. Mass starvation will likely arrive in the dead of winter soon after Trump is re-inaugurated."
2020-04-21 09:48:13,"It would help to know how many covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals get well. From media reports, our impression is that the hospital ICUs are full-up with covid-19 patients who are admitted close to their last breath. The impression is that very few improve (that rare event is usually a media frenzy), but most die--the only treatment is ventilators. And with ventilators in short supply, many covid-19 patients don't even have a chance at survival in the hospital. 

So why are hospitals given over to covid-19 patients, who we now know rarely benefit from the little hospital treatment they receive, yet whose disease often infects and kills the health care workers? Aside from all that, there's the outrageous, frightening fact that people who would ""normally"" be ICU patients are being turned away! This is what life is generally like if you don't have any health insurance at all, btw.  No, this ""system"" we've got going, especially these past couple of months, needs to be seriously rethought and revamped. People who are sick and can be cured--or maintained--must be allowed access to their treatment. That's all there is to it. Hospitals cannot continue to be turned into deadly versions of hospice centers."

Poor stewardship of this Nation by its elected President is to blame, together with a supporting cast of every voter who pulled the lever in the wrong direction. Maybe big oil too is now having second thoughts. And looks like the wizards on Wall Street who swooned for a plutocrat while waiting for that big day have finally been left at the alter. And every Southern State’s Huey Long is going to help solve the problem of the Electoral College’s preoccupation with Trump voters by doing their part to thin out that herd.

And it seems to be inaccurate to say ""Beds, blood, doctors, nurses and ventilators are in short supply,"" at least with regard to ventilators.  Governor Cuomo, who demanded 30-40,000 ventilators has found that he really only needed about 5,000 (as the Trump Administration was telling him), and he is now shipping ventilators all over the country because he has so many on hand."

How do we open the country, what tools can we use:  community immunity, better treatments, social isolation, and eventually a vaccine.  Of these, it seems that social isolation is what we mostly hear about, perhaps that may be all that we have so far.  But flattening the curve, is not about reducing the number of infections, just spreading them out over time, so our health care industry is not overwhelmed.

Perhaps the best strategy for an individual is to delay getting infected as long as possible, hoping better treatments (or a cure) are available when it is finally ""our turn"".  So while I think ignoring the advice to stay out of groups is stupid, another side of me thinks they are volunteering to be ""lab rats"" to help develop better treatments and more community immunity, while I wait for a vaccine.

At the same time the Aussie tv channels were showing Trump making one fatuous claim after another- it is under control, we will have no cases, it will just disappear, ad nauseum.

They even made a vaccine against the spike protein, like the ones under development now, but they found that in aged mice, unlike young mice, it potentiated the disease and made it worse by amplifying the immune over reaction that is deadly.

Letter | 09 November 2015

A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence

“On the basis of these findings, scientific review panels may deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue, as increased pathogenicity in mammalian models (humans) cannot be excluded. Coupled with restrictions on mouse-adapted strains and the development of monoclonal antibodies using escape mutants, research into CoV emergence and therapeutic efficacy may be severely limited moving forward. Together, these data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF (gain of function) research concerns; the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved.”

Focus on these key terms: “building chimeric viruses”, “increased pathogenicity”, “the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens”.  

Yes, it is highly probable this plague began at the Wuhan lab."
2020-04-20 16:13:43,"The artilce reports: ""In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed about 90 companies, many based in China, to sell tests that have not gotten government vetting, saying the pandemic warrants an urgent response.""

And yet, when a scientist in Seattle at the end of January requested emergency permission to use a flu study to begin testing for Covdi19, the FDA would not allow this and effectively squelched an opportunity to get an early look into the presence of SARS Cov2.

The Federal authorities, led by erratic and foolish President Trump, have completely dropped the ball on testing; they have so seemingly dropped the ball that it is starting to appear that they had no real intention to catch it. And now, the FDA lets multiple Chinese companies export test  kits, without FDA examination, that prove ineffective???

The president should have, could have, but hasn't, employed the Defense Production Act and compelled American based companies to produce tests that meet FDA approval at a fair price.

The president has let the American people down; and it isn't the fault of the World Health Organization."
2020-04-20 15:40:29,"The Chinese denial about the Wuhan lab, forwarded here by the NYT, misses the point. The conjecture coming from the US is not that the virus was created or tampered with by personnel in the lab. It is rather that it was inadvertently spread by lab employees and that Chinese officials denied this--i.e. lied. And thereby caused great damage. I have no idea what the truth is, but this is the conjecture coming from the US. And, interestingly, it seems not to be denied here."

2020-04-20 16:16:00,"Statistics by the World Health Organization point to Africa as the most likely continent from which nCoV-2019 would emerge.  For over 45 years, epidemiologists at EcoHealth Alliance have predicted viral outbreaks in various parts of the world based on complex modeling.  Hubei Province and Wuhan City were not predicted as future hotspots.  More suspiciously, China is reopening thousands of wet markets it shuttered a few months ago after blaming them for this virus.  We must reject the idea that the market was the origin because too many of the originally infected had NO connection to that market.  The first patient identified was immobile, senile and lived miles away from that market.

nCoV-2019 did not percolate from countless exotic bushmeat markets in China, East and SE Asia, Oceana, Africa and Bolivia.  These places routinely hunt bats and other wild animals, consume and export bat meat, including virus-infected horseshoe bats -  in Guam, Palau, Philippines, Samoa, and Bolivia.  Wild animal bushmeat is eaten in so many places they should all be at greater risk of outbreaks than metropolitan and urban Wuhan.  What tipped the scales?

(“Human-animal interactions and bat coronavirus spillover potential among rural residents in Southern China” Biosafety and Health, Volume 1, Issue 2, September 2019, Pages 84-90).  This study casts doubt on the official Chinese narrative that blames the Wuhan street market.  Numerous other studies by China’s scientists raise the same doubts (see ChinaXiv.org, 2/19/20).  

China’s government is now reopening the 20,000 wet bush markets it closed down a few months ago in the interest of “the People”.  China’s government knows those markets were not huge hazards. It knew the wet market in Wuhan was not the cause of nCoV-2019. 

The odds are good that our naive belief in China’s official line is wrong, at least this time. The urban bushmeat market construct deflects suspicion from the government’s virus lab in Wuhan.  It protects gilded rice bowls and careers of party officials.  Xi Jinping and Party propagandists must have considered the reputational damage if we all believed mismanaged operations at a government lab caused this plague."

But how is it that in NYC this kind of protesting is NOT happening? We have been battered, yet people seem to get what it will take to minimize the effects on our health care system and to preserve life! We too are feeling economic pains, it isn't just out there, What is the difference? A major study of our society is needed,  and a reboot."
2020-04-21 13:48:02,"There’s no way we’re ready to reopen if this prison just exploded with cases. 103 employees? How many family members, friends, or strangers did they infect before the symptoms began? How many did THOSE people infect? It’s just too soon. 1918 2.0 right on schedule, it seems."
2020-04-21 13:27:59,"Georgia Mayor states Massage therapist can go back to work. He is not thinking, Massage therapist can not wear gloves to message.

It is too soon.
Please rethink this."

2020-04-21 13:31:17,Shocking that states with numbers still climbing - rather than declining for the 14 straight days recommended by th CDC - are opening.  These Republican governors are putting their citizens and the citizens of other states at great risk.   You want to get a tattoo in Georgia?  Fine if it were just you.  But if you go home and your daughter has just seen her boyfriend who only sees one outside friend a week who has just visited his grandparents over the state line - that line can go right up to anyone.  And all those anyones - or just you when you end up in the ICU - will be demanding the services of health care professionals who put their own lives and the lives of their families on the line.   Let's take a few more deep breaths people.  Ending restrictions now only to see huge spikes in a few weeks makes all our previous efforts a waste.
2020-04-21 14:13:04,All the states which are ready to reopen businesses in a few days and others who are expected to follow suit have one thing in common. The governors in question are all Republicans. Their decisions are mostly political. The GOP appears to place greater value on their hunches than on science.
2020-04-21 14:14:34,"Throughout this outbreak we've seen the same scenario repeated over and over. The experts warn us, tell us what to do to stay safe, but there are always people and states who believe they know better. That, somehow, despite making the exact same mistakes they've witnessed in other states and around the world, that it's going to be ""different"" where they live. And, as always, it ends as the medical experts warned it would. Georgia is about to demonstrate what happens when you open too early. It not a demonstration we require, since we already know the outcome. However, like a kid who doesn't believe you when you tell them not do a cannonball into the 2 foot end of a pool, they apparently have to see for themselves."
2020-04-21 14:16:09,"The different approaches taken by different states will serve as a sort of crude clinical trial. Changes in rates of infections, hospitalzations, severe infections, and deaths can be compared to the different approaches taken by different states and locales. 

Interpreting the data might be difficult, if the differences between high and low level restrictions are small. 

On the other hand, it is very possible that the differences are so obvious that they don't require statistical analysis."
2020-04-21 14:37:17,"I can't speak for other states, but SC is making a calculated decision to reopen. Most readers like to think it is a political decision because McMaster is a Republican, but in reality, all modeling by our professionals in the state health agency (SCDHEC) shows that we are not going to reach capacity with hospital beds, icu beds, or ventilators. The numbers aren't even close.  If the whole point of flattening the curve is so that health services don't reach a critical point, then we have accomplished that. For the good of the whole country, some places need to open up. I encourage you to look at the DHEC website."
2020-04-21 14:28:07,"Once again, Trump places his self-interest above anything else.  In this case, he's putting himself ahead of the physical health of  Americans.  Keeping the testing numbers down (he thinks) makes him look good by showing that not as many people are being infected.  What he actually is achieving is making the situation worse both economically and physically by prolonging the epidemic.  His supporters apparently are mindless to the fact that he is actually threatening the well being of them and their loved ones.  At least his falling approval ratings show that some people are understanding the consequences of his actions."
2020-04-21 14:09:25,"Looking in, from outside the US, easing mitigation measures at this point is a horrifying prospect, a potentially deadly experiment gambling with human life. The current 40,000+ US death toll is in peril of exponential growth in coming weeks and months. The disregard for human life is unfathomable. Dr. Fauci is warning the US of the potential devastating consequences, and yet his warning appears to be going unheeded. Disgraceful, shocking and very very sad."
2020-04-21 14:16:59,"None of the states qualify to open prior to May 4 according to Trump’s guidelines and that assumes continued downward trend for 14 days straight.
These Governors say they are prepared and have the medical capacity to care for their states citizens if trends change and go up.
Are these Governors willing to commit on camera and in writing that they will not need or request and accept any aid from federal government and national stockpile?
Will the misguided “liberators “ taking to the streets this past week and currently refuse to seek out any medical assistance when they get sick and self quarantine for at least 3 weeks and until they test negative for 2 consecutive days?
Guaranteed when conditions go bad in these states Trump will blame Governor’s for not following guidelines and deny his encouraging of opening up states before they meet guideline standards!"
2020-04-21 14:30:24,How exactly can massage therapists or tattoo parlors maintain social distance? And why are these considered essential businesses?

2020-04-21 15:09:35,"It seems like these governors are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, their own apocalypse.  The backstop will be blue state monies flowing via Trump to red states to pay for all the health catastrophes.  Plus the front line health care workers who will sacrifice themselves in so many ways."
2020-04-21 15:19:22,"I thank the residents of Georgia and other states for being the guinea pigs for the rest of the nation. One way or another, we'll soon know whether the loosening of these restrictions causes more deaths or not. Thanks, Georgians and others!"
2020-04-21 15:21:04,"Dr. Scott Morrow, the lead health official for San Mateo County, California, has said that anyone who ignores or flouts shelter-in-place or social distancing protocols during this pandemic crisis is effectively spitting in the faces of those who honor, respect and follow them. If nothing else, with these premature moves to “open up” Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina, we know with what disdain and contempt their governors and Trump actually hold the citizens they ostensibly represent."
2020-04-21 15:27:40,"In a group of 600 sailors who tested positive for Covid-19 fully 60% had no symptoms: that's a lot of typhoid Mary's running around. And a lot of infrastructure isn't built for safe separation So..... maybe you won't even see the problem if you say testing for Covid-19 is in short supply, so why waste tests on corpses? The adverse consequences of opening up? What consequences?"
2020-04-21 15:35:56,"I find it absolutely mind boggling to see the protests in the U.S.A demanding an end to the various lockdowns currently in force.

There were people taking part in the protests who were not wearing masks, taking no notice of social distancing measures, and apparently, they were hand shaking/hugging one another as it were going out of fashion.

Do these people not realise that we are in a global emergency which is unprecedented, not just an American one. To casually brush off the evilness of covid-19 is simple insanity. I saw a woman on the news who gleefully declared that because she lives in a very sunny part of the U.S.A she will not get the virus - good luck with that one then lady.

What will these protesters do when they are ill with the virus and can't get any medical help because the health system is overwhelmed, directly attributed to the protesting. 

The daily images from New York - and elsewhere around the world - over the past few weeks have been truly harrowing and if those that protest can't see that, then all hope is lost.

The sad thing is that the protests in the U.S.A will spur on other folks in other countries to do the same, and much worse no doubt. 

We are all struggling with this crisis at the moment but, I would rather struggle within a lockdown than not.

The world as we knew it has gone for good, a new world of social distancing and renewed lockdowns now the norm."
2020-04-21 17:00:34,"I don't understand how Georgia thinks it's ready to start returning to normal as they were late to shut down and have a much higher percentage of infection than California, Washington or Colorado."
2020-04-21 14:54:06,"Leadership should mean responsibility, but instead everyone seems to be passing the buck. 

Governors will reopen states for political reasons. Businesses will mandate employees report to work for commercial reasons. Individuals will be the ones who fall sick. Their bosses and politicians will blame the victims, saying they didn’t wash their hands enough."
2020-04-21 15:24:21,"We undoubtedly have many more cases of coronavirus infection than we'll ever know, since Trump's incompetence, or malignancy, or both has severely limited the amount of testing possible.  

Nonetheless, the issue is not that it's a good thing that people who are infected don't get sick.  Nobody wants more people to be ill.  The issue is that they aren't aware that they're infected and can infect others.  They represent Typhoid Marys, capable of spreading infection without even being aware.

Others?  Oh yes, others.  That thing called social responsibility.  Or, to put it differently, even though a 35 year old adult may be an asymptomatic carrier and never get sick, his/her 5 year old child or 65 year old parent may not be so lucky.  

The issue, as has been said many times, is the availability of testing. Unfortunately, we have all kinds of rushes towards ""reopening"" the country's businesses, propelled largely by Trump's obsession with getting reelected and the GOP's hunger for power.  This dynamic controls the conversation now.  

Only time will tell how it turns out."
2020-04-21 16:27:10,"We must sit back, collect data and think:

In Sweden there never was a lock down. They DID have more cases than they could have had, but not terribly many. They think that they are rapidly acquiring herd immunity. 

So the urgent question remains - what makes them different than NYC? The answers are in part that their population is healthier, at lower risk, less population density and more. 

These governors who are opening their economy could be correct, PROVIDED that they protect the vulnerable people. The latest is that BMI is a predictor for hospitalization (BMI>40 is really bad news, BMI between 30-40 is less bad, but not good). That suggests that the South is NOT a good place to open the economy. 

Why do we not have data on who is vulnerable and who will be (relatively) OK?"
2020-04-21 16:47:46,They are volunteering to be an important real time experiment in public health. Glad I don't live in any of these states.
2020-04-21 14:44:41,"Thank you, Georgia! It's about time someone decided to stop this insanity. 
Yes, the virus is dangerous,  but most of the deaths are coming from nursing homes and the obese, not everyone else. Furthermore, the main out-of-control outbreak is in the home of the media, NYC and northern NJ, and not the rest of the country."
2020-04-21 15:47:30,"Staying home, wearing masks, and keeping six feet away from other people to try to stop the the virus, which we have been doing, has succeeded in slowing its devastating spread.  If we stop doing that now and try to resume life as it was, a surge could be far worse than the financial consequences so many families are suffering.  

 If we let our guard down now and see another surge, we may be slightly better prepared to deal with it, but the toll could be even worse than it has been at its peak.

A plateau  is a flattening, not an end.  If 743 New Yorkers died yesterday, the lowest one-day death toll in more than two weeks, and only 740 people die today, deaths of 740 people from this disease is still horrifying."
2020-04-21 16:05:53,"What these governors are doing is expressing a cold and calculating but simple math: How much are the lives of our elders worth?

Their answer: Not as much as keeping gyms open.
 
The data from NYC are pretty clear. The elderly with preexisting conditions are far more threatened with death than the young and healthy. 

There will be some deaths of young, otherwise healthy people, but the people who will die in greatest proportion from these decisions will be 55+, probably with some existing health concerns. As a percentage, black and Latino populations will suffer more.

What, in the long history of American conservative governance, has demonstrated that the Brian Kemps of the world care one speck for these people?"
2020-04-21 16:11:18,"I look forward to seeing all the photos of Governor Kemp eating out in several different restaurants surrounded not by his staff but by all the others who've been advocating opening up without having any actual medical/statistical basis for this. Let's have all these ""leaders"" go out and about as they exhort others to do.

What about the businesses that do open up only to find that people are too scared still to patronize them? All those extra payroll and supply bills. Them opening up is not an easy decision to foretell business by."
2020-04-21 14:55:29,"“Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand,” he said. “That is a complex subject, but some of the governors did not understand it.”
I’m hoping that those governors whom Trump has dissed will remember these words in the run up to November."
2020-04-21 15:47:10,"I’m going to look at this as an act of great generosity on the part of these states to voluntarily serve as the experimental group in this medical study. Those of us who remain cautious, perhaps overly so (that’s the experimental question), will gladly be the control group as the results are gathered. Thanks, red states!"
2020-04-21 14:49:50,"Imagine driving up to a train crossing, the alarm going off and a train approaching at high speed. You might be able to speed through the crossing before the train does. You should stop. But the stupidest thing is to slow down and then try to gun it across before the train crosses. That’s almost certain death. 

Reopen the economy prematurely and unsafely (tattoos - seriously?) you might as well have not shut down. The numbers will bounce up and then we have the same numbers of deaths, the collapse of the health system, and also losses of trillions of dollars. The worst of all worlds."
2020-04-21 14:56:31,"Open gyms, salons, and tattoo parlors? What a brilliant scheme to avoid paying unemployment benefits and extending loans to small businesses.  Governor Kemp must be bald, overweight, and tattoo-free.  Or heartless."
2020-04-21 15:15:20,"They shouldn’t go halfway. The southern states should open up completely. Let them open up 100 percent. Just don’t come looking this way for help if the disease starts spreading like wildfire. The states should rely on themselves, right? That’s the way they want it."
2020-04-21 15:24:37,"Exhausted and overwhelmed doctors, nurses, therapists and ancillary services, already overwhelmed, over burdened and under protected will now have to put themselves further at risk and in harm's way due to the selfishness and obstinacy (in the mildest terms) of mostly greedy men and women, (all Republican) who profess to be God fearing, pro life and...followers of Jesus teachings.
Our fearless leader tweets ""liberate..."" and fools rush in like lambs to the slaughter.
Stay at home South Carolinians, Georgians, Michiganders, and Minnesotans, and live and breathe to be able to be middle aged, to be grandparents, set an example for those you love and more to the point, don't make those you love another statistic of this wretched virus."
2020-04-21 15:29:18,"“We’re going to do what we think is right — what I think is right — and that is try to open this economy ... but do it very, very carefully so we don’t get a lot of people killed.” - Mike DeWine

So it is not okay if a lot of people die, but it is okay if only a medium amount of die?"
2020-04-21 15:30:24,"I wonder if these politicians think this Global Pandemic spreads by mosquitoes, contaminated water, bat bites, rats, fleas, rotten food or toilet seats? Have they not realized by now it spreads rapidly by close proximity of infected people, and that as much as 50% of virus carriers have no initial symptoms, and some never have significant symptoms at all? 

How do they ignore the nearly 800,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 42,500 horrid deaths (a number widely considered as under-reported)? 

If this is supposed to be a something of a political statement, it‘s like saying “The Walking Dead” is a Trump Campaign Advertisement."
2020-04-21 17:57:22,"Georgia has had shelter at home for 2 weeks, and they think they've bent the curve? This is a public health disaster waiting to happen, in the CDC's backyard no less."
2020-04-21 18:05:34,"What if you ""opened the economy"" and no one came?  I think we are about to see.  I just read some interviews with Atlanta restaurant owners at Eater.com and none of them feel comfortable re-opening on Monday.  How many customers are really going to show up at a re-opened nail salon?  Similarly, movie theaters don't even have any major movies to show.  Hollywood isn't going to release any major films just to show in Georgia.  Add in distancing requirements and revenue doesn't outweigh costs.  We'll see how this works out, but this could end an empty gesture in regards to actually having an impact on the Georgia economy.  For the health of the people of Georgia, that could be good."
2020-04-21 15:36:44,"Well, there’s the problem with these politicos, like the governor of Georgia, who are falling all over themselves to “Liberate their States”. 

So, let’s assume one day, the YMCA says it’s OK to urinate in one corner of the community pool.  All of your guys who aren’t concerned of being surrounded by urine, stand over there in that corner.  Hey, you want to stand in urine, that’s your right.   

Problem:  Sooner or later some of that urine’s going to seep into the other parts of the pool with the people, who don’t want to stand in pee, but who are now going to eventually be standing in pee.

Real simple to understand, folks."
2020-04-21 19:20:46,"I disagree with Kemp; not really a fan anyway, but he's wrong to open the businesses in the list on Friday.  While I'm not sure when the right time will be, and no one really knows, he should have at least stuck to April 30, the original possible date.

The list includes all of the businesses where people cannot really practice social distancing.  And I don't think masks and gloves offer any certainty for those businesses.  I know of no one that has a 6 foot pair of scissors for cutting hair.  We have a few petitions in GA to stop this, but sentiment is against us.  Hoping the next couple of days might change things, but doubtful. 

However, I also disagree with the governor of MI and her outrageous list of what one can or cannot do.  I agree that each state is somewhat different, but when we can travel across state lines, that changes things.  Entirely."
2020-04-21 19:31:54,"Some of the places very eager to lift restrictions haven't even really been hit that hard, could create a very weird situation."

2020-04-21 14:47:27,"Mr. Trump specifically mentioned Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, and Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican. He also framed the debates around testing in political terms, saying that Democrats wanted maximum testing “because they want to be able to criticize.”

So Governor Pritzker arranges with Abbott Labs to get the first shipments of its new fast COVID tests; the federal government intercepts and commandeers them; Trump actually SHOWS THEM OFF as the wonderful, wonderful tests that Trump has and you can beg for; and Trump bashes Pritzker for complaining.

And Trump hates the Governor of Maryland and his immigrant wife for obtaining medical supplies from Korea.  Next day, Trump says the Governor doesn't know how to get supplies (!) and suspends immigration.  

Trump hates it when someone helps America.  It means that he won't get all the credit there is, and that the people won't have to kiss his butt to get medical supplies, and that he won't be the source of all good things like a not particularly benevolent god."
2020-04-21 14:53:33,"Trump is confused largely because he's both ignorant and illiterate. What's he doing, forget it there's no rational explanation.  But, what's he doing telling Virginia to liberate and telling people to abide by the guidelines intending to help resolve the spread?  You don't get to bask in the sheen of both options and expect them to be your beliefs.  Talk about lying and being dishonest. He does it right out in the open, in the light of day like a flasher in and out of his raincoat.  Its an indication of mental illness not to be able to discern how the sides are distinct. The whole country must recognize that contradiction and idiocy frankly."

He should announce his plan on his daily coronavirus TV farce, and encourage all the protestors that he has inspired, to join him in Georgia for a Weekend of Liberation.  Better yet, let him spend some of his alleged billions to pay for their travel expenses.

Each year, as it is, I end up with 1 or 2 colds from a client who 'just has allergies.' Because massage is such a hard profession on the body, few of us can work enough hours weekly to qualify for health insurance. I'm beyond grateful for the ACA so I can get coverage! It is no coincidence that these are Southern states with Republican governors. And in Georgia's case, considering that Kemp had a huge conflict of interest during the gubernatorial election in overseeing said election as the Secretary of State, (which included accusations of minority voter suppression), it's hard not to be cynical about his reasons for opening the state up before even the most lax Federal guidelines are met in an election year. It is FACT that Covid-19 has disproportionately affected African American communities, which have fewer resources and fewer people that can work from home. I can't be the only one thinking this decision to re-open reeks of voting malice this close to a presidential election. It's beyond disgusting."

2020-04-21 23:08:06,"I heard that CDC had determined that 2 minutes of sunlight is enough to kill the covid-19 virus.  
If that is true, a lot of opening could be eased.  (People would still keep social distance, wear masks, minimize touching others and surfaces and one's own face, frequent hand washing and sanitizing, etc.  Sun screen would also help)
There are so many activities in the sun that will give us freedom, lessening the push to reduce self-quarantinting too early.
Where there is too little sunshine, Ultra Violet C might be used.  While UV can be destructive to skin and eyes, UV C is much less dangerous.  UV C illumination at levels roughly like sun light could make many more  areas safely accessible.

What it means is preventing the number of cases, even in case of hot spots and sporadic outbreaks, from overrunning your healthcare facilities.

Flattening the Curve tries to prevent deaths caused by resource issues. It does not try to prevent the number of overall deaths as you look across two years (time until vaccine).

Reality is, you cannot keep the economy closed or severely hampered for two years. Just can't do it. 

The pragmatic way to do this is to open up certain regions as you can, Detroit is different than Grand Rapids. NYC is different from Albany or Ithaca."

There ain’t no happy ending
When they’re rubbing you to death
You may be down for a reach around
But you’re being killed with every breath

The virus rains upon you 
As you dream of happy trails
And if the massage just doesn’t kill ya
You’ll drop dead when they do your nails

The science sits before them
But the state seems awfully blind
Thoughts and prayers are badly needed
I got Georgia on my mind"

The mile long lineups at food bank sites illustrate the fact that people are unable to provide for their families. Indirectly, the Trump re-election campaign is starving people into fighting for the reopening of the states despite the health and scientific reasons for keeping things closed until the curve flattens and sufficient testing is in place to permit a rationalized opening based on facts and not the hunches of a President who has abdicated all responsibility for his delays in dealing with the pandemic he initially called a Democratic hoax despite evidence to the contrary."

The main problem is that at low seroprvalence levels you will have too many self-positives. A test with 95% sensitivity and specificity would still require over one third of the population to have seroprevalence in order to be 90% sure that a positive test is a true positive. We are far from there. So best use of antibody tests is actually to measure seroprevalence (one can work the math backwards from no. Oof positive tests to calculate this) and not use to determine i dividual immunity. It can seem very odd, but the math is simple. Highly recommend NYT do more to share the math and this message."

You can test for flu anywhere (a local cvs!) and get results immediately. That, plus the availability of flu vaccines, the flu’s lower level of hospitalization, and lower death rate of flu, all make the analogy a nonstarter. 

I hope we can reach a level where reliable testing is ubiquitous—only then will people return to normal behavior (notwithstanding whether stores/businesses are open)."

2020-04-20 09:11:38,"This article appears to provide in a nutshell just how exceptional America is as concerns Public Health.

Here the entire American focus is on the Food and Drug Administration (in the time of Trump), not on a federal Public Health Agency, perhaps the CDC.

Correction: The real focus is on Trump who knows nothing about epidemioilogy or virology who cheers the FDA's emergency approval, none of which have been adequately tested.

Here in Sweden, we do have a National Public Agency and statements from that agency as concerns serological testing come from an epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell who thus far states there is as yet no reliable serological test available. Researchers at one Swedish university say they may have one.

What will we hear next? That 1000 protesters have all purchased do-it-yourself tests and find themselves to have had COPID 19.

The second Trump reads some such report he will be tweeting in CAPITAL LETTERS and influencers will be telling their millions of followers, buy this test.

What a strange irony that the only scientist to be quoted is Michael T. Osterholm, very likely of Swedish descent. Read what he says and you will realize the FDA very likely is speaking for Donald Trump alone.

Will now visit the University of Minnesota website to find Dr. Osterholm. 

Stay tuned.

At the same time he is calling on his right wing ""army"" to come out and swarm the streets. Why aren't we using the WHO tests? South Korea seems to be doing a pretty great job using these tests but somehow they are not good enough for the US? As with everything else Trump has done, people are jumping in to make millions off of others suffering. There is nothing normal about the response from this administration.  Evil needs to be called out when it is staring us in the face."

This was terrific reporting on a story that should make us all very frightened... and very angry.  The fact that the FDA rushed to approve tests without total vefification of their accuracy seems like an analog for the entire administration's handling of this virus.

The government sets a target date (opening up the economy) and then races to meet it by cutting corners with the technology needed to get that done.

Shouldn't it be the other way around?  Logic dictates people leave their homes when it's safe.

Because what good are flawed tests? You'd would think the administration might have learned its lesson with the flawed CDC testing rollout, but it seems to be following the same playbook."

How much easier to blame it on the governors because they expected him to lead not duck.  That expectation alone was absurd given the track record of our Deflector in Chief."
2020-04-20 10:02:55,"The problem is the absence of leadership in the Western world. The right approach would be to outsource to a couple of companies. But companies are just as prone to make mistakes as the CDC and the only way to get decent results is closely monitoring the results. 

Unfortunately - just as we see with defense contracts - monitoring has become haphazard and is often overruled by lobbying.

There were one-way arrows taped to the floor to guide people, but those arrows were routinely ignored. One guy even blocked an aisle so he could take a phone call.  A young couple jogged right up on me giggling as they reached for an item a couple of feet from where I was standing like I was not even there.

The entire trip was extremely stressful. I felt like I was playing a game of Frogger or Paintball. At the register I mentioned to the cashier and bag boy that nobody seemed to be paying any attention to the 6-foot rule. These two employees were already aware. The cashier said it was hard for the employees to avoid the customers. The bag boy said things might get really bad for all of them in the future. Leaving the store I thought about mentioning my observations to the security guard. But not even he was observing the six-foot rule. So, I did not bother."

Then went and googled and lo and behold, it looks like yesterday he finally took the pleas of Cuomo and other governors to heart and is now using it to compel more swab production.  

This is a start.  Thank you, Mr. President, for listening to our governors instead of bowing to the idol of free markets and taking a step to get the states the supplies they need to scale up testing.  Now sir, please follow through with the also-scarce reagents and right on into the arena of antibody tests.  This is the best way you can use your authority to get America back to work.  It would also give those who have criticized your leadership during this pandemic to sing your praises instead."

Results from the qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis.”  These products used properly can be very helpful to doctors, patients and communities if used as intended.  Does anyone rely solely on a home pregnancy test to know if they are pregnant?  They usually get confirmation from a second test via their doctor along an exam.  Many of these products are valuable if they are used properly."

I have been struggling to empathize with the woman in the Dodge Ram, head out the window, hurling epithets at the healthcare worker on the street. What desperation could lead her to this? I rationalize that maybe she could not afford to keep her business going with stay at home order. Of course this is one story of many ones, including my own parents. Yet my parents stayed home and closed, and received their $1200 check. The money is not enough, but they stayed home nevertheless. 

I hate to be cynical, but I would not be surprised to learn that this woman also received her check and that she wore her politics before her patriotism."
2020-04-20 11:13:34,"To let tests into the country without testing is insane. The CDC can't know not how to do this, but I'll state it here to show how simple it is.

Start with two bags of blood, one positive and one negative for the antibodies. Divide them up randomly into 10000 test tubes and give to a lab tech to apply the blood to the test strips and log the results. VOILA! You know which tests work and to what degree of accuracy.

CDC, you can still do this. You could get the results in a day. You publish your results and then remove the bad tests from circulation.

Overloaded? Ask me and I'll come down on my own time and do the tests for you."

It would be more difficult to mount such an effort here in the not-so-united USA, but it's tragic that so little is being done to attempt that kind of response. I am baffled by the lack of commitment to testing from our federal government. 
Dr. Brix said that we have many small epidemics. I think that's true and I think that means we have to find out where they have happened and where they are currently occurring. Is it just too difficult to do the testing we need, or are we in the grip of an administration that would prefer not to know the truth?"

2020-04-20 12:01:47,"One, any acceptance of anything made in China without robust testing is dangerously foolhardy. Two, having antibodies to this virus does not prove how long immunity lasts, if you can still be a carrier, or if you can be reinfected. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here."
2020-04-20 11:57:44,"We need Free, Universal Coronavirus Tests for everyone in the US, immediately.  Both diagnostic and antibody tests are needed, and the FDA needs to evaluate the reliability of these tests ASAP.
Only after this universal testing is complete can we consider reopening the country.  Those who have COVID-19 should be quarantined.  Everyone else can go about their business.
Many locations in America are probably free of Coronavirus, but we will never know unless we test.
Trump’s stubborn refusal to prepare for widescale testing, when the first US patients were found in January, was the single most dangerous (in)action in recent American history.  Trump is compounding this problem by refusing to recognize the present shortage of reliable testing.
Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Global Recession.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

The more I looked into them, the more it was clear that there was no validation by the manufacturers in most cases, and certainly no meaningful oversight by the Federal government or the College of American Pathologist. The tests that have been properly validated are not available due to demand far outstripping supply. It’s like Gresham’s Law applied to lab tests: bad tests flood the market, and good tests disappear.

In fact, they never use the term lateral flow even though that is what they are largely talking about when they say the tests are bad. They mention ELISA (which is an acronym), but says “Elisa”. Also, they never discuss the Abbott test that is receiving rave reviews from multiple academic clinical labs. Asking reporters to dive this quickly into the scientific weeds is obviously difficult.

Every other wealthy country created a furlough system, or already had one in place, backing the payrolls of most business, so that they don't go out of business and people aren't unemployed. If the UK can do that, why can't the US? Forget sending 1200$ to people who have lost their jobs. 
After four decades of 'starving the beast', aka public services, the Republicans have indeed created an utterly dysfunctional government. The Dems are hardly perfect, but there is no contest here as to who's to blame for social inequity, endless wars, and the gutting of public services.

It may well be that the results in South Korea were unrelated to testing but a result of immediate and severe mitigation as in India. Those two countries are not out of the woods yet.

This harks back to the lack of regulation in the drug and chemical manufacturers.  And at base it is a tool of the profiteers. They will sell defective tests that give workers a false sense of immunity in order to get them back to work and off unemployment compensation. We don't know if there are good tests of immunity and how long immunity lasts, but it's pretty obvious this is a ruse to start up the factories and farms even if it puts the workers in harm's way.

Instead we should use this forced pause to take stock of what really matters to us as American citizens. Yes, food and shelter--after that a clean environment free of the pollution we have caused these many years to put money in the pockets of fossil fuel and chemical companies.

The voters generally fail to consider how crucial is careful regulation of a product like this, their first choice being the quick and easy, the advertised, the unregulated product from China.

Meanwhile, they’ve got a finely honed story blaming the Chinese and WHO and, since facts are not an issue, they can embellish at will.

Trump, saving Americans from both Covid-19 AND the Deep State keeping us in lock down.  Impugning huge swaths of people (Mexicans, Fake News Media, Democrats, handicapped) or individuals with his name-calling that every outlet dutifully reports.  The facts don’t matter - the story wins.  We’re falling into the same trap again, acting like bad tests and unreliable results mean anything when there’s a sociopath delivering falsehoods every night on TV.

Unless one tests in a lab the ability of one's antibodies to protect cells from infection, one doesn't know the true value (or the duration) of your immunity. Not all immune responses are protective or long lasting, and certainly should not be used, in isolation, as a basis for  deciding it's safe to behave as we did pre-COVID."

How many of us do not have antibodies to the annual flu, or to the head cold? Even right wing papers in Europe get it, for example Le Monde, 4.20.2020: ""Nous n’avons pas encore de preuve que les anticorps produits à la suite de l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 soient capables de le neutraliser."""

We also have idiotic protesters, fanned by right wing organizations, pushing for opening the economy when we have been informed of the need for more, massive, testing.
Opening the economy without testing capabilities will undoubtedly lead to meow infections and deaths.
I would like to know how many of the protesters are over the age of 60, a group with a very high death rate.
In addition we have a divisive President instead of a President who tries to unite the country. Trump is a moron and he and most of the GOP need to be voted out of office in November. The GOP is a fraud and a failure as a political organization."

2020-04-20 13:16:33,"Another problem is that scientists don't even know for sure if antibodies reflect immunity from Covid-19. Nor, how long antibodies remain in the bloodstream even if they are effective in creating immunity. In other words, is immunity temporary or permanent. And, without widespread testing of the presence of Covid-19 in those of us who are sick or asymptomatic antibody testing is a shot in the dark. We need widespread Covid-19 testing, isolation, and a vaccine in order to get back to our former ways of life."

The Chinese are 'willing to help' for a price (and to benefit from any resulting consternation).

Am I surprised that some of these new, rapid to market tests are not delivering as promised? Not at all. Am I surprised that unscrupulous souls are out to make a buck? C'mon now. 

Should the FDA be trying to ride herd on this circus? Surely. But they should not revert to previous form and stop the process from happening. They need to find quality - needles in this haystack of tests - and tell us about it ... now, now, now.

No pressure."
2020-04-20 13:32:18,"Whether a test is adequate depends on the use of the test. All tests have both false positives and false negatives. Driving down the false negative rate will increase the false positive rate. If you are testing nursing home workers (for virus to see if they are currently infected) you want a test with a very very low false negative rate. The price you pay for that is that you will reject some workers who are not infected. On the other hand, if your goal is to ascertain the prevalence of virus or antibodies in a population substantial false negative and positive rates can be tolerated because  you can obtain statistically valid readings using tests with known false positive and negative rates. In this case it can happen that the results for the individual are no better than coin tosses but the population estimate is valid. It's just like tossing a coin. You can't predict whether the next toss of a fair coin will be heads or tails, but you can predict that very close to half heads  and half tails will occur in a  large number of tosses."

The best benchmark for opening up society is hospital admissions (defined as at least ONE night stay in hospital).  Different areas will have different benchmarks for this.....this is the benchmark for curve flattening, which we were told was our main objective.

First, we want to build up herd immunity (google it).  By definition this means contracting the virus can be beneficial for society, if and only if, you don't get hospitalized or die.   Greater than 90% of the people that contract CV19 do NOT go to hospital or die; yes they may get sick and wish they were not born, but if they resolve the virus they should have immunity.....at some benchmark herd immunity may end this nightmare.   And if there is no immunity for this virus....turn out the lights, it's over."
2020-04-20 13:59:25,"A 'useful' test is only as good as the underlying 'true positive' prevalence in the population. All of you crying for immediate availability of tests need to understand that the disease must be present in large numbers to be predictably useful. The most useful test will be a high sensitivity and high specificity antibody test once a majority of Americans have the disease. Given that less than 1% of Americans have tested positive so far (and with an unknown asymptomatic population), we have YEARS to go at the current rate of infection for testing to become predictably useful. Positive or negative tests tell you almost nothing on an individual level when the true positive prevalence is low."

The tests used for the study were pretty accurate, and would have given a good estimate of Covid-10 prevalence IF the prevalence were higher.  However, only about 1.6% of the people tested were positive.  This means that a small rate of false positives, say 1%, would badly confound the results.   If, say,  25% or even 10% of the people were positive, the results would have been useful.   You need a very accurate test to get a good estimate of something rare."

Sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of a test which are based on the results you would get if testing a group of people all known to have the infection or all known to not have the infection before being tested with the particular test being assessed. For example, if 10 people who were confirmed to have COVID-19 using the best available test were re-tested using a new rapid test for a research study, and 9 out of 10 tested positive, the rapid test has a 90% sensitivity. This is different from using the test in real life on people whose disease status is unknown at the time of testing. For this situation, the positive predictive value is a more useful metric; the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested affects the odds that a positive test result means the person actually has the disease. 

Believing that test sensitivity and specificity are the odds a test correctly labels people positive or negative when testing a real population is a common error.

2020-04-20 15:24:30,"As a retired physician, let me explain the difference, uses, and limitations of antibody testing. Many articles written do not make it clear that there are two different types of antibodies that are being tested. They rise at different times with infection and have different significance

The two types of antibodies are IgM and IgG antibodies. Ig M is an an acute phase antibody that rises early in infection. It helps the body fight off the infection by drawing immune cells to the virus. It rises early in active infection and falls after the infection is resolved. IgM antibody testing can help a physician determine if an active infection is Covid-19. It can not identify asymptomatic carriers and will not identify someone early in his infection. Cultures are better for that. IgM does not confer long term immunity. It only indicates that someone has or recently had Covid-19.

IgG is the antibody that indicates a person is likely immune to infection. This antibody begins to rise 3 to 4 weeks after infection, peaks 6 weeks after infection, and persists, providing a person with immunity, usually long term immunity.

Antibody testing is most reliable when there is a high probability that the test will be positive because of false positives. If a test has 5% false positives and 5 of 100 people are truly positive, there will be about 5 false positives in the remaining 95 people. If 80% are true positives then only 1 of the remaining 20 people will likely have a false positive."

Amatuers in charge at every vital step of process"
2020-04-20 14:22:45,"We should investigate the middlemen or companies who brought these illegal, improper and useless test kits to us.  

China recently tightened the restrictions on exporting medical equipment and test kits due to exactly this kind of problems. Only with CDC approval, we shouldn't purchase any products from abroad.  Or go through proper channels to get decent quality antibody test kits. 

For example, CDC just approved the KN-95 masks from China, which is the equivalent to the N95 masks we use.  I am sure that CDC will approve other products from China.  If we need antibody test kits, we should purchase products only approved by CDC."

The fact that CDC and then FDA veered from one extreme of caution to the other, first in rejecting tests from WHO after its
original test kit's contamination;  then  insisting upon  development of its own tests;   finally   approving any number of unreliable test kits ""subject to authorization""   without actual certification are  severe
indictments  of  top rung decision makers. This doesn't take into account the artificial constraints on who should have been    tested in January.

This troubling level of managerial incompetence
must be fully understood. 

I am not yet convinced  no relationship exists between these
bad errors of judgement  and interference from the WH. One can easily imagine chains of politically driven e-mail demands made to FDA to speed up the availability of tests that are fast but whose reliability is unclear. Similarly, one could imagine at a much earlier stage of the chaotic WH response that use of a WHO test was not politically acceptable since it implied our country's dependence upon international agencies. 

It would be very useful for a group of journalists to dig into this issue.

Meanwhile could someone, anyone,   please tell trump that it's not just swabs that are needed?"
2020-04-20 15:58:26,"NYT, don't feed into this ""blame China"" narrative that Trump and GOP are promoting. Some gratuitous cheap shots like ""some made in China"" when reporting on over 90 test kits, can do a lot of damage and don't illuminate much of anything. The problem here is the decision to allow tests, wherever they may have come from, onto the market without the rigorous FDA review normally required. The problems now being seen are completely illustrative of why we rely on the FDA, as do other countries around the world, to set the standard."
2020-04-20 15:19:33,"This is great news for economics professors around the country. They will have a perfect example of the value of government regulation. 

For years, the Kesselheim and others in the New England Journal of Medicine and elsewhere have been showing how, when you cut back on FDA regulation, more drugs and devices get to market that harm people and have to be recalled. 

Now we'll have another textbook example to demonstrate the results of deregulating medical products."
2020-04-20 16:03:13,"The U.S. needs to test many more people, but won't be able to anytime soon. And test results include many false positives and negatives, so... Antibody tests are supposed to be important, but are also unreliable. The experts don't know if those who were infected will then become immune. The CDC is failing. The numbers out of China are way wrong. Hospitals are in dire shape, and the medical pros are at risk every single minute. Some states are partially reopening, many are not. Many people wear masks in public and physically distance themselves from others, yet many do not. States are doing a lot, need more federal help, but are not getting enough. And there's no way to know if a vaccine will ever be developed. Suffice it to say, there's no reason to be optimistic that this crisis will end any time soon."
2020-04-20 10:08:13,"The Trump administrations incompetence and abdication of their responsibilities is just breathtaking.  We are four months behind where we should be because our federal government has failed with Republican complicity. 

Now we wait for the states to catch up and do on their own what should have been done federally.  It didn’t have to be this way."
2020-04-20 10:00:57,"Well, it's certainly a hot mess, isn't it?

I had a cough beginning in late February, lasted 12 days, no other symptoms, which I have wondered about. With the current state of affairs there is NO way I'd trust a test that said I had antibodies. 

If and until we can actually trust such tests (which it seems to me would mean solid FDA approval) they are worse than useless. They are very dangerous."
2020-04-20 09:32:39,A glowing example of free enterprise insufficiently regulated.
2020-04-20 10:42:56,"The article says: “Germany, which has emerged as a model among Western democracies in its efforts to curb the spread of the virus, is pursuing one of the most ambitious antibody studies, striving to test its entire population. It is a leader in the technology, has made its own antibody tests and conducted extensive diagnostic screening from the beginning.”

One would think the “greatest country in the world” would be able to do that too. Isn’t this the job of the Federal government? It seems that nobody is really in charge of the Federal government."
2020-04-20 16:19:50,"We're being given the ""antibody"" story as a magic silver bullet. Every fetus has a collection of cells that are generic antibody cells. The first time you are exposed to a bacterial or viral infection and become sick, some of the cells morph into antibody cells specifically modified to attach to the (in this case) virus's receptors, blocking some or all from attacking normal cells. Some diseases' antibodies can provide lifelong or at least decades-long immunity to that particular virus. With some viruses, only short-term immunity of weeks or months is provided. In some cases antibodies can fight the active illness, but don't provide any immunity at all. There are at least 6 known strains in the coronavirus family that can infect humans (all being able to jump species boundaries as well). While Flu is caused by a variety of constantly-mutating versions of the Rhinovirus, the common cold is caused either by rhinoviruses or a very mild strain of a coronavirus, so every human has had many exposures to at least one coronavirus.  

With generations of antibodies to common cold coronavirus, we have seen NO immunity (who ever gets only one case of the common cold?). Nor, have we yet developed a vaccine, treatment or cure for the common cold. That's at one extreme. Smallpox, which was eradicated because an original weak cowbox virus supplied immunity, is at the opposite extreme. So far, long-term immunity, a preventive vaccine, treatment, and a cure for COVID have NOT been verified."
2020-04-20 16:28:35,"Another example of lack of responsibility and coordination from Trump's administration.  He claims ""total authority"" but offers nothing of value to states and citizens in great need, then rants against governors who don't open their states for lack of adequate testing.  So. Much. Winning."
2020-04-20 16:40:42,"I am beginning to see the promised bazillions of big, beautiful swabs as the strict equivalent of a thrown roll of paper towels."
2020-04-20 17:31:27,"“More than 90 companies have jumped into the market since the F.D.A. eased its rules and allowed antibody tests to be sold without formal federal review or approval.”
Among established companies there must be some charlatans, who are shamelessly seeking to sell snake oil, claiming their magic medicine had “formal” federal approval.  What happens if these antibody tests have adverse effects, that put vulnerable individuals to risk? 
In the past we read about class actions brought against pharmaceutical companies, accused of flouting FDA compliance. These companies had to pay millions or billions to settle lawsuits. 
If these vaccines cause deaths, could victims’ families hold the manufacturers to account? The FDA's process of approval had faced criticism in the past without a state of emergency in place like now."
2020-04-20 18:06:32,"We are on our own. 
The anti-science Executive has been effective in discrediting the government for being the problem by underfunding it. Unfortunately in a pandemic, we need the government to work which his unlikely, as the least competent are in charge given  US politics going through its ""celebration of ignorance"".  As Winston Churchill said - One can always rely on the Americans to come through, after they have tried all other options.  We are still at Option #1."

2020-04-20 19:36:29,"Ortho and Abbott both have antibody tests that can be run on automated analyzers at a rate of hundreds/analyzer per day.  We don't need to rely on tests from China or other countries.  What we do need is for hospitals with these analyzers to run these tests for the community, not for the health system or stand alone hospital.  We also need the FDA to have produced their template for performance that labs have been screaming for so that they can run in-house developed assays."
2020-04-20 18:49:34,"In an article in this paper published on April 6th, Elizabeth Rosenthal wrote that the CDC “was slow to react to a virus many knew was likely to come our way, The agency initially distributed the test kits like Senate seats-  equally to each state lab, rather than where they were most needed. Then the tests didn’t work.” On that same exact day, Redfield, head of the CDC,  appointed by Trump, announces, “If we just social distance, we will see this virus and this outbreak basically decline, decline, decline.”  Explain that to the loved ones of the 41,376 Americans who have died from Covid 19.

1.  The initial tests rolled out by the CDC were contaminated due to sloppy laboratory practices at their labs.
2. The virus spread like wildfire because for a full month, there was no nationwide detection program because of the bungled and inept response by the CDC.
3. Testing remains consistently unavailable.
4.  The CDC decided to leave hundreds of Americans on the Diamond Princess which then became the biggest source of coronavirus cases.
  Now we learn the FDA eased its rules and allowed antibody tests to be sold without formal federal reviews or approval.  Most of these tests are from China. Some have only a 20% accuracy rate.  Once again, the richest country on earth blunders its way, at the cost of precious American lives.

This is what happens when your goal is to drown government in a bathtub, and it is the Americans who are literally drowning."

2020-04-20 22:55:46,"I have to commend the NYtimes for this article. 

Most articles I read on this issue produce outright lies, for instance, death rates from the virus, if you see any number, it is false, since we have no clue how many people are actually positive, you cannot say the death rate is 3,4,6 or 11 or for that matter, 0.04% but the more we learn, the more we are heading toward the latter. 

Unlike other countries, we seem to have made it our goal to bash our government and the media handpicks countries to bash it. 

Articles such as Europe is better prepared and has socialized medicine to handle a crisis fails when you look at facts, most countries with a higher fatality rate per million are in Europe, including the U.K. France and Sweden. 

If you fell for the S. Korea is better off because they tested early and we are idiots, well, then explain why almost every Asian country has fared better, even places like Myramar, which has tested almost nobody and has the 2nd worst healthcare system in the World. 

Even this issue, antibody testing, articles attack our government but check out the BBC and as mentioned here, they carefully explain why the U.K. has none, the test are NOT reliable. 

The FDA approved tests because of attacks on them, not because the tests are good, we are to blame for that. 

I hate to sound so positive but the more testing we get, the more it looks like the fatality rate is rather low. 

We rightly pulled the big red handle but it may of been the wrong virus."
2020-04-20 21:51:53,"Sensible federal planning and action would have test and vaccine manufacturing capacity lined up, waiting for science to deliver, as it will inevitably do.  Current U.S. manufacturing capacity is not even close to adequate at the present.  

Trump and the feds should be lining up distilleries to convert to vaccine production now, in order to have capacity in place, ready to go when science delivers the only remedy for the economy.  

Does anyone believe that President Trump and his chain of fools are even thinking along these lines?  A very stable genius indeed!"
2020-04-21 02:21:02,"There's no other way to proceed with the antibody tests than the one provided in Germany where they are under University supervision like in Munich run by the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at Munich University Hospital and financed by the state of Baviera or nationally under the Robert Koch Institute, the government’s central scientific institution in the field of biomedicine. That in U.S. the FDA lets the market rule the distribution and use of these particular tests is frankly mind-blogging."
2020-04-17 22:20:30,"In general, as a physician, I agree that we have an obligation to treat patients. If this was a natural disaster, I would be happy to come out of retirement if I thought I could be of some use. However, this is a disaster that keeps going because of federal, local, and administrative failures. To put your health and life on the line because someone, who is likely not a doctor or nurse, has put profit, ignorance, politics, or lack of attention first and then left workers without proper PPE, the moral duty is gone. Doctors are increasingly not involved in important ways about disaster preparedness. Our federal government has completely failed. For their failures, you most certainly should not risk your life, health, and the family around you. 

Let’s keep in mind how doctors were treated before Covid. Challenged by something read on Google, insisting the patient knows better, and all the time complaining doctors make too much money. These are the very same people that cheer on million dollar bonuses paid on Wall Street. Really? Your heart surgeon makes too much?

Let’s use this time to get doctors to take back control from administrative committees and actually practice medicine."
2020-04-18 00:05:26,"You need a union, a tough, ruthless, relentless union that will stand up to the hospital administrators who think of you as cannon fodder and that will put the fear of God into the miserable politicians who have placed you in harm's way."
2020-04-18 14:06:57,"These doctors' dilemma strikes me as a bit disingenuous or at the very least lacking in thoughtfulness and insight.  First of all there are plenty of ways that physicians who are not trained in adult pulm/ICU can contribute to the overall effort to not only combat COVID-19 but continue to provide care for the many other patients with urgent medical needs.  For example, they can do telehealth screening. They can take care of non-ICU patients under the supervision of a hospitalist, essentially functioning like ""super residents'.  These don't even have to be COVID-19 patients. They could be patients being admitted with congestive heart failure or need for acute dialysis or cancer patients receiving necessary chemotherapy.  No one is saying they have to put in central lines all by themselves.    We are graduating med students early to let them join in this effort, and many students have actively pushed to do this.  Are you telling me that these 2 MDs know less than a med student who hasn't even finished all 4 years of med school?   There are healthcare workers risking their lives every day to care for patients with COVID-19.  Many have been redeployed from their usual job, and many have willingly volunteered to do so.  Certainly, if there is a safety issue, e.g. a lack of PPE, that would be an understandable reason to not want to serve, but not what these 2 MDs have described."
2020-04-18 16:54:56,"I am an operating room nurse. I completed my NP degree but cannot test as the centers are closed. However, the OR staff are being deployed to other areas of the hospital when countless of us have not worked bedside nursing in many years. We are told that 'a nurse is a nurse' and that anyone can work bedside. It's not true. The amount of moral distress is beginning to overwhelm the OR staff. When restrictions are lifted and surgeons begin doing elective cases again who will come to our rescue? No one, because our line of work is so specialized."
2020-04-18 15:34:15,"Physicians and nurses are trained in the belief that they have a “duty to serve”. Sadly, hospital leaders have no commensurate duty to protect their people.  Imagine if these administrators were held to the same standards as military leaders, who view protecting their soldiers as among their most sacred duties.  

Hospitals have sold out their health care professionals for higher profits, and were underprepared for this pandemic.  They should have been stockpiling PPE and establishing backup vendors.  Every single hospital has a disaster response plan (as required by law).  In reality, these plans are likely developed by a health care professional and then drastically underfunded by management.  This would be a good topic for a follow-up story."

2020-04-20 14:22:20,"This excellent article demonstrates why government coercion does not work. Here in San Diego, California many thousand of people are out shopping for the millions of stay at home people. They are all having close contact with each other not to mention store employees. They could then bring the virus to the homes of millions of stay at home people. This has not happened because the virus is not a significant threat here at least statistically. People are losing faith in their governments because they see the cure for fighting the virus is far more damaging to society than the cure."
2020-04-20 14:46:55,"I spent time in Japan last fall and noticed even then that so many people wear face masks.  I'm curious about the spread of the virus there and whether or not that, in fact, helped keep the number of infections lower than in other major cities.  The article states that around 10,000 people in the entire country have the virus, which seems low.  Is the widespread use of face masks a reason?"
2020-04-20 15:05:28,"I am extremely intrigued by the question of did the face masks really help prevent the spread? 10,000 people is a not as many as I would have expected, could this low number be due to the face masks?"

2020-04-20 16:49:41,"Thank you for this look into a city that I know and love. My company sent me to Tokyo for a couple of years, several decades ago. I lived three or four stops from Shinjuku, along the central line. I would have expected Japan to take the pandemic in stride. We mustn't romanticize things. All the same, I remember a marked sentiment and emphasis among my friends, colleagues and neighbors that the individual must act in line with the wellbeing of the group. When folks failed to do so, others would remind them, formally or informally. That said, Tokyo and its life patterns have a vibrant brilliance that I have discovered nowhere else. I will never stop missing it. How painful it must be for the residents of Tokyo to give that all up, and socially isolate themselves."
2020-04-20 15:28:53,As everyone likely Japanese people wear masks to protect others when they're ill. But some people wear them just to feel more anonymous or comfortable in the crowd. Some ladies wear them to keep from getting harassed on public transportation. And some people wear them as a fashion accessory. I think that's pretty cool.
2020-04-20 15:44:11,"Abe’s response has been wispy-washy as Trump’s if not worse. The video he posted on a popular media shows him sitting at home (presumably) sipping tea and “relaxing.” Japan has so long been cuddled (or brainwashed?) into thinking that “O-kami (the higher up, who or whatever that may be) will take care of us,” that most people don’t feel the threat of the virus as keenly as we do here where we have to take care of ourselves. And while I’ve been reading in the Japanese media that most consider the government’s action as having come too late, if the government says it’s okay for restaurants and bars to stay open until 8pm, it must be safe to go there until 8pm. That’s the kind of thinking that goes on there."
2020-04-20 22:58:01,"Thank you so much for this article which seems to me to be the most clear and accurate report of the situation in Japan I have read so far. I live in the south of Japan in a very rural area where there are as yet no reported cases of the virus. People are doing their best to cope with the situation, but many people are just living in a fantasy world where they imagine that everything will be okay. As a foreigner here with most of my support network overseas, it is terrifying. We are often seen as paranoid freaks annoyingly interfeering with the otherwise peaceful and mostly harmonious society.
I sure hope for all of our sakes that we are wrong, and that Japan is indeed cloaked in some kind of mysterious protective shell akin to an anime movie. Time will tell. Stay safe and please everyone, try to be kind to others."
2020-04-20 23:58:37,"Instead of easy to write and report snapshots, is it too much to hope for a detailed look at much deeper questions, such as how and why the Abe regime, the Japanese mass media and the inept political opposition, all at various levels of denial, failed to clarify to the public the impact of COVID-19.  

For Japanese, this is not a story that began a few months ago. It began when the grandfather of the current PM, an accused war criminal, was sprung from prison by the postwar American occupation regime, which wanted, and got, a succession of business-friendly, anti-left wing governments. The American money that funded the right, and helped Abe's father become PM, came in large part from the CIA, during both Republican and Democrat administrations, as former Times reporter Tim Weiner's superb book, Legacy of Ashes, made clear.

Follow those tracks, and all the Japanese problems of today, and their links to still ongoing American influence, will become much clearer."

Police need to social distance from each other but who is there to give cops a summons for not social distancing . Every police officer should solo in there own patrol car, police should also be using citizen volunteers to patrol  their own neighborhoods in their own automobiles and reporting any trouble to a dispatch number . It’s not really rocket science. The problem is every police station just like every hospital is trying to figure things out on their own. The federal government could have come up with procedures to put into place to help out, but the federal government has dropped the ball on a lot of things.

While slamming Democrats for holding up legislation to fight for aid to municipalities to support their first responders on the front lines. Now and post pandemic.

One of the most poignant moments recently was 9/11 first responders cheering on pandemic healthcare workers. We know something of the 9/11 responders' long term wounds of their service. They know what today's first responders are facing. Many first responders are fighting to have their work classifications changed so that if they die then their survivors will be eligible for benefits. Just as they give us their all. We need to give them more than lip service.

In response, Detroiters need to control their criminal impulses in this time of trouble, patrol their own neighborhoods safely, call in illegal weapons to the authorities if they know people who have them, and generally become bigger citizens who rely more on themselves when government gets stressed."
2020-04-20 16:52:43,"My hometown has suffered for years, and seeing the current infection rates and deaths is just heartbreaking. 

We were lucky and didn't need the police when I was growing up there, but always said ""hi"" when we'd see them. They have a very hard job that they have embraced with pride, and not a large salary. 

We need more TESTS. We need antibody tests. I'm glad the police are getting them, healthcare workers should be next. 

But not having enough tests for the general population means a slower opening, with more uncertainty and anxiety. 

I'm glad our Governor Whitmer has pushed for more assistance on getting tests from the federal government. Forcing states to compete & bid against other states for the limited tests available means their budget shortfalls will  be greater. And that will be true whether the state is governed by Democrats or Republicans."

At this time, while documenting the changes in our city and region due to the pandemic, I've been surprised to see that Seattle cops rarely wear masks or PPE of any kind, whether socializing with other cops, or breaking up fights at homeless encampments.
Their public information office assured me that they have enough masks to go around, but that the wearing of PPE is left to the discretion of individual officers.
The somewhat cavalier attitude of our street cops is undercut by this devastating article, but I fear the most POs are not paying attention to the NY Times. This should be the lede of every police blotter in the country."

Our Governor Bullock locked down the sate with only 400 cases of Covid and ten deaths.  These two Governors are courageous.  Gov. Rick DeSentis, in Florida, has 25,000 cases and who knows how many deaths?  Instead of enforcing a lock down, his feeble mantra is ""Let's Party!""  Is he deranged? Or criminally culpable?"

Rather than Trump and his cohorts/cronies asking right wing folks to protest for opening the economy in certain blue states, there should be more efforts for testing, contact tracing, and antibody testing. 

Blaming China and WHO won't resolve the pandemic crisis in US and western europe. Trump is entering into the dead end of realpolitik and his infatuation for second term presidency is hurting states enormously. US needs a leader with a stature/acumen of JFK, Bill Clinton, Obama even Bush junior would have done excellent job in such challenging situation.

I saw a widely circulated photo of Cramer’s show where on one panel it stated that the week in question was the best week since 1938 for the stock market. On the lower panel it stated that more than 16 million Americans lost their jobs in 3 weeks. This was all in the same photo. I recently got a 20% reduction in my own salary.

He also said people should start buying. We know not to trust the President, nor the people around him. I don't trust or distrust markets, only some of the people behind them.

If they sink below 0% as some have suggested, then we are in for a deflationary spiral as Japan where stocks never recovered from the 1980s.  Its a tricky path and stocks (based on p/e) were far overpriced to begin with before the virus and it will be extremely difficult to surmount the carnage and borrowing that has already occurred.  Investors should be extremely cautious."

Airline companies, hotels, and restaurants are losing money faster than anytime in history. There is a ripple effect as people lose jobs, they spend less money. People with jobs are fearful for their jobs and resort to caution and they spend less money. In my opinion, this spending reduction is going to create an economic contraction for 12-24 months. The stock market is in denial."

2020-04-20 19:07:55,"I’ve believed the markets were significantly overvalued for a very long time.  Relying on the Shiller CAPE P/E this market was overvalued well over a year ago.  At the bottom of the recent crisis-related losses, the market was at least getting somewhat closer to a fair realistic value.  But in my judgment that was not even considering the Coronavirus.  

The absurdity of this recent rally is readily apparent to all but the dimmest people alive.  The prices are preposterous, absurd, perhaps even insane.  Having said that, as Shiller has pointed out and for those of us who spent decades investing in them know, it’s a fool’s errand (at least for nearly everyone) to time the market.

How many are going to run out to restaurants to spend $30.00-50.00 on a meal?  How many are going to feel anything close to ""affluent"" in the near term?

2020-04-20 19:29:25,"I know as much as anyone else, which is to say, very little.

I will say, though, that the real mortality rate for COVID-19 by one measurement is quite a bit higher than the 1% or so that's been bandied about.

That's according to Worldometer, and counts only cases that had an outcome (i.e. when all is said and done, the patient either got well or they died.) Because you don't estimate the disease's ultimate death rate by measuring it against all cases including e.g. people who just got diagnosed yesterday.

By that measurement (and there are arguments to be made for whether it's accurate or not) the death rate is more like 20%.

I imagine that if/when that figure becomes more broadly acknowledged, markets are going to have something to say about it."

Prevailing interest rates in the US up to 10 years in duration are all hovering around 0%.  The Federal Reserve has injected trillions into the capital market.  I would think both interest rates and liquidity can only tighten.  And while the Fed recharges its monetary ammunition, the federal government is running multi-trillion deficits this year. Not the best time to be optimistic of a bull market.

To paraphrase the Joker's insight into it only taking one bad day to reduce a sane man to lunacy, the market is one bad news cycle from halving or worse. The only reason prices have temporarily leveled off is cheap money. Investors with cash would sooner risk loosing it than earn less than 1% annual interest.

This is not the average investor or retiree.

The stock market is not the economy. The stocks can swing up or down overnight on the whiff of a profit or a risk. The economy is a much slower ship to turn.

Unless the consumer has a lot more faith in the future, they'll keep their money in the mattress or leave it in whatever investments they may have.

SO what we're seeing now is speculation by people betting with other people's money."

If you have been investing all your life and play the buy and hold game then you are OK and don't need to panic now or later. You understand risk and for 50 years you have been making money. 

So no, now is not the time to buy new shares of anything.

IF you have a lot of tax to pay for whatever reason sell some stocks now cause the market will go lower."
2020-04-20 19:46:05,"Our Keynesian system was designed when loans drove the economy. (Remember ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ with James Stewart?) The whole business of lowering the Fed rate and quantative easing was to help banks drive the economy. But that’s not the way it is any more. Banks are no longer banks but complex entities. When they get money from the govt in the form of QE, they invest it in financially engineered instruments that maximize ROI. People don’t get that money any more. That’s why there is no inflation despite pumping trillions into the ‘economy’ - the money is NOT going into the economy. It seems too many dollars are only chasing equities. That also explains why the stock market skyrockets-the inflation we see is in the equities markets ( I am being simple here - it’s not just equities but ALL financial markets). Unless we move the Fed into the 21st century, the old tools will only help those who know how to speculate in the market as the real economy stagnates. The Fed needs to deliver money DIRECTLY into the hands of the people who will spend it. People who need housing, people who need clothing, people who need food. Why do we continue to feed those addicted to avarice ?"

This is the normal state of affairs for the market, you cannot time the markets. That being said not all stocks are created equal. This not a good time to buy stocks that are dependent on large groups of people. Think cruises, airlines, hotels.  
However consider Netflix, Amazon, and others that will benefit from the current state of affairs..
But some investors favor a contrarian approach and will prefer specifically those beaten down stocks.
So, no, the markets are not a suckers game, no, they are not only or the elite and ultra rich, but you must have some risk tolerance and not bet the farm on it."
2020-04-20 19:58:05,"No. Even the Fed cannot defend the world wide depression. Saudi and Russia have declared war on our domestic energy industry at the same time that the virus is decimating the engines of the economy in major cities.
This is deflation by classic definition. Even if the Fed keep some prices propped up, they cannot stop demand destruction.
The ""price"" of stocks may stay at a give level, but  purchasing power will be cut dramatically in the aggregate. If the Fed reflates the economy and prices go up, but stock prices stay the same, then you lose. Assets will decline in value and only cash will be king unless the Fed goes to negative interest rates and negative deposit terms. The only solution lies in a 10 week assault on the virus, supported by overwhelming testing and massive containment measures.
Unfortunately, Trump thinks only of himself. He is sacrificing our treasure and lives for his desire to fool enough people ( same fools) to get elected again.  I don't think it can hold.
This is is Herbert Hoover moment."

Rest assured stock prices probably have another massive spike down before the green light goes on for the little people to jump in.  The danger is for ""market timers"" who like to play dangerously for incremental gains on the upside.  Playing the downside (shorting) is always dangerous.  If by some miracle, TRUMP gets another four years the equity market will go sky high.  When all's said and done, buy good companies and stick around and you're bound to make a few dollars."

2020-04-20 20:02:46,"Non investing professionals should consider the following before entering or exiting the equity market at present.

1- Valuations are priced for a quick recovery AND significant bailouts of corporations. Will the latter happen in an election year?

2- The equity markets benefit from the perception that interest rates will be at or near ZERO for the forseeable future. Remember equities are subject to supply and demand and in recent years the supply has declined (due to buy backs). The important point here is that with rates so low, the ONLY liquid place to put money and earn a return is the stock market. 

3- Inequality. Some people have so much money that they can make highly speculative bets on markets going up. They can afford to lose this money. Can you?

4- Professional investors (asset managers) in many cases have perverse incentives. In many cases, it is better for them to lose investors money than it is for them to ""miss"" market gains. This is because they are benchmarked against their peers and investors punish managers for missing the benchmark. 

FWIW, I spent over 20 years in banking and asset management. My money is in cash, gold, and real estate."

Can it see the arrival of a 2nd or even 3rd wave of Covid-19 infections, especially if we prematurely ""re-open our economy""? (Watch Singapore.)

Our stock markets (Dow 30 and SP 500) seem rather impervious at the moment to the growing unemployment rates and lack of earnings from shut-down businesses. And the consequent lack of GDP growth. 

At the State-level, many will soon be harshly tested to meet public service payroll and pension obligations due to falling tax collections and rising unemployment benefits payments. 

Given our already ballooning national debt of $24.5 trillion, most of the new stimulus spending will only cause our debt and service burden to worsen. (Republicans are promiscuous in raising our debts and deficits so democrats can raise taxes to meet our payment obligations.)

I believe right now our markets are artificially sustained by computer programmed trading that look for small arbitrage opportunities and also by day traders. (A very rich colleague in self-isolation at home engages in day trading to make even more money during this crisis. ""Every crisis is a $$$ opportunity."")

When the 2nd quarter GDP numbers arrive in early July, we will know the extent of our economic damage. 

Let's see where our market indexes would be then?

Dow 15,000 anyone? (I won't wager!)"

2020-04-20 20:31:02,"What has become clear over the past several years is that that the Stock Market has 'decoupled' from economics.  It is simply an electronic casino.  This has been in the making once Wall Street realized governments (primarily the US) are not going to let companies fail.  In addition, stocks are an easy way for the public to invest money in an environment of extremely low interest rates.  Also, investing in the stock market is in effect by  government legislation through tax incentives in retirement plans (IRA, 401K's, SEP's etc).  The last of the Middle Class is heavily invested.

However, eventually investor money needs to go *somewhere,* so the broader market seems likely to bounce back to at least some extent.  The question is what to hold.  My pre-covid strategy included pretty tried-and-true criteria.  Hold quality names with (1) proven performance, (2) long-term potential and (3) solid management teams.  I might now add to that list “balance sheets that can weather a storm,” but that pretty much goes along with the others on the list.  The only part of the equation an investor can control is what s/he holds: everything else is speculation and gambling."

Invariably, the cabdriver had plenty of investment tips and thoughts to share. 

Last week, my millennial niece “told” me which stocks I should consider investment on. To be clear, she does not have a broker account.

Invest at your on risk, but it is clear that the risk return ratio is completely unbalanced at the moment. There is no rational positive side to counter balance all the uncertainties.

""I was 21 and looking for work in 1932, one of the worst years of the Great Depression. And I can remember one bleak night in the thirties when my father learned on Christmas Eve that he'd lost his job.

Ronald Reagan

John Steinbeck 

""In the Great Depression in which I grew up and remember vividly, unemployment was over 25 percent, and over 35 percent where I lived. A grown man would work all day, 16 hours, for a dollar. I remember hundreds of people walking by, people who had come down from the North just to get warm. They would come to our house as beggars even though they might have a college education. People didn't have money. They bartered; they'd trade eggs or pigs. It was just completely different.""

It's always been the case; it always will be.

The United States economy is in deep trouble, not just because of  quarantine disruption, but also the government reluctant to address the fiscal side of the crisis in an election year. The cost of this crisis has to be borne today, or it will become a debtors’ prison for the nation tomorrow.

Nor is that the only problem. China’s rise to economic superpower status has been fuelled by US deficit spending, and this liquidity splurge to solve a problem they gave us in the first place might be a fatal overdose."

No."
2020-04-20 21:16:13,"No.  Stocks are supposed to be priced based on current and future earnings.  The economy is frozen, everything is shut down, current earnings are dismal.  Even if the future earnings recover to the pre-crisis expectations by let's say end of 2020 (which they will certainly not), there is no way that the prices should be merely ~15% below from where they were a couple of months ago.  This is an artificial prop, the result of a massive gov't stimulus and people's focus on the hopes for the beginning of the end of the epidemic.  As soon as people start focusing on actual earnings, this will go much lower."

One can't trust any speculator, day trader, broker, or anyone who plays with other people's money to tell the truth since they have nothing else to do but eek out a living. Best to trust one's instincts to sell and sit on cash pending the resolution of this pandemic. They may even want to cash out completely keeping their cash close at hand and not in gov't bonds in their brokers' hands."
2020-04-20 21:21:51,"Not an investors rally, it is the rally of FED, day trader's and algorithms. That is a bubble bound to explode soon when real valuations lead to significant P/E corrections. Trump's FED is quite irresponsibly trying to avoid a collapse at least until the election by simply printing money and purchasing whatever junk is out there. However, the valuations are so out of sync with reality and so inflated very soon the FED will be forced to print even more money to support the markets, which would lead to even more inflated assets, serious inflation, and risk $ credibility in the international market. Alternatively, they will let the markets approximate the historical P/E which in the current context would indicate a significant downturn given that the E(earnings) will be terrible. The problem is that Trump is well aware that if he chooses the latter path, which he should if he cares about the future of the country, it is likely that he'll lose the election. In any given year no sane president and not even Trump would not follow the first course of action, but unfortunately it is an election year. So, the bubble will keep growing until it bursts. It will hurt bad as at some point the reality of the current economy will catch up. I hope this happens soon and before the election, for obvious reasons, and before the FED prints more and more and mortgage our kids future."
2020-04-20 21:26:20,"The stock market is no longer a fair game.  The Fed has put its thumb on the scale.  No, the Fed, the elephant in the room, has sat on it, and the Fed's wallet is bottomless.

The Fed's objective was to return the massive bond market to normal function.  It had begun to lock up, spreads were widening substantially and off-run issues were being shunned.  Financial market participants were selling anything they could get their hands on to raise cash and meet margin calls.

The Fed also sought to restore liquidity to the credit markets.  Everyday economic activity requires free flowing credit markets of all sorts.

Since Feb. 26th the Fed has injected $2.2 trillion into the financial system by buying US Treasury securities.  These injections increased substantially on the week ended Mar. 18th.  The market bottomed on the 23rd.

The size of the recent injections is massive, particularly given the short time scale.  These bond purchases have displaced private capital.  There are very few places in the world where one can park a couple of trillion on short notice.  I believe that many of the participants that sold bonds to the Fed turned around and invested those proceeds into the stock market.

The media has struggled to give a credible explanation of the recent stock market rise in the face of the cratering of the US economy and elsewhere.  We are entering a depression.

The Fed needs to step off the gas before a massive bubble that can destroy the financial system develops."

Universal health care free at the point of use is a good idea, and so is an industrialisation renaissance in America. Neither party will have both policies, if they even have one."

2020-04-20 23:01:53,"Few comments address the retiree's situation. If like me you experienced the 2008 debacle, and cashed out too late rather than holding indefinitely, you lost a lot of money. 
I cashed out my conservative allocation fund on 2/27 and lost a relatively small amount compared to its recent high. I couldn't have stood the anxiety of seeing the fund drop 12% and then rebound (for no reason) to -2%. I made the right choice for me. I'm also somewhat soothed by the fact I do not have to make my annual required withdrawals from my IRA for 2020. 
I made an average 6% these last five years, and will only make 0.6% while it sits in a federal money market (another commentator pointed out that perhaps it should not be invested in gov't securities at all); CDs would earn only 1.5% interest.
Of course, there is no wisdom when to get back in, or not at all. When you're in your 70's, at somewhat hi-risk for severe COVID-19, the next 5-10 years is indeterminate."

The market is clearly overvalued.  Just looking at the unemployment numbers tells us that this will be more of U shaped recovery than a V.

Of course, we can't see into the future, but there are key indicators that always tend to repeat themselves in some form or another.  And here we are talking about a global halt to our world economy.  This is unprecedented.  Corporations were foolish in the bull market and the fed have no lifelines left.  And yet, we are still in the middle of this thing.  There is a great image you can find online called the ""psychology of a market cycle""  It shows the various stages of a market bubble.

Bill Maher publicly hoped for a recession for that same reason. It's seems that that's the Democratic strategy.  I'm neither Republican nor Democrat. I jut don't think economic suicide, racism, tribalism, or any other heinous strategy should ever be in anyone's toolbox. You don't have to tell us again, and again, and yet again the markets are unpredictable and unreliable indicators or things to come. They're operated by guesswork. We all know that.

I’m not religious, but when I listen to “Mache dich mein Herze rein,” or his violin concertos, or the cello suites, it connects me to creation itself (Douglas Adams would have agreed with me!).

The first two weeks of quarantine I listed to NPR and watched news coverage. Then I started listening to classical music via Amazon Echo instead, from the time I woke up until starting work remotely.

Bach is the main musician I have been listening to (Vivaldi next). Now I will listen to her performances, learn more and be appreciative of belonging to a global audience who is also tuned in to Bach as well."

2020-04-28 12:59:52,"Of all the recordings of these pieces, this is certainly one of the most emotionally satisfying. And of course, we find ourselves in an emotionally fraught period; Ms. Weilerstein’s playing transcends our time and place, as Bach’s music should.

There have been many superb interpretations of the Bach Suites, from Pablo Casals, Yo-Yo Ma, Pierre Fournier (my favorite), Paul Tortellier, Rostropovich, Janos Starker, others. This new recording is certainly among the greats."
2020-04-20 16:11:10,"Speaking as a determined collector looking to add unusual religious and ethnic antiques to my collections, I will be happy to make the adjustment to bidding at online only auctions. Despite taking a hit in my real estate business due to the coronavirus crisis, I am hopeful that there may be some online bargains out there now.  The passion and obsessive nature of collecting has not diminished even in this present crisis."
2020-04-20 17:37:51,"Yes, things may change because of the current pandemic, though I've a feeling such pronouncements are rather premature. Regardless, what won't change is the ridiculous. bordering-on-obscene auction prices for art. The very thought of Van Gogh's paintings selling for hundreds of millions - trinkets for the rich -  while the poor artist could barely afford to feed himself at the end of his life sickens me.  The art world is up in arms about a marketing adjustment when, in fact, what it deeply requires is a moral adjustment. But I doubt Covid-19 can change that."

They've rolled back countless environmental regulations, divided us from other nations, refused to offer student loan debt relief, and done nothing but play servant to big corporations (AKA old, straight, white men). 

My peers and I are trying to survive - we are trying to build an America which we believe in and which believes in us. And now the biggest public health crisis of the last 100 years has come along and we are being led into destruction. Because people are angry. Because they are selfish. Because our so-called ""leader"" is more concerned with his current reputation than his legacy (which will be tragic). 

I am begging you to please do the right thing. To stay united. To VOTE BLUE in November - no matter what. Please give me a fighting chance. Give my generation a chance. We are not asking for anything other than a chance."

Instead, those of us who have the ability to work at home (as I'm sure this Harvard economist has) should donate what we can to essential workers, and fight for their health and economic protections."
2020-04-18 19:04:24,"Thank you for this long and thorough review. It answered many questions for me.

The great danger seems to be our political divide.  I'm fearful of the ignorance displayed in the photos of rampaging survival types with automatic weapons, as much as I am of the virus. I feel that this article needs a last paragraph assessing the danger that the virus will be the catalyst for the revolution these people have been preparing for. Is it possible to just move all Republicans to Texas, where they're free to roam and gallop?"

But it’s much safer, and easier, and newsworthy to talk about “our doleful future.” If our experts and politicians cannot come up with practical things that we can do now that let us start going about our lives, it will be taken out of their hands. People and businesses will just get back to it."

We are at about 38,000 recorded deaths and well over 700K recorded cases as I write this, so those who think 60,000 fatalities is the likely end point are dreaming (yes, even you cited that 60,000 number Dr. Fauci). Bill Maher opined last night that Americans crave hope and optimism and that Mr. Trump could even ride to reelection on that white steed. Heaven help us.

Isn't that how it's supposed to go?
I said those very words to my more religious, conservative friends who have tended to Trump's prime marks.  A very sober minded friend became very silent.  That language made sense to him.  I have yet to see him.  So far as I know, he is still okay.

What will the outcome be?  Whatever we want it to be, within the parameters dictated by this virus, and the rules of science.  
I suspect some will become victims to what they've been conned into believing.  Those who come out the other end of this alive will perhaps have more faith, but act according to what is known for sure.

We will become a techno-agrarian civilization.  Those who can work from behind a computer will have better home offices, with technology to support their work. The Cloud will grow digitally and perhaps shrink in terms of air pollution.  Teachers will learn how to  create captivating lessons for their students, using all of the digital tools at their disposal and yet to come.  A talented teacher will make a decent living, providing compelling online classes to subscribers.  Universities will trade expensive tuition, room and board for online courses that are made available to everyone with broadband.  Tuition will drop to a subscription fee.  Schools will flourish.  Humanity will become better educated.  The human brain trust will grow and we will create the means to adapt to an ever changing planet and species."
2020-04-18 19:24:54,"When it comes to restarting the economy , it is never brought up that of the three main places it is the most likely that you are to catch a contagious disease , two of the three remained open. Grocery stores and public transportation. Schools, the main source of viral transmission thankfully are closed. Grocery stores by their very nature spread virus around a community , while mass transit is a quick way to get infected. It took fast food restaurants and delivery services a surprisingly long time to protect their workers from the general public and vice a versa. It took on average about a month for all the essential business that remained open to get up to speed . The businesses and plants that are shut have had plenty of time to make things safe for their workers , that’s the real challenge, to make it safe both for workers and customers. Any business must be made to show local
Government how they have adapted to the situation. You just can’t reopen like nothing has happened . Workers must know things are safe or no go. It is up to local unions to insure this safety . Adequate spacing of working areas, staggering shifts , rules about not coming to work sick . This is not like coming back to work after a hurricane , this is coming to work during a pandemic and everything has to change. Everything has to be safe."
2020-04-18 19:26:18,"This is an excellent piece and is the kind of investigative reporting that is confined to ever fewer media and journalistic resources.   The article makes it clear that given the complexity of the challenge at hand, connecting all the dots from start to finish cannot be done as there are so many unknowns in terms of our knowledge and the course that events and behaviors will take over the near term.  
I suppose, many folks are engaging in a degree of wishful thinking that cannot be supported with the facts unless Jesus shows up with a miracle so we can get busy again."
2020-04-18 19:32:08,"I'm at a complete loss as to why the Times says that we have 60,000 deaths, and the Univ. of Washington model predicts over 100,000 by mid-summer - the Times calls this good news.  We are in the middle of the highest death toll we've ever had from the virus - 250 people per day are dying.  This is close to 10,000 per month.  We see many people out on the streets in warmer weather, and none of them wearing masks or practicing social distancing.  We know that it looks like a plateau has been reached, but how long will we stay on this plateau?  With everyone talking about how the curve has bent through social distancing, there are many calls to relax at the height of the pandemic, at the plateau we are on.  Why is it that the writers of this article do not think we will hit the 100,000?"
2020-04-18 19:34:11,"Nice article. But largely ""more of the same"". 

A vaccine is needed but it will take time. Probably more time than we hope for. It is NOT known for how long a vaccine will protect you. People think ""long"" or ""forever"". For flu, the answer is that after 120 days (that's 4 months) the vaccine becomes ineffective. The German government has estimated that (natural) immunity to this Corona virus will last for 6-18 months.

This means, even the people who have had it and recovered, they can get it again in one year from now.

As a simple scientist, I say that we need to find out who can get the disease without getting very sick. More and more evidence is appearing that many people can get this and not even know that they have it. 

Once you infect ~60-70% of the population, hopefully many that won't get sick, or have mild illness, and all those people will become immune to infection, the virus will disappear from the population. 

It seems to be the only feasible path forward. And yet again ""20 experts"" have been consulted by the NYT and this concept isn't really visible. 

The traditional US approach of getting a pill is not likely to work (fast or reliable enough). The approach of getting a vaccine will be too slow. Permanent lock down will cause unbearable economic damage.

The US needs to catch up (!) with the rest of the world. Maybe, in my dream, take the lead.  Where are the leaders?"
2020-04-18 19:34:29,"Nature smiles when humans back off.

As you imply, this pandemic is a small warning of the colossal pandemic facing us next, and right away: climate breakdown.

It will require a completely different reality: de-growth. Man up to it!"
2020-04-18 19:37:41,"Excellent reporting. America should know there is no magic elixir waiting around the corner. Let those who are practicing what has been preached (washing your hands, social distancing, wearing a mask) continue to do so. And may government officials give us straight, honest information so we can work to ease the situation.
And let's hope the machismo in the minority screaming to be heard can understand what you perceive as your personal liberty is inconsequential compared to the health and safety of others. Especially those health care workers who are today's heroes."
2020-04-18 19:42:46,"Brilliant reporting as usual.

What worries me most from this article is the idea that schools may be opened sooner rather than later.  This sounds more to me like another hammer, rather than any kind of dance.  

Since the Fox ""doctors"" are saying a 2-3% death rate would be acceptable given the importance of education, I hope school leaders proceed very cautiously.  These are children -- our future!  

If and when they do decide to re-open, they should try to think outside the box and find ways to make class sizes smaller and to decentralize learning environments.  Maybe they could use empty restaurants or retail stores to widely disperse students and classrooms, which might help out all concerned.

In the meantime, the blue skies and wildlife are indeed a side benefit, one we can all enjoy and work to protect.  Americans now know what ""flattening the curve"" is all about.  Maybe global warming can be the next curve we can all work on together to flatten."

This makes yesterday's tweets by the president all the more harrowing, dangerous, and ignorant. Encouraging this kind of insurrection and the gathering of a mob of armed protesters sounds criminal to me. If it isn't it should be. I would like to encourage my fellow Americans to not heed the horrible and possibly deadly advice of Donald Trump and instead be safe and protect yourself and your family.

The ingenuity of no strategy or planning for public health emergencies?  That ingenuity?  Oh please, just stop it.

I know I'm going to view fellow employees, the workplace,and physical points of contact (phones, keyboards, desks, chairs, etc) as my new enemy. Clients too. The break-room is off limits now, I'm not gathering in there, unless they're handing out bundles of cash, and even if, it would be a dash-in-out.

I'm not gonna go back to maybe stopping at store Y, on the way home, to see if that jacket, etc is on sale. Don't need it! 

I'm only going into the supermarket, which are not so super anymore, when I must, and not to just to grab a craving item, or change my dinner plans, or get some extra X. Don't need 'em. I'll stick my meal plans. Even if its just tuna salad on crackers. 

And I expect that many people are feeling the same, and will be very reluctant to return to the pre-Covid ""normal"". In fact, of the friends I have been talking to thru this, ALL feel that a shift has occurred for them, and that they, and I, must make changes in our own lives, and not expect, or rely on, a general public shift to take place and carry us all along. Its about us, making small and some large changes...that is hoped will become a thing in the larger population. 

If not, then we have done our personal work. Which is what matters most.

I'm fortunate to be a public school teacher in Los Angeles.  My state and local officials, all Democrats, are trusting science and acting accordingly.  We have a large state budget surplus that is being put to good use to help all levels of our society, including illegal immigrants and the homeless.

With the exception of a few hundred right-wing protesters who want to immediately get back to normal life, Southern Californians seem to be behaving well.  There is some NIMBY-ism involving putting the homeless in hotels and a few non-essential businesses that are now having power and water shut off for having remained open, but mostly we're doing what we're supposed to do.

Our infection rate reflects our collective good behavior.  And every day, our sky seems a little more vividly blue.  The air is noticeably cleaner.

It's hard for us all to change our routines, to lose livelihoods and sleep, much less loved ones. Harder still to accept that in the face of an enduring challenge, there are many who insist that the lives of others is a fair price to pay for a return to old haunts and habits. 

Time will tell what damage selfishness will mete out in terms of death and long-term infliction.

Perhaps we could save some things here and there? It wasn't necessary to let the horror of that day force us to give up what enough effort could retain.

Ground Zero was scraped bare and we started all over again. Not because we didn't value what was lost, but everyone realized that there was no saving what remained.

More importantly, we understood there was no way to pretend we could go back to the second Monday in September.

Early signs have not necessarily been encouraging, but there is also hope in seeing many adapt and change some of their most common behaviors in the matter of just a few weeks.

2020-04-18 20:01:02,"This article is unnecessarily pessimistic.

In the short term, we need to ramp up availability of testing.  Companies like Abbott Laboratories are developing new COVID tests.  Among these is a test for the currently ill that renders results in under 15 minutes via a machine the size of a toaster, that obviates the necessity for a full laboratory to do the tests.  Another test is a new antibody test that may be able to check if a person has had COVID in the past.

Yes, the US has been slow in getting these tests off and running.  But other countries have been able to control COVID-19 testing with testing and contact tracing.

Yes, there may be some long-term changes to the economy until we have a vaccine.  Large sporting events may be canceled for the next year or two.

Travel will be curtailed.  Virtual meetings will replace face-to-face meetings.

But the essential parts of the economy (food production, delivery of energy, manufacturing, banking) should be mostly OK.

Yes, lower aggregate demand will most likely produce a severe recession.

But COVID-19 also provides a warning for the future.

This catastrophe may give us practice on how to prepare for crises that will become prevalent as planet earth warms between now and 2100.

We need to rethink the old academic subjects.

Perhaps most important is a reexamination of macroeconomics.

Macroeconomic models seem to be predicated on ""eternal growth.""  But global warming suggests that population will reach a peak and decline."
2020-04-18 20:01:52,"If I read this article correctly - and I'd welcome being corrected by the author if I'm wrong - the take-home message is this: The United States, even now, has done far less to corral and knock down this virus than most any other country - and even countries that have done a lot more continue to struggle mightily with suppression and long-term containment.

That being the case, the conclusion is clear: We're going to pay a hellacious price for our approach, and it will vastly increase and prolong the suffering.

I can't understand why some people - like those protesting to re-open things quickly - can't grasp this simple reality. There is simply no bargaining with or ignoring a virus.

But then again I can't understand why people deny climate change, refuse to acknowledge that every other rich country has a vastly superior health care system to ours, or tolerate policies that keep millions of our hard-working citizens in a precarious, highly-insecure form of serfdom.

There are blaming fingers pointing everywhere and it is all pointless at this stage...with one exception. Regardless of what news outlet one searches, there seems to be one constant; that the United States is way behind when it comes to testing. 

We know that other countries have been testing with far greater efficiency and in greater volume because someone in the federal government decided that the internationally-accepted version of testing would not be used in the United and that we would develop our own. 

Who made that decision and why? 330 million of us deserve an answer to that basic question."

Life, unfortunately, carries many risks, but we don’t stop driving cars because there are traffic accidents.  We don’t hide at home during flu season though the flu kills many people each year.

2020-04-18 20:04:42,"How many Americans would need to be isolated and protected from exposure if America ‘opens up’. A quick search found that 20% of the US population is over 60 years old.  That puts 1/5 or 66 million Americans into the ‘at risk’ group.  There are around 100 diseases that affect the autoimmune system.  20% to 50% of Americans under 65 years old were estimated to have pre-existing conditions during the ACA debate. If we conservatively use 20% of the US population under 65 having some sort of autoimmune disease, that put the ‘at risk’ population at 132 million individuals or 40% of the US population.

The idea of opening up America and excluding 132 million people at a conservative estimate, how would many businesses expect to operate profitably?  I understand that many goods and services are ‘essential’ and those in the ‘at risk’ population will still spend on these goods and services.  My question becomes, if we remove 40% from the consumer non-essential economy, will businesses still be viable?  We need to 'liberate America' from C19 first, then we can 'liberate' workers, business and the economy."
2020-04-18 20:04:57,"""The best hope is that fatalities can be held to a minimum."" That's an optimistic viewpoint, considering President Trump is encouraging his base to challenge the stay-at-home orders.

Let's observe what happens as the virus has a chance to transmit and incubate for another 14 to 21 days. My guess is that Trump will quickly sing a new tune when the statistics show a sharp spike in cases."
2020-04-18 20:05:25,"For the most part, states which tend to be most supportive of the so-called ""right-to-life"" movement are, nonetheless, the same states which oppose saving lives by locking down. I expect the same is true for churches.

Churches and Trump-encouraged groups that fail to obey the law are usually the very same churches and groups that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law. (Do you think governors can get Homeland Security money to build walls around the churches and demonstrators?)

Why aren't the leaders of the churches and groups which hold in-person services and demonstrations in defiance of government rulings, services and demonstrations which, when they disperse, threaten the lives of many innocent Americans, treated as the terrorists they are? Consider the response when terrorists killed 3,000 on 9/11.

Once upon a time we had a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriot and a genuine wartime leader, who federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when the governor, Orval Faubus had used the state's National Guard to surround the schools and prevent integration under Federal Court order.

The situation is now largely reversed. We have a President who is neither a leader nor one who has served his country. This time we need governors to call out the National Guard to protect innocent Americans by enforcing the law."
2020-04-18 20:09:51,"In the Summer of 1918, people began to relax about the impact of the Spanish Flu. By Fall 1918, the consequences were swift and horrific. 

If by chance COVID19 has a seasonal nature, what we are seeing now is the ""off-season"" impacts of this virus. Now is not the time to undo the positive effects from all of our sacrifices over the last several weeks."
2020-04-18 20:11:44,"Recent antibody testing by Stanford appears to show number infected and had developed antibody about 50 times those shown to be infected by testing only those with symptoms.  Assuming herd immunity works when about 50% of the population has been infected, simple calculations show that we will reach herd immunity in about 500 days - with social distancing.  If the number of new cases increase by a factor of two with somewhat relaxed social distancing, we might reach this point in 250 days.  Very unlikely that widespread vaccines will be available before then.   No reason why we will not be back to pre-CV normal in about an year. 

All bets are off if there is no immunity having recovered from infection. 

We should know from Sweden’s experience which way to go."

In the months and years ahead, expect the people to be behind the government, even if the government gives a green light to commerce and social interaction. Those of us over 55 and/or with preexisting conditions will continue to be exceptionally cautious, including contact with may-be carriers who are younger. The half the population that is obese will be exceptionally cautious; it knows the complication and death rates. Those will kids will limit their activities lest they bring infection home.

As a former hospital COO, I have a grip on infection control that, after years of dealing with it (children in an old building were under my charge), serves me well now.
There are myriad ethical, moral, financial and public health decisions to make.  The situation is not helped by faulty leadership, but we've been faulty as a country for decades now.
At a now advanced age, I hope that the sane voices prevail in every realm and that we emerge as a less greedy and more fair place.  We urgently need healthcare for all, sustainability for our rapidly heating planet, and way less income inequality.  With any luck,progressive leadership will emerge among the young, as most of the old haven't shown these inclinations.

Well, the answer to that is: Our military. 

It's the dirty unspoken truth behind international power politics, and the reason why we still have the highest concentration of wealth, despite offshoring most of our production capacity.

The state actors who really make decisions about what happens always have a sword hanging over their heads. We might not be the smartest, or the most caring, or efficient, but we still have the biggest guns."

All scientific predictions are made by statistical analysis and models. These models and statistics depend of data. The more random and widespread the data the better the predictions of the model. Statistics 101 teaches you this and it is the backbone of any statistical model. As new data is available the better the model will become. 100% of the population can never be tested for the data. We have to do sampling and again the more random and  wide the sampling the better the data and hence better the prediction."

I wish there were some way to synthesize this kind of reporting with an open minded hope for promising treatments and optimistic accounts of the new ways we are approaching vaccine development, testing, and production. I actually tend toward light pessimism myself, even stronger pessimism when it comes to some kinds of planning that will likely be necessary, but I think it's always important to see with two eyes."

I've seen no reports on the impact of decreased air pollution on deaths in the U.S."
2020-04-18 20:25:02,"There are no economic models for damage done by shuttering commercial America, and there should be. Unintended consequences are mounting.  
Our new fascination with numbers is not always without bias. Acute care medical professionals are obviously biased in favor of zero disease; as they should be. The press has amplified that drastically because it is popular. It’s not the only viewpoint. 
I did not see much historical perspective in this piece. Example: the newest projection of 60,000 deaths is in fact roughly equal to the CDC death stats for the 2017 flu season. So, it is true this bug will be much like a bad flu season. It will be worse than 2009, better than 1968. And much better than the 1918 pandemic’s toll of 675,000 Americans. In fact, that death rate as applied to our population gave us about the same number as the Imperial College of London: 2.2 million. 
If as stated, millions of Americans have been infected but obviously survived, the death rate is substantially less than presently shown. Equally then, transmissibility of the bug is less than thought. Both would be normal for any disease and imply herd immunity. 
Re: not opening schools, facts: less than 0.0088%, or one death out of CDC’s study sample of 11,500 were 5-14. More alarming is the 22% of COVID deaths among people 25-65 (working age). Knowing which of those were in the health professions and higher risk activities might suggest that some business and commercial activities can be safely restarted."
2020-04-18 20:26:09,"As much of a nightmare as this is, this is great opportunity for accelerating the sustainable, time-as-currency, economy.  If FaceBook, or another monumental platform, could forgo the profit motive long enough to facilitate 'circles of giving' and the widespread use of time-dollars, we could stimulate a grassroots, food-sharing and domestic-work-force, like sewing masks at home, which may very well keep some of us from starving to death when our unemployment insurance runs out, and we're left scrambling and competing for extinct jobs."

Preferably so that our health systems can cope with the amount of patients without endangering those who care for them. And our social systems with the massive numbers of people who are out of work/in need of help without risking havoc.

In the article were numbers given for daily deaths due to 
heart disease/cancer. How many people die in the US every day because they drink too much alcohol/use opioid drugs/smoke tobacco/shoot each other ?

Your's is a rich nation.

The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics will ultimately determine how many of them should be attributed to COVID-19.

He can purpose a complete reversal of the long standing GOP policies and many democrats of putting corporate interests over the public's. He can point out the obvious GOP philosophy of rather having people die than see the stock market go down.

To do so, he needs to bring Warren to his team as a VP and have her in charge of getting our healthcare fixed.  Of course it means the revers of his corporate approach of putting band aids around the problem and fully buy in to Warren's proposals.   <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/opinion/joe-biden-health-care.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/opinion/joe-biden-health-care.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage</a>

This pandemic greatly illuminates the needs of a  strong social safety net, advocated by the progressive wing of his party such as improving healthcare, nursing home,  etc. which is obviously needed. In choosing Warren and her progressive policies he will bring in younger progressives and win a historical victory.  He will also demonstrate courage and wisdom at a time when America sorely needs it in a president.

According to the WAR PRESIDENT, this war is apparently different.

His so-called plan for reopening is outrageous, because he wholly abdicates the traditional role of the federal government, to provide tests, PPE and expert medical help to the states in times of crisis, and tells the governors that each state must provide adequate testing, contact tracing and PPE themselves. His plan also leaves all decisions with the governors, then states that they can reopen only if impossible conditions are met, and Trump himself is now tweeting ""Liberate Michigan"" to encourage reopening immediately without any adequate precautions. Trump is too incompetent to organize testing, PPE and contact tracing, wants to shift all responsibility and the blame to the governors, is fecklessly undermining his own plan, and only really cares about restarting his own businesses. Where reopening is being tried it seems to be quickly leading to a resurging wave of infection.

2020-04-18 20:16:25,"Data seem to show that COVID-19 prevalence is much higher and mortality for those infected is much lower than this article suggests.  A recent study from Stanford found that the true prevalence in Santa Clara County is between 50 and 80 times higher than reported cases, and that mortality is correspondingly lower.  

<a href=""https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/04/17/stanford-study-more-than-48000-santa-clara-county-residents-have-likely-been-infected-by-coronavirus"" target=""_blank"">https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/04/17/stanford-study-more-than-48000-santa-clara-county-residents-have-likely-been-infected-by-coronavirus</a>

The current NY Times map of cases by state shows 717,825 cases in the US, and 34,022 deaths.  If we assume that there are 30 actual cases for every official case (this would be a very conservative application of the Stanford results), then we would have an estimated 21.5M cases and a mortality rate of 0.16%.  This suggests that while COVID-19 is very dangerous, it is not nearly as bad as it could be.  If I applied the actual Stanford estimates (between 50 and 80 actual cases for each official case), then COVID-19 would be less serious than the estimates I listed above.  

I am hopeful that with good testing, we will be able to ease up restrictions in the next few months.

I am not necessarily convinced that scientists will find an effective COVID-19 vaccine.  Scientists have never come up with an effective vaccine for any coronavirus, and it's not clear that COVID-19 will be an exception.  Let's hope that they find a vaccine, but it's certainly not a sure thing."

What that takes is effective leadership, but instead we have had and still have grossly ineffective leadership by Donald Trump who seems intent, perhaps actually with malign intent, to inhibit or violate every step needed to safely reopen businesses.  He has yet to provide the testing so essential nor the contact tracing nor the ""adequate resources"" to protect our vulnerable front-line health care providers. Instead, he's seeking to undermine governors who he'd just conceded had the real power to ""Call Your Own Shots"" by promoting a rebellion against them that amounts to the reckless endangerment of both his followers and the citizens of the states he seeks to ""LIBERATE"" from the very guidelines he's put in place to contain the virus and allow for a timely and safe reopening of businesses.

I’m a junior in high school right now. My second semester has gone online due to COVID. I had a summer job, but the offer was rescinded too due to COVID. If the country doesn’t take aggressive measures to combat the virus like testing and isolation, my senior year too might entirely be online.

2020-04-18 20:47:06,Very interesting article.  I would like to see historians and medical people address how the US and other countries dealt with TB.  I think it was quite prevalent in the US up until the 1930's or so.  How did our society operate and what was put in place to manage the spread of this highly contagious disease. Could we gain perspective from that situation that could be applied to today's pandemic?
2020-04-18 20:47:17,"Excellent story; the most comprehensive and clear I've read. I am relieved to read of researchers who believe it unethical to conduct studies using a placebo group of humans in these circumstances. I understand that there can't be ironclad proof that a drug is effective without it, but certainly many doctors on the front lines must have some observation-based opinions on whether a drug has been effective in saving lives. I'd like to hear more from them. What they see and opine might not be scientific. But it surely can't be dismissed either."
2020-04-18 20:48:14,"This thoughtful article does not ask whether there is any existing simple remedy that has not been seriously considered.  There is one:  gargling.  Japanese clinical research studies show that gargling is protective against respiratory infections.  Very likely tens of millions of Japanese are assiduously gargling, as is their custom.  That may be one reason Japan has remarkably low rates of confirmed cases and deaths.  Yet we Americans aren't even debating gargling, and CDC remains silent about it.  Gargling could save lives and help us to restart the economy."
2020-04-18 20:50:50,"""..... How long, realistically, before we have a treatment or vaccine?....The coronavirus has a C-3 protease that is essential for its replication. Protease inhibitors already have a strong track record as successful antiviral drugs.  Pfizer has a C-3 protease inhibitor that is effective against the coronavirus in tissue culture which they plan to bring to clinical trials in August. Whether this specific compound is the answer or not, it is very likely that a 3-C protease inhibitor analog would be effective. There may be other antiviral solutions as well. The question is why hasn't the government engaged in a Manhattan like project, using all the combined resources of the the several large pharmaceutical companies together in a coordinated effort? In an all hands on deck 24/7 accelerated program there could have been a drug available in under six month; and the effort should have started two months ago."

While conservative America didn't ""get"" that movement, at least the goal of the protesters was somewhat understandable - to get America out of Nam.

I never thought I would see the day when mobs of misguided Americans would refuse to recognize the unprecedented damage and death this pandemic continues to cause while protesting IN FAVOR of the president who is encouraging such behavior.  More people will continue to become infected and die with such faulty reasoning and actions.  But that seems to be almost irrelevant to them or to their president."

Heavy among the already health compromised with poor respiratory capacity.   Life will go on.  And everyone will see this as a super flu.  This flu does seem to have a much longer life then previously thought, and  thus the current measures will not be sustainable because starvation and homelessness will accellerate rapidly.

2020-04-18 21:05:23,"Great comments here, but we should add that we are up against a virus which now morphs genetically with the DNA of the hosts it infects. The evidence is still circumstantial, but the virus seems to have the trait of changing RNA within a single host who is not presenting to be able to spread to susceptible new infected hosts where the result then turns deadly. Unfortunately, this will stymie efforts to develop a vaccine, because the vaccine will be attempting to address the older pre-morph versions of the virus, and researchers don't know where the virus will morph for some time. Not to be a downer, but the physical separation of the population remains the best solution for some time to come."

I just looked at the BNO news stats. 

If the USA death rate (5.2%) holds true for the remaining unresolved cases (643,843), and there are no more new cases, then the ultimate death total will be over 71,000.

There definitely will be many more new cases, so it looks like we've already left 60,000 behind."

If there were 2-3,000 COVID-19 test kits available, federal health authorities could obtain tests from a random sample of American adults who display no symptoms. The test results would provide a fairly accurate estimate of the percentage of the nation's adults who are infected but asymptomatic versus the percentage that is not infected.

Those deceased individuals isn't a fluke or fake news.  Their deaths are real and that number continues to climb every single day.

How some people can dismiss that fact, that single sobering fact, and just think or assume everything will be okay, safe and back to normal by May1 or Memorial Day or July 4th, well, good luck with that fantasy.  There are still untold number of people who still either underestimate, dismiss or deny this virus is not only deadly, but does not discriminate.

Every day becomes a little more bleaker with that knucklehead in the WH with no real plan other than hurry up and get back to work so the stock market can continue to climb upwards.

This country is woefully shy of any meaningful and positive leadership that will navigate towards long-term solutions rather than merely placing bandaids on the many serious and complex issues we are facing today, tomorrow and the next untold number of months ahead.

The president's knee-jerk response to quickly and hastily open businesses back up and allow people to return to work without proper safety materials like masks or testing kits is not only irresponsible, but reckless and potentially deadly.

He is perhaps the only journalist who does not demonize, blame another country for the pandemic. His view of how China has handled the outbreak is not uncritical yet fair. He understands when you face with a NOVEL and lethal virus, you don't know how it would infect and how to deal with it particularly in the early days of the outbreak. This is true for any country including the US. The challenge is how quickly and effectively the leaders and scientists can learn from the experience and data and carry out the right policies to contain it."
2020-04-18 20:56:56,"To all who say, ""Well, every year there are so and so number of deaths from the regular old flu!""

Lets explain this in clearer terms:

First off, I have never ever known anyone to die from the regular seasonal flu.  True.  But I have already known 1 person to have died from Covid-19 and two that are still really sick from it.

Second, we do not Social Distance during regular flu.  Imagine what the 40,000 confirmed dead from Covid-19 in the US alone would be now if we didn't use Social Distancing with this.   100,000-200,000?  More?  Much more?

Third, we have Anti-Virals and Vaccines for virtually all seasonal Flu's.

Covid-19 is an alien virus to our systems.  We are easy meat for it.  It has no resistance coming from any of us.  It is the 3 am wake up call at your front door from something you prayed never to meet if you're the right person - which a lot of us are."

The missing link here is that Pres. Trump did not wait for herd immunity nor a proven  treatment nor a good vaccine.

J&J has promised a billion by end of next year using its proven manufacturing technology PerC6 platform (most recently used for the Ebola vaccine).  The idea China would not sell us something is farcical. They are already supplying diagnostic tests, API for therapeutics and PPE.  Final point is if you ask 30 experts for an opinion, you will get 30 different answers.  These opinions are not worth the paper they are printed on nor are their ridiculous models and prognostications for the future which change by the nano-second.

Trump knows that the chances are increasing that the pandemic will not be over by November, so the whole thrust of his administration now is how to steal or cancel the election, and that is where he is going to do the most damage.

2020-04-18 20:49:53,"Trump's reopening does not even resemble a plan. Trump however continues to display of this mastery of lying. 

From the Guardian:

The US has so far tested about 3.3 million people, about 1% of its population. Per capita, that is small compared with several countries including Germany and South Korea. Iceland has tested people at 10 times the US rate.

“Testing has been an unnecessary disaster,” said Michael Greenberger, director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security. “Trump says we have the best testing, but the US is in the last percentage of tests administered to its population.”

Not one of the 50 states is currently in a position to carry out tracking of Covid-19 infections on the scale needed, whatever Trump said about their readiness to reopen. Many states, including the hardest hit, New York, are still experiencing testing shortages, 12 weeks after the first US case was recorded.

Time to invoke 25th amendment. This guy only wants to open things up so he can get back to his rallies. Trump is sick of being questioned on his performance, he wants his Trumpy crowd to cheer him on despite his lies."
2020-04-18 20:50:19,"For the past five weeks, I've been logging into the website of the local Austin paper to track the number of cases. We started with four back in mid-March, and are now at 1074 five weeks later, with no decline at all and a death rate of 1.95 percent. It makes no sense to ease restrictions, since the case number is still only climbing. Yet, our governor is ""reopening"" the state, starting in three days. It's head-scratching logic, to say the least."
2020-04-18 21:20:35,"IF you want to be able to open the economy to some degree without overwhelming the hospitals (which incidentally will increase the death rate), you have to be able to *know* how many people are sick and how many have been exposed.  Then you can adjust the degree to which you open the economy to keep the hospitals busy but not overwhelmed, until the infection has worked its way through most of the population, or there is a vaccine, whichever comes first.  Nothing revolutionary there — and that is what Germany is attempting to do now.  It's a basic control problem in engineering parlance.

But the key is something called 'observability', meaning the ability to measure the variable you want to control (in this case, new infections).  In other words, it all comes down to testing, testing, testing.  Without it you will either hide under a rock forever or end up with a cataclysm of simultaneous infection."

2020-04-18 21:21:29,"As the virus spreads towards the rural regions, particularly those in the ""Red"" states, I suspect it will become somewhat of a ""silent killer"".

The ""conservative"" states are anxious to re-open their economies almost regardless of the public heath consequences.  The reactions of those state governors to the mobs seems to be one of both tolerance and sympathy.

With a return to greater social mingling, sans any cure or vaccine, it is highly likely there will be a considerable spreading of the virus.  And as a consequence there will certainly be a rise in the death rate.

But given the political flavor of those regions I would expect that for many of these deaths the underlying cause will either be hidden altogether or just ascribed to some bland category like ""old age"" or ""general poor health"" etc.

Despite the reasonable pleadings of leaders like NY's Governor Cuomo today -- there's no way in this angrily divided society that anyone will keep ""politics"" out of dealing with this pandemic.

I am just glad that I divide my time between two leading ""Blue"" states with strong leaders who will not kowtow to the howling of rightwing mobs."
2020-04-18 21:21:55,"The impact of COVID cannot be measured solely by fatalities. While lowering the number of deaths is important and a good metric to track, it alone does not tell the whole story of this pernicious virus. We know of two people who have been very ill with confirmed cases for 3 and 4 weeks, but who have not been hospitalized and have not died, so we don't know if they are included in any of the counts being reported. Nevertheless, they are so ill, and recovering so slowly, that they will not be able to return to work for some time, if ever, even when and if there are jobs for them to return to. The impact of this illness will be felt by them, and by all of us, for a long time to come."
2020-04-18 21:26:32,"There will not be a return to ""normal."" The future has been changed.

The only way that there will be economic (and physical) survival is if the federal government basically puts everyone who does not have a paying job on their payroll and to the extent that businesses (other than Amazon and Walmart and their ilk) are necessary ""own"" the business so that it can be open. When the virus passes in two, three, or even ten years, then it can ""reprivatize"" the economy and recoup the amounts spent through taxes.

What will remain will be universal basic income, universal health care, and similar programs.

Donald Trump's non-response in the early stages will have done what Bernie Sanders couldn't -- give us democratic socialism."

Sorry to all of the folks in those states who do stay at home.  My only advice is to get out of Dodge while you can.  Or Austin (really Austin?) or Jacksonville.  Run from Michigan now.  Honestly, if you have the common sense to take care of a pandemic before insisting you can walk your dog shoulder-shoulder with (infected) strangers, they aren't your people anyway."

2020-04-18 20:49:37,"This reporter, Donald G. McNeil Jr., and reporters like him, are the reason I maintain a subscription to the New York Times. It is a foregone conclusion that he will win a Pulitzer Prize for his extraordinarily informative dispatches on Covid-19. More importantly, he has provided us a lucid, scientific roadmap to deal with this virus on a daily basis.

His reporting provides us with a gold standard pathway to rise above politics and special interests to ponder the best ways to navigate past this disease with the fewest deaths. 

At this critical juncture in our nation's history, Mr. McNeill has emerged as an unlikely national treasure. Like the great reporters of the past, we need him to inform us and give us hope. I am grateful for his vast experience and no-nonsense writing style that illuminates with global perspective."

The world is paying a price for Xi's censorship and oppression, and for Trump's manifest unfitness for office. As for our own country, the challenge is, how can we get from here to where we need to go, given the ignorant, ill-intentioned, incompetent and erratic president that we have?"

No more travel, restaurants, theaters, and other social gathering places, will be taboo for years to come. We live in a condo but next year we may buy into a small home with a backyard. Nothing fancy just a place to step outside for some fresh air and a little gardening.

Yet with this lifestyle change we still feel fortunate, no one in our family has fallen ill yet, our finances are such that we can ride out the storm, unlike so many other folks.  Every night we watch PBSNewshour, and watching and listening to those out of work, and the doctors, nurses, and first responders, it's heart wrenching.  And so many have lost loved ones, and were not able to be with them at the end.

My hope is, that this November we elect a new President and he starts to bring the country together again. We so desperately need that.

Thank you again for the in depth article."

2020-04-18 21:40:51,"Good article but still so much more not known than known.  Grateful to have some to give perspective but anything resembling a realistic future is still at least several months, if not more, off.  This article implies school better adapt quickly after not changing their style of education for the last century.  As being a parent it is hit and miss (mostly miss) as to how schools are adapting and most thing Fall will start up normally.  Many parents need to work to make money and when you have young kids somebody also has to watch them. Some level of risk will have to be taken as while we are not there yet, the measurement of risk has to be taken into account.  The entire workforce can't be ground for very long without the entire economy collapsing."
2020-04-18 21:41:54,"The article states ""In truth, it is not clear to anyone where this crisis is leading us"". It all depends upon the leadership. Under Trump's optimistic leadership with cooperation from governors, the USA has already slowed the spread of corona virus, the curve has started to turn down, hospital system handled and will be able to handle the treatment of the sick, several therapies are in clinical trial, vaccine trial has already started, the people are following the social distance guidelines, market  stabilized and started to move up, Govt. has allocated and is  ready to spend trillions of dollars to help people and businesses to survive, Federal Reserve Bank is doing everything in its power to stabilize and revive the economy, and new technologies are mushrooming to cope with lockdown. As a result, America will most likely achieve normalcy soon by opening the economy in three phases under Trump's guidelines supported by his medical experts. By the end of the third phase, we will have therapies, drugs, and vaccine to kill the virus forever or we will have enough herd immunity to manage the virus with minimum disruption. 

After the end of this crisis, I don't think there will be a lot of people who prefer China's leadership to Trump's."
2020-04-18 21:42:54,"If the US decides to discriminate against and continue to lockdown those of us who who have not been infected, what was the point of us following the rules in the first place? So we can be forced to stay home forever? Why would we do what we're told ever again?

If that's the way it goes, my first priority will be to get infected right away. I can live in the garage while I recover. Yes, there's a risk. But that's my risk to choose so I can go back to work and provide for my family instead of trusting the government do so."
2020-04-18 21:44:53,"Hopefully, the year ahead will see the removal of Donald Trump as President and the GOP majority in the Senate. A country run by a group that denies expertise and refuses to believe in science is part of the reason Covid 19 is so dangerous.

Anyone who says that this is a time to avoid politics doesn't  understand our current and future dilemma."

How is that done safely in this time of COVID ? Are the buyers (and sellers) primarily  younger? I’m confused  as to how sellers deal with potential buyers visiting their home. I don’t imagine then coughing or sneezing frequently or anything. It’s not that. 
. 
  It’s just that we live in a very controlled environment (generally  don’t go out except for walks and to get the mail) and I don’t worry if I occasionally forget  to disinfect a high touch item ( light switches, etc)

In my best case scenario the treatments continue to improve and evolve, lessening severe cases and deaths.   Hope so."
2020-04-18 21:48:19,"How to deal with covid-19 has been turned into a political struggle rather than a reasoned effort to deal with a threat. The media has had a field day with it, pressing each side's equally poorly informed opinion on us all, day and night, minute by minute, citing either raw numbers or percentages, driven by drama rather than rational analysis. But the virus doesn't care about your political beliefs. it is neither republican nor democrat; nor is the solution.
This virus will probably become a permanent part of our lives, like measles, smallpox, and influenza have. They too were feared, and in their prime were responsible for much more mortality and morbidity than covid-19. But we lived our lives and learned to cope with each so that we no longer fear them. We go on with our daily lives despite the continued existence and still significant effects on our society some of them, and others unmentioned, have. It will be like that with covid-19 as well. Some people will continue to die, many more will still become ill, as our experience with the others mentioned has demonstrated. But we will learn to live our lives and address the threat with a rational approach over time. Meanwhile society has to learn to stand up, move on,  and cope with it in our midst."
2020-04-18 21:50:27,"With Trump as president, one of the few things I can be thankful for is living in a blue state with Cuomo as governor.  Trump's plan to make this a blue-red state divide will backfire, like most of his ""businesses:""

First, blue state governors are professionals and can read polls.  They know the vast majority of their residents support the lock-downs, and do not want to risk their lives and the lives of their families to go back to work.

Second, the red states that ease their restrictions prematurely will see a spike in illness and death and overwhelm their ERs.  This will have the opposite effect of scaring the population even more than they already are.

Meanwhile, third, the responsible blue states will continue to beat back the virus the old-fashioned way -- with science and sacrifice and not baseless wishes.  And the economy will only significantly ""re-open"" when New York, California and the other wealthy blue states open.

Eventually those twin blue-state assets (wealth and intelligence) will lead to effective tracking and testing, and more availability of protective masks and gear.  This will permit a thoughtful and lasting re-opening of their economies, while minimizing the impact of any subsequent outbreaks, including from infected persons traveling into their states from a relative “hot-zone.”

So given the way Trump is ""leading,"" the coronavirus will become like the opioid crisis.  More entrenched in red states and less and less of a problem in blue states."
2020-04-18 21:51:14,"All the epidemic diseases in the past have raged for a few months, and then disappeared.    

Testing random samples of the US population has revealed much higher percentages of people with antibodies than expected.   Once this hits a certain level of the population, the epidemic might start to wane.    

At the same time, doctors are gaining experience in helping patients with serious cases of the virus.   The death rate in hospitals will probably go down because of this.   

This combination of factors may get us off  the hook sooner than expected.   Most of the predictions so far have been wrong, so I'm not making any predictions, but things may turn out better than feared."
2020-04-18 21:53:18,"There are a lot of good ideas in this article.

However, I think that we need to drop the term ""experts"" and use proper professional titles like ""epidemiologist"" and ""psychologist"" and ""social scientist.""

The term ""expert"" give the impression that ""experts"" are roundly knowledgable about everything, or at least more knowledgable than the rest of us.  

The reality is that ""experts"" are ONLY ""experts"" in their one, very specific field, and even then usually only in one aspect of it.  And they only measure success and failure through the narrow lens of their single field, which might not prioritize what is important to someone else at the personal level.

Experts also are not without their own cognitive biases and human limitations.  Bias can keep experts from understanding their research, or can bend it one way or the other.  In many fields there is wide disagreement between experts.  The public needs to see this disagreement and be a part of decision making that affects their lives and freedoms.

And experts are not immune to getting taken over by politics.  My own professional association, the APA, has become a joke of political agendas, shoddy research, and position papers that parrot Critical Theory cliches from the humanities with no regard for the quality psychological or neurological research that does exist.

We need experts, but we also need checks and balances on experts.  They are worthy of respect.  They do not form an infallible magisterium."
2020-04-18 21:53:59,"This is a war and the enemy is the virus.  In WW1 and WW2 the US escaped direct damage (except for Pearl Harbor).  WW2 in particular led to the US becoming the world's major power, largely because the economies of other countries were destroyed. 

This time is different partly because, unlike today, we had several presidents who inspired us and put the country first (even Eisenhower, who was an extinct type of Republican) but also because:

1. China will recover more quickly than anyone else
2. Like many countries, we have made ourselves dependent on China by outsourcing manufacturing and jobs.
3. China is already implementing their own version of the Marshall Plan.

Expecting everything to quickly go back to its pre-war state is a fantasy."

Obviously, there are others who specialize in human behavior.

QUESTION: Have regional governor groups considered consulting the directors of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association? 

They might be of use in assembling a panel of experienced trauma and disaster experts. 

These experts could provide evidence-based recommendations for dealing with the individual and group behavioral challenges of this crisis.

Additionally, industrial psychologists should be on the panel to assess the workplace changes, conditions, and timelines needed to get people back work in as safe a manner as possible."

2020-04-18 22:07:10,"For the most part, states which tend to be most supportive of the so-called ""right-to-life"" movement are, nonetheless, the same states which oppose saving lives by locking down. I expect the same is true for churches.

Churches and Trump-encouraged groups that fail to obey the law are usually the very same churches and groups that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law. (Do you think governors can get Homeland Security money to build walls around the churches and demonstrators?)

Why aren't the leaders of the churches and groups which hold in-person services and demonstrations in defiance of government rulings, services and demonstrations which, when they disperse, threaten the lives of many innocent Americans, treated as the terrorists they are? Consider the response when terrorists killed 3,000 on 9/11.

Once upon a time we had a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriot and a genuine wartime leader, who federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when the governor, Orval Faubus had used the state's National Guard to surround the schools and prevent integration under Federal Court order.

The situation is now largely reversed. We have a President who is neither a leader nor one who has served his country. This time we need governors to call out the National Guard to protect innocent Americans by enforcing the law."
2020-04-18 19:10:03,"I am a physician-scientist and professor. One trend that will hopefully be reversed by this painful period of suffering is the erosion of the confidence of some Americans in facts, evidence, science, learning and teaching. All Americans are going to learn that wishing for things to be true--or believing things simply because they fit your opinions--cannot change reality. The virus doesn't care about any of that. There is only one path out of this pandemic, and that is by answering questions and considering that evidence without the context of political bias. The truth has always mattered, but never as much as now."
2020-04-18 21:31:32,"Here in rural Utah, where the Trump 2020, No More Bullshi flags adorn many houses there is a disbelief that ""the virus is real."" The hoax mythology is firmly rooted in the brains and behavior of the majority of the residents. The governor has announced he's ready to reopen the state for business. Given the tourism industry is a major economic engine in southern Utah we will start seeing people headed here from throughout the country and around the world. So the simple question is: ""is your indulgence worth my illness or death."" Until people start thinking in those terms the clamor for ""open it up"" will grow louder."

2020-04-18 21:47:06,"""There may be good news buried in this inconsistency: The virus may also be mutating to cause fewer symptoms. In the movies, viruses become more deadly. In reality, they usually become less so, because asymptomatic strains reach more hosts. Even the 1918 Spanish flu virus eventually faded into the seasonal H1N1 flu.""

1) Is the now seasonal H1N1 less lethal to someone with currently no antibodies to it?  Does everyone have at least some antibodies to seasonal H1N1?  

2) Are people asymptomatic because it's an asymptomatic strain, or because of their strong immune systems to the same strain? 

Different subject, the science paper provided by the link in the quote above says, 

""In early 2009, a novel pandemic H1N1 influenza virus appeared, but it has not exhibited unusually high pathogenicity. Nevertheless, because this virus spreads globally, some scientists predict that mutations will increase its lethality.""

3) I guess mutations can go either way.  I don't know if the virus ""wants"" increased or decreased lethality from a Darwinian/survival perspective?

It was an astoundingly scary spectacle to watch these masses of women and men ignoring the consequences of coming together given the example of Italy next door. Sure enough, wives of politicians who were marching got infected, and thousands of people in the next few days and weeks. The virus spread like fire and Spain had to face a hellish situation. Few spoke about the march. Those protesters in Austin now are putting other people at risk as they become vectors for the virus' spread. Watch the numbers grow in those places in the next weeks.

If they are gathering and ignoring social distancing the worry is how many of them are congregating. Just lets hope this is a small movement. Otherwise they will undo previous efforts of control and instigate a new spreading of the virus.

Nucleic acid based testing detects active COVID-19 infection, including in silent carriers.  Antibody tests can detect 1) ongoing COVID-19 infection after sufficient time for antibodies to develop and 2) those who had the virus but are now virus free and won't spread the virus.  Do not confuse a positive COVID-19 antibody test as meaning with certainty that a person had an active, ongoing COVID-19 infection or is a silent carrier. They would have to have a positive nucleic acid based test to show that they currently have an active COVID-19 infection and therefore could spread the virus to others."

As Trump's popularity started to slide, the spinmeisters, Putin's social media trolls and right wing extremists (see: InfoWars) have pivoted from Trump's incompetence, tin ear and failure to function as a coherent leader to a new astro-turf grass roots Tea party-esque raging base. Stoking a wild xenophobic blame game- a new 'movement' is trying to shift attention to China, WHO and anyone but Trump. These folks are so afraid of Trump losing in November that they're suckered into believing there is no pandemic. They have been convinced that covid-19 is a Democratic plot to defeat their guy. Real economic distress gets redirected away from the failed federal bail out to a delusional solution.

Some would just want to ""LOCK the vulnerable UP!""

One of the worst consequences of these desperate Trump propaganda Big Lies- (apart from putting the entire country at great risk for an endless pandemic with NO return to economic stability)- is that rational people now wish these hotheads get very sick !
Maybe if they listened to the healthy younger folks who barely escaped death (Chris Cuomo, Danny Burstein, Hanks & Wilson, et al) they'd favor caution & science."

Trump is totally obsessed with his own image while thousand die unnecessarily due to his total incompetence.  The latest Trump tactic to promote protests against the lockdown is just part of his failed leadership in time of national crisis.  

Trump has systematically let the coronavirus pandemic get out of control as follows: 
Destroying the CDC’s capacity to deal with a pandemic; 
Refusing to take responsibility for his response to the pandemic. Trump said, ""I don't take any responsibility at all.""; 
Trump ignored dire warnings in January and February from U.S. intelligence agencies about the coronavirus pandemic; 
Failing to establish critical testing early on to contain the spread of the virus. Trump said "" One day it's like a miracle—it will disappear."" ; 
Failing to procure medical supplies needed for this public health crisis; 
Appointing anti-science Mike Pence to run the White House Coronavirus Task Force; 
Favoring governors who are political allies when distributing lifesaving medical supplies; 
Failing to allow  experts to manage this crisis. 

In a country where chaos prevails instead of leadership, there is no hope for managing the scourge we now face.

Maurice Hilleman, the great genius of creating vaccines, in the summer of 1957. noted in the NYT a story that children in Hong Kong were sick with glassy eyes. He promptly asked the US military to acquire samples of what he was certain was a flu virus. Soldiers were dispatched to Hing Kong and samples were obtained and flown back to Hillerman in late summer or early fall. In about a month he had created a vaccine and gave it to several drug companies which promptly produced the necessary doses of vaccine. By December of 1957 it was getting shot into arms all over America and a flu which had caused 70,000 deaths was brought to an end as 60.8 million Americans got the vaccine. Between those who were vaccinated and those like me were infected, herd immunity was created. The Asian Flu was gone from America."

Unfortunately, your ideas are not going to be absorbed by 99% of readership, and certainly not by the one person who should but seems flummoxed by anything more than a page with illustrations.

It would seem almost impossible to accurately estimate the ultimate outcome as a) the virus, the disease and the societal and environmental factors are all novel and incompletely elucidated, b) the data available today are known to be incomplete, non-representative and include a lot of ""guesstimates"".   I only consider S. Korea's data to be statistically representative - but her society is much different from the US'.   We'll just have to wait fo the future - much like any relationship.

If I may, one can regard this ""pandemic"" as a collective, global relationship.    If Gaia (earth as a being) is real, she could be sending out a clear message of, ""Enough is enough!""  

In one month, immediate global threats to her, such as pollution, can be halted; blue skies over much of China and India, rare in a generation.   In the silence, wildlife has ventured into cities.   Even halving travel, the world won't stop - especially was we can work remotely.

By a mild pandemic, targeting essentially those beyond reproductive or professional activity, the point can be made without devastating society like the Black Plague did (30-50% wiped out in Europe in 1350-1450).

Even wars and terrorists have stopped and nations shown that cooperation is essential for survival."

The fact is that the “experts” don’t have solutions just about anything related to COVID19 yet. The doctors are merely treating symptoms not the disease and are trying to save lives using whatever drugs they can find as helpful. I guess media and Democrats are the real experts whose expertise are obscuring information and Blame Trump.

The curve is flattening because the constant daily total of 30,000 new cases is always adding to the pool of cases and is therefore a slightly smaller percentage.  Filling an empty swimming pool with 10 gallons of water every minute and even though curve flattens as you as the pool fills--10 gallons is only 10 % of 100 gallons and only 1% of a thousand gallons--you're still add to the pool at a constant rate.  And, in the last week the total pool of confirmed cases has increased 38%, from 533,000 to 736,000--over 200,000 cases.

Disturbingly, the percentage rate of deaths has steadily increased and has grown over the last several weeks from 1.3% to 5.2% as of today.  We'll hit a million cases in 9 days...and if the fatality rate doesn't go up again, there will be 52,000 confirmed deaths.  And that's a conservative estimate.  65 days to get with range of Vietnam war deaths over 10, or is it 12 years?

The ONLY solution available right now is social isolation for everyone, and get as many tests as possible, both for Covid-19, and the anti-bodies.  Or millions more WILL die.

2020-04-18 22:45:38,"This article reveals a basic reality of this pandemic: The rate of infection is mediated by population density and the likelihood of social contact. It is because of these factors that larger cities and their surroundings—where high economic activity and high rate of public interactions are prevalent—have had an overwhelming proportion of infections and a high number of deaths. What this article does not explicitly address, however, is that these numbers are particularly high in population pockets where even higher density and poverty levels affect behavior, type of employment and access to education, healthcare and other quality of life resources. From the beginning, the current administration’s reaction has focused on trying to attenuate the economic impact of the crisis. This is obviously a reflection of an attitude the president, his political allies and many supporters have shown, which emphasizes money above other important considerations like personal health and well targeted planning. The effects of poverty, for instance, are often dismissed at best. It is therefore crucial that experts and other leaders measuring rate of exposure and its effects on the American population now plan policy and draw conclusions taking these factors into consideration. Social ethics aside, if anything else, understanding the peculiarities of our demographic distinctions and connections, and planning strategies accordingly, will also be crucial to our success as a society moving forward."

If, as the number of cases levels off, they relax restrictions and the death rate takes off again, then people will say they did not do enough.

I have 3 questions, the answers to which may either allow us to mitigate the human toll as well as we are able, given the unknowns and random nature of the virus, or perhaps even seal our collective fates to a significant degree. They are as follows:

1. Will the Administration actually provide the number of tests needed, plus the materials required to perform the tests (reagents, etc)
2. Will the political bent and agitation of his base be allowed to a degree where Trump is permitted to obscure the scientific approach to the application of the smart response to the crisis.
3. If the agitation of Trumps base results in violence and/or constant violation of the social distancing and other guidelines, will Governors have the authority to enforce the restrictions with police actions in order to provide safety for most of us.

I fear not.  Historians among the readers, has a pandemic ever been politicized and burdened by misinformation as this one is?  As a research biologist, I find the disconnect between the emerging consensus among scientists and public health agencies on the one hand, and the willful spread misinformation and denial of the reality to be seen in any emergency room by Trump and his followers on the other hand to be beyond comprehension.  It seems that Trump himself is trapped in a state of cognitive dissonance between these poles, endorsing rational proposals from his scientific advisors one hour, only to negate his own statements in a tweet the next hour.  If the consequences of his dissonance weren't so threatening to peoples' health, it would be fascinating to watch him engage in this tug of war between his reluctant acceptance of covid reality and his worst dysfunctional inclinations.  We may be trapped in a deadly dance between impetuous openings of society and panicked retreats back to isolation until when and if Americans vote Trump out of office next fall.

If I was in Mr. Trump's position, I would turn up the nationalism and emphasize China, China, China. That this is what we have reaped for exporting so much of our industrial capacity to a nation whose values so blatantly contradict our own, a nation that quite possibly let COVID-19 sneak out of a lab, yet continues to obfuscate its origins by kicking out foreign reporters and censoring its own researchers. A nation that strong-arms the WHO into issuing undeserved praise, yet kept the lid on coronavirus while stockpiling billions of facemasks for itself.

Once the dust settles, reasonable folks will be asking why we  rely on a foreign nation/adversary to manufacture our medical equipment, drugs, and vaccines. Why isn't this critical infrastructure here on our shores? ""America First"" is a practical response: that we should become resilient and self-reliant by bringing back our industry."

My husband's 84 year-old sister was released from Emory-Decatur hospital in Atlanta this morning. She was in the hospital for 3 days in terrible shape when admitted--high fever, shortness of breath, weak and disoriented (She is one sharp & tough cookie ordinarily--the only girl in the family raised with 4 brothers)  

She had the symptoms of COVID-19, yet kept testing negative with different tests. She is to go home and quarantine herself for 14 days. Her son was wonderful and texted the widely dispersed multigenerational family with updates 4-5 times a day. 

We feel like we dodged a bullet, but now realize how truly scary and uncertain this disease is, and how dedicated, impressive, and heroic the worn and frustrated medical teams are. There are a bunch of people in health care in our neighborhood in UT.  

No thanks to Trump--as the misinforming, grandstanding, bungling Decider of public health in this country--the doctors, nurses, health care workers, and hospital staff have muddled through without the supplies and coordination they need in an epidemic, but with fortitude, deep worry, and concern.

It also strikes me that those ""Liberate"" protesters, whom Trump welcomed and empowered, are actually the people who are making health policy in this country & are the ones Trump tries to please"

Just one example, and I pick Iceland only because they have by far the most extensive testing of any nation. I am NOT saying that diagnostic and surveillance testing isn't important, but it's hard to find proof in the data.  Iceland has tested by far the most people, about 12%.  Texas has tested 20 time less than that, about 0.6%  Yet Iceland has more than four times as many deaths per capita as Texas.  When I plot the data internationally and within the US, there is no discernible correlation.  The story comparing Germany to Japan and South Korea is equally confusing.

We are in hot soup here.  We need some expert advice backed up by retrospective data that shows quantitatively what the problem is, what works, and what doesn't.  No more speculation, ""it's obvious that's"", or ""it's just gotta be's.""

In 1863 -- the deadliest year of America's deadliest war -- total lives lost (North & South) numbered 15,000. New York State shot past that in the first 4 months of covid-19. Twice as many Americans died last Thursday (April 16) as they did on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941. That was at Pearl Harbor -- ""a date which will live in infamy.""

Few days ago, a random test of population in Sweden showed about 15% are infected, meaning 1500000, and the same day death toll was 1203, which makes to IFR=0.08%. Similar numbers based on similar serology tests shows similar infection mortality rates (Italy, CA). This IFR is for whole population. There is almost sero fatality among persons younger than 30.

The description of 'just the facts, ma'am' was more frightening than any Stephen King novel (such as 'The Stand' - a terrifying novel).  For the first time since this all began in January, I became very frightened.  At 68 with underlying issues I could easily catch this disease and die.  I don't want to die.  So that means I shelter in place with a partner who, at this point, does all the few errands we deem necessary.

I said a few weeks ago, ""Life has changed"".  But I think I'm just now letting it truly seep into my brain that life truly has changed so dramatically that I may never see the other side of all of this.

right wing factions that are against

2020-04-18 22:24:29,"Just to be clear. ""President Trump"" is a mentally and emotionally ill human being who happens to be a narcissist on top of all his other problems.

2020-04-19 00:19:18,"Until now in this particular war the enemy has dealt us severe blows. We didn’t expect this war, we were not adequately prepared for this war, and we reacted too slowly and too late to the enemy’s advance. In this particular war our returning to work, school, etc. is akin to mounting our counter attack against that enemy. We know the enemy will be waiting for us, hiding. For our counter attack to be successful we need a leading general of the stature of an Eisenhower or similar. We don have one at this time. That is our real problem."
2020-04-19 00:20:02,"Although I appreciate the hard work put into this article -not to mention the burdens of the people collecting and calculating the data referred to- I am presently overwhelmed by the numbers and statistics thrust on us in the daily news reports. I do not mean to say that the figures are wrong, are politically motivated or are not reported with sincerity and good intentions. Rather, there is simply too much to contemplate. It's not necessarily that I cannot work my head around the sums and percentages. It's just that I know I will see whole new sets of such the next day."
2020-04-19 00:24:41,"Thank you for this stark and candid analysis of our collective lives living through this global pandemic. What we must accept is that this virus has no borders, no divides, does not see us in any political or geographical way, we are all susceptible, we are all equally vulnerable.

We have been asked to do one thing, to stay at home and protect lives, to stop the spread of COVID-19, this is our challenge and out duty and we must stand strong...together."

2020-04-19 00:32:59,"Everyday I say to myself “I don’t know what I don’t know.” And experts, despite all their modeling, forecasting, projections do not take into account the human aspect of COVID-19. The damage that is being done to our collective psyche is real and serious and maybe not necessary. Articles like this are frightening and defeating and creates am overwhelming helplessness. Hope is essential to our very existence, and maybe we need to reassess the imminent threat of COVID-19. After 4 weeks of social distancing and lockdowns we are now facing another calamity of emotional, physical and mental distress. Should the risk of infection be secondary to the threat of depression and hopelessness. Do we need to take down barriers in order to alleviate the suffering that isolation has caused? What really is the greater risk to humanity, the virus or the mental anguish that has stricken us as a nation?"
2020-04-19 00:34:02,"Honestly, good luck to us all. Deaths from covid-19 given the lack of social distancing by some will surely occur in greater numbers. But we’ll be re-defining deaths of despair soon though too, due to increased poverty and the mental health suffering brought on by the pandemic, both in terms of its economic consequences AND the change in our social lives. I truly hope those with expertise take the latter into consideration as well. 

That aside. I think there will be a recognizable reordering of global power post-pandemic - we were already heading there. But maybe once the USA needn’t market itself as being No.1 anymore, we can move onto to the business of actually taking care of EVERYONE living in this country and making sure their most basic needs are met: universal healthcare, decent education and housing, livable incomes, etc. Maybe. But something tells me to not be surprised if many Americans return to their individualism and lack of accountability to those with the least, while continuing an economic system that favors those with the most."
2020-04-19 00:34:42,"With no cure or vaccine, we have to get and keep the disease reproduction rate below one. Locking down society and isolating everybody accomplish this, but with major impact on the economy (which may ultimately be a bigger problem than the epidemic itself). Relaxing the restrictions will increase the reproduction number and likely lead to a ""second"" wave -- unless we lower it other ways.

Testing can be used for this. By repeatedly testing everyone, we can limit the amount of time a sick person can infect others. Initially, testing every week seems appropriate based on the period of infectiousness. Yes, the cost will be high, but far less that the current cost of mitigating the economic disaster.

Testing should be augmented by tracking to identify other possible infections. Both electronic and human tracking should be used.

Testing will also tell us which areas are safe, and can opened up, and which areas require other restrictions.

It's too bad we're still neglecting this!"

Perhaps this Coronavirus will stir us from our centuries long slumber, or perhaps, as William Butler Yeats suggested in his poem, our destiny may be slouching toward Bethlehem, to be born -

""When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   

A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   

Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   

Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   

The darkness drops again; but now I know   

That twenty centuries of stony sleep

Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   

And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   

Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?""

Those of us who are able to survive without engaging in those activities, realize how dangerous they may turn out to be if we should engage in them, have even modest underlying health conditions, and have the resources to shelter indefinitely, understand that we will be at home until a proven vaccine has been administered and many weeks have passed since receiving that vaccine. 

At this point in time, using the traditional time estimates for the production of a proven vaccine, this means sheltering-in-place until at least the spring of 2021. We're planning for the fall of 2021 and feel extremely fortunate to be in the financial position to do so.

We're not living in the woods with hundreds of pounds of rice and beans, etc. We're in an urban area and will unavoidably have interactions with others. We will do everything we've learned to do in recent weeks to minimize the risks from those interactions. Frankly, we don't have a lot of hope that doing that will be completely successful in terms of avoiding the current mutation of the virus, but that's the situation we're in."

He has done nothing about testing ... the single most crucially essential thing for enabling the opening up of the economy which is under lock-down solely because of his deliberate intransigence.  Now he’s abandoning it all together|. The nation was left totally vulnerable and in a place of ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" as trump deliberately over the last three years dismantled all the important measures Obama had taken to protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and guard against other possible infection situations in the future. 

trump effectively owns both the mounting death toll, and the catastrophic economic collapse, no question. Not because he was too late and inept (which he is), but because he deliberately ignored warnings and dithered.

- That it has not been possible to develop either a vaccine or a monoclonal antibody against coronaviruses in the last 17 years.
- It has never been possible to develop a vaccination against any coronavirus.

- So, we do not know how long we will have to deal with this virus. Two reports, which should not have been available to the public (U.S.- Government COVID Response Plan and a report of Imperial College London) come independently of each other to a ""lock-down"" phase of up to 18 months.

- We do not know whether this virus will concern us epidemically/pandemically or perhaps even endemically.

- We still do not have a recognized and broadly applicable, defined therapy; we have never been able to present such a therapy for influenza either. ""

While California and New York want to implement containment, only the federal government has the funding and power to organize production of adequate test kits and protective equipment, and Trump refuses. 
The United States is the only developed country with organizations demanding the economy re-open with no viral containment—Trump, Fox News, the Koch brothers’ ALEC, rightwing extremist Ammon Bundy. Businesses will open and become battlefields, with desperate workers replacing the sick; people will drown in their own fluids untended in hallways of under-staffed hospitals; the poor will bring their dead to refrigerator trucks in parking lots."

Autocrats, despots, life-long enemies of the democratic way of life have been elevated to the altar of “my good friends” by a President that seems to ignore the ill-meaning intentions of those individuals and the regimes that support them. Generals and admirals, career American intelligence professionals, scientists, medical experts have been regaled with the derogatory comment “I know more than… (Any and all of them)” and have been ridiculed in front of urbi et orbi.

Will the States receive the funding to buy the testing and hire the thousands needed to perform contact tracing? 

Pres. Trump is already circumventing his own guidelines and goading States to reopen.  Every expert knows this is wildly dangerous.  He insists there are no problems with PPG or testing. Yes, we know what we need but what good will that do any of us if the President thinks we already have what we need?

What would stop an enemy country from making fake protest pages that glorify Trump and create mass gathering at a time when it is so crucial for people to stay home to keep this from spreading? It is time to do away with unverified and anonymous accounts on twitter and facebook. These social media companies need to step up and do more.

We need to corner this rat but we can't do that if Dollar Don keeps giving it more frequent flier miles. 

Take a look at the county map outbreak for Oregon where I live. As long as only local traffic is allowed off interstate 5 (Seattle to San Diego) apart from filling gas, and commercial trucking traffic highly regulated, there's no reason to shut down the local counties with very few cases of the virus on either side of interstate 5 which can be controlled by the county sherrifs office under the supervision of health authorities.

Those living in sparsely populated counties should not be free of rules. Covind19 loves a church choir and screaming fans in the bleachers at the local high school basketball game, aircraft carriers and cruise ships.

The point is not to be perfect but to be sensible."
2020-04-19 01:48:46,"I expect the measures required to eradicate the virus entirely will prove to be unrealistic in the US (and UK) where there is an aversion to overbearing government interventions. However the effects of the virus will force us all into the social distancing measures that allow the health centres to function. What matters is the transmission rate R0 which needs to be at or below 1 to prevent exponential case growth. It looks to me as though in the US R0 is still close 1 as infection rates are not obviously declining; that means there will be only limited scope for any relaxation of current social distancing measures. These will need to be held in place until either 60% of the population has had the infection or a vaccine is widely distributed. My guess is that the US will go through several cycles of lockdown and release until 60% of the population has been infected over the next 2 years or so. However with anti-viral treatments the disease may be less severe in the latter cycles and the current panic assuaged. Which ever way you look at it this is not a brief episode it's at least a 2 year battle with enormous social and economic harm. Hopefully Biden gets elected, if not I'd prepare for a prolonged cold war with China whom Trump will be using as his scapegoat."
2020-04-19 01:50:13,"Almost no American alive today has ever experienced anything like a pandemic, and even America's wars have happened in other countries, never here. That's why 9/11 was so traumatic; so many Americans felt we were invulnerable before that.

Now we are in the middle of something many people feel is impossible. The carnage is right in front of us, but denial persists. There is this growing sense of, ok, this has become boring now, time to move on--because that's how we deal with news cycles now. But this is not a news cycle, it's plague.

 I think this wake-up call will be painful beyond imagining."
2020-04-19 01:54:12,"The Press has focused on the challenge of distance learning until in-person classes resume. However, a looming question for educators is the future condition of employment for older faculty. 

Will schools require professors with the common health ailments of middle age (asthma, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, etc) to risk a fatal respiratory infection by mandating a return to the classroom?

Consider that teachers expose themselves to multiple daily contacts with classrooms of 35-plus students, congested hallways, department meetings, and shared classroom equipment? This is a recipe for putting one's health on the line. 

At the same time, this is what many ""essential workers"" like bus drivers, food service workers, nurses and hospital workers experience on a daily basis. Should teachers be any different?

No doubt some older teachers with health issue will face a career-altering decision in the fall. Administrators, students, parents will expect a quality in-person classroom experience -- especially at pricey colleges. 

Should it lead to a culling of at-risk faculty over the age of 50?"
2020-04-19 00:01:26,"Perhaps I’m nihilistic enough to believe humans are the dumbest species ever to populate Earth. Our so-called intelligence with a pre-frontal cortex capable of leveraging science, arts and organization to simultaneously accelerate technological progress and war isn’t a sign of a superior being - in fact it puts us in the lowest order.

I can imagine a similar human-like species dominated Mars five hundred million ago when it may have been a lush planet with all the ecological diversity of Earth. Then within just three centuries these superior Martians were wiped out by their own folly, dragging every living organism down with them. As Mars turned to a crisp followed by hundreds of millions of years of deadening of the Martian doornail, we observe the red planet today, devoid of all signs of life except for faint traces of surface erosion.

By protesting -- in large, closely packed groups -- the very policies that could help us shorten the pain, these selfish people will bring great harm upon themselves and disproportionate harm to large concentrations of Democratic voters.  

These less well-off haters would rather die themselves than see every one of us help each of the rest of us.  

(This is why we don't, for example, have single payer health care, like other developed nations.)

2020-04-18 23:22:54,"Methinks your enthusiasm for the demise of western civilization is a bit premature.....

Now. This is a virus and they are ubiquitous. This one has probably been around the world a dozen times by now and has already mutated into several different strains. We have probably all been exposed already. A large portion of the population is immune and will never get tested. Another has had it and had no or mild symptoms and will never get tested. A third portion (maybe 20% of the total population) is symptomatic and gets tested. These are the ""cases"" reported. A tiny portion of the third group will have weak immune symptoms and would die of any infection because they cannot fight it. These are the ""deaths"" reported. But they are counting all those who die with the virus not just those who die of it. So statistically speaking we won't know how many have it until we test everyone in a given population so our ""n"" number is to small to be statistically significant.

So why are millions of people not succumbing to this scourge...?...because there is no need in the physical world for an infectious virus to be that deadly. All it wants to do is reproduce. And if it kills you it will end its own bloodline."

2020-04-19 02:05:27,"How can we make a rational decision about reopening society without massive testing? One of two things is happening. Either,

1) the mortality rate is much lower than we think because lots of people who have not been tested actually have the disease but have very mild symptoms - this bolsters the case for reopening society now.

OR

2) the mortality rate is much higher than we think because lots of people are dying without being tested and their death certificate reads ""pneumonia"" or ""natural causes"" for the very elder. This bolsters the case for society remaining shut down.

Which is it?"
2020-04-19 02:09:02,"Regardless of what decisions the federal, state and local governments make, it will be the people themselves who will determine just how quickly our society can ""reopen"".  If large numbers are fearful and remain unwilling to come out of their homes, any return to normalcy will be chimeric. 

On the other hand, some communities seem outraged by restrictions that still require them to obey social distancing.  If a few of them can be kept isolated from others, they should be permitted those freedoms for which they seem to crave.  Hopefully, they will be lucky.  In the far likelier scenario in which the disease breaks out among them, they will have learned a lesson the hard way and in so doing, will have provided a much needed example to others.  

As for a vaccine, a two year time horizon is merely a hope.  It remains to be seen whether any vaccine at all can be developed in the foreseeable future.   People should remember that we don't have a truly effective vaccine for the flu and there is still none for HIV or Ebola.

We can only be successful - and retain our humanity -  in the months and years to come if we meet truth and reality head-on.

Steven Colbert hit the nail on the head years ago when he coined the phrase"" truthiness."" 

Truth, facts, science, and reality...became optional. 

I refer to this as our ""illusion default."" When feelings, facts, experiences, or information challenge - or threaten - our emotional comfort zone, we create an illusion to divert us from the undesirable truth or reality.

Our ""Illusion default"" is a tool we develop in childhood; we learn to ""make something up"" when reality challenges or frightens us; that way we can ""believe"" - believe being the key word - we are safe.  

This default into illusion is a necessary and valuable tool in childhood. As adults however, we must shed it and do the ""work"" to grow and mature emotionally so we are able - and willing - to discern, truth, facts and reality...even when it is challenging or threatening. 

Media, marketing, advertising, and technology made it even easier for us to divert our attention and slip into illusion rather than deal with reality; most folks are simply trying to keep up with their smart phones every day.

By January we'll likely have a vaccine, several are already showing promise.  And, it looks more and more like the morbidity rate of this virus is similar to influenza.  And, the vast majority of Americans, if infected, would have mild or no symptoms.  We over-reacted in a huge way.  If you are older and have underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, then you are at risk.  Stay home.  But, the rest of us do not need to stay at home or stay away from work.  We can move about freely, practicing social distancing and washing our hands frequently.  Which we should have been doing anyway to protect against all viruses and bacterias.  The lockdowns should end. And end now.  Liberals don't believe it but we are all not stupid and all do not need someone telling us how to take care of ourselves.  Texas is moving forward quickly as we all should.

Worst case scenario is a limited protection by the vaccine and antibodies, so people have to expect, to get infected several times in their life with an increasing risk while growing older. 

I also don't get the mentioned daughter demanding Corona-Parties for younger people ""to keep the economy running"". Ignoring the fact, that it would risk the life of other people, there is no need for getting infected on purpose - young people could just continue their Pre-Corona-Lifestyle until they get hit by Covid-19. Of course they would have to avoid any contact with elder population and people with health issues, which is exactly why this is a dumb idea.

I developed confidence that the international research community will defeat the pandemic and will probably develop an effective vaccine, much faster than in the previous history of eliminating infectious microbial diseases. 

I appreciate the opportunity to share a few thoughts from my personal experience that might trigger the thinking of this expert community. One of my associates was the late Cyril Ponnamperuma, a University of Md professor. and amine scientist,  who is most noted for his achievement in creating life from non-living chemicals and is the author of The Origins of Life. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ponnamperuma"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ponnamperuma</a> 

During the HIV scare, Cyril and I often discussed pathways of pathogen research and during the HIV epidemic, he was interested in seeking people where there was a high probability of HIV infection, such as the sex workers in India, who did not develop HIV/AIDS and use them to examine the uniqueness of their immune system and other physiological factors.  

I thought it was a very good idea because I personally had been through the polio period and my younger brother caught polio and I did not. He was 3 years younger than me (b. 1937) and we had the same exposure, same parents, same diet, etc. He was removed from our home and to a special treatment center with iron lungs, etc. Finally, he returned home and we are both alive."

2020-04-19 00:50:26,"A Wikipedia entry on life during the Blitz:

Although the intensity of the bombing was not as great as pre-war expectations so an equal comparison is impossible, no psychiatric crisis occurred because of the Blitz even during the period of greatest bombing of September 1940. An American witness wrote ""These people are staunch to the bone and won't quit ... the British are stronger and in a better position than they were at its beginning"". People referred to raids as if they were weather, stating that a day was ""very blitzy"".[68]

Office workers make their way to work through debris after a heavy air raid. According to Anna Freud and Edward Glover, London civilians surprisingly did not suffer from widespread shell shock, unlike the soldiers in the Dunkirk evacuation.[69] The psychoanalysts were correct, and the special network of psychiatric clinics opened to receive mental casualties of the attacks closed due to lack of need. Although the stress of the war resulted in many anxiety attacks, eating disorders, fatigue, weeping, miscarriages, and other physical and mental ailments, society did not collapse. The number of suicides and drunkenness declined, and London recorded only about two cases of ""bomb neurosis"" per week in the first three months of bombing. Many civilians found that the best way to retain mental stability was to be with family, and after the first few weeks of bombing, avoidance of the evacuation programmes grew.[70][71][72]"

Churches, organizations, and Trump-encouraged groups that are failing to obey the law are usually the same churches and groups that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law. 

Why aren't the leaders of the churches and groups which hold in-person services and demonstrations in defiance of government rulings, services and demonstrations which, when they disperse, threaten the lives of many innocent Americans, treated as the terrorists they are? Consider the response when terrorists killed 3,000 on 9/11.

Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriotic, wartime leader federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when Governor Orval Faubus used the state's National Guard to prevent integration.

Now we have a President who is neither a leader nor has served his country. So now we need governors to use the National Guard to protect innocent Americans by enforcing the law.

Have your own community rules and write them up and display them. It's your life that's at risk - not the governments. Even put locks on your gates to keep people two metres or more away from you so you can't catch the virus.
It's going into summer in USA so if I lived there I wouldn't be hanging around the city where the virus spreads like wildfire because of clusters. I'd be heading for the hills or lakes and living in isolation until a vaccine is found because the USA government hasn't a clue.
Don't forget the USA people in government live in sprawling homes where they don't have to be amongst clusters.
The only promising test for the virus is being done by Oxford University and they say they're 80% sure their experimental vaccine will work and they should know in September.  Nothing is sure and people are just hopeful a vaccine is found; I also read that viruses can mutate and they found a mutated strain in India and that means any vaccine is useless cause the virus is one step ahead of the researchers.
I got the flu vaccine for the first time; and an pneumonia vaccine. Someone needs to ask Trump how come no Senators or Billionaires or people in high Office haven't caught the virus."

2020-04-19 02:46:05,"Try to remember that Trump is a damaged person with limited ability to be of any help. It is best to rely on people who are professionals that have worked in the field of health. We all should know by now that the virus will spread in close contact. If there is some around and people contact it ,it can spread very rapidly before we know it is there. It takes time to manifest itself, This is a fact of life now. If you want to be safe, stay away from people.
If you have risk factors,be extremely careful.
Those places that plan to restart the economy will suffer if they do not test to see what is around first. Tests are hard to get. The virus is able to hide in the early stages. All this says we must be cautious or we will set off another round of virus. 
The virus is not going to comply with anything but its own nature. We had better learn to respect it now, rather than learning the hard way. 
Dense populations are extremely vulnerable. Fact.

2020-04-19 02:58:16,"We are witnessing the disintegration of American society in real time. It started years ago, but is accelerating at a frightening rate.  Can it be saved?  Frankly, that is unknown.  What is known is that Trump and the Republican (aka New Know-Nothing) Party must be removed and kept from power for the foreseeable future.  This is an imperative.  Our very survival as a country depends on it."
2020-04-19 02:59:13,"I’m nearly 70; reasonably healthy, not obese or diabetic. Nevertheless in the ‘danger zone’ if infected, according to the data available to date. Fortunately able to work from home, which I still do part-time for a generous hourly rate. Debt free, with savings that should last despite the market volatility we will experience for years.

I likely can avoid the contagion, although there are no guarantees. But I grieve for the millions who must work to live from week to week; for the tens of thousands of small businesses (and I mean small, not those with a ‘mere’ 50 to 100 employees); for the kids who will miss school. And for the tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans who will become gravely ill, and the caregivers who will work under wartime conditions trying to save lives.

It’s way past time to stop our bombastic, know-nothing President from turning this fiasco into a cheap entertainment, another Trump reality tv show and rally for his right-wing cult. Let the grownups run the show from here on out. The grownups will tell you we’re in uncharted territory; we’re playing frantic catch-up because of White House denial and inaction during the crucial weeks and months when the spread of the virus could and should have been traced and abated. 

But it’s too late to cry over spilt milk. The models will not tell us what will happen much more than a week or two from now. The data will change, and thus change the model output, esp. if we end containment measures too soon."
2020-04-19 03:09:21,"It's a pity that Trump is talking about reopening the economy when he has not actually ""closed"" it in the first place. Although we're not testing enough, the national lockdown (for a month today) in Argentina is yielding very positive results. Brazil, which has not implemented a lockdown as strict as ours, already has 20 times more dead people than us (and they had their first positive case at the same time as we did). Unless a really tight lockdown is applied in the US, the number of dead people won't go down."

2020-04-19 03:11:24,"People keep talking about opening up when there is enough testing. This is a false premise. There is no vaccine and there is no treatment. What use is it if I test positive and end up with a ventilator and die. How can we open up in an environment where the virus is still around everywhere and people can get infected on the subway, in the train, at work, etc. As long as the virus is around, people will get infected, and infect in turn.
Perhaps universities must remain closed in NYC and go fully online - I cannot image thousands of students in dorms (like nursing homes & prisons) spreading it among themselves and staff, faculty and other workers. This is harakiri."
2020-04-19 03:17:05,"From everything I can tell, the US will remain locked down until there are no more Covid-19 cases.  Based upon current data this will not occur until mid to late 2021 according to Dr Fauci.  What this means is that the US business will need to be financially nationalized in order to survive.  What this also means is that, in the absence of mail-in voting or a similar alternative, US elections will be suspended and President Trump will remain president until there are no more Covid-19 cases.  Long story short, given the gravitas of the pandemic, President Trump is unilaterally in charge of everything with the pandemic increasingly causing Congress to revert to a ceremonial role until there are no new Covid-19 cases."

Although, clearly, we need to inform the public, so thanks for the piece. But I can't help but think the time we're spending trying to explain the logistics of a pandemic might be better spent preparing for the horrible possibility that Trump might use this as an excuse to halt the upcoming election. His NPD won't allow him to accept defeat in any rational way & when backed into a corner, he will decompensate & channel his fear & anger & crippling insecurity into even more dangerous actions.  I know, someone in my family has NPD. The best way to solve this problem would be to declare him unfit. Encouraging the states to disobey their own governors, right after he backtracked about his statement that his authority is ""total"" is a sign of this decompensation. And it is going to get worse. We are going to have a resurgence of the virus & if it happens near November, he will have his excuse.  It never gets better because he can't accept who he really is and he would rather sacrifice the lives of others than admit defeat or errors in any way. 
I really appreciate the enormous amount of research that went into this article, but it is all for naught if we don't have a leader who is sane enough to implement any of these strategies. His illness is really going to be the determining factor in how many of us die. Not the sage advice of experts."

Today, I cycled through my town and saw cars with license plates from Quebec, Vermont, and New Hampshire.  Were the Vermont and Quebec drivers essential workers at our local hospital?  Perhaps, but if not, why are they even in NY State?

A local fraternity house had laughing coeds on the front porch.  So much for keeping apart.

Aside from the critical need for widespread testing and equipping our first responders, unless people get serious and practice social distancing, how are we ever going to get back to any kind of normalcy?"
2020-04-19 03:37:20,"Political figures need to be more blunt about the tradeoffs in the strategy outlined in Pueyo's ""Hammer and the Dance"" article. Make it clear that specific containment measures are exchangeable, and that the menu of relaxing restrictions is flexible, but limited. As a fictive example, opening up sporting events would be costly in terms of infectivity, but might be equivalently exchanged for opening up schools and restaurants instead. Given that choice, what madness could possibly possess people to be so selfish that they can't even take the tiny step of putting on a mask?"
2020-04-19 03:37:36,"In the Netherlands the RIVM (comparable to the CDC) has reported that based on blood tests, about 3pct of the population has been infected. This equals to about 500.000 people. In the same time we know that 3700 people died in hospitals and elderly homes that were diagnosed. From our statistics bureau we also know that the actual mortality rate over the last three months show an additional increase of about 1000 people per week from undiagnosed causes. It you do the math, then over the last 6 weeks roughly 7500 people have perished while 500000 have been infected. This gives a mortality rate of approx. 1.5 pct. Since the mayhem started end of february."
2020-04-19 03:38:01,"This article feels like it gets a lot of assumption right. However, the glaring unacknowledged variable in the room is what the Federal Government will do. It looks like the best assumption is that they will make the States go it alone.

If that happens, as is already the case, money will become an immense variable and drag on both protection and recovery as States try to, or not, figure out how to pay for it all, even if they can at all.

Perhaps the most unfortunate part, which will also impact the success or failure in both health and employment terms is the fact that the Federal government does not want any truth or transparency except for numbers that are favorable to them. They will do their utmost to obfuscate the death toll, the amount and type of testing done, and employment figures. This will undoubtedly make it far more difficult for the entities trying to resolve these problems to do so. And at the end of the stick, the general public will be left holding the proverbial bag for their own economic circumstances and health bills. By all accounts the virus leaves permanent damage and health problems for those that survive, and this has not been factored in yet as the scope cannot be determined.

I fear there is a heartbreaking amount of death, economic ruin and lifelong health issues to come, over many years, which will be compounded by our Federal governments responses."
2020-04-19 03:42:53,"I find it curious how the discussion in the US is how to return to normality ASAP, while the discussion in Europe is on how to improve the previous situation and build upon a greener economy.
It may be a coincidence that densely contaminated regions tend to be more affected by the virus, but we really should study the correlation between contamination and coronavirus propagation. It is clear that contamination and smoking weaken the resistance of the lungs against infection but it also seems likely that fine dusts from contamination may serve as transport for the virus.
This would actually put together two of Trumps most denied subjects: climate change and health, forcing us to re-evaluate a much greener future."

2020-04-18 19:16:33,"Given this information, our economy will recover in fits and starts as hot spots emerge an then disappear. This inconsistent recovery will require the government to find a sustained way to maintain local municipalities and state government. Already, many governments are seeing incredible loss of revenues, when they will obviously be needed to do much more for their citizens. We need an economic plan, to sustain our citizens and our infrastructure over the next two years. We cannot let more Americans fall into poverty and we need our civic institutions to keep functioning. I hope Congress will adopt fiscal strategies such as a progressive tax system, which was employed after WWII, to fund infrastructure projects, free college, grants to local governments and to establish Medicare for All. We will need the communal, tax-based infrastructure of government and the public sphere more than ever in the upcoming 18 months."
2020-04-18 18:57:21,"I work for a local public entity in the San Francisco Bay Area. I've seen very little discussion about how the economic shutdown will eventually destroy the ability of the government to function and maintain the public services that are essential to keeping society functioning, especially right now. Tax revenue is what pays the salaries of the firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and health care workers at public hospitals. It's what's paying for all the efforts to expand healthcare capacity, build tent hospitals, and rent motel rooms for homeless people. Without economic activity there are no taxes. Without taxes, public employees will be laid off and government services will collapse. Local governments will be the first to go under, many within a year. State government can't last forever either. Why isn't the media talking about this?"
2020-04-18 21:45:56,"I appreciate the complexity of this piece, despite its brevity. 

All along I have worried less about the physical aspects of the virus, as horrifying as they are, and more about our fragile social fabric. 

-a widening of inequality as those with resources ride things out while those without  $400 saved for an emergency watch their tenuous situation lurch over the edge

-the ways we have become interdependent and how unprepared we are to be isolated and on our own (super interesting article on the downsides of the nuclear family in this kind of disaster)

-the effects of shutting down large swaths of economic activity which ripple through our world (which is not a reason to rush to resume normal activity! - just a reality)

-And a national government that is manifestly unable to generate the technology we need (testing), the production we need (components of the tests), or the sense of selflessness solidarity and resolve that would pull us through this stronger and wiser. 

I want to be optimistic for the future, as some of your experts are, but our social capital — shared norms, networks and trust — has been weakened by our politics...just when need it most. 

Most grateful to the thoughtful governors and public health officials. They instill confidence if not hope."

This is infuriating to read. Many of us are trying really hard to never leave our houses or apartments, except to get essentials from the drug store or do a quick round of exercise. Our efforts to help stamp this out are being flagrantly undermined by ignorant, misinformed fellow citizens who think the rules don't apply to them. In part because of this, I fear we're all going to be shut in until a vaccine arrives."
2020-04-19 03:48:22,"I'm not seeing the Trump optimism.  When he waves his hands, things are not going to return to normal.  This doesn't even take a lot of thought.  Even if Trump's base returns to life as in December, the economy will only bump a little.  The smart folks (the ones who don't like dying) are not going out until there are effective drugs or a vaccine on the market.  This isn't going to be anytime soon.  We may have a 50% economy by fall, but it will take a couple of years to return to normal, if then."

Making predictions with an unknown foe is fraught with potential errors.  However, we do know that society recovered from previous scourges relatively intact as long as the death rates were below 50% or so.  The potential loss of institutional knowledge and knowledge in general though may well be an insurmountable problem at death rates below 50%.  Such a loss in a technologically dependent society could prove to be fatal in the long run.

That said, people who avoid crowds, wear n95 masks when around any potential vector and follow basic infection precautions will likely avoid infection.  It is going to be increasingly difficult in high density areas.  These areas are going to see a marked change in life style.  We may well see a move to the rural areas if a secure data skeleton exists there.

May you be born in interesting times.  May you vote the republican cult out of US governance."

2020-04-19 04:02:55,"The strategy that we use to fight Covid needs to look beyond the short term death rates and assess the scenarios for two to five years out. It is unclear to me how important herd immunity is or whether short term death rate is more important than long term death rate, or whether we want to put all of our eggs into the basket of a vaccine. And of course there is the economy that looms over all of this. 

I am not hearing anyone say what our goals are, and then use that to figure out what makes sense for us to do now to achieve those long term goals. Fighting battles without seeing the big picture is not a good way to conduct a war."

This can can achieved by our mass production capabilty,and it is certainly cheaper to produce these masks than to make the ventilators needed in the numbers sufficient to handle patients in the worst case scenarios.
A ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,and certainly there is a reason why soldiers wear helmets and body armor-the same personal responsibilty should be expected of everyone,as well as the obligation to others to prevent making others sick.
Surely an expensive fine,much the same as a speeding ticket would deter many from foolhardy risk taking.

Will Trump dedicate government factories producing PPE to insure military and civilian hospitals will never run out of supplies again?
Testing reagents and swabs? Ventilators and  CPAPs and helmet ventilators?  Science labs working to develop rapid testing, antibody testing, and vaccines?  

I’m for free markets but reality is that hospitals buy thinking months in advance.  Private lab research requires funding.  Government has to produce thinking and results years in advance. And sell to hospitals at cost when the next crisis hits. 

An anti-science, thinking-from-his-gut-President is ill equipped to get us out of this crisis and prevent the next.  Wishful thinking in January, and February got us to the mess of March and April. Badly done."

Eradication of community transmission changes everything. Combine this with strong border control and quarantine of new arrivals, and well-resourced public health services to contact trace and isolate contacts of the occasional case that slips through the net. Testing of course, with Covid 19 on every respiratory pathogen panel in every hospital microbiology lab.

Society can safely emerge from hiding.

Maybe, just maybe if enough smart governors and medical experts take command, we can do it. Testing and tracking the virus is obviously at the forefront. People testing negative can go back to work and get the economy chugging along, buying time until we find a vaccine or antibody to tackle the virus. Finding either a vaccine or antibody, critical as it is, may not happen soon. And a lack of funding toward this goal will cost lives. The article didn't explain why a pill taken daily, presumably loaded with a vaccine or antibody, would be quicker to produce than shots. Maybe I can locate the answer elsewhere. But, back to my point—the country and the world needs to be educated with this kind of straight forward, totally non-political information. It's understanding what we must do that will save us."
2020-04-19 05:28:47,"“It will be a frightening schism,” Dr. David Nabarro, a World Health Organization special envoy on Covid-19, predicted. “Those with antibodies will be able to travel and work, and the rest will be discriminated against.”

And whose fault is that? Somewhere along the line this effort has evolved from flattening the curve so as to not overwhelm the healthcare system, to preventing any and all infections. Which is it? The message and the strategy is woefully badly articulated. We don't know what the exact game is or how to keep score. If we stuck with the original intent of flattening the curve, we would have plenty of people with immunity."

It is possible, or is it,  for a virus (as in some hepatitis B patients) to be ""carried"" in a recovered COVID patient. If carriers exist, they may well infect many others in society unknowingly. Needs examination by the experts though we would hope that the antigen would remain positive even as the antibody appeared so these persons could be identified rapidly.

One of the amazing things about South Korea is that they recommend that people don't do things, rather than making it a legal requirement, and they generally do it. Makes life a lot easier.

It is used in other countries to boost children's ability to fight off respiratory infections. It has been used safely for 100 years. There are 2 current studies, one in the Netherlands and one in Australia, where it is being given to physicians and other health care workers in a blind study, half get the vaccine and half get a placebo.

So they went off their meds only to figure out later, when they crashed into chaos again, that they had felt good because they had been taking the medicine, and not because they had control of their brain chemistry. 

Our country has been on medication to stabilize public health. That medicine is social distancing. We may be feeling good right about now, but that’s because we are taking our medicine, not because we have control of this virus.

2020-04-19 06:26:31,"History repeats itself.

Over several years, consumer spending/investment dropped, causing steep declines in industrial output and employment as failing companies laid off workers. By 1933, the Great Depression reached its lowest point, 15 million Americans were unemployed. It was when President Hoover (R), appointed a Cabinet consisting largely of wealthy, business-oriented conservatives, established many commissions that were sponsored by private donors rather than by the government, and spent large amounts of money on farmers. It was an era of income inequality dangerous market speculation over valuing stock. There was the tariff war that Hoover started as well.

Hoover alienated the African Americans and to cut immigration to the United States he signed an executive order requiring individuals to have employment before migrating to the United States. With the goal of opening up more jobs for U.S. citizens, Secretary of Labor William N. Doak began a campaign to prosecute illegal immigrants in the United States. Doak’s campaign most strongly affected Mexican Americans.  Deportations were overseen by state and local authorities who acted on the encouragement of Doak. During the 1930s, approximately one million Mexican Americans were forcibly ""repatriated"" to Mexico; approximately sixty percent of those deported were birthright citizens.

Hoover avoided direct federal intervention, feared that allowing individuals on welfare would permanently weaken the country.

Next was war"

Experts believe that somewhere between 48 and 60 percent of the population may ultimately be infected with this virus.  Unless other factors such as a vaccine (likely at least a year away) or reductions in virus cases because of warmer weather (not really supported by current evidence) reduce the virus’ impact, the same number of cases, and largely the same number of fatalities, will occur regardless of lockdowns and social distancing.  It will just take longer and our hospitals will be less overwhelmed, which will save some lives.

Until there is a vaccine, this is far from over.  Like he has always done, our President is looking for the easy way out of this trap.  Think of all his bankruptcies and how many times he has stiffed creditors or contractors.  Our country is in this trap through his negligence, and there is no easy way out.  The choices are American lives, American livelihood, or really hard work testing, contact tracing, and isolating over the next year or two.  This last option will be anathema to the crazy, assault weapon toting “don’t tread on me” right.  Our President will never do this and so we will will pay for our livelihood and our liberty with American lives.

How is this making America great again?"
2020-04-19 07:27:35,"The 800 pound gorilla in the room that no one wants to talk about is world over population and crowding.  World population is now nearly 8 billion, up from 2 billion in 1930, and 1 billion in 1800, and going up over 80 million people a year, every year for the last few decades.

We should all support birth control efforts more, everywhere, but especially in the poor half of the world where the birth rates are so high. Then the whole world can enjoy the many benefits of a flat and falling population, especially more living space for each human, and more habitat for the natural world.

Hello, has anyone heard of the very large problem of global warming, which is not helped in any way by a growing human population that consumes more and more every year?

Do we all want to live in a very crowded country like China, that requires very strict and authoritarian government to control pandemic diseases and many other societal problems?

World air travel has doubled in 10 years, and is up 10 times since 1975, to 4.3 billion passenger flights per year.  Why are we better off with such risks of human disease transmission with so many people traveling everywhere?  And why are we better off with rising noise and air pollution everywhere with so many planes flying?

Why are we better off with ever more crowded cities, and ever more humans and goods traveling everywhere, raising the risks of both human and natural world disease transmission, everywhere?"
2020-04-19 08:00:03,"South Korea is reporting a 2% reinfection rate, this early in the outbreak. There is a chance that - observed over a longer period of time - this 2% might rise significantly. To me this would mean that either our bodies don't produce viable antibodies or that the immunity from those is very short lived. 

Since any and all vaccines rely on the immune system to work (they just trick it into thinking it's been infected and to produce fitting antibodies) this would be very problematic. Either there can be no vaccine at all or it would have to be re-administered on something like a weekly basis.

This can't be provided by the medical system, it would have to be ""over-the-counter"", which the FDA probably would have kittens about. Also there is the price. Imagine paying $10.000 a year for your weekly Corona vaccination.

I just HOPE I'm wrong. But if I'm right the phrase ""Live as we know it"" doesn't even touch on the changes needed for humanity to survive. We would be a species under constant threat, just one step away from catching a deadly disease, over and over again, until - at some point in time - our bodies simply would give up. 

Life expectancy would plummet like a rock. And any disruption to our lives, like wars, strikes, economic crisis, even just a fire at a chemical plant or distribution center, would have dire consequences. People would die. How does politics deal with that? Force ""essential"" workers to work? Ban unions? Martial law?

Tough times ahead, friends..."

How can I and hope to avoid exposure?  I survived AIDS and this is even harder BUT I will survive it by not taking any risks until treatment comes along, it’s that simple."
2020-04-19 09:10:17,"People living in advanced economies forget that infections diseases had been the leading killer until improvements in social hygiene, and the invention of vaccines and antibiotics.  They remain the leading cause of death in many developing countries.  We remember the black plaque and the 1918 flu epidemics, but in fact, syphilis and tuberculosis have had epidemics lasting centuries and killing more people than any other cause throughout history.  Without antibiotics, these infections would still be the leading cause of death worldwide, as there are still no effective vaccines.  In that light, and without effective anti-viral agents and vaccines against Covid-19, we could indeed be living with it for a long time."
2020-04-19 09:16:32,"We are destroying the lives of hundreds of millions of people over a disease that, if its deaths increased tenfold, would still be less than the number people killed by smoking every year.

That is not to diminish the tragedy of any death. But people are reacting to fear more than to an accurate assessment of risk
7500 people died in the us yesterday. Only a fraction from Covid-19. Is a Covid-19 death somehow worth more attention than a car accident? 40,000 people die in car accidents every year and yet we have not banned driving unil a cure is found.

Hiding in our homes, ceasing to live life, and inducing widespread suffering until someone has found a way to eliminate all risk from life is not sustainable or realistic.

We need to find a way to help those who are most vulnerable to reduce their potential for exposure. But it can't be making most of the population never leave home again for two years. That's crazy. This is not a police state."
2020-04-19 09:18:51,"The virus was/is an test on our society worldwide.
It has shown that our economy is not robust (Everything that starts to fray at the edges after 2 weeks shutdown IS NOT)

2020-04-19 09:25:06,"You are missing one fact that should shorten the quarantine. Specifically, since the virus travels in stealth mode, and often doesn't present symptoms, it's spreading immunity silently too. Guesses range from 25% to 100% times the number of infected people with symptoms.

So, instead of 735,000 Americans infected now, at 25%, we'd have 900,000 true infections.

But we don't know much of anything because Trump has failed to test. Does this confer immunity? We don't know because we don't test. Is it safe to open up? We don't know because we don't test. Why do some people get hit harder? We don't know because we don't test.

And, we could fully open up safely IF we could test, then contract trace anyone exposed to that positive individual and quarantine them as well. The worst inconvenience most people would get would be a two-week stay at home order.

Since we started late, we'd need to be able to do 100 million tests a month but the number would drop as we gained control.

I'd give Trump a week to get adequate testing plans in place, and if he didn't, I'd immediately remove him (and Pence) from office. We really can't wait till November for competence to arrive in the West Wing."

What else could we have expected given the lack of courage, fear or aversion to take very hard decisions early that the people might not have agreed with?

All those responsible knew this would happen if nothing was done to quickly isolate those geographic areas where the virus hit hardest. 

China proved that was the only rational choice, Italy cut off the North, Spain, France, Nordics and most countries impacted closed both external and internal borders, shut down travel without a ""pass"" - the only way to slow spread to places where there were no cases. 

""Isolation"" NOT as targeting but for the opportunity to focus ALL medical and financial, psychiatric and social efforts to support those first centres rather than allow the spread cross the country, making it harder and harder to offer/pay for/find the personnel to deal with a spreading threat nationwide.

Choices were made for what experts and deciders believed were the best reasons they had, around the world.  

Those decisions/choices are only proven right or wrong far too late. 

Finally, it is always harder to be truly effective in a Democracy .. much easier in a centrally controlled State with an all powerful executive. That is not what Americans would easily accept, whatever the threat - but the price for that preference will be very high."

2020-04-19 10:00:24,"Most educated people are unable to accept the fact that a virus can bring so much misery due to their strong belief that they can always manipulate Nature as they wish. For the first time in living memory, Human race as a whole has been challenged by Nature. Countries with weaker economies have decided to avoid the virus rather than fight with it by enforcing strict lockdowns. Richer countries are not showing signs of fear and are challenging the virus by refusing to curtail their freedom of movement. 
It is a time to choose between of human lives and Dollars."
2020-04-19 10:02:00,"We have to listen to the experts, but can't rely only on the scientists to guide us forward.

The idea that we can remain closed down for months, that we can segregate the elderly, the infirm, the sick, isn't tenable. Repeated closures, cell phone tracking –- all the proposed solutions are extremely complicated.

Imagine you are 95 and don't even get to decide how you want to live the rest of your life? Perhaps live a bit longer in isolation, perhaps die sooner but with family and friends. Shouldn't that be your choice? 

Our political leaders need to listen to the scientists but they also need to listen to the psychologists, the sociologists, the educators, the economists, the philosophers. How we come out of this stronger may have much less to do with medical advances than we may think. 

We have seen that poorly funded public health systems are disasters waiting to happen. France (where I live) has been reducing medical budgets for years and French emergency room doctors had been on strike for months before the virus arrived. The U.S. private health system is a disaster. If we had a strong public health system in place, with ample beds, protective gear and ventilators, we may have been able to avoid any massive shutdown. 

If we fail to address the outrageous inequality – economic, racial, social -- in our society then the current situation may simply be a prelude to something far more lethal than COVID-19."

In that case, they might have spare vaccine plant capacity."" 

Why not thinking about the same scenario in the US? Why don't we hope that the virus moves quickly through NYC, Miami, or Boston? We would lose millions of citizen but we would achieve herd immunity. If we lift the lockdown, remove social distancing, and reopen the economy, we will certainly achieve this."
2020-04-19 10:05:02,"This comprehensive and provocative article is basically excellent with one glaring exception. It states flatly that ""the incubation period for the virus is 14 days"".  Not true. This too-common error  should have been caught during proof-reading.

The incubation period for the disease called COVID19 ranges from a couple of days to approximately 14 days. This range is based on solid empirical data (observations of many COVID19 patients by epidemiologists).  The ""magic number"" of 14 days is the UPPER LIMIT of the COVID19 incubation period. Based on the data gathered in examining many past cases, the median incubation period for this disease is believed to be around 5.5 days.

In a related and often incorrectly understood process, the period of quarantine used for COVID19 is set at 14 days because healthy people who have had significant virus exposures either will or will not develop symptoms/signs of COVID19 at some point within 14 days of their putative exposures. Exceptions are extremely rare.  The logic that underpins the mechanism of quarantine is obvious. The process automatically accomplishes preemptive isolation of new contagious disease cases at the earliest possible moment."

The third thing will be a changed profile of jobs and employment shifting to flexibility in work place and conditions. Finally, more and more societies demanding more accountability and socually oriented governance agenda, specially a better public health quality and access, from respective governments."

This is the ""Gold-Standard"" of modern science and while mandatory for a vaccine or suitable for laboratory studies involving thousands of mice, it is exactly the wrong approach to treating human beings in a pandemic. We have useful data involving baseline morbidity and mortality (or would have if we had wide-scale and reliable testing). Now is not the time to be entering an 18-24 month pipeline toward peer-reviewed journal articles establishing ""science"" with an arbitrary level of significance. For the sake of people, society and health-care workers we must find a way to lower the death toll and hospitalization time, and let science argue about this in the future."

Every country needs to have their own means of producing vaccines, testing equipment, and medications. Every country need to be able to produce at least 80-90% of the food needed for their population. It is wrong to allow or expect/allow a few countries to produce life essential things, dead wrong.

Huge improvements must be made in access to medical care and treatment. Huge improvements must be made to the social welfare system in the US. Strong laws must be passed to protect people from discrimination in all aspects of life and consequences of the person and/or company committing the offense are is swift and severe with decades in prison for the people and the removal of all licenses to do business for the company. Work from home must be a legally protected option.

Housing, food, water, medical treatment, education and work must be legally protected and made available to everyone. Pollution must be cleaned up not just buried deeper.

It is also time for EVERY nation to put the needs THEIR people first and this includes the US. Failure to do so will kill a billion or more in a shorter period. We cannot take care of the world. Human beings must take care of themselves first if they wish to take care of others."

2020-04-19 10:59:04,"There is a better approach. Treat every county in the U.S. exactly the same. Lock them all down for 60 days. During that time, in some safe, secure locations, ramp up testing capacity. Devote whatever resources are necessary to get testing levels up to a point where they can monitor small outbreaks early. Quarantine people who become infected.

In short, reduce the virus to near zero prevalence, nationwide, and then, when the virus starts to re-emerge, isolate it, and reduce it again. Repeat as often as necessary until a vaccine becomes available. 

The key to doing that is treating the entire nation alike, and timing the cure the same everywhere. That, of course, is a non-starter politically, because President Trump will not be able to see any way to get electoral advantage out of it. He wants a,""solution,"" which lets him pick and choose—punish enemies, reward friends, and lavish resources on those who might swing either way. Down that road is protracted agony for the nation."

All of these so-called 'two-dozen experts' didn't see COVID-19 coming and they have no immediate safe and effective plan to control the Mother Nature of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is no 'scourge'.  COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign.  Outside of a living host cell a virus is an inert camouflaged chemical chameleon with a genetic information package poised to hijack cell machinery in order to reproduce itself.

Among the 1200+ types of coronavirus that are naturally endemic to 1200+ species of bats are four types that cause the common cold, SARS-1 and MERS.  The coronaviruses seem to favor an intermediate mammal hosts before jumping to humans like camels, civets and pangolins.

It isn't in the evolutionary fit interests of COVID-19 to kill it's hosts. COVID-19 is driven in infect and spread to as many living host cells as possible for as long as possible. 

Favoring contagion power over lethality is the most effective long term strategy. A long asymptomatic contagion period aka 14 days is brilliant in it's simplicity.

Although the difficulties have been increased by having a president who has more faith in his own hunches than he does in facts, I think this article also reveals that we have some systematic problems.  

The highly fractured privatized health care system and equally fractured system of governments makes it difficult for us to develop a comprehensive and efficient response. In most instances a fractured competitive system leads to more experimentation and innovation, but in a time of emergency it does not work as well.

The high value we place on individuality and freedom (for those who have enough money to be free) could prove to be the greatest barrier to our ability to respond intelligently.   

The only ray of hope I see on the horizon is that when all those sharks teeth finish chewing us up, one city and county at a time, that the devastated populations in rural America will finally realize that we would be better off with a national health care system and a single payer insurance scheme.

I'd expect a deep depression to set in for many when they realize this is going to be a long-haul process. That there is just no way we can go back to crowded bars, theatres, stores and sports arenas anytime soon. That many of our businesses and jobs have disappeared for good. That we may be facing a long-term unemployment rate of 20% or higher. That college campuses may not be able to operate. 

For those living in places like NYC, much of why they lived there was the access to restaurants, theatres, museums and other crowded venues. Why live in a place like this if you're going to basically stay home and cook? 

I think far too many are counting on a miracle vaccine to arise. It doesn't help that our government leaders have been more or less telling us that we will have one soon and then get back to ""normal"". We desperately need leaders who will tell the truth, even when it's just that they don't know.

We don't know how many people have had subclinical infections, we don't know whether they are immune (perhaps), and therefore we don't know whether most people, because of ""herd immunity"" can resume their normal lives.

We simply don't have enough testing, nor the right kind of testing, nor enough scientific evidence to make these determinations. We don't even have accurate statistics about the mortality rate.

We do know that the whole society cannot shelter in place for  18 months, so we must muddle through as best we can, hoping not to overwhelm our healthcare system. That is the purpose of sheltering in place, not avoiding mortality—some mortality is inevitable as we continue forward. All the rest is speculation."

If we multiply that number by 10 (which is a pretty large number) to account for the people who may have had it, we would have 20,000 people that have had the disease.  That means approximately 680,00 have not had the disease.  (We are really practicing social distancing and sheltering at home.

When we reach the peak, the disease will NOT be over.  Flattening the peak simply means not so many people will be getting it at the same time.  680,000 in our county will still possibly get the disease.  Two percent would die.  

It only takes one person who currently has the disease to infect those not yet infected.  The country has to stay closed to completely eliminate the virus (or until we reach herd immunity.  
I plan to stay sheltered until at least a month after our governor has said we can reopen or until we get a vaccine or a treatment.

I also personally know a conservative who lost his father to the coronavirus. And he uses the fact that the coronavirus killed his father to justify his opinion that this whole thing is “overblown.” I was at a loss of words when he told me that.

Carefully staggered approach to reopening, widespread testing and surveillance, a treatment that works, adequate resources for health care providers —  an effective vaccine is certainly the way to go. But this does not account for the idiosyncratic human behavior pattern.

A study at the University College London (UCL) on the  amount of effort required to do something influences what we think we see, suggesting we're biased towards perceiving anything challenging to be less appealing.

""Our brain tricks us into believing the low-hanging fruit really is the ripest,"" says Dr Nobuhiro Hagura, who led the UCL team. ""We found that not only does the cost to act influence people's behavior, but it even change what we think we see.""

Prof Patrick  Haggard (UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience). ""Our results suggest these methods could go beyond changing how people behave, and actually change the way the world looks. Most behavior change focuses on promoting a desired behavior, but our results suggest you could also make it less likely that people see the world a certain way, by making a behavior more or less effort intensive. Perhaps the parent who places the jar of biscuits on a high shelf actually makes them look less tasty to the toddler playing on the floor.""

Incompetent regimes rule around the world, dictators or wannabes at the helm: Trump, Putin, Johnson, Erdogan, Bolsonaro, Duterte, Orban, Abe, Suu Kyi, Xi, all hanker for supreme power at the cost of humanity and competence.  It is no coincidence that it these countries, with their misanthropic philosophies intact, bear the greatest risk and potential tragedy of all nations exposed.  Germany, which historically waltzed with fascism before rejecting it for robust democracy, is the first western country to control the virus and begin to reopen, its losses mitigated by testing borne by social conscience. The Nefarious Nine above simply fiddled while their capitals raged.

Speaking of which, Trump’s response is to rally social strife while his people die in droves. Putin doesn’t have a clue how to treat a spiralling pandemic. Johnson, in a wan attempt to stay home, protect the NHS, and save lives, did the opposite and became a state burden instead and remains so in convalescence. Bolsonaro fired his health minister for preaching health, Abe was asleep at the wheel as the virus rebounded, Orban established a new tyranny, Erdogan likewise, Kyi denies a virus exists, and Xi obfuscates his losses.

you take key facts then completely drop the ball following thru. to wit, you mention the Chinese (who true, lie about as much as the orange guy) took everyone testing positive and quarantined them. yet did you ask some absolutely key questions like 1) how many who tested positive even had symptoms? (most Navy sailors confirmed as infected had NO symptoms) so why all the wrist-slitting when majority have NO symptoms? why does everyone refuse to answer key questions like this? 2) of the Chinese who DID exhibit symptoms why do we *refuse* to create a credible profile of those who DO get sick? in your owns pages, multiple times, you've written how 90% of the sick exhibit a small cluster of well defined preconditions; age, lung conditions and a cluster that majority of the time go together, morbid obesity and its cohorts; high blood pressure, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

2020-04-19 01:14:38,"Sorry folks. 

As long as the US cannot mobilize your vast resources, but consistently fall prey to petty partisan propaganda and shortsighted grifting, you are increasingly irrelevant in any kind of global solution.

This virus is dangerous, much more deadly and contagious than the seasonal flue. But it is not the plague. It can be handled by more rational and less greedy societies, and it will be.

When the US cannot even count your real casualties, but ignore or politicize the toll in many states, how can you ever understand the challenge, or map the real threats? 

When your ""leader"" peddles miracle medicine proven dangerous and unworkable, how can you get a grip? When your president consistently alienate potential national or international allies, who will cooperate with the huckster?

The US is currently unique. Your testing stalls at about 150k per day, and you consistently record about +30k new cases. It's a consistent 20% of the daily tests as a national average. If the US could test more, your positives would explode. If you dared to test your dead, your real casualties too. The US is not India or Brazil, you will not tolerate a 5-10% toll of your population. But how to avoid it with an ostrich approach?

Just face it. The US is a large successful experiment in how not to handle a pandemic. How to divide an already deeply divided nation even further. 

If someone tried to design an attack on the fragile and unsustainable US society, this virus is just perfect."

2020-04-19 11:23:53,"Some thoughts on quotes from the article:

1) ""In truth, it is not clear to anyone where this crisis is leading us.""
Well, I can tell you where this is leading us - recession, depression and collapse. This virus is NOT causing the economy to collapse. The mismanagement by our political overlords is causing the economy to collapse.

2) ""Without a vaccine, the virus is expected to circulate for years . . . ."" 
Yes, the virus has shifted from a pandemic to endemic. Of course the WHO and all the geniuses who run developed countries conveniently ignore this.

3) ""The best hope is that fatalities can be held to a minimum."".
And here is the nub of the problem - hope. Hope is a fool's bargain. Hope is thin gruel. The best solution is to a) accept that the coronavirus is endemic, b) stop this lockdown nonsense and c) accept that people will die from the disease.

Suppression has failed. Now it is all about mitigation. In mitigation, it is prudent to focus on number of deaths. In my view, killing off the global economy will kill many more millions than the virus will. Trump has blundered into the same assessment. However, remember this: just because Trump finally gets it does NOT mean it isn't true. Even a blind man knows when the sun is shining."

As a psychiatrist, I reassure my patients that we will get through this time together, as one. I tell them, that maybe the silver lining in this will be the destruction of the system of injustice that is prevalent and the formation of a true democracy where the government cares for the weak, the old, the orphan and the needy. I reassure them that we need to rely on each other more and be there to lend a hand to all who may need it. I tell them to protest by making sure they vote in November.

We need to think less about locking up the entire country, and more about locking up the people who run our nations nursing homes - that's where 70% of the problem is.

Potentials: Fauci and company need to come up with a viable long term plan, and disregard the daily spam show! Perhaps the proposed vaccines, immunities and procedures, will change annually or more frequently, just as our current flu vaccines do, for periodic, scientific updates against this ever changing virus. We have the best, let them do the rest!

Futures: We must end discriminations against all groups/classes and countries, to keep ourselves unbiased and functioning to address this plague, which it is. 

We need to help and maintain all of our governments, and our local, state and federal businesses and economies,  functioning without prejudice or bias, for us to continue to succeed.

Instead of finding ways to control the spread of the virus, he wants to bow down to some foolish protersters, whose main demand is that public places should open so that they can enjoy their life as before. How will we keep the virus at bay, asks some. As long as the beaches and other public hotspots kept opened for the public, there is no way that you can keep the virus at bay. It will also depend on how individual Americans behave during this quarantine time. I presume that Trump is running short of ways and ideas to control the virus spread. I adviise him to put down his ‘dignity’ for sometime, and take views from experts from medical field, from administration and if need he can take help from those nations which are handling the situation far far better than the US.

Wish they would.  Can’t see Republicans backing him with the country in such dire straits.

We need to continue isolation until testing can be ramped up.  The plans that are in place definitely need tweaking and more money thrown at all citizens.  If the whole country would just shut down for a few months, with only necessary people working and also supplied with adequate protection, we could get a better handle on transmission, but Trump can’t handle that level of leadership, so as many people as possible will just have to stay at home for the next few years.

  The future depends on authentic, honest, inspirational and visionary leadership.  As paraphrased from the book of proverbs,  where there is no vision, the people perish.  

 Whether clearly recognized or not, the United States along with the rest of the world has embarked on a new reality.  This new reality is one in which highly contagious microbes are with us into the foreseeable future, maybe forever.  The next major assault is potentially escalating climate change and depletion of natural resources.  We are currently as unprepared for these as we were for the pandemic.

There will be no return to what was perceived as normal before the pandemic.  Of course, in the shortterm, there will be an attempt to return to business as usual, with disastrous consequences."

One line from Mr. McNeil's essay does stand out: ""In truth, it is not clear to anyone where this crisis is leading us."" How do we parse the experts' comments? I do not know, but suspect multiple takes are, for now, fine."
2020-04-19 02:09:10,"There is a reason Trump is in favor of opening the country before it is safe. His puppet masters know this will cause a relapse of the pandemic as it did in 1918. Trump wants this. He wants the pandemic to last for two reasons.
1. The country will go back to being shut down and he will not have to deal with how to open the economy. Plus he can put the blame on the governors for opening things too soon.
2. If the pandemic is still on close to the election he will try to delay the election so he can remain in office."

It's terrible that Trump and Republican governors like DiSantis don't seem to care for the lives of Americans.  Trump incites protests against shut-downs for public health reasons in states with Democratic governors.  DiSantis opens the beaches.  According to the article cited here, 30% more Trump-supporters than Democrats are likely to die as they are older and more vulnerable.  Surely that should matter, or will the cult of Trump overwhelm reason in the name of an empty ""liberty""?"

So the US is only number 9 in terms of death per million.  Not GOOD, but it does show that Trump is NOT the worst among world leaders.

Remember always that the NYT is out to make Trump look bad (and he does deserve some blame) and they will leave out facts which show that he has not done that badly.

Fighting the virus and blaming Trump are NOT the same enterprise.  True, Trump does deserve some blame, but so do Cuomo and de Blasio who slept while California and Washington were active.  Thus California has a rate of death per million of 29 and New York's rate is 901.  THAT second number is NOT Trump's doing.

2020-04-19 05:56:46,"A useful article.  Thank you Mr. McNeil.  

I am 71 and more than concern for myself and my wife I worry what will the next 10 years be like for my daughter and all her friends.  This is a nasty virus. Certainly social distancing works to slow the spread, but how long can millions of people stay at home with no work and no income?  Planning on the assumption that some day soon there will be a vaccine, or a drug. or ""herd"" immunity is foolish because we do not even know whether  or not there will be a ""when"".

Our hospitals and medical workers are in dire need of support.  Equally so for the huge number of unemployed.  People will need food, housing, clothing, education.  Tax revenues will be stagnant at best.  If we are to hold our social fabric together for future generations, we must borrow.   But who will be lenders?  Quantitative easing?  

I believe a 3 year plan that will run in many trillions of dollars that provides security to every citizen is mandatory.  The alternative could be an ugly confrontation as people become desperate and afraid.  We are the United States and so let us act like it.  This requires a change in leadership in Congress and the Presidency.  Trump and the Republican Senate have had their chance and their failure must not be allowed to continue.  The crisis is severe and stern, thoughtful action is mandatory"
2020-04-19 06:21:40,"What about the fact that no health expert has publicly addressed the casual sex and hook-up app problem? How about announcing the brutal truth that no matter what other measures are taken, the virus will continue to spread as long as people are continuing to have sex with people who are not already members of their household? Isn’t this a huge gaping hole in the (often excessive, neurotic) safety measures being taken? 

From a quality-of-life perspective, what’s going to be done about most humans’ need for professional hair care? Do we all shave our heads or walk around for six months or a year like newly released POWs? We’re getting into the crazy zone. Certainly, by June 1, small businesses, including hair salons, must reopen. Maybe the workers and customers all get their temperatures taken and at least the employees (in the case of hair salons) wear masks and wash their hands between customers. Precautions taken but moving forward and allowing small businesses to provide needed, valued services."

You can't run an entire economy by just having the government print more and more money while people stay in their homes. (Supposedly Southern Italy is already starting to become a ticking time bomb as its poor people eat through their savings.)

Complete economic devastation could easily start problems that would be ten times as lethal as the virus. Remember the Great Depression laid the foundation for WWII."
2020-04-19 09:53:13,"Thank you for your research. Your article was both sad and scary. Frankly, I don't believe our numbers are correct. Houston, Harris county I feel has not tested enough people to get an accurate view of what's going on. Our numbers are really low for a metropolitan area and I'm perplexed as to why we don't get more in house glimpses of what is truly going on in the local hospitals. Here in Houston one would think no one is truly infected because we have few that are dying. True we are not as dense as San Fran or NYC, but our numbers trouble me. 

I know of 2 people who probably had Coronavirus:  both went to Urgent Care; both were sent home, untested for Corona, tested negative for 'regular' flu and were told, ""only call 911 or go to ER if you feel like you are dying"". One figured she had Corona because she started hallucinating. Both were dreadfully ill for about 2 weeks and stayed home. So far, no other family members have gotten sick. 

Folk are getting restless, and not respectful of COVID-19. They are not wearing masks, not practicing social distancing  (in my neighborhood in many homes family members come and go). If people are getting anxious, getting restless, how do we contain The Beast amongst us???? I do believe the low numbers here give people a false sense of security.

All of this is so surreal: our possibly new reality. Who would have ever thought that a microscopic virus would shut down darn near the entire world in a matter of, truly, a few days?"

2020-04-19 10:24:36,"One aspect of this ""crisis"" that nobody is writing about is how isolated most Americans are from death these days. 

I grew up on farm out in rural East Texas where birth and death were as common as sunrise and sunset.   I don't mean just in animals, but, in people too.

First, back when I grew up, the local hospital was tiny, and, very limited in what it could do.   When people got cancer, they died.   When people had a heart attack, they died.   

Most of the time, honestly, people died and nobody had any idea how it happened.   

But, the next day Keri Ann gave birth to her new baby Andrew.    And Susan and Jim had a boy whom they named James.  

And, the cow we named Sally turned up missing.   I personally walked the fields for days but could not find her.   Eventually, when I stopped looking, I found her.   She was not coming back.  But, Sassy gave birth a healthy little calf.

Now, Americans are addicted to knowing every detail of how someone died and how much money they spent trying not to die before it caught up with them.   

Americans seem, honestly, to believe that dying is for people from Mexico, or India, or China.

But, ladies and gentlemen and and reporters from America:  Dying is for all of us.

And, 1200 extra dead bodies a day in a population of 360,000,000 is not exactly going to result in a substantial reduction in the population.   

This from an old man that grew used to death back in the day when it was not a novelty in American life."
2020-04-19 10:49:44,"The face of the federal government in the ""war"" against the coronavirus is Donald Trump. He's backed up by an administration who dutifully echo his words and advance his ""agenda."" 
That ""agenda"" seems to be giving people the ""freedom"" to spread the virus and get sick. Mike Pence said the social distancing at the Air Force Academy was politically correct. What? 
I think it will be possible to reopen parts of the nation soon without devastating results, but those places will not be the ones where the coronavirus has not yet struck. The headlines say that the virus is spreading to the suburbs and popping up in rural areas. 
It's a sad story. One person in a group spreads the infection and then the victims spread it to others. It can happen anywhere and it will happen, especially in places where people don't perceive danger."

2020-04-19 10:02:15,"My present concern is that this anti-shutdown, antigovernment, pro ""liberty"" movement so very foolishly egged on by Trump will lead to rash behavior and too rapid ""opening"" in parts of the country. Already in these rallies we see folks disregarding distancing guidelines. It is as if this part of the population simply decided that they were done with this, so it is over. 

It is stunning that the POTUS, who one day was laying out a reasonable, if vacuous and shallow, ""plan"" for reopening, could suddenly tweet his support. It is as if he, too, thinks that it can all just be over because he is tired of it all. That only shows that he still does not really understand what is happening. Repeated shut-down moves will be harder and harder to call and enforce. That is truly sad and likely will be tragic for many"

Yet, all the outsourcing and failures in domestic production are real.  The U.S. needs a health industrial policy which it clearly does not have.  Neither bashing nor simply befriending the Chinese is a sufficient response.  In contrast, we need a way to make the economy responsive to urgent needs by socializing the economy, i.e. giving networks of communities the power to organize the R&D and production necessary to protect lives."

NY is going to take much longer than Ohio, California or Washington state to reopen.  Perhaps some more focus on the reporting of the localized responses can help citizens determine who actually leads their states and cities well and what approaches are working and not working.  That is what we need to know.  

The local health expert in Ohio,  a relative unknown before this crisis focused on one thing,  she just did her job.  It would be great to have a panel of the state and local health officials in your next article.  Many local health officials are on the ground doing the job, working with the politicians in their state’s and making progress.  They will be the ones that guide a successful reopening.  They are the real “health experts” fighting this virus."

The irony could not be starker, as communities under lockdown flee to parks and beaches at the first opportunity, putting themselves and others at risk, those less fortunate are forced to make heartbreaking choices, with leisure being a distant thought. An out of work migrant worker in Gurgaon, India, pawned his mobile phone for $30 dollars so that his family could eat before committing suicide.

Governments all over must ignore optics and double down on the difficult choices. There aren't easy ones especially in India and Brazil. Lockdowns in these places have been inconsistent, with many flouting them. There may not be a clear milestone for easing restrictions. Those on temporary jobs need to get back to work.

The article mentions that Brazil and India both have large vaccine industries, and, ""If the virus moves rapidly through their crowded populations"" they could develop herd immunity and free up capacity for export.  But Brazil is not particularly crowded. It  has a third fewer people than the US in a space larger than the 48 states.  

Famous images of Brazil are the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, but near 95% of Brazilians don't live in favelas even if they're poor.  Most live in single-family homes on paved streets across sprawling towns and cities. Rio is crowded mainly because it's built like Hong Kong, tucked between mountain and ocean. 

More hopefully for building herd immunity without extreme suffering, both India and Brazil have younger populations than the US or Europe or even China.  Brazilians are also relatively healthy. Besides strong preventive public-health programs, minimal opioid abuse, and three times as many hospital beds per capita as India, Brazilians smoke a third fewer cigarettes on average as Americans, and a fifth of what Italians smoke.

Hospital admissions are decreasing, that’s good news! The models used for projections are being fed real-time data and they are improving dramatically, that’s good news! Many hospitals, including in NYC where my daughter is an ER nurse, responded very positively, had adequate equipment and supplies, and were not in a state of chaos, again,that’s all good news! The truth is there are many health care facilities that are very poorly run and struggle during normal times.

Where we stand now is pretty clear. Nothing will go back to normal until there is a cure and a vaccination. 

What will testing do for us? It will create three classes of people, those who tested and came up negative, those who tested and came up positive and those who haven't tested at all. As far as the latter two groups go, they need to stay at home if they haven't reached the point of hospitalization yet. 

As far as the tested go, they may be able to resume some semblance of normalcy if they spread out and wear masks and take other precautions. That said, even the tested and normal can contract the virus on a moment's notice and become new carriers. What are we going to do, test everyone, every day, every hour. For that we'd need some kind of thermometer-like device."
2020-04-19 12:23:25,"Unfortunately the media report mountains of statistics and public health experts appear to make decisions based on mountains of statistics, but all those statistics appear to be bunk.  Testing for the coronavirus so far has been rendered useless for two reasons:  1) Testing is not readily available; and 2) Testing is inaccurate, with a 20-30% false negative rate.  (These facts have been reported in the NYT, and confirmed to me by my doctor, an infectious disease specialist at Mt Sinai in NYC.) In fact, in CT, where one needs a referral from a doctor to get a test, the positive rate is only 30%, which implies that either people are not getting COVID-19 or the testing is inaccurate.

Furthermore, the antibody studies in Santa Clara suggest that there are 50-80 times as many people with the antibodies than have tested positive in the county.  This, combined with the paucity and inaccuracy of the testing, implies that the virus has spread through much, much more of the population than public health officials and the media report.

But this is good news, because it appears that the vast majority of people are either asymptomatic or have symptoms so mild as to not require medical attention.  And it could mean that more people than thought are developing an immunity.  However, it also means that large swaths of unsuspecting people are transmitting the virus.  

These are the factors that we need to consider as we map our way forward through this pandemic."

The masks cost pennies, so retooling factories to mass produce or getting the government to produce them seems like a no brainer to me, but all of the talk is about vaccines or treatment. 

I have worn masks when sanding wood, working in the garden (allergic to mulch), making art and now when I leave my apartment.  It's not ideal, but it is better than dying.   I know some companies like 3M are trying to double their production of the N 95, but still that is not going to be enough.

2020-04-19 03:10:57,"'America could be divided into two classes, ones who had the virus and recovered, and those who are yet to', reads frighteningly like the opening lines of a dystopian thriller. But unlike a work of fiction, the effects of the pandemic are unravelling inducing a sense of deja Vu among afficionados of doomsday epics. This is not without it's sense of satire though, as sitting in India, I read about morons in Florida flocking to reopened beaches, while a desperate migrant worker sells his mobile phone for $30, hands the money over to his starving family, before hanging himself to death. Juxtapose the two, it's more satire than tragedy.

The disease is already accelerating the average daily death toll in many nations, eclipsing the number of daily cancer and cardiac deaths in America. The toll in India is still 'only' 521, almost flippant when you consider that 25 people die in motor accidents every hour and an age old tuberculosis scourge still claims 1400 lives a day. The shrill reaction of the Indian news channels appears disconnected from reality, do they milk the epidemic for all the airtime it's worth or debate the looming starvation that awaits the daily wage labourers, induced by the lockdown? It's an Hobbesonian choice.

A vaccine is still months away, but the needed scale to inoculate billions does not bode well. Will a terrible price be exacted from the poor, let's say sub Saharan Africa to access the drug? Will it only reinforce the economic divide? Time will tell."

In spite of all the wealth, all the hospitals, all the health care workers, a lot of brilliant epidemiologists and scientists, the one constant is  a inept Republican President, inept Republican members of Congress whose ONLY goal is power (as opposed to concern about the health of Americans), foolish governors (Florida's irresponsible DeSantis)  and misguided-cult of supporters. This has caused chaos, dysfunction and disunity thoughout the country. 

When you have a President urging on protestors to ""open up"", insulting scientists who know more in one finger than Trump knows in a lifetime about health care (he was too busy practicing corruption), creating division, denying responsibility, shifting blame for purely political purposes, you know, that any reasonable person with half a brain, would understand as plain as day,  your President is a unmitigated disaster.  He needs to go. 

You had the chance in the impeachment, because Trump clearly obstructed justice, and abused his powers. But - guess what?, a bunch of old, out of touch, white, wealthy  Republican Senators starting with Mitch McConnell, ever bent on preserving his power, conducted a sham trial, a farce, a disgrace in the Senate.

Yes, testing needs to ramp up a lot, but it's not going to happen quickly enough, and not be as accurate as it should be. And yes, people who are older, infected, and have symptoms, need to stay home for the most part. And yes, a vaccine would be great, if we ever get one - which is far from certain. Is there one for the common cold? No. But for perhaps 300 million people, we don't need to continue being shut-ins. We can't and won't be able to ""live"" this way.

What if the Federal government (especially since they're anti-testing) had 350 million N95 masks manufactured and distributed to us all? We would ALL have to wear them when outside (at all times, other than when having a restaurant meal), and also continue to be physically distance from each other, but to a lesser extent. If resuming somewhat normal lives is possible, who wouldn't agree to abide by the aforementioned two measures? Many (but not all of us) are doing it now, but we ALL need the top-of-the-line mask. We also need enforcement. Police departments should hire non-officers and give them the authority to issue citations. 

We clearly can't go on this way for another ___ months or years, as the country will be crushed economically, and so will our lives and any chance at happiness any time soon. Something has to give and soon!"

They are lying. Lying. Say it, and write that. This isn’t some academic difference of opinion, Trump and his sycophantic toadies are promoting false information and now, in some states that happen to have Democratic governors, straight-up sedition.

What's really exhausting are people's sanctimonious tones -- across the political spectrum. Yes, of course we should prioritize saving as many lives as possible. But yes, it is valid to worry about the economic cost-benefit of a nationwide shutdown, and no, you are not a right-wing conspiracist, you are not killing my grandma, you are not delusional for wanting to open soon. It is legitimate to wonder if closing schools and universities is actually helpful when one of the virus's main targets is nursing homes. It is legitimate to look to countries with different strategies like Sweden, Iceland, and South Korea.

The media reports that this virus is easily transmittable because ~50% of carriers are young, a-symptomatic spreaders, but in the next breath writes that it is ""deadly"" for young people. The Times picks a ""Top Comment"" that says the Covid death rate is 5%; we know this is not the case given testing in Iceland and Germany.

I do not suggest someone made this virus to attack the US, but it has proven perfect to destroy the very fragile US society and economy. In this respect the Covid-19 pandemic is a dire threat to what ""The American way"" has decayed to, over the last 4 decades. 

Kindly note the US is not discussing facts, you do not even employ your wast resources and scientific expertise to seek real knowledge. The US numbers on this pandemic are politically biased, not done in a uniform way, and thus not a solid foundation for viable policies. 

John Hopkins University may make the largest and most reliable mapping of the pandemic on the planet. But it relies on politically biased numbers and lack of testing. Just look at the Florida or Alabama death counts, or the many unregistered deaths outside hospitals, and realize many of your numbers are not from the real world, but made to support various fantasies presented by your joke of a president and his bimbos and errand boys on Fox ""news"".

The world leaders were warned in december, not the least by US intelligence from China. Some prepared for the onslaught others didn't, the US included.

This pandemic proves the US is utterly unable to respond collectively, but very good at grifting , blaming and whining.

After three week of government fiat we added 22,000,000 people to the unemployment roll. If the shut-down continues that number will climb to even more astronomical levels and the population made paupers. So, it is easy to see that the country will re-open in the next few days, at most a couple weeks. and the opinion of medical experts are irrelevant.

It is also clear that people will not accept the mental scurvy, loneliness and frustration now imposed on them by government fiat for more than the same short period of time. The restrictions will be lifted or each day will see hundreds of millions of cases of civil disobedience and what, then, will the government do?

Public acceptance of mutilated civil rights may be tolerated a bit longer but not indefinitely. If police raid churches, synagogues and mosques the public response will be immediate and possibly violent. (How would readers feel about police raids on worshipping Jews come the High Holy Days, what with its Third Reich similarity?)

The country is about to reopen full bore and the ukases of public officials and medical experts will count for nothing.

Obviously at this point we cannot get there from here with Trump in office.  Still I fear that as Trump politically implodes, his narcissism will only make things go from bad to worse. 

During the last months of World War II, Hitler's narcissism was such that he ordered the destruction of Germany's infrastructure, the ""Nero Decree"" given that the German people had failed him and so he wanted all of them to go down with him. Ultimately, I wouldn't expect any real progress until Biden assumes the presidency. 

Until then the monetization of our recovery will continue.  For one, Jared Kushner's Project Airbridge is anything but a lend-lease operation. Instead taxpayers are subsidizing shipments of PPE for around $1million per flight. The PPE is then given chiefly to private distribution companies who sell to whomever--even oversea customers. No lending or leasing in that equation. Instead it is a Trumpian Recovery that bypasses policies, procedures, and laws laid down years ago and borne out in lessons learned from decades of responding to disasters. And so many of us stagnate knowing that a deathly virus is readily around all of us---this is not sustainable."

In the 1918 influenza pandemic, some 75 million people died worldwide out of a total human population of 1.7 billion. That is a death rate of 0.04%.

In the current influenza pandemic, about 150,000 people have died out of a total human population of 8 billion. That is a death rate of 0.000017%.

34,000 US deaths from 675,000 infected people in the USA is a loss of 4.9% of those ill.

150,000 deaths from 2,200,000 infected people worldwide is a loss of 6.7% of those ill.

2020-04-19 11:57:57,"Lockdown is not a black and white option. We can do both.

Set up lockdown zones that range from unrestricted to completely safe. Require people who want to join a specific zone register so we can identify them if their death rate begins to spiral out of control. Open our parks back up, for example, so people will have a place to escape their confinement. Cordon off an unrestricted “Z” zone, say a picnic area or shelter, where those who want to risk their lives and the lives of others can congregate and spread their infection only among the willing. It’ll help develop herd immunity and will sacrifice the lives of only those who chose to risk death. At the other end, assign an “A” safe zone, other picnic areas and walking trails, where responsible and considerate people can gather under prudent rules for safe interactions.

Extend this concept. Open Z zone restaurants and bars. Have Z shopping days, work days, school days. Set up zones at work sites and offices. Set up other appropriate zones as required, maybe an “I” zone for probable immunes and an “H” zone for health care workers.

Now society can focus on isolating Z people so that they don’t spread the virus beyond their zone while also allowing A zone people more places to roam, de-stress, work, and play."

Yes, without a vaccine the virus will circulate. But if we develop more effective treatment, a rising death tally will not necessarily follow.

2020-04-19 12:45:04,"The best article that NY Times has written about Covid-19 in recent days. The fact and truth telling in a widened discussion is admired and appreciated.

China's number of new cases is in single digit and maybe double digits with imported patients, and ours are in 4 digits over one thousand minimum.  China did not allow Wuhan, Nanjing or other cities to reopen until intensive surveillance found zero new cases for 14 straight days, the virus’s incubation period. Compared with China or Italy, the United States is still a playground.

And we dance around the subject of a lockdown with social distancing and wearing masks to entertain our self. We are convinced that that will be enough. Vaccine is around the corner that can help us soon.  But none of those arguments are valid.  

Scientists of Harvard Medical School are constantly in touch with leading Covid-19 scientists in China.  Dr. Bruce Aylward led the WHO investigating team to China and Wuhan in particular.  Their words to combat Covid-19 should be treated carefully and thoughtfully."

Serious depression has so ensnared these people I worry for their lives.

Isn't traveling from abroad, by plane -- mixing with so many people an airport, sitting for many hours in the recirculated air of an airplane, and standing in a crowded customs & immigration line -- far more risky than going to a restaurant, especially one that leaves space between people?

Not saying restaurants should close in phase 1 of the reopening. Just that if it's not safe enough to reopen restaurants, we shouldn't be allowing international travelers either.

It is worth noting that some subset of recovered individuals may experience chronic, or permanent health problems after this virus, like decreased lung, heart or kidney function. Also, at a time when it is clear that air pollution and its associated health effects increase risk of developing more severe viral disease, the Trump administration is pushing ahead with weakening environmental protections while the public's attention is on the COVID-19 catastrophe.

A pun if I may. When I grew up, tetanus toxin was made from horse serum. I was allergic to horse serum. When asked for known allergies, I used to reply horse serum.

Trump keeps feeding the meme that we are past the peak, treatments are available and a vaccine is just around the corner when NONE of these things is true.  And premature reopening will only extend the pain and economic suffering as the virus finds fresh victims and creates new secondary peaks.

The key to Trump's motivation, of course, is re-election, so he keeps pushing the happy talk to boost the stock market while he has his fingers crossed that some of the more optimistic possibilities actually come true in time to save him.  With the challenges to finding safe treatments that work and the realistic time frame to develop AND manufacture a vaccine... which in and of itself is not a slam dunk... it's not a bet I would join in on."

There are financial incentives to do this as hospitals receive substantial funding for every coronavirus case, whether the person dies or not. The media is ignoring the financial incentives on so many levels with the coronavirus situation. Of course the most glaring one is to convince people to panic so that they purchase a vaccine when it comes out, even though the vast majority of people have little to no symptoms. But there are other, behind the scenes financial motives for skewing the numbers, as I describe above, that are being completely ignored by journalists. And sadly, by doing that, they are contributing to the demise of American society far more significantly than the actual damage the virus is doing to people's health."

How to work together to build a nation for all who are willing to pledge that together we can. 

Now we have a divided nation filled with hatred, selfishness, and fear.  Our Federal Government has stated that they have no responsibility, if we are to survive we are on our own.

They are either retired and have a comfortable pension, can work from home without issue, or are independently wealthy and can afford to sit back and ""embrace their down time"". 

I empathize deeply for the people whose lives have been torn apart by the closures and who will never fully recover from the COVID shutdowns. Consider the millions of people losing their jobs, any meager savings they had being decimated and the resulting homeless. People are living in their cars.  That kind of poverty is near impossible to recover from. Contracting the virus (which affects most people in a mild or even asymptomatic form) might be the least of their worries at this point.

The largest group seem to be Millennials, the people from 20 to 35, who are just starting out their lives or had finally found some semblance of security. They had the rug pulled out from under them with these blanket shutdowns. And for what? Cases are still rising, according to reports. Deaths are a lagging indicator, but cases are not and we are entering week 5 of the shutdown.

2020-04-19 13:40:05,"The long term difficulty we are facing is that all of the prescriptive approaches for containing the virus, as described in this article, are predicated on nearly 100% cooperation from the populace. Keeping everyone at home during ordered lock-downs, testing everyone, isolating every positive patient, vaccinating everybody. The reality is that we'll be extremely lucky if we can get 50-60% of the population to comply with even one of these. I do not see anti-vaxxers making an exception and lining up to get a Coronavirus shot once it's available.

Many people have commented that staying alive under a months or years long lock down is not living, it's merely surviving, and as time goes on the number of people willing to endure this is going to decrease, with a corresponding increase in the number of infections. We are barely 3 months into what, compared to other countries, is basically a voluntary effort, and already we're seeing strategies emerge for getting out from under the controls: self-infection, immunity certification, outright defiance. Imagine this scene 6 months or a year from now.

As important as it is to develop the vaccine, we also need to develop a plan on how to deal with the constant presence of this virus in a society that will eventually refuse to follow medically based directives to stay at home. I fear this is going to be a constant presence in our lives for many years to come."

I’m 75 - living in a non-profit retirement community that has amazing administration/infection-control.  So far we have not had one case of the virus.  Group activities were ended early on.  Visitors were forbidden.  While we can go outdoors to a small park that adjoins our community, there is only one way back in now.  The main entrance.  Via an employee who opens the door.  There’s a “check-point.”  Initially temperatures/travel history of residents was taken.  One by one, at our apartment door.  Employees go through a health check every time they come to work.  They wear masks and gloves.  

I feel safe here.  I am able to drive my car (and keep its batteries charged, about every 10 days).  Nearby grocery stores have “elder hours” - employees wearing masks, signs reminding people to distance.  I’ve gone twice, entering with a list,  getting exactly what I need, and leaving quickly.  Washing everything once I get back.

BUT, as I had already foreseen, and this article makes clear, this will have to go on FOR A VERY LONG TIME - if we elderly residents are to stay safe!  

BUT we are also dependent on the outside community to protect us.  We need society to COOPERATE.  Which takes what we already have - excellent administration and infection control.

That question has sometimes been here in the Times, but rarely, and certainly without any actual importance, has it been put forth.  The facts have become clear that while it's not certain at all that all this was a deliberate action taken by the Chinese government, it is a fact now that they deliberately spread the virus world wide.  When the virus was already known to have human to human communication, China quickly sealed off the Wuhan area from other parts of China.  However, they allowed about a million people from there to travel outside of China, and thus spread the virus throughout the world.  Such an action has significant implications.  How can they be trusted in any aspect of trade?  How can that government be trusted in any way?  Such a malicious and murderous action means we cannot and should not trust them.

When we talk about the economic impacts of the corona shutdown, we are talking about mortality and morbidity. It's indirect and in the longer term, so it's not as evident as deaths in nursing homes, but it's more insidious. Every increase in the unemployment rate will translate into a higher death rate among the unemployed--sure as clockwork. Every worker kicked off their health insurance will become much more likely to suffer from poor health outcomes that will increase mortality. Every month that poor students have to submit to ""distance learning"" and don't receive reliable meals through free and reduced lunch programs is going to result in measurable worse long-term outcomes (with higher poverty and mortality attendant). These negative outcomes will almost certainly dwarf the current numbers of Covid-related deaths. If the economic shutdown continues, it's not unrealistic to believe that it will ultimately have a much more significant and negative impact than the virus itself. 

It would certainly be nice to believe that you are making altruistic decisions solely related to health outcomes when you insist upon the economy staying closed indefinitely; alas the truth is much more nuanced and intertwined."
2020-04-19 13:59:42,"This article gets some things right. For example, ""The gains to date were achieved only by shutting down the country, a situation that cannot continue indefinitely. ""  The lockdowns are already doing substantial harm; not just to mental health and well being, but they are themselves causing loss of life as the global economy shuts down. We are already running out of some food products, this will worsen, and shortages of medicine and failures of our infrastructure will become common.  The catastrophic effects of indefinite draconian lockdowns are as inevitable as deaths from the virus.  We face a Sophie's choice and we must face it head on.

Yet intelligent behavior by us call can dramatically reduce the death toll. History is not encouraging in this regard. For example, in the US alone 20,000 to 40,000 die each year from influenza; a toll that would be substantially reduced if everyone got annual vaccination.  Yet, over half the population does not.

Similarly, there are over 30,000 automobile related deaths each year, a figure that would be substantially lower if we all wore seat belts whenever we're in a car. Yet many don't. Air bags help, and were developed because so many refuse to use set belts, but universal use of seat belts, as required by law, would do even more good.

At some point we'll likely have a vaccine against corona.  Rationale social distancing (what we have now is beyond rational) will help.  But will we all behave with wisdom and good sense?"

After WWII our systems of production and consumption were still primarily contained within national borders. Now they are global, with a high degree of complexity and interdependence. And after WWII there was still a huge amount of opportunity, even in the developed nations, to create transformative new technologies and accelerate the transition from agrarian to industrial societies. Our opportunities for growth may be more incremental and more focused on the developing world now. I can see a scenario where we simply don't have sufficient resources to either invest or consume, making what's coming much more like the Great Depression than the post WWII economic boom."

I realize that isolation was originally requested to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with patients, but opening up now doesn't mean the virus has gone away. Hospitals will still wind up being overwhelmed, it seems. It just means that the state won't be on the hook to pay anyone to stay home, which is really the goal here, isn't it -- avoiding having to give money away. When it comes to Texas, the phrase ""your money or your life"" has taken on new meaning, and the correct answer is, according to the state, ""your life."" Our rate of infection in Texas is still rising. We had four cases in mid-March in our county, and those four cases have continued to multiply steadily, bringing the total case load to more than a thousand. Yet, according to Republicans, it's no big deal, and we should all get back to work. I guess we'll see whether or not our hospitals are overwhelmed in late May ... Pardon me if I look upon Republican policy with a jaundiced eye."

Trump is also under enormous pressure exerted by the leaders of the Evangelical Christian industry, the same characters that laid hands of Trump’s head in the Oval Office. No attendance to services in their churches (or shall we call them “place of business”?) means less money coming into their own personal bank accounts from the milking of their parishioners.

It is the most important single thing he can do for the US to get the schools and businesses open. The govt could subsidize the extra needed dollars so that the manufacturers can make some money.  Not a lot, just some.  They would be doing their part like the rest of us.  The Defense Production Act……please use it. Without the rapid testing, we have months of sequestering and waste."
2020-04-19 14:15:24,"The Boston Globe reported last night on a just released Harvard researcher generated antibody test done in one of our hardest hit communities (Chelsea, Mass. pop. 40,000) that showed that 33% of the randomly selected and tested inhabitants carried the C-19 antibodies.  None of those tested had active symptoms of C-19 or had ever been tested for C-19, but half had reported having a mild symptom or two, weeks earlier.

Many more antibody studies here in Boston are going to be done in the next few days and weeks, but this one study has hit like bombshell...33%!!!  If, this holds up in other studies to come, then we are a lot more infected than what we have been led to believe, and are a lot closer to herd immunity than any of us think.  Also, the virus probably cannot be contained.   Again, if 33% of a population is already walking around with C-19 and doesn't know they have it, good luck trying to contain infection with testing and tracing.

Some epidemiologists are now predicting that C-19 is far more contagious than we think, but also far less deadly."

2020-04-19 14:22:30,"The Covid19 outbreak shows how our economic-environmental activities promote viral transfer and our political choices drive pandemic impact.

To paraphrase Shakespeare, there is more in heaven and earth than is encompassed in our political philosophies - we need to look at the bigger picture. 

And to quote the artist Goya, the sleep of reason breeds monsters - whether as viral outbreaks or kleptocratic regimes.

What we need is universal economic and environmental justice. Chasing the cheapest labor world wide and ravaging the earth for profit is killing us. How could we think it wouldn't?

In the most recent roundup here, I read about school cafeterias working around the clock to cook meals for entire families. Because of federal regulations, they cannot recoup the estimated 15 million dollars they spend on feeding others (while putting themselves at risk by cooking and delivering the food). 

In that same article, I bump into this expose of a young, entitled, deluded conservative who gets paid by ""prominent GOP members"" to foment dissent:
""... the pandemic has showcased Mr. Kirk’s influence, providing him with ample fodder to stir up fellow conservatives against a full menu of enemies, real and perceived.""

So the road ahead isn't just bumpy, entire mile-long stretches of it are missing. Until we garner the courage to do what Oreskes and Conway suggest in ""The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future"" and renounce lies, hoaxes, ""provocateurs"" and stop with the false equivalences and kneejerk attempts to pretend that both sides of a story carry equal weight and merit, we'll be lost in a wilderness of our own making.

The question is, how long will it take to convince 300 million Americans that this is the reality.  

Before this Corona-virus was an issue, we had 330 million Americans.   In less than a month (when finally Tump took it seriously) we are now down to 300 million.

And the Republicans in charge are allergic to investing ANY government money, EVER.  Even if it saves millions of peoples’ lives.  

(Exception:   when the money is spent on bailing out big companies, or on wars.  Then suddenly there is plenty of money available). 

Examples:

o Testing, testing, testing.  There are countries that test more people per DAY than the US has in total.  Buy from the WHO, other countries, crank up production.  Whatever it takes.  

o Other countries are covering peoples’ mortgage or rent during the shutdown.  And some other expenses. This ultimately helps the economy.   

o Paid sick leave.  If you can’t bring yourself to pass it permanently, then at least do so for the duration of the crisis.

But if you’d rather save government money and take the chance of 3-8 million people dead, then please let me know which one of your family members you are willing to sacrifice.   And don’t be fooled into thinking it can’t happen to you, or to someone you care about."

2020-04-19 12:20:41,"3 things I need to start seeing:

1. More information about mutations, maybe good news that the less deadly strains are spreading 

2.  Hire the temporarily  unemployed to jobs that are needed NOW.
This article points out we have very few contact tracers there are maybe a couple thousand currently,  if we need 300,000,
Where is the call for more??? This should be a huge priority.  Until you can get this virus spread down to contacts and away from “community” spread we aren’t “safe”.

3.  Mobilize for the current treatment of virus patients and mobilize again for the longer war and eventual vaccine.  Again where is the mass hiring of people needed to build more ventilators, syringes, hospital beds, whatever??

We shouldn’t be arguing over when to “open” the economy , we should be “arguing” over which job opportunity can I take to help with the response. 
This is the part that really boggles my mind.  I really thought our democracy and capitalism would function so much better than it is. Where is the capitalist reaction to this?? All it can do is complain at this point , what kind of sad leadership is that???

Fiscally things couldn't be worse, as they openly say they are severely broke. Their actions not only failed to defend our great city, but are actively destroying it. It may not be salvageable.

I have read numerous news articles and opinion pieces on how to reopen the United States. Frieden's seem the most logical and wise. However, I am sadly doubtful that Americans can fall in line and abide by these strictures. The demonstrations in state capitals and tweets from Trump prove this.

Instead he struts around and makes ridiculous off the cuff pronouncements about things he knows nothing about. At a time when we need real leadership we are confronted with a TV actor in bad orange face paint pretending to be a leader, but doing a very, very poor job of actually leading.

One would think so unless there is an unknown aspect of the virus that we carry around after suffering its worst symptoms which might be immunity but also contagiousness?

--Families have lost their income and some may go homeless. This will increase suicides. Also alcoholism and illicit drug use.

--Charities will lose their funding. Overseas, this means starvation. Irrelevant, right?

--We lose funding for other good causes like fighting global warming.

On the contrary this is exactly what he wants, to keep us in a state of turmoil without any clear and concise approach to combat this deadly disease￼￼. A prime example of this is his stoking the radical right to protest the social distancing and lockdowns declared by the perceived enemy, the Democratic governors of states that he wants to “liberate“. ￼"

So, typically, he must put himself first and includes those appeals to his base (apt label).  After a long career of reckless business ""deals,"" some involving crime like that charity fraud (""fake""?), it would be about time for him to be caught, dead to rights.  Let's see how his enablers can get him out of that one.

The heroes at the front lines in hospitals at a minimum should give us much hope that dedicated medical professionals will find the cure and/or vaccine we need soon. On top of this the FDA is actually cutting the scientific community a little slack. It is a little early to be speculating about all that will go wrong in the next two years. Don't you think?

If you’re not sick enough to stay out out the car just stay home-influenza is contagious too. Just because your COVID19 test is negative doesn’t mean you can go out and about with the flu. Antibody testing however is another thing-who has the antibodies for plasma treatments for severely ill hospitalized patients, who doesn’t need to stay indoors, which of my colleagues can prance into a COVID19 patient room without fear or the N95 mask? Antibody testing will change the course of this disease. Acute illness testing won’t-a test is not a vaccine."

The virus was apparently here in the late fall - many people suffered from fever/chills etc. of unknown origin and tested negative for the seasonal flu.  Many of us worked with such people and/or suffered those symptoms ourselves.  People travelled to and from China and Europe all along and evidently brought it back and forth.  What surprised us with COVID19 was the quick spikes, the lack of a medical solution and no vaccine.  Which lead to part two, our response.  Unfortunately it was fear driven, based upon multiple and conflicting estimates.  So fear-based decisions life worsened things by closing down the economy and destroying businesses - that feed and provide for employees, our neighbors, families and friends.  A more considered approach would have been modifications in behavior and reminders of safe practices which seem to be effective in Sweden, for example.

What I’m suspicious of, in fact, is that 90  percent of our experts are in fact only self-proclaimed after the fact experts. Not experts in fact. Just read the Times closely everyday and I think you will agree. We even have Nobel prize winning economists weighing in on medical processes, ad nausea.

In my opinion there is another individual that is equally responsible (maybe “irresponsible” would fit better in this case) of the absolute failure of our federal institutions in relation to the pandemic but even worst also responsible for the unabated mutilation of our democracy and the very fabric that has kept our country united (albeit that united with very fragile cloth safety pins). That individual is Mike Pence, a former governor that kept silent when his former colleagues were trampled by Trump’s demagogic and very dangerous verbal abuse."

2020-04-19 14:29:30,"Perhaps I could give credence to trump's demand that we ""re-open"" the economy as soon as possible if he had a plan.  Perhaps mandatory testing for everyone so that we don't have a resurgence; perhaps using our tax dollars to benefit us tax-payers, to re-ignite the economy, rather than transferring it to billionaires, banks and stock market gamblers.  

But there is no plan other than, re-open!  That's because we're dealing with someone who has no concept of public service.  His fundamental mentality is that he is answerable to no one.  He acts like the trillions of our tax-dollars are his; he has no regard for the fact that that is OUR money, for OUR benefit; he is OUR public servant charged with meeting OUR needs.  

Having a plan would take work.  That is something this sorry excuse for a man has never done in his life: work.  He is lazy and self-serving."

When they don’t know, they reflexively seek information that fills in the blanks, even using their imaginations to achieve a state of comforting certainty. The hardest response is to just state with clarity that we don’t know. 

With respect to this pandemic, we don’t know. Because we do not know, we must accept that returning to what we expected for the future two months ago is ridiculous. Instead, we must learn all that we can and to respond according to the information that becomes available, the confirmed facts not our preferred circumstances. 

The numbers described are extremely simple to understand if one is familiar with mathematics. For those who are not, then take some time to familiarize with it. One percent is a small proportion but one percent of 7 billion is an enormous amount, it’s 70 millions. If all people were to become infected in a short time, one percent would die, 70 millions dead people like ourselves.

And those very areas have inadequate hospital/medical support that one would find in the big cities. It might feel comforting that there are fewer people around you, and that you feel “safe” in those expansive areas, but the virus knows no boundaries–not wealth, not race, not age, not physical. We can keep dreaming that our age, or our wealth, or that we can seclude ourselves in a pastoral setting, will protect us from harm (Though money certainly, to be fair, is extremely helpful if we can afford to stay home and not work outside, but it is no cure all). Staying home, IF POSSIBLE, is the best solution we have now (so those who can SHOULD). In the big cities, or the rural areas, the solution is the same."

2020-04-19 15:04:09,"This comment is not meant to be predictive, but the facts and thought experiment is based on actual knowledge of viruses. 
There are some viruses that live commensally with us at all times and do not become debilitating until our immune systems become less able to keep them at bay. The herpetic (herpes) viruses e.g. CMV and EBV are examples. Herpes zoster remains latent (viruses can be either ""latent"" or ""lytic"") until they enter the ""lytic"" phase wherein they again attack cells. The influenza virus lives in the guts of ducks, never attacking the host but ready to jump out and into (say) a pig and voila, we have a novel flu outbreak. Ducks fly long distances to share this stuff with us and our pigs. 
One of the worst outcomes of all this could be a scenario where SARS-CoV-2/COVID becomes very much like the herpetic/herpes viruses, spreads and lives below the surface in all of us ready to pounce when we become vulnerable. In that case it may or may not be vaccinatable. I don't believe EBV and CMV are vaccinatable and they are capable of being fatal. EBV causes Burkitt's lymphoma. 
Right now, our vulnerability lies with the aged (me), and certain comorbidities. 
If those comorbidities became permanently vulnerable to COVID, and SARS-CoV-2/COVID were to become inactive/latent within us, we would see a very dramatic reduction in population over time. 
Oh yeah; some of the human genome is thought to be former viral particles. You can't make this stuff up."

I share your hope that people will develop a desire for deeper understanding of physical reality.
It is the ground layer (hardware) on top of which social, emotional and economical (software) realities are standing. 

The problem is most people are disconnected from the need to understand physical reality beside their own body mechanics as they interact with the world through technology that ""magic"" to them. Press a button and there is light, turn a faucet and there is water. 

We are much more consumed by our interaction with the social, economical and emotional world than the physical one. Those things are more shared virtual reality than things following rigid physical rules like conservation of energy. 

Because of that, I tend to not be too judgmental of people  applying the wrong set of rules in assessing physical reality. 

This crisis hopefully will increase the awareness that we cannot just wish for the present reality to be a thing that it is not and have honest discussion of what it is [like for exponential growth curves]. 

However, we should also celebrate our ability to wish for a different reality and often make it happen in the future by the shear miracle of purposeful interaction with the world [plant seeds - get crop...]."

As a Canadian who has the good fortune to spend the past 6 winters in Florida and coastal Georgia, I offer a word of caution, especially to those Southern governors thinking reopening soon means business as usual: do not look toward Canadians next year to support your local economies.  Until a proven vaccine has been distributed in Canada, travel health insurance will be unavailable or totally cost prohibitive. I’ve spoken to several snowbirds since arriving back home and whether property owners, RVers or more short-term visitors, we all are of a like mind: international travel, particularly to the U.S. is off the table for a minimum of two years.  This does not bode well for Florida real estate."

As far as a return to what one could perceive as normal in relatively quick order, think again.  In 2003, Toronto(the fourth largest city in NA) was what could be perceived as the epicenter of the SARS outbreak, yet, with a comparatively speaking small amount of deaths(43),the business atmosphere along with tourism took almost TWO YEARS to finally come back to what it was before the disease started to take its toll especially after  the CDC issued a travel warning to the area.  

The problem is that the ""perception"" of a community and the negativity surrounding the virus and what ultimately occurred lasts much longer than the disease itself."

2020-04-19 15:51:20,"We know that most Covid deaths have been in the elderly with underlying medical conditions.  Although every death is tragic, I think it would be a valuable exercise to consider how many deaths could be considered “slightly accelerated”.  For example, when most of my older relatives have passed, it was described as “it could have been any number of things that eventually got them”.   Right now that may be Covid.  My healthy teenage daughter was hospitalized with what we suspect to be Covid in February (before anyone was tested in Oregon), so I know that it can be brutal, and I supported the current stay at home orders.  However, they are meant to be temporary and mitigate, not eradicate, the virus.  At this point, ~70 people have passed in Oregon.  We can’t keep the economy shut down forever.  We need to gradually reopen the economy, knowing that some will get sick - flattening, not removing, the curve.  Of course there is risk to that, and we may need to slow down if the curve gets too large again, but the virus isn’t going away."

Canada responded approx. 2-3 weeks earlier to the virus than some  of the hardest hit US states.  Fortunately this helped a lot as all of Canada has fewer cases & deaths than Michigan has.

(BIG SIGH)

I lean liberal (but not on everything). I try to give differing points of view fair consideration. I tend to be an optimistic cynic (if there can be such a thing).

I want to believe that every person WANTS to to the right thing, and when we disagree, it isn’t out of hatred for one another, but out of ignorance (and I mean that in a positive way).

We can never really know the motivations behind what a person says or does. Typically, we react to the words and deeds of others based on our frame of reference (which is limited by our ignorance of other frames of reference). Most people think their frame of reference is the right one. If they didn’t, they would change it (and many times throughout their lives they do change it as they become less ignorant).

What’s my point?

Ignorance is our problem. Ignorance is our enemy. Ignorance is our virus. Ignorance may very well be our downfall.

Medical experts. Economic experts. Politicians. Citizens. Generally, we all want the same thing: the freedom to pursue healthy, prosperous lives. Freedom, health, prosperity. If you have any of these, would you want to lose them? Not me and not anyone I know.

Therein lies our dilemma. Each of us assigns value to our individual freedom, health, and prosperity, based on our specific frame of reference. Some of use are willing to trade-off one for another (freedom for health, health for prosperity, prosperity for freedom).

Some are not."

In the end the death toll will be similar to that seen in a bad seasonal flu year and much less than the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic. And studies will prove that aside from restriction of travel and encouraging social distancing none of the mitigation efforts including statewide shutdowns will have made any difference in propagation, hospitalization or rate of deaths- and the flattening of the curve is merely the natural decline seen in a viral outbreak.
What will happen is that the public will realize that statewide shutdowns only cause economic disruption without any tangible benefit."

This will require invoking the Defense  Production Act, something he should have done weeks ago but did not. Daily we wait to hear if he will move on testing and daily we find that he will not. Curiously a part of hearing he will not move on this is hearing from Drs Birx and Fauci that testing is coming and will be fine within a few weeks or so. This is also a bit of magical thinking , since it is clear that the states cannot afford to do this, and Trump has told us quite clearly that it is not his responsibility.  How can people go on pretending this is not the case? Newsom and Cuomo have the capability to organize massive testing if they had the money.

Even within the US, businesses have consolidated into oligarchic/monopolistic single points of failure and concentrations of wealth.

Given this natural occurrence, it offers another type of control strategy. If scientists were to be on the lookout for evolving variants of much lower pathogenicity, it might be possible to actually facilitate the spread of that variant thus ensuring milder disease and producing naturally occurring immunity well before an effective vaccine arrives. 

Unfortunately, I don’t believe it’s possible to serologically determine the particular strain a person had after the virus has been eliminated. So we’d still need widespread testing for active infections followed by contact tracing and back-tracing to identify and define illness severity.

Yes there are more covid19 deaths than reported but there are many people that have  had the disease and were never tested because of lack of tests. So the death rate is much lower then 1%. Only when there is a reliable anti-body test  and if we test everyone will we really know the infection and death rate. You say that this is killing more people daily then heart disease.

This was the right time where US would have moved from covid 19 testing to contact tracing and antibody testing. Trump should be more sensitive to loss of human lives rather than inciting right wing folks to open up economy in three blue states.

How desperately Americans needed Hillary or Obama to combat such awful pandemic; even president Bush second could have handled it pretty well.

Perhaps pick an infamous collective of known offender inflammatory molecules, that are highly likely to be present in the case of an infection. Maybe those who already have a higher immune inflammation may have a more welcoming environment towards this highly infectious virus. Of course this depends on whether we have available tests for such cytokines. 

Also while it is heartening to see so many brilliant minds focused on solving the problem, please also advice the population in general on what might keep us baseline healthy apart from a decent diet, social distancing, masks and hygiene. Would taking extra vitamins, especially C and D help?  Are certain over the counter medications helpful or harmful with this virus? For example, it affects our ciliated epithelium causing those infected to drown in their mucus. Would taking an over the counter mucus thinner at the inception of this infection be detrimental or beneficial? Would antihistamines help address this virus at the start or help it to invade us more thoroughly?"

Unless I am seriously mistaken (though not likely, given that I have an MS in molecular biology and my wife has a PhD in virology), those who test positive on an antibody test ARE NOT NECESSARILY CARRIERS. They are people who have had the virus, but whom are EITHER currently infected, BUT ASYMPTOMATIC, in which case they may be INFECTIVE, or else they had it and beat it, in which case they are NOT INFECTIVE.

Patients must be at least actively infected (positive on a PCR test, proving the presence of virus) in order to be infectious.

This week he exhibited his ignorance again by telling us all that the President has total control over the states of the United States even tho the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution says exactly the opposite of Trump's utterances.   

Although  Trump was pressured into issuing mask, and distancing orders to the general public, he has now decided to wipe out those controls by trying to get states to re-open. He has followers ""who like him"" that are protesting without wearing face masks and standing together closer than 6 feet. By failing to warn his people to retain face masks and social distance, Trump may LITERALLY cause his base of support to die in large numbers before the November election.  Trump's ignorance is very dangerous to our country and his followers."

It only makes no sense if Trump is determined for states to take the fall if there’s a subsequent upsurge in cases.

Too many deer, and a harsh winter, or an increase in predators reduce the herds, eliminating the oldest and weakest. Science is increasing the population beyond the resources capable of sustaining resources to survive. If a virus culls the oldest and weakest of humans, the cost of healthcare dramatically goes down for those that survive, and resources become more plentiful.  Should science keep extending lives indefinitely, so humans can rule the planet?  Maybe doctors or scientist have the moral duty to do it.

The statistics say that it is still not as bad as a bad flu season, although it may become as bad or worse.  Measuring a disease by how efficiently the bodies of the people it kills are processed is just silly."
2020-04-19 17:29:34,"So the story is, get infected as quickly as possible, recover if you can and don't die, and then, armed with presumed immunity, go out to work and party to your hearts content. Be responsible, on the other hand, and avoid getting the virus, and end up in lockdown with thousands of others like you, unable to work or even go outdoors for the rest of your life. Nice choice."

Seriously—it’s the same “Oh, wow, lookit THAT!” that you see in Hudson River School paintings of the sublime.

But the nuttinesses that are coming from the president (lower case intentional) and his devotees are not much fun at all. I think it’s probably because the idiocy of watching lockdowns go into place, watching the numbers drop, watching the virus spread into rural America and the poorer parts or the world where there aren’t any lockdowns, and concluding that therefore the lockdowns were pointless and everybody should go back to work, is gonna get a lot of people killed. 

It’s just not fun to watch Trump get people killed through sheer ego and incompetence, and see a lot of my fellow Americans cheer him on."

Some people are not able to genuinely social distance - because they are low-income, and they work in a situation such that in practical terms they can't really social distance. Like, for example, an Amazon warehouse/packing facility, with an employer that has a long history of using Taylorism tactics to leverage and drive workers. There is the lack of testing, and the issue of asymptomatic carriers. Medical facilities, in some areas, have apparently shut down. Cuomo hasn't drafted all of them to work in NY - they just aren't available to patients. So if we are going to be stuck with wave after wave of corona virus for a long time, I have to suspect we need an approach that isn't driven by media-led mob politics, but something more complex, more precisely crafted. Corporations can't borrow forever. If corporations had the breathing space of a re-opened economy, could the Feds leverage that breathing space to force, say, Amazon, for example, to re-construct the structure and workflow of their warehouses to make social distancing practical long term? Could we restore checks and balances, and other values essential to Constitutional legitimacy, and stop letting society be driven by unaccountable, ""executive orders"" from on high? Could society pay a lot more specific and direct attention to how workers are actually treated on the job, and be real about ""social distancing""?"

2020-04-19 18:24:27,"The more likely path to get past this virus is to go right through it.  That means it burns through the population at a steady (no hospital overwhelming surges) but non zero rate over the next 12 months with the more vulnerable holed up until we reach the herd immunity.  Some antibody tests suggest we are 10x, 20x or even 80x further along than confirmed cases would indicate.  So the lethality isn't 3% but more likely a fraction of a percent.  And with treatments to get critical patients through the worst of it, the mortality rate would be lower still and maybe flu like.  If 200 million get infected, about 200,000 would die given a 0.1% rate.  That's 4x an average flu season.  Nobody will advocate this approach but it will happen because people at some point will push back against all the restrictions.  

What?  You want to sacrifice lives so we can have our way of life back?  We already do just that.  We accept an average of 50,000 flu related deaths every year.  That number could be much lower if we just did extreme social distancing from October through March.  But we don't.  We go to concerts, ride subways and pass on the flu.  Yes we vaccinate but giving up our way of life could save more."
2020-04-19 18:31:53,"I do see a few glimmers of hope in this article, if they are accurate.  New reports from Wuhan show that a far greater of the population were carriers but asymptomatic.  That may show that the % who became critically ill or died was far smaller than first thought.  The Stanford Medical Center report (not in this story) appears to show far greater exposure than reported.  Also encouraging if accurate in this report is that mutations may be more benign and less deadly.  

That doesn't change the fact that we to main vigilance, social distancing to slow the spread and protect our ability to treat those who become ill from any serious illness in our hospitals.  We need test for the virus and for antibodies so we can safely open up our economy again."
2020-04-19 18:32:46,"Consider lowering Medicare, and maybe even Social Security on a sliding scale, to age 50.

Although all ages can get the virus, people over 50 generally seem to be more at risk for severe effects.

I think the average age of hospitalization for the virus is 47.

Therefore, I think it would only make sense if Medicare age was lowered to age 50, and maybe even Social Security. 

This way older workers who are more vulnerable to the virus would be given the opportunity to retire earlier so as not to put their health at greater risk."

5. Companies will realize that they should spend more money on AI/automation.
6. Those who are not technology savy will be unemployed or underemployed.
7. Prostitution will be legalized. 
8. More people won't be having babies or getting married and those who do will get money and other benefits from the government.
9. Pay of medical professionals especially nurses will be much higher than before.

So the virus has increased the normal death rate by only a little with a cost that has been economically devastating to millions of people, mom/pop businesses, and large corporations.  
To those who regard the disruption to keep the virus caused death rate to only 1800/day as worth the price, consider the fate of the 14,000 and what national disruption we should pay to prolong their lives.  Sounds like a nonsensical question until you consider the cost the nation is paying to ‘flatten the curve’ to in an effort to stretch out the deaths from this virus."

In  Verhagen 2012""The Tierra Solution: Resolving the Climate Crisis through Monetary Transformation"" I seminally presented the ethical, commercial, intellectual, ecological and strategic dimensions of a carbon-based international monetary system with its carbon monetary standard of specific tonnage of CO2e per person  to deal not only with the financial crisis, but especially  and the greater challenge and threat of the looming climate catastrophe.

 Now as part of the forthcoming Tierra Pathway I am proposing national conversation on the comprehensive notions of justice and sustainability as the foundation of the two pillars of just and sustainable  global governance system. 
A money-based financial system rather than the present debt-based financial system and the above carbon-based international monetary system. Evidence will show how we are beginning to shift from a debt-based financial system to a money-based financial system where quantitative easing and grants are increasing. It is argued that the Fed, Congress and the Department of the Treasury have to reclaim their duty to be the  sole creator of money and that privately owned banking systems are to become regulated utilities without the privilege of money creation."

One thing I do know, can we keep the far left and far right politics out of this...PLEASE..we were warned that something like this would happen for 20 years and we didn't prepare for it, similar to 9/11,..we could bicker about how we got here but in the end,  we're still in the same place. The 2 major issues we have are testing and how we will socially distance each other going forward until a vaccine is found. The thought of opening things up will be interesting...how do you keep people 6 feet apart in an office, restaurant, retail store, or in public transportation...it appears that social distancing is working but how long can this go on....every aspect of our economy...except for Amazon, will be negatively effected, and all of you are right...our states depend on tax revenue to pay for everything, how do you pry money out of people that don't have it.

2020-04-19 19:45:21,"Excellent article. I would like to address one issue, the ethics of a challenge trial where volunteers are given a unproven vaccine then purposely exposed to the virus as a faster alternative to the current standard phase 3 test of giving the unproven vaccine or a placebo to large numbers of individuals and compare infections rates over a much longer time period. A challenge trial puts the volunteers at significantly higher risk, a risk some call unethical. In the framework of clinical trials in “peacetime” it could easily be characterized as unacceptable. However, we are not at peace, we are in a global war. On April 2nd, Elliot Ackerman wrote an excellent piece in this paper “There Is an Antidote to Our Fear. It’s Called Leadership.” He vividly describes the preparations for the 2004 Marine assault into Falluja. The casualty estimate was 70%. To ask your Marines to step up to that level of risk is not unprecedented but rather the norm in wartime. We, as a nation, have become very complacent about contributing to the welfare of our country. Rather any inconvenience can be portrayed as an imposition on personal liberty – even paying taxes or staying home. Let us ask what we can do for our country and step up when we get the answer. I was a Lieutenant in the Army for two years, I stepped up then and I would step up again."

It was previously reported that 40% of Americans had few reserves to fall back on in csse of a financial emergency. Depending on the lenght of unemplyment for many Americans, they won't have the resources to spend on anything other than basic necessities - food, shelter and other maintenance items (past due payments?). Where will the robust spending come from???"
2020-04-19 20:06:13,"The pandemic curve may appear to be flattening, but this is not a result of happenstance, the bend is being achieved through diligence. There are many, many 'social distancing' fingers in the dike holding back this contagion, which if they are removed will result in the pandemic climbing still higher. We should keep in mind that we are still very near the peak, and as a result, the daily identified case-rate and the daily death-rate are not far off the maximum.  There are city-by-city charts from the 1918 pandemic which should be looked at closely, as they illustrate the various consequences of in some cases maintaining lockdowns and in others prematurely lifting them.  Some charts have the familiar simple bell-curve shape - but many more describe a double-hump, which has resulted from the lockdown being lifted prematurely.  It's all very fine to plan for the lifting of social-distancing measures - but this 1918 experience indicates that lockdowns should only be lifted once the death-rate drops down to 10-15% of where it was at the peak.  We are nowhere near that effective tipping point yet. There is history here to inform us that needs to be respected... as otherwise,  lockdowns will have to be repeated - which would also be repeating past histories.  If anyone wonders what outrages that might stip up, one has only to look at historical commentary that accompanied past failures."

At its peak, flu also becomes a leading cause of death for a week or two every year. The CDC says flu killed at least 61,000 Americans last season, fare  more than COVID-19 has killed far this year, and the number of COVID-19 infections is declining.

As of April 17, the CDC count, which is based on actual death certificates, shows 582,565 Americans have died since the COVID-19 outbreak began in February. A total of 19,032 of these deaths are attributed to COVID-19 and COVID-19 with flu.  So COVID-19 has caused about 3.2 percent of deaths since the beginning of the outbreak.

Unless commands can be *enforced* (good luck with 331M+ people), a ""restructured"" work/play environment still has far too many holes to ensure mitigation of contagion.  Too many people have sloppy hygiene, have no clue what 6 feet means, don't anticipate collisions inside stores, etc.
There are two options:
Put every American inside an isolation cell, including within their own homes -- perhaps monitored by some evil video tool linked to law enforcement (i.e., totalitarian state)
or
Accept mortality, mistakes, and imperfection as part of the human condition.

To my surprise, I have discovered that suddenly all government officials, all media outlets, and most people reading the NYT, find the latter utterly unacceptable.  Not a single cell of any virus or other biological enemy of the body must emit from anywhere before our earthly lives resume.

If not every non-immune person is restricted to an isolation cell, Covid is here to stay at least temporarily -- months, years, whatever.

the united states is the weakened patient and the stimulus spending thus far has been the ventilator. 

a recovery interrupted by another spike in cases will make recovery that much more difficult. 

trump can't have it both ways. treat the patient properly now - with testing, with a Manhattan Project-like effort to find a treatment and a vaccine, and with more testing. or rush the patient out of the ICU with the likelihood that a recovery won't materialize and the patient will die.

2020-04-19 02:42:39,"This may seem beside the point to many of you, but there is a system of health care that is currently working well in covid 19 cases. I have studied homeopathy for many years. This system of natural medicine is inexpensive and widely available. One of the doctors I have studied with has treated over 150 cases of covid 19, maintaining all cases with only mild symptoms, even the cases that were becoming severe before treatment. This is a system of medicine that has a strong track record in epidemics, for hundreds of years. It is not mainstream medicine, and some people believe it does not work. However, if the practitioner is skilled, results are good. This is a time to be open to any and all solutions. I sincerely hope that people will become more open-minded. There are many experienced homeopaths in America. They have been in communication, sharing successful treatment plans with each other. I hope this information is helpful."
2020-04-18 19:06:57,"At some point, the politicians have to reflect a balance they thus far seem to ready to ignore--health versus civic freedom. Among a free people, risks are always part of the bargain. If I were only concerned, for example, with saving lives, I would never let anyone drive over 35 on the freeway--both for themselves and for others. If I were only concerned about lives, I would never let anyone smoke or eat fatty foods--both for themselves and for others affected (including in lost relationships and cost to taxpayers). If I were only concerning about saving lives, then I would outlaw all extreme sports and things like skydiving. If I were only concerned with saving lives, I would fine anyone who had sex without a condom. The list is easy to draw if you think about it. 

Well, why don't we do these type of things? We don't do them because freedom is an essential human good. It cannot be shut aside as easily as it is now. Even the Ancient Greeks in part understood this. We know that doctors will never address these political goods because that is not their job. They will always look exclusively through the lens of what is good medically. But we should be very careful assuming always that what is good medically is what is good in terms of rights and freedom and the common good. At some point, and I don't think it's far off, Americans will simply refuse to stay home. Why? Because they will say, as humans often do, what's the point of being healthy if I am not living as a human."

They along with several thousand conservatives, including members of the Proud Boys hate group and Confederate flag-waving right-wingers, descended on Michigan's state Capitol on Wednesday to protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's (D) stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic. Most participants did not wear protective masks or observe social distancing recommendations.

The popular Gov. Whitmer pointed out that MCC is funded in large part by the family of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos: “ I think it's really inappropriate for a sitting member of the United States president's Cabinet to [be] waging political attacks on any governor.""

Increasing civil disobedience will end this lock-down. 

The vast majority of citizens will, if necessary, sacrifice the lives of the largely elderly population most at risk in order to resume their own lives.

Politicians who refuse the public demand to an end to this quasi-police-state mentality will be run out of office.

It is idle to suppose that a third-billion people will allow themselves to be pauperized and kept under a form of house arrest.

Other nations, e.g. Germany and Sweden, have either refused to goose-step through this epidemic or are rapidly ending their subservience to the worst warnings of the medical profession.

It is just about over and then will come what may."
2020-04-18 20:37:12,"Currently, the virus is killing about 5% of infected people.  If half of the nation gets it and that percentage holds up, that's eight million deaths, a staggering amount.

It looks like about 20% get terribly sick and have to be hospitalized.  That's 32 million hospitalizations.  Again, a staggering amount.

That's precisely why mitigation is so terribly important.  We absolutely cannot let this thing go wild and free.  

Conservatives are making false arguments that the virus does not pose that much of a threat if only 60,000 die.  This is a false argument because that death toll is predicated upon widespread mitigation.  If we stop social distancing, the 60,000 grows to millions really fast.  

Travel of all kinds has to stop.  We must stay within our local communities.  Travel can make anyone a new source of infection.

The faster we implement widespread testing, the faster we can move around within our local communities.  We should be implementing a WWII level production of testing kits.  We should be training an army of testers.  (There are plenty of people looking for work now).  We should be developing a national data base to accurately track test results and assist those who must stay home with food, medicine and emotional support so they don't go nuts.  Getting infected should not be be a punishment.  

We could do all of this is we had a president who would use his power for the people instead of boosting his ratings.  Otherwise, we are in for a long haul."
2020-04-18 19:18:56,"Herd immunity cannot be transmitted via synthetic
immunities, such as are supposedly conferred by
vaccination. True herd immunity is a result of people
gaining natural immunity when their bodies contract,
fight and recover from a disease. If vaccines conferred
genuine disease immunity, children and adults would not
be susceptible to the illnesses against which they were
vaccinated. 
There is no way to know what the rates of infection will be in this ""novel"" virus.
It may be the case that we should allow for children to become infected ( as the suggestion has already been made that they are either asymptomatic or at little mortality risk), but isolate and/or vaccinate the most vulnerable populations. 
One can look the corresponding examples as measles was a scourge for centuries. We did much better when we had 20th century therapeutics available to treat what became thought of as a ""childhood disease."" Only the combination of a largely naturally obtained immunity and better treatments did things truly improve. The introduction of a vaccine came late in the cycle. ( 1963).
From my perch, devising the best therapeutics for Covid19 is more urgent than the assumption that a vaccine is a cure-all solution for the long term."
2020-04-18 19:45:41,"Thinking...about how the society returns to whatever ""normal"" will be. I believe that the key to finding a culture and economy that will be safe and stable lies mostly in the hands of those people between the ages of 15 and 35. Their ""activities"" and expectations for social contacts will be the most impacted by the disease. AND they have the greatest control, for better or worse, of the spread of the virus.

What about schools, what about bars eateries and clubs, what about sports, both participation and attendance, what about work and shopping, travel/tourism. Although all of us will contend with these questions, these younger folks probably account for a greater percentage of ""consumption"" of these activities. Some of that is unavoidable, some of it optional.

It is vital that people in this ""group"" understand the consequences of their choices and that they are informed and willing to look hard at their options to limit their consumption. If that does not happen we will be in for a very long and rough ride."

Yet, Weld County now has well over 1000 cases and 61 deaths compared to Larimer County with 212 cases and 12 deaths.

 Why did it spread so much more and is more deadly  in Weld County?  

 Is it because Weld County is a GOP stronghold?  Patrick Neville, GOP minority speaker of the house compared (Jewish American) Polis' stay-at-home orders to Naziism. (please note that stores like home depot,  lumber and paint stores are still open so some can still work and construction goes on).  The Colorado Springs Gazette published an editorial condemning this on Saturday but it is still out there for the fringe crazies protesting the stay at home orders. 

Could it be Trump with his dismissive attitude and his lame and delayed response to the virus and his fantasy outcomes of re-opening the economy where he is the hero?  

Could it be that much of the population is Hispanic and poor (undocumented)?  Meat packing plants there  continued to require workers to work when sick.  

Larimer County has a higher income and educational level.

Could it be the air pollution in Weld County, among the areas with the highest concentration of oil and gas development in the country?"

We already have many 100% safe effective treatments and other countries are using them right now.  They work with no side effects.  They're proven with PubMed studies and clinical outcomes.  They save lives far better than pharmaceuticals, but are natural biomolecules.

You won't hear about them from the mainstream media that accepts the ultra expensive reductive pharma model as the one and only healthcare model - even though our outcomes are dead last amongst the industrialized countries (11th) and 27th in the world - even though our industrial healthcare kills 440,000 people every year with avoidable medical errors, and drugs correctly prescribed kill another 100,000.  

Even though our expensive healthcare failed abysmally against this virus.  

No one questions these obvious failures.  

Why?  

Maybe they think there's no alternative, but there is.  Other countries use a more systems-based approach that hits the virus from every direction.

There are many many molecules that are not patentable but directly act on the genes this virus uses to do its damage.  

They directly interfere with viral function, mechanistically.  This is exactly what the pharma labs are trying to develop synthetically so they can patent them.

We have safe effective treatments right now that every healthcare worker should be taking.

Think about it.  The highest estimate of the US death toll if we didn’t shut down was around 2.5 million mostly elderly or ill people.  We are a country of 330 million and those who are seriously hurt by the shutdown but at almost no risk from the virus are people with decades of life ahead of them.

He had to rely on the often contradictory advice of the scientific community who despite their claims, are themselves learning on the job about the Virus and the treatment.

The Federal ADA and many state and local laws require reasonable accommodations for voter with disabilities, including curbside/drive through voting.  It could be argued that, until a reliable, safe COVID19 vaccine is widely available and affordable, we all, or most of us, have a disability: no, or inadequate, ability to fend off infection of this deadly and highly-contagious virus and the grave consequences it can have on vital organs and bodily systems."
2020-04-19 20:41:19,"Here is an idea for the Federal Government to consider. Rather than fighting with the States about authority to manage the re-opening, Trump should leverage the idea of regions of Coronavirus response. The Midwest, West Coast and Northeast States have already agreed to co-ordinate their reopening on a regional basis. The Whitehouse should encourage the remaining States to organize themselves into similar regions, and allow these areas to independently manage re-opening. Travel between regions could be modeled on the Canada-US border agreement, allowing only ""essential travel"" between regions."

3. We are in “stay at home” and “shelter in place” advisories and orders of health departments. We are able to travel. We can get essential items for the most part. We are not arrested and taken away without due process. The term “lockdown” is used in prison riots, school shootings, and on behavioral health wards/clinics and sometimes dictatorships and totalitarian regimes. 

4. We are alone in many cases TOGETHER. We are saving the lives of elders, health care workers and other essential workers. We will get through this. 

5. Most people, the great majority care and will help others. It is the humanity in our human nature. This not an apocalypse and no one should be profiting in popularity or money spinning it up situation. We are together keeping our focus on overcoming this together which is inevitable.

The most recent podcast and NTY articles on SCOTUS, however neglect to address basic concerns raised by teleconferenced and/or zoomed (or other web-based) lawsuits.  Among the neglected concerns: since the courts will be unable to see, or see much of, the various participants’ total surroundings, how will they ensure that not a single person (party, judge/justice, lawyer, witnesses or jurors  (the latter 2 in lower courts), etc.) are safe undue influence up to and including even mortal threat — Particularly if/when such hearings persist past COVID stay at home orders/advice? Courthouses have somewhat rigorous security screeners and trained, well-vetted bailiffs and sheriffs officers present and security cameras all around and attended to at all times.  Private homes and offices do not.  

Similarly, can the courts truly rely on the honor system, without meaningful verifying measures, to ensure that no one’s cheating in some manner?

The Trump Republican party, led by Murdoch's Fox News propagandists, continues its delusional assault on science-based responses to the pandemic.  Lockdown protests (cheered on by a president who has abdicated responsibility, funded in part by Secretary of Education Betsy deVos) and rightwing vilification of Tony Fauci, are symptoms of our more serious illness--the denial of facts.  

A few voices, like Paul Krugman's, seem willing to call out these enablers of catastrophe.  The tragedy is how many informed and intelligent people seem to be silenced by fear of Trump's tweets and internet flaming.  It's hard to imagine a leader more unfit for a genuine crisis than Donald Trump, whose only thoughts are for himself, and whose response to adversity is to find others to blame.  Mitch McConnell comes to mind, though, and his Senate (R) toadies.  They're blind to the obvious truth that science-based action is the only path back to a functioning economy, and that political posturing only makes things worse.  

The Republican party looks more and more like the Death Panel they claimed would result from Obamacare (I remain a registered Republican after 60 years, to my shame).  How long can it continue, and will the Republican party ever recover the integrity it once had?"

From our president.  To say I’m shocked is an understatement.  I’m devastated.  I have been for over 3 years, but it keeps getting worse.

Trump's initial strategy (It's under control, it'll disappear like magic) was informed not by himself but by his political taskmasters, the hidden puppeteers who control both parties, who sought to elbow Bernie Sanders out of the primary by delaying awareness of the virus's economic impact until after South Carolina, ensuring that the redistributionist agenda would die a death and be off the table only days prior to the total failure of late-stage capitalism.  Bernie's communist/socialist/progressive agenda would now be quite viable here in the United States, at least for the time being.   

The success of Trump has been maintaining the status-quo (China supply chain, tax policies for trillionaires, anti-labor policies) while paying lip service to his campaign slogans, thereby tricking the good citizens of Bumpkinville again. 

It's phony populism, folks."
2020-04-19 11:48:01,"Obviously, ""Trump's"" recommendations did not come from him but from some underling talking with  Dr. Fauci and others who are trying to be sensible about ""reopening,"" because Trump is already ignoring them and urging his base to fight any restrictions in states with democratic governors.  If this isn't ""politicizing"" the crisis, I don't know what is.  The only sensible way forward is the way we've been forced to take - spotty approaches depending on who the governor of a state is and whether he/she is listening to scientists and medical advisors or political ones, like Trump.   The spotty approach will allow the virus to go where the people are out and about, and people will travel and bring it to wherever they go. I'm continuing my more cut-back life for the foreseeable future until the death count stops going up and reverses to come down.  Meanwhile, MY thoughts and prayers are going to the health care workers and grocery store clerks and delivery people who are on the front line of having to interact with the sick and dying.  I am not praying for Trump or his foolish followers."
2020-04-19 13:29:41,"It is realistic to think that without a vaccine which will take a couple of years to produce in quantity, we will have to live with the virus. 
But from recent observations many are asymptomatic (data from Iceland, Dutch blood donors, French and American sailors on airplane carriers) and the overall mortality is low. 
We can not control the virus, but we can control the factors that allow most to die of covid. American have low vitamin D levels, the food industry sells sodas packed with high fructose corn syrup, snacks have low nutritional value and too much sugar and unhealthy fats. Type 2 diabetes is rampant. Those factors can be addressed.  Maybe if the soda super size ban in ny would have passed a few lives might have been saved."
2020-04-19 23:13:16,"The year ahead there should be a deployable safe vaccine that will help acquire protective immunity to COVID-19 and there could be a safe antiviral with no adverse effects to treat the confirmed positive cases. I am not so sure that relying on hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir will be a safe bet. We need more options especially safe broad spectrum antivirals that will not only be effective against the current pandemic but all future enveloped virus pandemics like Influenza, Corona virus, Ebola etc. 

Currently in the absence of any deployable vaccine or a safe antiviral treatment, we also need to acquire herd immunity now and that can only happen if we are truly the home of the brave. Sweden health minister thinks that their bold response will lead to herd immunity in a month. I believe it will. Our response has been a knee jerk reaction without proper thinking of the consequences. I fully support the travel restrictions across our International airports and school closings but closing eg clinics, dental offices, fitness centers was going way too overboard and we will suffer dire consequences for those local orders from governors, mayors and cowards of the county. By staying home in our bubblettes we cannot acquire essential  ""herd immunity"" for the ultimate long term eradication of the pandemic. I therefore support all non violent protests to reopen the country to tomorrow. there is no scientific evidence to support not to, except in the COVID-19 ill prepared areas of the US"

Grocery stores and public transportation. Schools, the main source of viral transmission thankfully are closed. Grocery stores by their very nature spread virus around a community , while mass transit is a quick way to get infected. It took fast food restaurants and delivery services a surprisingly long time to protect their workers from the general public and vice a versa. It took on average about a month for all the essential business that remained open to get up to speed . The businesses and plants that are shut have had plenty of time to make things safe for their workers , that’s the real challenge, to make it safe both for workers and customers. Any business must be made to show local
Government how they have adapted to the situation. You just can’t reopen like nothing has happened . Workers must know things are safe or no go. It is up to local unions to insure this safety .

We are in the middle of the highest death toll we've ever had from the virus - 250 people per day are dying.  This is close to 10,000 per month.  We see many people out on the streets in warmer weather, and none of them wearing masks or practicing social distancing.  We know that it looks like a plateau has been reached, but how long will we stay on this plateau?  With everyone talking about how the curve has bent through social distancing, there are many calls to relax at the height of the pandemic, at the plateau we are on.  Why is it that the writers of this article do not think we will hit the 100,000?"
2020-04-18 19:34:11,"Nice article. But largely ""more of the same"". 

A vaccine is needed but it will take time. Probably more time than we hope for. It is NOT known for how long a vaccine will protect you. People think ""long"" or ""forever"". For flu, the answer is that after 120 days (that's 4 months) the vaccine becomes ineffective. The German government has estimated that (natural) immunity to this Corona virus will last for 6-18 months.

This means, even the people who have had it and recovered, they can get it again in one year from now.

As a simple scientist, I say that we need to find out who can get the disease without getting very sick. More and more evidence is appearing that many people can get this and not even know that they have it. 

Once you infect ~60-70% of the population, hopefully many that won't get sick, or have mild illness, and all those people will become immune to infection, the virus will disappear from the population. 

It seems to be the only feasible path forward. And yet again ""20 experts"" have been consulted by the NYT and this concept isn't really visible. 

The traditional US approach of getting a pill is not likely to work (fast or reliable enough). The approach of getting a vaccine will be too slow. Permanent lock down will cause unbearable economic damage.

What worries me most from this article is the idea that schools may be opened sooner rather than later.  This sounds more to me like another hammer, rather than any kind of dance.  

Since the Fox ""doctors"" are saying a 2-3% death rate would be acceptable given the importance of education, I hope school leaders proceed very cautiously.  These are children -- our future!  

If and when they do decide to re-open, they should try to think outside the box and find ways to make class sizes smaller and to decentralize learning environments.  Maybe they could use empty restaurants or retail stores to widely disperse students and classrooms, which might help out all concerned.

Our hopes rest with the selfless and the brave, and our thoughts with all who must confront the illness with the knowledge that, were it not for those who will not follow medical advice and governmental shutdowns, they might have been saved."
2020-04-18 19:58:39,"There will be a whole new industry now generating books about the various scenarios to follow the pandemic.  Of course, the Base first has to believe that there is one.  

Don’t think Dr. Oz or Dr. Phil will be heading that effort."
2020-04-18 19:59:21,"A lot of good people are going to die of COVID before, possibly, the wealthy and powerful realize we can't drag the country back to the world of 90 days ago. Not for a lack of trying, but because that world doesn't exist anymore. 

I recall looking at photos of 9/11 wreckage and finding pieces that were recognizable. I was desperate for hope and in my mind ""recognizable"" became ""possibly salvageable"". Perhaps we could save some things here and there? It wasn't necessary to let the horror of that day force us to give up what enough effort could retain.

Ground Zero was scraped bare and we started all over again. Not because we didn't value what was lost, but everyone realized that there was no saving what remained.

More importantly, we understood there was no way to pretend we could go back to the second Monday in September.

Someday, I'll visit the new World Trade Center like I visited the old one. Before that, I'll step outside again and visit the new world like I visited the old one, but it won't be what I left behind."
2020-04-18 19:59:48,"This is a grim, but necessary, and I feel very realistic take on what is ahead. How well people can move away from the several generations of extreme selfishness created by relatively cushy living will make the difference in how it all goes. 

Early signs have not necessarily been encouraging, but there is also hope in seeing many adapt and change some of their most common behaviors in the matter of just a few weeks. 

Ultimately, it will come down to leadership. Right now we have none whatsoever coming from the executive branch. Let's hope that part of the ""new normal"" will be people understanding the responsibility that comes with voting."
2020-04-18 20:01:02,"This article is unnecessarily pessimistic.

In the short term, we need to ramp up availability of testing.  Companies like Abbott Laboratories are developing new COVID tests.  Among these is a test for the currently ill that renders results in under 15 minutes via a machine the size of a toaster, that obviates the necessity for a full laboratory to do the tests.  Another test is a new antibody test that may be able to check if a person has had COVID in the past.

Yes, the US has been slow in getting these tests off and running.  But other countries have been able to control COVID-19 testing with testing and contact tracing.

Yes, there may be some long-term changes to the economy until we have a vaccine.  Large sporting events may be canceled for the next year or two.

Travel will be curtailed.  Virtual meetings will replace face-to-face meetings.

But the essential parts of the economy (food production, delivery of energy, manufacturing, banking) should be mostly OK.

Yes, lower aggregate demand will most likely produce a severe recession.

But COVID-19 also provides a warning for the future.

This catastrophe may give us practice on how to prepare for crises that will become prevalent as planet earth warms between now and 2100.

We need to rethink the old academic subjects.

Perhaps most important is a reexamination of macroeconomics.

Macroeconomic models seem to be predicated on ""eternal growth.""  But global warming suggests that population will reach a peak and decline."
2020-04-18 20:01:52,"If I read this article correctly - and I'd welcome being corrected by the author if I'm wrong - the take-home message is this: The United States, even now, has done far less to corral and knock down this virus than most any other country - and even countries that have done a lot more continue to struggle mightily with suppression and long-term containment.

That being the case, the conclusion is clear: We're going to pay a hellacious price for our approach, and it will vastly increase and prolong the suffering.

I can't understand why some people - like those protesting to re-open things quickly - can't grasp this simple reality. There is simply no bargaining with or ignoring a virus.

But then again I can't understand why people deny climate change, refuse to acknowledge that every other rich country has a vastly superior health care system to ours, or tolerate policies that keep millions of our hard-working citizens in a precarious, highly-insecure form of serfdom.

Maybe this experience and the collision with unavoidable facts it entails will make us change."
2020-04-18 20:02:42,"We need to retrench human society at a planetary level. Ensure basic health care, useful educations and women's equality for all people on our planet.

This is doable. Do it."
2020-04-18 20:03:17,"Thank you for the excellent and sobering analysis of what is and what may be. There are blaming fingers pointing everywhere and it is all pointless at this stage...with one exception. Regardless of what news outlet one searches, there seems to be one constant; that the United States is way behind when it comes to testing. 

We know that other countries have been testing with far greater efficiency and in greater volume because someone in the federal government decided that the internationally-accepted version of testing would not be used in the United and that we would develop our own. 

Who made that decision and why? 330 million of us deserve an answer to that basic question."
2020-04-18 20:03:25,"Despite the over weening pessimism of this piece, everyone needs to come to grips with the fact Americans are not, repeat not, going to hunker down in their homes month after month.  The vulnerable need to be protected to the extent possible, but everyone else should get back to work.  If you want social instability, try keeping these lockdowns in place and see what happens.  Life, unfortunately, carries many risks, but we don’t stop driving cars because there are traffic accidents.  We don’t hide at home during flu season though the flu kills many people each year. Telling people what they can buy because some second-rate politician thinks some is or is not essential is a nonstarter.  If you want to live under strict social control, move top China.  I am not willing to live that life and neither are the vast majority of my fellow citizens."
2020-04-18 20:04:22,"For those of you who review the comments before reading the article I can tell you that the substance is ""we don't know what, where, when, or how this is going to pan out"".
In the end a bunch of people die and a bunch of people get blamed, but there's not enough people left to keep it from happening again."
2020-04-18 20:04:42,"How many Americans would need to be isolated and protected from exposure if America ‘opens up’. A quick search found that 20% of the US population is over 60 years old.  That puts 1/5 or 66 million Americans into the ‘at risk’ group.  There are around 100 diseases that affect the autoimmune system.  20% to 50% of Americans under 65 years old were estimated to have pre-existing conditions during the ACA debate. If we conservatively use 20% of the US population under 65 having some sort of autoimmune disease, that put the ‘at risk’ population at 132 million individuals or 40% of the US population.

The idea of opening up America and excluding 132 million people at a conservative estimate, how would many businesses expect to operate profitably?  I understand that many goods and services are ‘essential’ and those in the ‘at risk’ population will still spend on these goods and services.  My question becomes, if we remove 40% from the consumer non-essential economy, will businesses still be viable?  We need to 'liberate America' from C19 first, then we can 'liberate' workers, business and the economy."
2020-04-18 20:04:57,"""The best hope is that fatalities can be held to a minimum."" That's an optimistic viewpoint, considering President Trump is encouraging his base to challenge the stay-at-home orders.

Let's observe what happens as the virus has a chance to transmit and incubate for another 14 to 21 days. My guess is that Trump will quickly sing a new tune when the statistics show a sharp spike in cases."
2020-04-18 20:05:25,"For the most part, states which tend to be most supportive of the so-called ""right-to-life"" movement are, nonetheless, the same states which oppose saving lives by locking down. I expect the same is true for churches.

Churches and Trump-encouraged groups that fail to obey the law are usually the very same churches and groups that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law. (Do you think governors can get Homeland Security money to build walls around the churches and demonstrators?)

Why aren't the leaders of the churches and groups which hold in-person services and demonstrations in defiance of government rulings, services and demonstrations which, when they disperse, threaten the lives of many innocent Americans, treated as the terrorists they are? Consider the response when terrorists killed 3,000 on 9/11.

Once upon a time we had a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriot and a genuine wartime leader, who federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when the governor, Orval Faubus had used the state's National Guard to surround the schools and prevent integration under Federal Court order.

The situation is now largely reversed. We have a President who is neither a leader nor one who has served his country. This time we need governors to call out the National Guard to protect innocent Americans by enforcing the law."
2020-04-18 20:09:51,"In the Summer of 1918, people began to relax about the impact of the Spanish Flu. By Fall 1918, the consequences were swift and horrific. 

If by chance COVID19 has a seasonal nature, what we are seeing now is the ""off-season"" impacts of this virus. Now is not the time to undo the positive effects from all of our sacrifices over the last several weeks."
2020-04-18 20:11:44,"Recent antibody testing by Stanford appears to show number infected and had developed antibody about 50 times those shown to be infected by testing only those with symptoms.  Assuming herd immunity works when about 50% of the population has been infected, simple calculations show that we will reach herd immunity in about 500 days - with social distancing.  If the number of new cases increase by a factor of two with somewhat relaxed social distancing, we might reach this point in 250 days.  Very unlikely that widespread vaccines will be available before then.   No reason why we will not be back to pre-CV normal in about an year. 

All bets are off if there is no immunity having recovered from infection. 

We should know from Sweden’s experience which way to go."

In the months and years ahead, expect the people to be behind the government, even if the government gives a green light to commerce and social interaction. Those of us over 55 and/or with preexisting conditions will continue to be exceptionally cautious, including contact with may-be carriers who are younger. The half the population that is obese will be exceptionally cautious; it knows the complication and death rates. Those will kids will limit their activities lest they bring infection home. It's going to be tiptoe time to normalcy, much slower than the politicians would like. After all, a person can't be tested 24 hours a day."

As a former hospital COO, I have a grip on infection control that, after years of dealing with it (children in an old building were under my charge), serves me well now.
There are myriad ethical, moral, financial and public health decisions to make.  The situation is not helped by faulty leadership, but we've been faulty as a country for decades now.
At a now advanced age, I hope that the sane voices prevail in every realm and that we emerge as a less greedy and more fair place.  We urgently need healthcare for all, sustainability for our rapidly heating planet, and way less income inequality.  With any luck,progressive leadership will emerge among the young, as most of the old haven't shown these inclinations.
The only ""old"" politician I supported (and still support) is Senator Bernie Sanders.  His lessons have been learned by many in the younger generation. All thanks to this honest, consistent, truthful politician."

Well, the answer to that is: Our military. 

It's the dirty unspoken truth behind international power politics, and the reason why we still have the highest concentration of wealth, despite offshoring most of our production capacity.

The state actors who really make decisions about what happens always have a sword hanging over their heads. We might not be the smartest, or the most caring, or efficient, but we still have the biggest guns."

All scientific predictions are made by statistical analysis and models. These models and statistics depend of data. The more random and widespread the data the better the predictions of the model. Statistics 101 teaches you this and it is the backbone of any statistical model. As new data is available the better the model will become. 100% of the population can never be tested for the data. We have to do sampling and again the more random and  wide the sampling the better the data and hence better the prediction."
2020-04-18 20:22:45,"Thanks for the article--it is informative even though it is tilted toward pessimism and includes the de rigueur NYT slap at the President. I wish there were some way to synthesize this kind of reporting with an open minded hope for promising treatments and optimistic accounts of the new ways we are approaching vaccine development, testing, and production. I actually tend toward light pessimism myself, even stronger pessimism when it comes to some kinds of planning that will likely be necessary, but I think it's always important to see with two eyes."

I've seen no reports on the impact of decreased air pollution on deaths in the U.S."
2020-04-18 20:25:02,"There are no economic models for damage done by shuttering commercial America, and there should be. Unintended consequences are mounting.  
Our new fascination with numbers is not always without bias. Acute care medical professionals are obviously biased in favor of zero disease; as they should be. The press has amplified that drastically because it is popular. It’s not the only viewpoint. 
I did not see much historical perspective in this piece. Example: the newest projection of 60,000 deaths is in fact roughly equal to the CDC death stats for the 2017 flu season. So, it is true this bug will be much like a bad flu season. It will be worse than 2009, better than 1968. And much better than the 1918 pandemic’s toll of 675,000 Americans. In fact, that death rate as applied to our population gave us about the same number as the Imperial College of London: 2.2 million. 
If as stated, millions of Americans have been infected but obviously survived, the death rate is substantially less than presently shown. Equally then, transmissibility of the bug is less than thought. Both would be normal for any disease and imply herd immunity. 
Re: not opening schools, facts: less than 0.0088%, or one death out of CDC’s study sample of 11,500 were 5-14. More alarming is the 22% of COVID deaths among people 25-65 (working age). Knowing which of those were in the health professions and higher risk activities might suggest that some business and commercial activities can be safely restarted."

If FaceBook, or another monumental platform, could forgo the profit motive long enough to facilitate 'circles of giving' and the widespread use of time-dollars, we could stimulate a grassroots, food-sharing and domestic-work-force, like sewing masks at home, which may very well keep some of us from starving to death when our unemployment insurance runs out, and we're left scrambling and competing for extinct jobs."

The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics will ultimately determine how many of them should be attributed to COVID-19.

To do so, he needs to bring Warren to his team as a VP and have her in charge of getting our healthcare fixed.  Of course it means the revers of his corporate approach of putting band aids around the problem and fully buy in to Warren's proposals.   <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/opinion/joe-biden-health-care.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/opinion/joe-biden-health-care.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage</a>

In choosing Warren and her progressive policies he will bring in younger progressives and win a historical victory.

The administration is out of its depth, because it's led by an increasingly paranoid narcissist whose objective at any given moment flits between soothing his ego and padding the stock market - and the latter will be abandoned soon once he realizes that it's a lost cause. 

No, Trump won't turn into a rational leader.
No, he won't step aside and let Fauci dictate terms. 
No, we won't be able to adequately scale up testing. 
No, timely contact tracing won't happen. 
No, we will not wait until the scientifically right moment to reopen. 
No, he won't unite an increasingly anxious nation with his words or actions.
No, he will not ignore Obama when he speaks up for Biden.

2020-04-18 19:55:34,"I suspect that Trump is thinking more about the lack of revenue in his hotels than the health of the American people. His so-called plan for reopening is outrageous, because he wholly abdicates the traditional role of the federal government, to provide tests, PPE and expert medical help to the states in times of crisis, and tells the governors that each state must provide adequate testing, contact tracing and PPE themselves. His plan also leaves all decisions with the governors, then states that they can reopen only if impossible conditions are met, and Trump himself is now tweeting ""Liberate Michigan"" to encourage reopening immediately without any adequate precautions. Trump is too incompetent to organize testing, PPE and contact tracing, wants to shift all responsibility and the blame to the governors, is fecklessly undermining his own plan, and only really cares about restarting his own businesses. Where reopening is being tried it seems to be quickly leading to a resurging wave of infection. If this goes well, the governors deserve the credit, and if it goes poorly, Trump has earned all the blame."

2020-04-18 20:16:25,"Data seem to show that COVID-19 prevalence is much higher and mortality for those infected is much lower than this article suggests.  A recent study from Stanford found that the true prevalence in Santa Clara County is between 50 and 80 times higher than reported cases, and that mortality is correspondingly lower.  

<a href=""https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/04/17/stanford-study-more-than-48000-santa-clara-county-residents-have-likely-been-infected-by-coronavirus"" target=""_blank"">https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/04/17/stanford-study-more-than-48000-santa-clara-county-residents-have-likely-been-infected-by-coronavirus</a>

The current NY Times map of cases by state shows 717,825 cases in the US, and 34,022 deaths.  If we assume that there are 30 actual cases for every official case (this would be a very conservative application of the Stanford results), then we would have an estimated 21.5M cases and a mortality rate of 0.16%.  This suggests that while COVID-19 is very dangerous, it is not nearly as bad as it could be.  If I applied the actual Stanford estimates (between 50 and 80 actual cases for each official case), then COVID-19 would be less serious than the estimates I listed above.  

I am hopeful that with good testing, we will be able to ease up restrictions in the next few months.

I am not necessarily convinced that scientists will find an effective COVID-19 vaccine.  Scientists have never come up with an effective vaccine for any coronavirus, and it's not clear that COVID-19 will be an exception.  Let's hope that they find a vaccine, but it's certainly not a sure thing."

2020-04-18 20:26:12,"Another terrific article by Don McNeil who informs us that, ""The path forward depends on factors that are certainly difficult but doable, they [experts] said: a carefully staggered approach to reopening, widespread testing and surveillance, a treatment that works, adequate resources for health care providers — and eventually an effective vaccine."" What that takes is effective leadership, but instead we have had and still have grossly ineffective leadership by Donald Trump who seems intent, perhaps actually with malign intent, to inhibit or violate every step needed to safely reopen businesses.  He has yet to provide the testing so essential nor the contact tracing nor the ""adequate resources"" to protect our vulnerable front-line health care providers. Instead, he's seeking to undermine governors who he'd just conceded had the real power to ""Call Your Own Shots"" by promoting a rebellion against them that amounts to the reckless endangerment of both his followers and the citizens of the states he seeks to ""LIBERATE"" from the very guidelines he's put in place to contain the virus and allow for a timely and safe reopening of businesses. This is callous, cruel, and frankly criminal in that Trump knows full-well that thousands will die if governors succumb to his bullying."

2020-04-18 20:47:06,Very interesting article.  I would like to see historians and medical people address how the US and other countries dealt with TB.  I think it was quite prevalent in the US up until the 1930's or so.  How did our society operate and what was put in place to manage the spread of this highly contagious disease. Could we gain perspective from that situation that could be applied to today's pandemic?
2020-04-18 20:47:17,"Excellent story; the most comprehensive and clear I've read. I am relieved to read of researchers who believe it unethical to conduct studies using a placebo group of humans in these circumstances. I understand that there can't be ironclad proof that a drug is effective without it, but certainly many doctors on the front lines must have some observation-based opinions on whether a drug has been effective in saving lives. I'd like to hear more from them. What they see and opine might not be scientific. But it surely can't be dismissed either."

Japanese clinical research studies show that gargling is protective against respiratory infections.  Very likely tens of millions of Japanese are assiduously gargling, as is their custom.  That may be one reason Japan has remarkably low rates of confirmed cases and deaths.  Yet we Americans aren't even debating gargling, and CDC remains silent about it.  Gargling could save lives and help us to restart the economy."

Protease inhibitors already have a strong track record as successful antiviral drugs.  Pfizer has a C-3 protease inhibitor that is effective against the coronavirus in tissue culture which they plan to bring to clinical trials in August. Whether this specific compound is the answer or not, it is very likely that a 3-C protease inhibitor analog would be effective. There may be other antiviral solutions as well. The question is why hasn't the government engaged in a Manhattan like project, using all the combined resources of the the several large pharmaceutical companies together in a coordinated effort? In an all hands on deck 24/7 accelerated program there could have been a drug available in under six month; and the effort should have started two months ago."

I never thought I would see the day when mobs of misguided Americans would refuse to recognize the unprecedented damage and death this pandemic continues to cause while protesting IN FAVOR of the president who is encouraging such behavior.  More people will continue to become infected and die with such faulty reasoning and actions.  But that seems to be almost irrelevant to them or to their president."

Heavy among the already health compromised with poor respiratory capacity.   Life will go on.  And everyone will see this as a super flu.  This flu does seem to have a much longer life then previously thought, and  thus the current measures will not be sustainable because starvation and homelessness will accellerate rapidly.

2020-04-18 21:05:23,"Great comments here, but we should add that we are up against a virus which now morphs genetically with the DNA of the hosts it infects. The evidence is still circumstantial, but the virus seems to have the trait of changing RNA within a single host who is not presenting to be able to spread to susceptible new infected hosts where the result then turns deadly. Unfortunately, this will stymie efforts to develop a vaccine, because the vaccine will be attempting to address the older pre-morph versions of the virus, and researchers don't know where the virus will morph for some time. Not to be a downer, but the physical separation of the population remains the best solution for some time to come."

I just looked at the BNO news stats. 

If the USA death rate (5.2%) holds true for the remaining unresolved cases (643,843), and there are no more new cases, then the ultimate death total will be over 71,000.

There definitely will be many more new cases, so it looks like we've already left 60,000 behind."

If there were 2-3,000 COVID-19 test kits available, federal health authorities could obtain tests from a random sample of American adults who display no symptoms.

Those deceased individuals isn't a fluke or fake news.  Their deaths are real and that number continues to climb every single day.

How some people can dismiss that fact, that single sobering fact, and just think or assume everything will be okay, safe and back to normal by May1 or Memorial Day or July 4th, well, good luck with that fantasy.  There are still untold number of people who still either underestimate, dismiss or deny this virus is not only deadly, but does not discriminate.

Every day becomes a little more bleaker with that knucklehead in the WH with no real plan other than hurry up and get back to work so the stock market can continue to climb upwards.

This country is woefully shy of any meaningful and positive leadership that will navigate towards long-term solutions rather than merely placing bandaids on the many serious and complex issues we are facing today, tomorrow and the next untold number of months ahead.

The president's knee-jerk response to quickly and hastily open businesses back up and allow people to return to work without proper safety materials like masks or testing kits is not only irresponsible, but reckless and potentially deadly.

He is perhaps the only journalist who does not demonize, blame another country for the pandemic. His view of how China has handled the outbreak is not uncritical yet fair. He understands when you face with a NOVEL and lethal virus, you don't know how it would infect and how to deal with it particularly in the early days of the outbreak. This is true for any country including the US. The challenge is how quickly and effectively the leaders and scientists can learn from the experience and data and carry out the right policies to contain it."

Lets explain this in clearer terms:

First off, I have never ever known anyone to die from the regular seasonal flu.  True.  But I have already known 1 person to have died from Covid-19 and two that are still really sick from it.

Second, we do not Social Distance during regular flu.  Imagine what the 40,000 confirmed dead from Covid-19 in the US alone would be now if we didn't use Social Distancing with this.   100,000-200,000?  More?  Much more?

Third, we have Anti-Virals and Vaccines for virtually all seasonal Flu's.

Covid-19 is an alien virus to our systems.  We are easy meat for it.  It has no resistance coming from any of us.  It is the 3 am wake up call at your front door from something you prayed never to meet if you're the right person - which a lot of us are."

The missing link here is that Pres. Trump did not wait for herd immunity nor a proven  treatment nor a good vaccine.

J&J has promised a billion by end of next year using its proven manufacturing technology PerC6 platform (most recently used for the Ebola vaccine).  The idea China would not sell us something is farcical. They are already supplying diagnostic tests, API for therapeutics and PPE.  Final point is if you ask 30 experts for an opinion, you will get 30 different answers.  These opinions are not worth the paper they are printed on nor are their ridiculous models and prognostications for the future which change by the nano-second.

Trump knows that the chances are increasing that the pandemic will not be over by November, so the whole thrust of his administration now is how to steal or cancel the election, and that is where he is going to do the most damage.

When we prematurely end 'stay at home' restrictions, the virus will flare for a second and possible third wave. In 1918, the subsequent outbreaks of Spanish flu were much more deadly than the initial wave.

Initial government predictions of 100,000 to 240,000 fatalities will be eclipsed if the selfish few manage to infect the gullible masses. I know who I trust. It's not the President or his minions."
2020-04-18 21:11:02,"The entire Coronavirus scenario was predicted in advance, and the US had contingency plans.
Under Hillary Clinton, or indeed, ANY normal president, the US would have been working with China, allies, and international agencies last November and December, to prevent this pandemic from leaving China to begin with.
Instead, Trump fired all the planners, denied the science, and refused all collaboration.
Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Global Recession.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.
There can be no progress in health or economics until Trump leaves office in Jan. 2021."
2020-04-18 20:35:19,"Who believes the fantasy that Donald Trump spins daily in his Coronavirus White House Task Force Rallies?  That America will open up, abra cadabra, despite the assault we've taken economically, socially, in every area of their lives? 

Who knows what percentage of Americans will die from Covid-19 between now and 2021, with our general elections arriving in 6 months, ready or not. Who's paying attention to Trump's ""Opening Up America Again"" guidelines?

We're at the mercy today of infectious disease scientists pushing back against Trump's reopening our country in the midst of a pandemic. America is closed today. We'll open for business when the plague passes and not before."
2020-04-18 20:49:53,"Trump's reopening does not even resemble a plan. Trump however continues to display of this mastery of lying. 

From the Guardian:

The US has so far tested about 3.3 million people, about 1% of its population. Per capita, that is small compared with several countries including Germany and South Korea. Iceland has tested people at 10 times the US rate.

“Testing has been an unnecessary disaster,” said Michael Greenberger, director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security. “Trump says we have the best testing, but the US is in the last percentage of tests administered to its population.”

Not one of the 50 states is currently in a position to carry out tracking of Covid-19 infections on the scale needed, whatever Trump said about their readiness to reopen. Many states, including the hardest hit, New York, are still experiencing testing shortages, 12 weeks after the first US case was recorded.

Time to invoke 25th amendment. This guy only wants to open things up so he can get back to his rallies. Trump is sick of being questioned on his performance, he wants his Trumpy crowd to cheer him on despite his lies."
2020-04-18 20:50:19,"For the past five weeks, I've been logging into the website of the local Austin paper to track the number of cases. We started with four back in mid-March, and are now at 1074 five weeks later, with no decline at all and a death rate of 1.95 percent. It makes no sense to ease restrictions, since the case number is still only climbing. Yet, our governor is ""reopening"" the state, starting in three days. It's head-scratching logic, to say the least."
2020-04-18 21:20:35,"IF you want to be able to open the economy to some degree without overwhelming the hospitals (which incidentally will increase the death rate), you have to be able to *know* how many people are sick and how many have been exposed.  Then you can adjust the degree to which you open the economy to keep the hospitals busy but not overwhelmed, until the infection has worked its way through most of the population, or there is a vaccine, whichever comes first.  Nothing revolutionary there — and that is what Germany is attempting to do now.  It's a basic control problem in engineering parlance.

But the key is something called 'observability', meaning the ability to measure the variable you want to control (in this case, new infections).  In other words, it all comes down to testing, testing, testing.  Without it you will either hide under a rock forever or end up with a cataclysm of simultaneous infection."
2020-04-18 21:21:01,"Thank you, Donald McNeil, for this incredibly well researched and thoughtful article. There are even some glimmers of hope in it!"
2020-04-18 21:21:29,"As the virus spreads towards the rural regions, particularly those in the ""Red"" states, I suspect it will become somewhat of a ""silent killer"".

The ""conservative"" states are anxious to re-open their economies almost regardless of the public heath consequences.  The reactions of those state governors to the mobs seems to be one of both tolerance and sympathy.

With a return to greater social mingling, sans any cure or vaccine, it is highly likely there will be a considerable spreading of the virus.  And as a consequence there will certainly be a rise in the death rate.

But given the political flavor of those regions I would expect that for many of these deaths the underlying cause will either be hidden altogether or just ascribed to some bland category like ""old age"" or ""general poor health"" etc.

Despite the reasonable pleadings of leaders like NY's Governor Cuomo today -- there's no way in this angrily divided society that anyone will keep ""politics"" out of dealing with this pandemic.

I am just glad that I divide my time between two leading ""Blue"" states with strong leaders who will not kowtow to the howling of rightwing mobs."
2020-04-18 21:21:55,"The impact of COVID cannot be measured solely by fatalities. While lowering the number of deaths is important and a good metric to track, it alone does not tell the whole story of this pernicious virus. We know of two people who have been very ill with confirmed cases for 3 and 4 weeks, but who have not been hospitalized and have not died, so we don't know if they are included in any of the counts being reported. Nevertheless, they are so ill, and recovering so slowly, that they will not be able to return to work for some time, if ever, even when and if there are jobs for them to return to. The impact of this illness will be felt by them, and by all of us, for a long time to come."
2020-04-18 21:26:32,"There will not be a return to ""normal."" The future has been changed.

The only way that there will be economic (and physical) survival is if the federal government basically puts everyone who does not have a paying job on their payroll and to the extent that businesses (other than Amazon and Walmart and their ilk) are necessary ""own"" the business so that it can be open. When the virus passes in two, three, or even ten years, then it can ""reprivatize"" the economy and recoup the amounts spent through taxes.

What will remain will be universal basic income, universal health care, and similar programs.

Donald Trump's non-response in the early stages will have done what Bernie Sanders couldn't -- give us democratic socialism."

Sorry to all of the folks in those states who do stay at home.  My only advice is to get out of Dodge while you can.  Or Austin (really Austin?) or Jacksonville.  Run from Michigan now.

No more travel, restaurants, theaters, and other social gathering places, will be taboo for years to come. We live in a condo but next year we may buy into a small home with a backyard. Nothing fancy just a place to step outside for some fresh air and a little gardening.

Grateful to have some to give perspective but anything resembling a realistic future is still at least several months, if not more, off.  This article implies school better adapt quickly after not changing their style of education for the last century.  As being a parent it is hit and miss (mostly miss) as to how schools are adapting and most thing Fall will start up normally.  Many parents need to work to make money and when you have young kids somebody also has to watch them. Some level of risk will have to be taken as while we are not there yet, the measurement of risk has to be taken into account.  The entire workforce can't be ground for very long without the entire economy collapsing."
2020-04-18 21:41:54,"The article states ""In truth, it is not clear to anyone where this crisis is leading us"". It all depends upon the leadership. Under Trump's optimistic leadership with cooperation from governors, the USA has already slowed the spread of corona virus, the curve has started to turn down, hospital system handled and will be able to handle the treatment of the sick, several therapies are in clinical trial, vaccine trial has already started, the people are following the social distance guidelines, market  stabilized and started to move up, Govt. has allocated and is  ready to spend trillions of dollars to help people and businesses to survive, Federal Reserve Bank is doing everything in its power to stabilize and revive the economy, and new technologies are mushrooming to cope with lockdown. As a result, America will most likely achieve normalcy soon by opening the economy in three phases under Trump's guidelines supported by his medical experts. By the end of the third phase, we will have therapies, drugs, and vaccine to kill the virus forever or we will have enough herd immunity to manage the virus with minimum disruption. 

After the end of this crisis, I don't think there will be a lot of people who prefer China's leadership to Trump's."

If that's the way it goes, my first priority will be to get infected right away. I can live in the garage while I recover. Yes, there's a risk. But that's my risk to choose so I can go back to work and provide for my family instead of trusting the government do so."

  It’s just that we live in a very controlled environment (generally  don’t go out except for walks and to get the mail) and I don’t worry if I occasionally forget  to disinfect a high touch item ( light switches, etc)

2020-04-18 21:48:19,"How to deal with covid-19 has been turned into a political struggle rather than a reasoned effort to deal with a threat. The media has had a field day with it, pressing each side's equally poorly informed opinion on us all, day and night, minute by minute, citing either raw numbers or percentages, driven by drama rather than rational analysis. But the virus doesn't care about your political beliefs. it is neither republican nor democrat; nor is the solution.
This virus will probably become a permanent part of our lives, like measles, smallpox, and influenza have. They too were feared, and in their prime were responsible for much more mortality and morbidity than covid-19. But we lived our lives and learned to cope with each so that we no longer fear them. We go on with our daily lives despite the continued existence and still significant effects on our society some of them, and others unmentioned, have. It will be like that with covid-19 as well. Some people will continue to die, many more will still become ill, as our experience with the others mentioned has demonstrated. But we will learn to live our lives and address the threat with a rational approach over time. Meanwhile society has to learn to stand up, move on,  and cope with it in our midst."
2020-04-18 21:50:27,"With Trump as president, one of the few things I can be thankful for is living in a blue state with Cuomo as governor.  Trump's plan to make this a blue-red state divide will backfire, like most of his ""businesses:""

First, blue state governors are professionals and can read polls.  They know the vast majority of their residents support the lock-downs, and do not want to risk their lives and the lives of their families to go back to work.

Second, the red states that ease their restrictions prematurely will see a spike in illness and death and overwhelm their ERs.  This will have the opposite effect of scaring the population even more than they already are.

Meanwhile, third, the responsible blue states will continue to beat back the virus the old-fashioned way -- with science and sacrifice and not baseless wishes.  And the economy will only significantly ""re-open"" when New York, California and the other wealthy blue states open.

Eventually those twin blue-state assets (wealth and intelligence) will lead to effective tracking and testing, and more availability of protective masks and gear.  This will permit a thoughtful and lasting re-opening of their economies, while minimizing the impact of any subsequent outbreaks, including from infected persons traveling into their states from a relative “hot-zone.”

So given the way Trump is ""leading,"" the coronavirus will become like the opioid crisis.  More entrenched in red states and less and less of a problem in blue states."
2020-04-18 21:51:14,"All the epidemic diseases in the past have raged for a few months, and then disappeared.    

Testing random samples of the US population has revealed much higher percentages of people with antibodies than expected.   Once this hits a certain level of the population, the epidemic might start to wane.    

At the same time, doctors are gaining experience in helping patients with serious cases of the virus.   The death rate in hospitals will probably go down because of this.   

This combination of factors may get us off  the hook sooner than expected.   Most of the predictions so far have been wrong, so I'm not making any predictions, but things may turn out better than feared."
2020-04-18 21:53:18,"There are a lot of good ideas in this article.

However, I think that we need to drop the term ""experts"" and use proper professional titles like ""epidemiologist"" and ""psychologist"" and ""social scientist.""

The term ""expert"" give the impression that ""experts"" are roundly knowledgable about everything, or at least more knowledgable than the rest of us.  

The reality is that ""experts"" are ONLY ""experts"" in their one, very specific field, and even then usually only in one aspect of it.  And they only measure success and failure through the narrow lens of their single field, which might not prioritize what is important to someone else at the personal level.

Experts also are not without their own cognitive biases and human limitations.  Bias can keep experts from understanding their research, or can bend it one way or the other.  In many fields there is wide disagreement between experts.  The public needs to see this disagreement and be a part of decision making that affects their lives and freedoms.

And experts are not immune to getting taken over by politics.  My own professional association, the APA, has become a joke of political agendas, shoddy research, and position papers that parrot Critical Theory cliches from the humanities with no regard for the quality psychological or neurological research that does exist.

We need experts, but we also need checks and balances on experts.  They are worthy of respect.  They do not form an infallible magisterium."

This time is different partly because, unlike today, we had several presidents who inspired us and put the country first (even Eisenhower, who was an extinct type of Republican) but also because:

1. China will recover more quickly than anyone else

Obviously, there are others who specialize in human behavior.

QUESTION: Have regional governor groups considered consulting the directors of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association? 

They might be of use in assembling a panel of experienced trauma and disaster experts.

Churches and Trump-encouraged groups that fail to obey the law are usually the very same churches and groups that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law. (Do you think governors can get Homeland Security money to build walls around the churches and demonstrators?)

Why aren't the leaders of the churches and groups which hold in-person services and demonstrations in defiance of government rulings, services and demonstrations which, when they disperse, threaten the lives of many innocent Americans, treated as the terrorists they are? Consider the response when terrorists killed 3,000 on 9/11.

Once upon a time we had a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriot and a genuine wartime leader, who federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when the governor, Orval Faubus had used the state's National Guard to surround the schools and prevent integration under Federal Court order.

The situation is now largely reversed. We have a President who is neither a leader nor one who has served his country. This time we need governors to call out the National Guard to protect innocent Americans by enforcing the law."

One trend that will hopefully be reversed by this painful period of suffering is the erosion of the confidence of some Americans in facts, evidence, science, learning and teaching. All Americans are going to learn that wishing for things to be true--or believing things simply because they fit your opinions--cannot change reality. The virus doesn't care about any of that. There is only one path out of this pandemic, and that is by answering questions and considering that evidence without the context of political bias. The truth has always mattered, but never as much as now."

1) Is the now seasonal H1N1 less lethal to someone with currently no antibodies to it?  Does everyone have at least some antibodies to seasonal H1N1?  

2) Are people asymptomatic because it's an asymptomatic strain, or because of their strong immune systems to the same strain? 

Different subject, the science paper provided by the link in the quote above says, 

""In early 2009, a novel pandemic H1N1 influenza virus appeared, but it has not exhibited unusually high pathogenicity. Nevertheless, because this virus spreads globally, some scientists predict that mutations will increase its lethality.""

The “protesters” appear to be endangering themselves their families, particularly their elders and their neighbours. If they are gathering and ignoring social distancing the worry is how many of them are congregating. Just lets hope this is a small movement. Otherwise they will undo previous efforts of control and instigate a new spreading of the virus. Many have disadvantaged themselves in order to save the lives of others, both economically and emotionally. I can not visit my elderly mother. I can not visit my sister who has been diagnosed with Leukemia. Staying home saves lives."

""India and Brazil also have large vaccine industries. If the virus moves rapidly through their crowded populations, they may lose millions of citizens but achieve widespread herd immunity well before the United States does. In that case, they might have spare vaccine plant capacity.""

Apparently  it is ok to consider the dead of millions of indians and brazilians as  collateral damage to the benefit of americans, but not either  europeans or chineses.

Nucleic acid based testing detects active COVID-19 infection, including in silent carriers.  Antibody tests can detect 1) ongoing COVID-19 infection after sufficient time for antibodies to develop and 2) those who had the virus but are now virus free and won't spread the virus.  Do not confuse a positive COVID-19 antibody test as meaning with certainty that a person had an active, ongoing COVID-19 infection or is a silent carrier. They would have to have a positive nucleic acid based test to show that they currently have an active COVID-19 infection and therefore could spread the virus to others."

As Trump's popularity started to slide, the spinmeisters, Putin's social media trolls and right wing extremists (see: InfoWars) have pivoted from Trump's incompetence, tin ear and failure to function as a coherent leader to a new astro-turf grass roots Tea party-esque raging base. Stoking a wild xenophobic blame game- a new 'movement' is trying to shift attention to China, WHO and anyone but Trump. These folks are so afraid of Trump losing in November that they're suckered into believing there is no pandemic. They have been convinced that covid-19 is a Democratic plot to defeat their guy. Real economic distress gets redirected away from the failed federal bail out to a delusional solution.

Some would just want to ""LOCK the vulnerable UP!""

One of the worst consequences of these desperate Trump propaganda Big Lies- (apart from putting the entire country at great risk for an endless pandemic with NO return to economic stability)- is that rational people now wish these hotheads get very sick !

Trump is totally obsessed with his own image while thousand die unnecessarily due to his total incompetence.  The latest Trump tactic to promote protests against the lockdown is just part of his failed leadership in time of national crisis.  

Trump has systematically let the coronavirus pandemic get out of control as follows: 
Destroying the CDC’s capacity to deal with a pandemic; 
Refusing to take responsibility for his response to the pandemic. Trump said, ""I don't take any responsibility at all.""; 
Trump ignored dire warnings in January and February from U.S. intelligence agencies about the coronavirus pandemic; 
Failing to establish critical testing early on to contain the spread of the virus. Trump said "" One day it's like a miracle—it will disappear."" ; 
Failing to procure medical supplies needed for this public health crisis; 
Appointing anti-science Mike Pence to run the White House Coronavirus Task Force; 
Favoring governors who are political allies when distributing lifesaving medical supplies; 
Failing to allow  experts to manage this crisis. 

In a country where chaos prevails instead of leadership, there is no hope for managing the scourge we now face.

Maurice Hilleman, the great genius of creating vaccines, in the summer of 1957. noted in the NYT a story that children in Hong Kong were sick with glassy eyes. He promptly asked the US military to acquire samples of what he was certain was a flu virus. Soldiers were dispatched to Hing Kong and samples were obtained and flown back to Hillerman in late summer or early fall. In about a month he had created a vaccine and gave it to several drug companies which promptly produced the necessary doses of vaccine. By December of 1957 it was getting shot into arms all over America and a flu which had caused 70,000 deaths was brought to an end as 60.8 million Americans got the vaccine. Between those who were vaccinated and those like me were infected, herd immunity was created. The Asian Flu was gone from America."

Unfortunately, your ideas are not going to be absorbed by 99% of readership, and certainly not by the one person who should but seems flummoxed by anything more than a page with illustrations.

It would seem almost impossible to accurately estimate the ultimate outcome as a) the virus, the disease and the societal and environmental factors are all novel and incompletely elucidated, b) the data available today are known to be incomplete, non-representative and include a lot of ""guesstimates"".   I only consider S. Korea's data to be statistically representative - but her society is much different from the US'.   We'll just have to wait fo the future - much like any relationship.

If I may, one can regard this ""pandemic"" as a collective, global relationship.    If Gaia (earth as a being) is real, she could be sending out a clear message of, ""Enough is enough!""  

In one month, immediate global threats to her, such as pollution, can be halted; blue skies over much of China and India, rare in a generation.   In the silence, wildlife has ventured into cities.   Even halving travel, the world won't stop - especially was we can work remotely.

By a mild pandemic, targeting essentially those beyond reproductive or professional activity, the point can be made without devastating society like the Black Plague did (30-50% wiped out in Europe in 1350-1450).

Even wars and terrorists have stopped and nations shown that cooperation is essential for survival."

The fact is that the “experts” don’t have solutions just about anything related to COVID19 yet. The doctors are merely treating symptoms not the disease and are trying to save lives using whatever drugs they can find as helpful. I guess media and Democrats are the real experts whose expertise are obscuring information and Blame Trump. Governor Cuomo is a real expert who put millions of New Yorker in danger by not doing enough and blaming the Feds for all his incompetencies. remember his theatrics when Trump suggested mandatory quarantines and closing state borders?

Ross' own employer published a great article quoting a Stanford study how our destroying of the wilderness (due to population explosion) makes it easier for these animal-orgin viruses to mutate.

The curve is flattening because the constant daily total of 30,000 new cases is always adding to the pool of cases and is therefore a slightly smaller percentage.  Filling an empty swimming pool with 10 gallons of water every minute and even though curve flattens as you as the pool fills--10 gallons is only 10 % of 100 gallons and only 1% of a thousand gallons--you're still add to the pool at a constant rate.  And, in the last week the total pool of confirmed cases has increased 38%, from 533,000 to 736,000--over 200,000 cases.

Disturbingly, the percentage rate of deaths has steadily increased and has grown over the last several weeks from 1.3% to 5.2% as of today.  We'll hit a million cases in 9 days...and if the fatality rate doesn't go up again, there will be 52,000 confirmed deaths.  And that's a conservative estimate.  65 days to get with range of Vietnam war deaths over 10, or is it 12 years?

The ONLY solution available right now is social isolation for everyone, and get as many tests as possible, both for Covid-19, and the anti-bodies.  Or millions more WILL die.

2020-04-18 22:45:38,"This article reveals a basic reality of this pandemic: The rate of infection is mediated by population density and the likelihood of social contact. It is because of these factors that larger cities and their surroundings—where high economic activity and high rate of public interactions are prevalent—have had an overwhelming proportion of infections and a high number of deaths. What this article does not explicitly address, however, is that these numbers are particularly high in population pockets where even higher density and poverty levels affect behavior, type of employment and access to education, healthcare and other quality of life resources. From the beginning, the current administration’s reaction has focused on trying to attenuate the economic impact of the crisis. This is obviously a reflection of an attitude the president, his political allies and many supporters have shown, which emphasizes money above other important considerations like personal health and well targeted planning. The effects of poverty, for instance, are often dismissed at best. It is therefore crucial that experts and other leaders measuring rate of exposure and its effects on the American population now plan policy and draw conclusions taking these factors into consideration.

Let's call that what it is (to the mind of Trump and his followers): ""payback.""

Ironically, it's the supporters themselves who are going to be paying the biggest price, since they unwittingly exposed themselves to the virus."
2020-04-18 22:32:58,When is enough enough and time to end the trump presidency? How much more damage will you allow to happen? Do you really believe there will be fair elections in november?
2020-04-18 22:34:17,"When I saw the protesters or Trump supporters wearing masks that said it all.  But who is surprised at their ignorance when they  believe and support Trump or their ""republican"" leader."
2020-04-18 22:48:09,Thank you Mr. McNeil for your fact-rich reporting with valuable links to important sources.  News-hungry readers appreciate your effort - very well done.
2020-04-18 22:54:09,"The governors who are enforcing a shut down of their states- like Whitmer in MI and Cuomo in NY and all the others - are going to face a nasty problem: If they resist the protesters who want to end restrictions and the death rate is kept low, then people will say they hurt the economy by over-reacting. If, as the number of cases levels off, they relax restrictions and the death rate takes off again, then people will say they did not do enough. 
Already we can hear people shouting that the experts are wrong and cannot be trusted because we have fewer deaths than the worst predictions. 
Heads we lose, tails we lose."
2020-04-18 22:59:02,"Goody. More experts.

And this at a point when it is crystal clear that ALL the models and ALL the expert predictions were off by orders of magnitude [N.B., even when the predictd effects of social distancing are part of the model of otherwise factored in]. As they have been wildly incorrect for several previous epidemics.

Our experts would now like to claim that ""The gains to date were achieved only by shutting down the country."" Which is an assertion  that has no genuine data behind it. 
As is the newest claim that, ""The White House’s “phased” plan for reopening will surely raise the death toll no matter how carefully it is executed.""

The great mystery is why we continue to imagine that these 'experts' have much that is practical and useful to tell us."
2020-04-18 22:31:22,"So there is a comprehensive understanding of what will be required to manage the virus amongst our population - maybe that is the good news, despite the somber reality portrayed. But the constant betrayals of Americans by Trump threatens a rational approach to all of this. I have 3 questions, the answers to which may either allow us to mitigate the human toll as well as we are able, given the unknowns and random nature of the virus, or perhaps even seal our collective fates to a significant degree. They are as follows:

1. Will the Administration actually provide the number of tests needed, plus the materials required to perform the tests (reagents, etc)
2. Will the political bent and agitation of his base be allowed to a degree where Trump is permitted to obscure the scientific approach to the application of the smart response to the crisis.
3. If the agitation of Trumps base results in violence and/or constant violation of the social distancing and other guidelines, will Governors have the authority to enforce the restrictions with police actions in order to provide safety for most of us.
4. Is there any possibility that Trump or the DOJ under Barr will cheat on the election, or tacitly call for a national revolt amongst his base that is currently believing FOX news, particularly if polls show that he’s sure to lose the election."

2020-04-18 23:13:49,"Your piece has much positive comment trying to balance the overall tone but you reach for the negative e.g. this could go on for years versus viruses tend to become less deadly ‘Spanish flu became seasonal Hin1‘. America isn’t in this alone, so ingenuity of all nations is in collaboration with ‘American ingenuity’. Lockdowns and other practices have been working and as you noted cases are plateauing. Don’t get caught ignoring the positive developments while projecting doom, because it really might just be that the economic gloom has a greater impact not only financially but also on the nation’s health and well-being."
2020-04-18 23:15:54,"An excellent article that lays out the road ahead of us.  The series of steps that would lead us from the present to the immunity conferred by a hoped for vaccine are becoming clear, but does the US have the will and discipline to test, trace, and quarantine at the levels necessary?  I fear not.  Historians among the readers, has a pandemic ever been politicized and burdened by misinformation as this one is?  As a research biologist, I find the disconnect between the emerging consensus among scientists and public health agencies on the one hand, and the willful spread misinformation and denial of the reality to be seen in any emergency room by Trump and his followers on the other hand to be beyond comprehension.  It seems that Trump himself is trapped in a state of cognitive dissonance between these poles, endorsing rational proposals from his scientific advisors one hour, only to negate his own statements in a tweet the next hour.  If the consequences of his dissonance weren't so threatening to peoples' health, it would be fascinating to watch him engage in this tug of war between his reluctant acceptance of covid reality and his worst dysfunctional inclinations.  We may be trapped in a deadly dance between impetuous openings of society and panicked retreats back to isolation until when and if Americans vote Trump out of office next fall.  It is frightening to consider the cost in human lives that will result from Trump's failures as president."
2020-04-18 23:16:12,"No surprise Donald McNeil Jr. produces this in-depth compendium of the most likely scenarios for ""returning to normal.""

We face immense bleakness and it's hard to make lemonade out of lemons.  For the elderly, this sounds like the end of the line: either they die from Covid-19 or from advancing age made worse by depression and isolation from family.

The economic, social, and political impact of the next year are so unimaginable that it's hard to make any prediction beyond a day.

The one factor that stands out, however, is the wild card known as Trump.  That he's egging on Tea Party protestors to violate public health norms, threatens our entire social order.  

There only few safe ways to transition and yet, message changes daily based on FOX News.  Funny, how the president always manages to make a bad situation worse."
2020-04-18 23:27:15,"With all due respect, I don't think ""America First"" is going anywhere after this crisis. If anything, it's likely to become a bigger part of our body politic because it will make Americans deeply skeptical of globalism and our reliance on China.

Let's start with the basics: this virus emerged from deep inside a foreign nation; it spread rapidly throughout our globalized, interconnected world; it caused not just our nation, but every nation, to hoard supplies for self-preservation; and it revealed that yet another prominent institution, the WHO, caters to interests at conflict with its mission.

If I was in Mr. Trump's position, I would turn up the nationalism and emphasize China, China, China. That this is what we have reaped for exporting so much of our industrial capacity to a nation whose values so blatantly contradict our own, a nation that quite possibly let COVID-19 sneak out of a lab, yet continues to obfuscate its origins by kicking out foreign reporters and censoring its own researchers. A nation that strong-arms the WHO into issuing undeserved praise, yet kept the lid on coronavirus while stockpiling billions of facemasks for itself.

Once the dust settles, reasonable folks will be asking why we  rely on a foreign nation/adversary to manufacture our medical equipment, drugs, and vaccines. Why isn't this critical infrastructure here on our shores? ""America First"" is a practical response: that we should become resilient and self-reliant by bringing back our industry."
2020-04-18 23:29:21,"Well the truth is no one knows. I would like to add one thing .  We need to save money for research. More research not less. The economic response of the governments both Federal and State have not been well thought out frankly  was too quick. .

Giving people money through convention systems of unemployment insurance , welfare and other means tested programs is better. Save the money for needed research."
2020-04-18 23:31:48,"The WHO, and national public health institutes should also carefully study and analyze the dozen high casualty countries. There are for some unexplained reason mostly western countries. Of course, there are China, Iran, Brazil and Turkey in this dozen group. Is it under reporting in non western countries? Is it the climate? Are there any cultural, social, governmental or other structural weaknesses in these countries? The world needs an answer. Perhaps, the UN security council should investigate."

The continental west coast states -- California, Oregon, Washington -- form an Alliance of Reality, or whatever they choose to call themselves.

New England plus New York could do the same.

Then pursue an independence within the republic [sic], and autonomy such as enjoyed by 25% of the regions in Italy, which are historically and ethnographically distinguished from the other fifteen regions.

Continue to contribute to national defense, but otherwise enjoy self-rule.  10% of tax revenue goes to the federation; 90% remains with the regions.

2020-04-18 23:33:52,"This is a most informative article.  I am so appreciative of the people and press who value, respect, and tell the truth, keep us informed, & bring us up-to-date with solid information!

My husband's 84 year-old sister was released from Emory-Decatur hospital in Atlanta this morning. She was in the hospital for 3 days in terrible shape when admitted--high fever, shortness of breath, weak and disoriented (She is one sharp & tough cookie ordinarily--the only girl in the family raised with 4 brothers)  

She had the symptoms of COVID-19, yet kept testing negative with different tests. She is to go home and quarantine herself for 14 days. Her son was wonderful and texted the widely dispersed multigenerational family with updates 4-5 times a day. 

We feel like we dodged a bullet, but now realize how truly scary and uncertain this disease is, and how dedicated, impressive, and heroic the worn and frustrated medical teams are. There are a bunch of people in health care in our neighborhood in UT.  

No thanks to Trump--as the misinforming, grandstanding, bungling Decider of public health in this country--the doctors, nurses, health care workers, and hospital staff have muddled through without the supplies and coordination they need in an epidemic, but with fortitude, deep worry, and concern.

It also strikes me that those ""Liberate"" protesters, whom Trump welcomed and empowered, are actually the people who are making health policy in this country & are the ones Trump tries to please"
2020-04-18 23:35:18,"It is comforting to say that we should be guided by the facts, but it's far from that simple.  I have been analyzing the publicly available data related to COVID-19 for about a month now, and ""the facts"" are siimply all over the place.  I could post a half dozen examples or crazy data, but that wouldn't change anyone's mind.

Just one example, and I pick Iceland only because they have by far the most extensive testing of any nation. I am NOT saying that diagnostic and surveillance testing isn't important, but it's hard to find proof in the data.  Iceland has tested by far the most people, about 12%.  Texas has tested 20 time less than that, about 0.6%  Yet Iceland has more than four times as many deaths per capita as Texas.  When I plot the data internationally and within the US, there is no discernible correlation.  The story comparing Germany to Japan and South Korea is equally confusing.

We are in hot soup here.  We need some expert advice backed up by retrospective data that shows quantitatively what the problem is, what works, and what doesn't.  No more speculation, ""it's obvious that's"", or ""it's just gotta be's.""  Just as Trump has met his match in a virus that doesn't care about bluster, so have the rest of us with a reliance on data that doesn't really tell a story."

In 1863 -- the deadliest year of America's deadliest war -- total lives lost (North & South) numbered 15,000. New York State shot past that in the first 4 months of covid-19. Twice as many Americans died last Thursday (April 16) as they did on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941. That was at Pearl Harbor -- ""a date which will live in infamy.""

did the ""case"" test positive and self quarantined at home with garden variety flu symptoms?

did the ""case"" walk into an ER with fever and difficulty breathing?

Few days ago, a random test of population in Sweden showed about 15% are infected, meaning 1500000, and the same day death toll was 1203, which makes to IFR=0.08%. Similar numbers based on similar serology tests shows similar infection mortality rates (Italy, CA). This IFR is for whole population. There is almost sero fatality among persons younger than 30. If we do not consider facts, we will stay in darkness.

I read an article a few days ago in WaPo which described this illness as not just respiratory but that the virus can also attack all of our internal organs - heart, liver, kidneys, brain.  The description of 'just the facts, ma'am' was more frightening than any Stephen King novel (such as 'The Stand' - a terrifying novel).  For the first time since this all began in January, I became very frightened.  At 68 with underlying issues I could easily catch this disease and die.  I don't want to die.  So that means I shelter in place with a partner who, at this point, does all the few errands we deem necessary.

I said a few weeks ago, ""Life has changed"".  But I think I'm just now letting it truly seep into my brain that life truly has changed so dramatically that I may never see the other side of all of this.

If this is the new normal I have to change my ways.  Turn off the TV.  Read my books, of which I have hundreds.  Play records.  Stop reading so many articles online.  Take more walks.  Explore day trips in the car (gas is cheap! Write. Sing. Talk to friends.  Work around the house.

""punishes"" the governors by supporting 
right wing factions that are against 
sheltering  in place.

Let's examine this situation.  Trump is playing rogue president to all his advisory boards.  He is acting out his basic, strongest emotion--  REVENGE.
In other words his need for revenge is stronger than the needs of the people, stronger even than global well being.  

How can we expect him to make a well-reasoned decision?  We can't.

I never imagined something so microscopically tiny could have such power to cause unprecedented and long term destruction not just in this country but throughout the world.

And the leadership in the WH is comparable to the country flying without rudder - just aimlessly gliding about without a plan or a map.

Every day seems like we are in deeper trouble than we were the month prior.  It's becoming a mystery as to why I do get out of bed every morning."

To date, only about 700,000 people out of a country of 330 million have tested positive. Would the majority of us really be discriminated by the 0.2% of the population that has perceived immunity?

Humans call themselves an ""ethical species"" and invent all sorts of gods, of logically inconsistent philosophies and meaningless dialectic artifacts to justify their unjustifiable actions. I have no sympathy for my species, and I am indifferent to its current predicament."

Assuming neither herd immunity nor effective treatment nor vaccine, Americans over age 55 who want any kind of quality of life at all, as well as the best chance to survive, will flee big cities like New York, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, and Philadelphia. Rents will plummet there, as will residential real estate values, as will commercial real estate values when people realize that they do not want to be going up and down in elevators with strangers, in booths that have transported thousands of strangers that same day. Urban tax bases will crumble. However, it is an excellent time to be a senior housing developer, or to own rental property in small towns all over the country."

What would the next year or 2 be like if Mr. Azar HHS Director led the WH Task Force and we had a collaborative National and Internationl strategy ?


A couple remarks from
Alex M. Azar II
National Biodefense Summit
April 17, 2019

 -As HHS Secretary, I was appointed by President Trump to oversee the implementation of the National Biodefense Strategy,

- A ""national strategy"".

- the ""national strategy"" was designed to be a ""highly collaborative effort"".  Engaging the public and ALL key stakeholders is vital to successful work

 -A cardinal rule.. accountability, which means picking a leader.  That's a leadership lesson well understood by President Trump, who has a particular interest not just in our national security but in preparedness for biodefense in particular.

Less than one year later after Mr. Azar speech,  a Pandemic was looming

"" Mr. Azar directly warned Mr. Trump of the possibility of a pandemic during a call on Jan. 30, the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks       Trump thought he was alarmist""
                                            NYT reported 4/11/2020

Today, 3 months later WE are the ones alarmed by the President's instability and VP Pence is clearly not a substitute for Azar expertise."
2020-04-18 23:04:02,"The U.S.A. needs incredibly solid leadership to get through this.  Instead, we have a sociopath who revels in antagonizing, dividing, inflaming, lying, manipulating, deflecting, scapegoating, discounting science, and making deliberately bad decisions.  This ""great business leader"" is incapable of diplomacy, self-restraint, cooperation, or deferring to medical experts because he knows everything.  And barring the efforts of a crazed gunman, we're stuck with this now-LETHAL monstrosity for another 8 months.  And no, I'm not a democrat, so don't think this is mere partisanship."

Please keep on washing your hands.  Seriously."
2020-04-19 00:17:19,"Great article, one that everyone should read.

I'm wondering why there is no mention of Australia or New Zealand though? In NZ the strategy has been elimination from the start. And it looks like they just might do it. And that changes everything for them.

Here in Australia suppression efforts have been so successful we are hearing leaders discuss the possibility of elimination. We've had some advantages, like an earlier start, easier borders to control, a smaller population, and strong effective leadership at both the federal and state levels that are working with each other. And it isn't a sure thing by any means but if we can accomplish it our lives will look much different than the ones you describe."

2020-04-18 22:24:29,"Just to be clear. ""President Trump"" is a mentally and emotionally ill human being who happens to be a narcissist on top of all his other problems. Maybe the times should start writing stories about this disease, interviewing psychologists and psychologists so the American people can really understand what's going on with this guy."
2020-04-19 00:19:18,"Until now in this particular war the enemy has dealt us severe blows. We didn’t expect this war, we were not adequately prepared for this war, and we reacted too slowly and too late to the enemy’s advance. In this particular war our returning to work, school, etc. is akin to mounting our counter attack against that enemy. We know the enemy will be waiting for us, hiding. For our counter attack to be successful we need a leading general of the stature of an Eisenhower or similar. We don have one at this time. That is our real problem."
2020-04-19 00:20:02,"Although I appreciate the hard work put into this article -not to mention the burdens of the people collecting and calculating the data referred to- I am presently overwhelmed by the numbers and statistics thrust on us in the daily news reports. I do not mean to say that the figures are wrong, are politically motivated or are not reported with sincerity and good intentions. Rather, there is simply too much to contemplate. It's not necessarily that I cannot work my head around the sums and percentages. It's just that I know I will see whole new sets of such the next day."
2020-04-19 00:24:41,"Thank you for this stark and candid analysis of our collective lives living through this global pandemic. What we must accept is that this virus has no borders, no divides, does not see us in any political or geographical way, we are all susceptible, we are all equally vulnerable.

We have been asked to do one thing, to stay at home and protect lives, to stop the spread of COVID-19, this is our challenge and out duty and we must stand strong...together."
2020-04-18 20:12:53,I now fully understand why Senator Burr dumped his stock portfolio. Lucky him.
2020-04-19 00:32:59,"Everyday I say to myself “I don’t know what I don’t know.” And experts, despite all their modeling, forecasting, projections do not take into account the human aspect of COVID-19. The damage that is being done to our collective psyche is real and serious and maybe not necessary. Articles like this are frightening and defeating and creates am overwhelming helplessness. Hope is essential to our very existence, and maybe we need to reassess the imminent threat of COVID-19. After 4 weeks of social distancing and lockdowns we are now facing another calamity of emotional, physical and mental distress. Should the risk of infection be secondary to the threat of depression and hopelessness. Do we need to take down barriers in order to alleviate the suffering that isolation has caused? What really is the greater risk to humanity, the virus or the mental anguish that has stricken us as a nation?"
2020-04-19 00:34:02,"Honestly, good luck to us all. Deaths from covid-19 given the lack of social distancing by some will surely occur in greater numbers. But we’ll be re-defining deaths of despair soon though too, due to increased poverty and the mental health suffering brought on by the pandemic, both in terms of its economic consequences AND the change in our social lives. I truly hope those with expertise take the latter into consideration as well. 

That aside. I think there will be a recognizable reordering of global power post-pandemic - we were already heading there. But maybe once the USA needn’t market itself as being No.1 anymore, we can move onto to the business of actually taking care of EVERYONE living in this country and making sure their most basic needs are met: universal healthcare, decent education and housing, livable incomes, etc. Maybe. But something tells me to not be surprised if many Americans return to their individualism and lack of accountability to those with the least, while continuing an economic system that favors those with the most."
2020-04-19 00:34:42,"With no cure or vaccine, we have to get and keep the disease reproduction rate below one. Locking down society and isolating everybody accomplish this, but with major impact on the economy (which may ultimately be a bigger problem than the epidemic itself). Relaxing the restrictions will increase the reproduction number and likely lead to a ""second"" wave -- unless we lower it other ways.

Testing can be used for this. By repeatedly testing everyone, we can limit the amount of time a sick person can infect others. Initially, testing every week seems appropriate based on the period of infectiousness. Yes, the cost will be high, but far less that the current cost of mitigating the economic disaster.

Testing should be augmented by tracking to identify other possible infections. Both electronic and human tracking should be used.

Testing will also tell us which areas are safe, and can opened up, and which areas require other restrictions.

It's too bad we're still neglecting this!"

So the future  is going to look like the South because it is yet to impact there. And we all know how compassionate the big Landlord is to blacks; he has proved his sympathy with the Central Park Five. He even talks about ""my African American"", completely oblivious to the historical implications of the possessive pronoun.

Perhaps this Coronavirus will stir us from our centuries long slumber, or perhaps, as William Butler Yeats suggested in his poem, our destiny may be slouching toward Bethlehem, to be born -

""When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   

A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   

Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   

Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   

The darkness drops again; but now I know   

That twenty centuries of stony sleep

Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   

And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   

Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?""

Those of us who are able to survive without engaging in those activities, realize how dangerous they may turn out to be if we should engage in them, have even modest underlying health conditions, and have the resources to shelter indefinitely, understand that we will be at home until a proven vaccine has been administered and many weeks have passed since receiving that vaccine. 

At this point in time, using the traditional time estimates for the production of a proven vaccine, this means sheltering-in-place until at least the spring of 2021. We're planning for the fall of 2021 and feel extremely fortunate to be in the financial position to do so.

We're not living in the woods with hundreds of pounds of rice and beans, etc. We're in an urban area and will unavoidably have interactions with others. We will do everything we've learned to do in recent weeks to minimize the risks from those interactions. Frankly, we don't have a lot of hope that doing that will be completely successful in terms of avoiding the current mutation of the virus, but that's the situation we're in."

Trump is acutely aware of his appearance now. More variety of colorful ties lately. Calculated to script new episodes. 

Trump cross-media Fox TV+ productions w/staging, makeup, scripting, editing, adding soundtracks & styling is Trump's priority. Election Ads.

He needs more edited video clips and the 
video/radio/twitter/Utube host job that he really wants.

In today's blast, Trump seems profoundly surprised again that national health care planning ahead could be so surprisingly difficult. Hillary & Obama championed HC so kill it & blame. ""Lock them up""?  

Healthcare is too difficult. Big surprise TV guy.

He has done nothing about testing ... the single most crucially essential thing for enabling the opening up of the economy which is under lock-down solely because of his deliberate intransigence.  Now he’s abandoning it all together|. The nation was left totally vulnerable and in a place of ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" as trump deliberately over the last three years dismantled all the important measures Obama had taken to protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and guard against other possible infection situations in the future. 

trump effectively owns both the mounting death toll, and the catastrophic economic collapse, no question. Not because he was too late and inept (which he is), but because he deliberately ignored warnings and dithered.

- That it has not been possible to develop either a vaccine or a monoclonal antibody against coronaviruses in the last 17 years.
- It has never been possible to develop a vaccination against any coronavirus.

- So, we do not know how long we will have to deal with this virus. Two reports, which should not have been available to the public (U.S.- Government COVID Response Plan and a report of Imperial College London) come independently of each other to a ""lock-down"" phase of up to 18 months.

- We do not know whether this virus will concern us epidemically/pandemically or perhaps even endemically.

- We still do not have a recognized and broadly applicable, defined therapy; we have never been able to present such a therapy for influenza either. ""

While California and New York want to implement containment, only the federal government has the funding and power to organize production of adequate test kits and protective equipment, and Trump refuses. 
The United States is the only developed country with organizations demanding the economy re-open with no viral containment—Trump, Fox News, the Koch brothers’ ALEC, rightwing extremist Ammon Bundy.

2020-04-19 00:58:47,I have been reading about the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. It seems to have ended as the virus mutated and became less lethal. No vaccine was developed for it. Could that happen with the current novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19? Could it mutate to become less lethal?
2020-04-19 00:59:59,"""In China, anyone testing positive, no matter how mild their symptoms, was required to immediately enter an infirmary-style hospital — often set up in a gymnasium or community center outfitted with oxygen tanks and CT scanners.

There, they recuperated under the eyes of nurses. That reduced the risk to families, and being with other victims relieved some patients’ fears. Nurses even led dance and exercise classes to raise spirits, and help victims clear their lungs and keep their muscle tone.""

It doesn't make much sense to quarantine Wyoming as long as somebody doesn't take a subway train to LaGuardia, change planes at O'Hare and head to the high plains of Wyoming. 

We need to corner this rat but we can't do that if Dollar Don keeps giving it more frequent flier miles. 

Take a look at the county map outbreak for Oregon where I live. As long as only local traffic is allowed off interstate 5 (Seattle to San Diego) apart from filling gas, and commercial trucking traffic highly regulated, there's no reason to shut down the local counties with very few cases of the virus on either side of interstate 5 which can be controlled by the county sherrifs office under the supervision of health authorities.

Those living in sparsely populated counties should not be free of rules. Covind19 loves a church choir and screaming fans in the bleachers at the local high school basketball game, aircraft carriers and cruise ships. 

I'd like a good public service ad explaining what a ""hub"" is. Don't let a drunk stand outside the door of the 7/11 panhandling.

2020-04-19 01:48:46,"I expect the measures required to eradicate the virus entirely will prove to be unrealistic in the US (and UK) where there is an aversion to overbearing government interventions. However the effects of the virus will force us all into the social distancing measures that allow the health centres to function. What matters is the transmission rate R0 which needs to be at or below 1 to prevent exponential case growth. It looks to me as though in the US R0 is still close 1 as infection rates are not obviously declining; that means there will be only limited scope for any relaxation of current social distancing measures. These will need to be held in place until either 60% of the population has had the infection or a vaccine is widely distributed. My guess is that the US will go through several cycles of lockdown and release until 60% of the population has been infected over the next 2 years or so. However with anti-viral treatments the disease may be less severe in the latter cycles and the current panic assuaged. Which ever way you look at it this is not a brief episode it's at least a 2 year battle with enormous social and economic harm.

2020-04-19 01:54:12,"The Press has focused on the challenge of distance learning until in-person classes resume. However, a looming question for educators is the future condition of employment for older faculty. 

Will schools require professors with the common health ailments of middle age (asthma, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, etc) to risk a fatal respiratory infection by mandating a return to the classroom?

Consider that teachers expose themselves to multiple daily contacts with classrooms of 35-plus students, congested hallways, department meetings, and shared classroom equipment? This is a recipe for putting one's health on the line. 

At the same time, this is what many ""essential workers"" like bus drivers, food service workers, nurses and hospital workers experience on a daily basis. Should teachers be any different?

No doubt some older teachers with health issue will face a career-altering decision in the fall. Administrators, students, parents will expect a quality in-person classroom experience -- especially at pricey colleges.

I can imagine a similar human-like species dominated Mars five hundred million ago when it may have been a lush planet with all the ecological diversity of Earth. Then within just three centuries these superior Martians were wiped out by their own folly, dragging every living organism down with them.

2020-04-18 23:22:54,"Methinks your enthusiasm for the demise of western civilization is a bit premature.....

Now. This is a virus and they are ubiquitous. This one has probably been around the world a dozen times by now and has already mutated into several different strains. We have probably all been exposed already. A large portion of the population is immune and will never get tested. Another has had it and had no or mild symptoms and will never get tested. A third portion (maybe 20% of the total population) is symptomatic and gets tested. These are the ""cases"" reported. A tiny portion of the third group will have weak immune symptoms and would die of any infection because they cannot fight it. These are the ""deaths"" reported. But they are counting all those who die with the virus not just those who die of it. So statistically speaking we won't know how many have it until we test everyone in a given population so our ""n"" number is to small to be statistically significant.

So why are millions of people not succumbing to this scourge...?...because there is no need in the physical world for an infectious virus to be that deadly. All it wants to do is reproduce. And if it kills you it will end its own bloodline."

2020-04-19 02:05:27,"How can we make a rational decision about reopening society without massive testing? One of two things is happening. Either,

1) the mortality rate is much lower than we think because lots of people who have not been tested actually have the disease but have very mild symptoms - this bolsters the case for reopening society now.

OR

2) the mortality rate is much higher than we think because lots of people are dying without being tested and their death certificate reads ""pneumonia"" or ""natural causes"" for the very elder. This bolsters the case for society remaining shut down.

2020-04-19 02:09:02,"Regardless of what decisions the federal, state and local governments make, it will be the people themselves who will determine just how quickly our society can ""reopen"".

On the other hand, some communities seem outraged by restrictions that still require them to obey social distancing.  If a few of them can be kept isolated from others, they should be permitted those freedoms for which they seem to crave.  Hopefully, they will be lucky.  In the far likelier scenario in which the disease breaks out among them, they will have learned a lesson the hard way and in so doing, will have provided a much needed example to others.  

As for a vaccine, a two year time horizon is merely a hope.  It remains to be seen whether any vaccine at all can be developed in the foreseeable future.   People should remember that we don't have a truly effective vaccine for the flu and there is still none for HIV or Ebola.

Steven Colbert hit the nail on the head years ago when he coined the phrase"" truthiness."" 

Truth, facts, science, and reality...became optional. 

I refer to this as our ""illusion default."" When feelings, facts, experiences, or information challenge - or threaten - our emotional comfort zone, we create an illusion to divert us from the undesirable truth or reality.

Our ""Illusion default"" is a tool we develop in childhood; we learn to ""make something up"" when reality challenges or frightens us; that way we can ""believe"" - believe being the key word - we are safe.  

This default into illusion is a necessary and valuable tool in childhood. As adults however, we must shed it and do the ""work"" to grow and mature emotionally so we are able - and willing - to discern, truth, facts and reality...even when it is challenging or threatening. 

Media, marketing, advertising, and technology made it even easier for us to divert our attention and slip into illusion rather than deal with reality; most folks are simply trying to keep up with their smart phones every day.

I also don't get the mentioned daughter demanding Corona-Parties for younger people ""to keep the economy running"". Ignoring the fact, that it would risk the life of other people, there is no need for getting infected on purpose - young people could just continue their Pre-Corona-Lifestyle until they get hit by Covid-19.

I appreciate the opportunity to share a few thoughts from my personal experience that might trigger the thinking of this expert community. One of my associates was the late Cyril Ponnamperuma, a University of Md professor. and amine scientist,  who is most noted for his achievement in creating life from non-living chemicals and is the author of The Origins of Life. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ponnamperuma"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ponnamperuma</a> 

During the HIV scare, Cyril and I often discussed pathways of pathogen research and during the HIV epidemic, he was interested in seeking people where there was a high probability of HIV infection, such as the sex workers in India, who did not develop HIV/AIDS and use them to examine the uniqueness of their immune system and other physiological factors.  

I thought it was a very good idea because I personally had been through the polio period and my younger brother caught polio and I did not. He was 3 years younger than me (b. 1937) and we had the same exposure, same parents, same diet, etc. He was removed from our home and to a special treatment center with iron lungs, etc. Finally, he returned home and we are both alive."

2020-04-19 00:50:26,"A Wikipedia entry on life during the Blitz:

Although the intensity of the bombing was not as great as pre-war expectations so an equal comparison is impossible, no psychiatric crisis occurred because of the Blitz even during the period of greatest bombing of September 1940. An American witness wrote ""These people are staunch to the bone and won't quit ... the British are stronger and in a better position than they were at its beginning"". People referred to raids as if they were weather, stating that a day was ""very blitzy"".[68]

Office workers make their way to work through debris after a heavy air raid. According to Anna Freud and Edward Glover, London civilians surprisingly did not suffer from widespread shell shock, unlike the soldiers in the Dunkirk evacuation.[69] The psychoanalysts were correct, and the special network of psychiatric clinics opened to receive mental casualties of the attacks closed due to lack of need. Although the stress of the war resulted in many anxiety attacks, eating disorders, fatigue, weeping, miscarriages, and other physical and mental ailments, society did not collapse. The number of suicides and drunkenness declined, and London recorded only about two cases of ""bomb neurosis"" per week in the first three months of bombing. Many civilians found that the best way to retain mental stability was to be with family, and after the first few weeks of bombing, avoidance of the evacuation programmes grew.[70][71][72]"

Trump will blame the states..He will never take responsibility for the not addressing the pandemic earlier.  WHO notified the US back in December of 2019..yet the Trump lackey's did nothing..and now with the deaths of so many now and in the future..Trump continues to lie to the American people.

2020-04-18 20:49:41,"For the most part, states, churches, and organizations which tend to be most supportive of the so-called ""right-to-life"" movement are, nonetheless, the same ones which oppose actually saving lives by locking down. 

Churches, organizations, and Trump-encouraged groups that are failing to obey the law are usually the same churches and groups that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law. 

Why aren't the leaders of the churches and groups which hold in-person services and demonstrations in defiance of government rulings, services and demonstrations which, when they disperse, threaten the lives of many innocent Americans, treated as the terrorists they are? Consider the response when terrorists killed 3,000 on 9/11.

Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriotic, wartime leader federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when Governor Orval Faubus used the state's National Guard to prevent integration.

Now we have a President who is neither a leader nor has served his country. So now we need governors to use the National Guard to protect innocent Americans by enforcing the law.

Are these illegal and dangerous pro-Trump demonstrations simply the will of dissatisfied Americans rather than Republican manipulated campaign rallies? Note there are none in Ohio, the one state with a Republican governor who takes COVID-19 seriously.

We, the people, have been subjected to enough of this. Nobody but nobody tells him that what he is doing is not right though they would not let their own children speak the way he does about everyone. Think about this. I hope we have our Network moment soon."
2020-04-19 01:31:27,"What I can’t fathom is the idea that Trump thinks he will be more popular and likely to win the election if the US is “liberated” and hundreds of thousands or even millions of people end up severely ill or dying.  Also, I can’t see the economy bouncing back if the virus is rampant and people know that by going out they’re likely to get sick and maybe die.  I think the call for protests is really just a stunt. Trump knows that the Governors won’t actually listen to the protesters and risk lives and overwhelming hospitals.  But, he gets to make himself look like the “cool” parent without risking any consequences, while the responsible parent who actually loves the child says “no” looks like the bad guy.  Also, from the reports I’ve seen the protestors don’t have large numbers and are really from the lunatic fringe. It would be poetic justice if they got the virus they think is a hoax."

Even put locks on your gates to keep people two metres or more away from you so you can't catch the virus.
It's going into summer in USA so if I lived there I wouldn't be hanging around the city where the virus spreads like wildfire because of clusters. I'd be heading for the hills or lakes and living in isolation until a vaccine is found because the USA government hasn't a clue.
Don't forget the USA people in government live in sprawling homes where they don't have to be amongst clusters.
The only promising test for the virus is being done by Oxford University and they say they're 80% sure their experimental vaccine will work and they should know in September.  Nothing is sure and people are just hopeful a vaccine is found; I also read that viruses can mutate and they found a mutated strain in India and that means any vaccine is useless cause the virus is one step ahead of the researchers.
I got the flu vaccine for the first time; and an pneumonia vaccine. Someone needs to ask Trump how come no Senators or Billionaires or people in high Office haven't caught the virus."

It takes time to manifest itself, This is a fact of life now. If you want to be safe, stay away from people.
If you have risk factors,be extremely careful.
Those places that plan to restart the economy will suffer if they do not test to see what is around first. Tests are hard to get. The virus is able to hide in the early stages. All this says we must be cautious or we will set off another round of virus.

Frankly, that is unknown.  What is known is that Trump and the Republican (aka New Know-Nothing) Party must be removed and kept from power for the foreseeable future.  This is an imperative.  Our very survival as a country depends on it."

Fortunately able to work from home, which I still do part-time for a generous hourly rate. Debt free, with savings that should last despite the market volatility we will experience for years.

I likely can avoid the contagion, although there are no guarantees. But I grieve for the millions who must work to live from week to week; for the tens of thousands of small businesses (and I mean small, not those with a ‘mere’ 50 to 100 employees); for the kids who will miss school. And for the tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans who will become gravely ill, and the caregivers who will work under wartime conditions trying to save lives.

It’s way past time to stop our bombastic, know-nothing President from turning this fiasco into a cheap entertainment, another Trump reality tv show and rally for his right-wing cult. Let the grownups run the show from here on out. The grownups will tell you we’re in uncharted territory; we’re playing frantic catch-up because of White House denial and inaction during the crucial weeks and months when the spread of the virus could and should have been traced and abated. 

But it’s too late to cry over spilt milk. The models will not tell us what will happen much more than a week or two from now. The data will change, and thus change the model output, esp. if we end containment measures too soon."
2020-04-19 03:09:21,"It's a pity that Trump is talking about reopening the economy when he has not actually ""closed"" it in the first place. Although we're not testing enough, the national lockdown (for a month today) in Argentina is yielding very positive results. Brazil, which has not implemented a lockdown as strict as ours, already has 20 times more dead people than us (and they had their first positive case at the same time as we did). Unless a really tight lockdown is applied in the US, the number of dead people won't go down."

What use is it if I test positive and end up with a ventilator and die. How can we open up in an environment where the virus is still around everywhere and people can get infected on the subway, in the train, at work, etc. As long as the virus is around, people will get infected, and infect in turn.
Perhaps universities must remain closed in NYC and go fully online - I cannot image thousands of students in dorms (like nursing homes & prisons) spreading it among themselves and staff, faculty and other workers. This is harakiri."
2020-04-19 03:17:05,"From everything I can tell, the US will remain locked down until there are no more Covid-19 cases.  Based upon current data this will not occur until mid to late 2021 according to Dr Fauci.  What this means is that the US business will need to be financially nationalized in order to survive.  What this also means is that, in the absence of mail-in voting or a similar alternative, US elections will be suspended and President Trump will remain president until there are no more Covid-19 cases.  Long story short, given the gravitas of the pandemic, President Trump is unilaterally in charge of everything with the pandemic increasingly causing Congress to revert to a ceremonial role until there are no new Covid-19 cases."

Although, clearly, we need to inform the public, so thanks for the piece. But I can't help but think the time we're spending trying to explain the logistics of a pandemic might be better spent preparing for the horrible possibility that Trump might use this as an excuse to halt the upcoming election. His NPD won't allow him to accept defeat in any rational way & when backed into a corner, he will decompensate & channel his fear & anger & crippling insecurity into even more dangerous actions.  I know, someone in my family has NPD. The best way to solve this problem would be to declare him unfit. Encouraging the states to disobey their own governors, right after he backtracked about his statement that his authority is ""total"" is a sign of this decompensation. And it is going to get worse. We are going to have a resurgence of the virus & if it happens near November, he will have his excuse.  It never gets better because he can't accept who he really is and he would rather sacrifice the lives of others than admit defeat or errors in any way. 
I really appreciate the enormous amount of research that went into this article, but it is all for naught if we don't have a leader who is sane enough to implement any of these strategies. His illness is really going to be the determining factor in how many of us die. Not the sage advice of experts."

Today, I cycled through my town and saw cars with license plates from Quebec, Vermont, and New Hampshire.  Were the Vermont and Quebec drivers essential workers at our local hospital?  Perhaps, but if not, why are they even in NY State?

A local fraternity house had laughing coeds on the front porch.  So much for keeping apart.

Aside from the critical need for widespread testing and equipping our first responders, unless people get serious and practice social distancing, how are we ever going to get back to any kind of normalcy?"
2020-04-19 03:37:20,"Political figures need to be more blunt about the tradeoffs in the strategy outlined in Pueyo's ""Hammer and the Dance"" article. Make it clear that specific containment measures are exchangeable, and that the menu of relaxing restrictions is flexible, but limited. As a fictive example, opening up sporting events would be costly in terms of infectivity, but might be equivalently exchanged for opening up schools and restaurants instead. Given that choice, what madness could possibly possess people to be so selfish that they can't even take the tiny step of putting on a mask?"
2020-04-19 03:37:36,"In the Netherlands the RIVM (comparable to the CDC) has reported that based on blood tests, about 3pct of the population has been infected. This equals to about 500.000 people. In the same time we know that 3700 people died in hospitals and elderly homes that were diagnosed. From our statistics bureau we also know that the actual mortality rate over the last three months show an additional increase of about 1000 people per week from undiagnosed causes. It you do the math, then over the last 6 weeks roughly 7500 people have perished while 500000 have been infected. This gives a mortality rate of approx. 1.5 pct. Since the mayhem started end of february."
2020-04-19 03:38:01,"This article feels like it gets a lot of assumption right. However, the glaring unacknowledged variable in the room is what the Federal Government will do. It looks like the best assumption is that they will make the States go it alone.

If that happens, as is already the case, money will become an immense variable and drag on both protection and recovery as States try to, or not, figure out how to pay for it all, even if they can at all.

Perhaps the most unfortunate part, which will also impact the success or failure in both health and employment terms is the fact that the Federal government does not want any truth or transparency except for numbers that are favorable to them. They will do their utmost to obfuscate the death toll, the amount and type of testing done, and employment figures. This will undoubtedly make it far more difficult for the entities trying to resolve these problems to do so. And at the end of the stick, the general public will be left holding the proverbial bag for their own economic circumstances and health bills. By all accounts the virus leaves permanent damage and health problems for those that survive, and this has not been factored in yet as the scope cannot be determined.

I fear there is a heartbreaking amount of death, economic ruin and lifelong health issues to come, over many years, which will be compounded by our Federal governments responses."
2020-04-19 03:42:53,"I find it curious how the discussion in the US is how to return to normality ASAP, while the discussion in Europe is on how to improve the previous situation and build upon a greener economy.
It may be a coincidence that densely contaminated regions tend to be more affected by the virus, but we really should study the correlation between contamination and coronavirus propagation. It is clear that contamination and smoking weaken the resistance of the lungs against infection but it also seems likely that fine dusts from contamination may serve as transport for the virus.
This would actually put together two of Trumps most denied subjects: climate change and health, forcing us to re-evaluate a much greener future."

2020-04-18 19:16:33,"Given this information, our economy will recover in fits and starts as hot spots emerge an then disappear. This inconsistent recovery will require the government to find a sustained way to maintain local municipalities and state government. Already, many governments are seeing incredible loss of revenues, when they will obviously be needed to do much more for their citizens. We need an economic plan, to sustain our citizens and our infrastructure over the next two years. We cannot let more Americans fall into poverty and we need our civic institutions to keep functioning. I hope Congress will adopt fiscal strategies such as a progressive tax system, which was employed after WWII, to fund infrastructure projects, free college, grants to local governments and to establish Medicare for All. We will need the communal, tax-based infrastructure of government and the public sphere more than ever in the upcoming 18 months."
2020-04-18 18:57:21,"I work for a local public entity in the San Francisco Bay Area. I've seen very little discussion about how the economic shutdown will eventually destroy the ability of the government to function and maintain the public services that are essential to keeping society functioning, especially right now. Tax revenue is what pays the salaries of the firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and health care workers at public hospitals. It's what's paying for all the efforts to expand healthcare capacity, build tent hospitals, and rent motel rooms for homeless people. Without economic activity there are no taxes. Without taxes, public employees will be laid off and government services will collapse. Local governments will be the first to go under, many within a year. State government can't last forever either. Why isn't the media talking about this?"
2020-04-18 21:45:56,"I appreciate the complexity of this piece, despite its brevity. 

All along I have worried less about the physical aspects of the virus, as horrifying as they are, and more about our fragile social fabric. 

-a widening of inequality as those with resources ride things out while those without  $400 saved for an emergency watch their tenuous situation lurch over the edge

-the ways we have become interdependent and how unprepared we are to be isolated and on our own (super interesting article on the downsides of the nuclear family in this kind of disaster)

-the effects of shutting down large swaths of economic activity which ripple through our world (which is not a reason to rush to resume normal activity! - just a reality)

-And a national government that is manifestly unable to generate the technology we need (testing), the production we need (components of the tests), or the sense of selflessness solidarity and resolve that would pull us through this stronger and wiser. 

I want to be optimistic for the future, as some of your experts are, but our social capital — shared norms, networks and trust — has been weakened by our politics...just when need it most. 

Most grateful to the thoughtful governors and public health officials. They instill confidence if not hope."

Our efforts to help stamp this out are being flagrantly undermined by ignorant, misinformed fellow citizens who think the rules don't apply to them. In part because of this, I fear we're all going to be shut in until a vaccine arrives."

Even if Trump's base returns to life as in December, the economy will only bump a little.  The smart folks (the ones who don't like dying) are not going out until there are effective drugs or a vaccine on the market.  This isn't going to be anytime soon.  We may have a 50% economy by fall, but it will take a couple of years to return to normal, if then."

Making predictions with an unknown foe is fraught with potential errors.  However, we do know that society recovered from previous scourges relatively intact as long as the death rates were below 50% or so.  The potential loss of institutional knowledge and knowledge in general though may well be an insurmountable problem at death rates below 50%.  Such a loss in a technologically dependent society could prove to be fatal in the long run.

That said, people who avoid crowds, wear n95 masks when around any potential vector and follow basic infection precautions will likely avoid infection.  It is going to be increasingly difficult in high density areas.  These areas are going to see a marked change in life style.  We may well see a move to the rural areas if a secure data skeleton exists there.

2020-04-19 04:02:55,"The strategy that we use to fight Covid needs to look beyond the short term death rates and assess the scenarios for two to five years out. It is unclear to me how important herd immunity is or whether short term death rate is more important than long term death rate, or whether we want to put all of our eggs into the basket of a vaccine. And of course there is the economy that looms over all of this. 

I am not hearing anyone say what our goals are, and then use that to figure out what makes sense for us to do now to achieve those long term goals. Fighting battles without seeing the big picture is not a good way to conduct a war."

2020-04-19 04:47:46,"Wouldn't it be easier to simply make it a very strict law,with very swift punishment, to require the use of proper masks with N95 and P100 filters? This can can achieved by our mass production capabilty,and it is certainly cheaper to produce these masks than to make the ventilators needed in the numbers sufficient to handle patients in the worst case scenarios.
A ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,and certainly there is a reason why soldiers wear helmets and body armor-the same personal responsibilty should be expected of everyone,as well as the obligation to others to prevent making others sick.
Surely an expensive fine,much the same as a speeding ticket would deter many from foolhardy risk taking.

Will Trump dedicate government factories producing PPE to insure military and civilian hospitals will never run out of supplies again?
Testing reagents and swabs? Ventilators and  CPAPs and helmet ventilators?  Science labs working to develop rapid testing, antibody testing, and vaccines?  

I’m for free markets but reality is that hospitals buy thinking months in advance.  Private lab research requires funding.  Government has to produce thinking and results years in advance. And sell to hospitals at cost when the next crisis hits. 

An anti-science, thinking-from-his-gut-President is ill equipped to get us out of this crisis and prevent the next.  Wishful thinking in January, and February got us to the mess of March and April. Badly done."
2020-04-19 05:22:35,"There is another way: eradication of community transmission. Australia and New Zealand are likely to achieve this goal by the end of April, and by mid-May providing the reassurance of two weeks without new cases.

Eradication of community transmission changes everything. Combine this with strong border control and quarantine of new arrivals, and well-resourced public health services to contact trace and isolate contacts of the occasional case that slips through the net. Testing of course, with Covid 19 on every respiratory pathogen panel in every hospital microbiology lab.

Society can safely emerge from hiding.

The next step can be an opening of borders between countries with well documented virus elimination.

2020-04-19 05:27:15,"This article, though big and wide, should be read by everyone. There is a step by step method or process to the U.S. recovering medically and economically. Maybe, just maybe if enough smart governors and medical experts take command, we can do it. Testing and tracking the virus is obviously at the forefront. People testing negative can go back to work and get the economy chugging along, buying time until we find a vaccine or antibody to tackle the virus. Finding either a vaccine or antibody, critical as it is, may not happen soon. And a lack of funding toward this goal will cost lives. The article didn't explain why a pill taken daily, presumably loaded with a vaccine or antibody, would be quicker to produce than shots. Maybe I can locate the answer elsewhere. But, back to my point—the country and the world needs to be educated with this kind of straight forward, totally non-political information. It's understanding what we must do that will save us."
2020-04-19 05:28:47,"“It will be a frightening schism,” Dr. David Nabarro, a World Health Organization special envoy on Covid-19, predicted. “Those with antibodies will be able to travel and work, and the rest will be discriminated against.”

And whose fault is that? Somewhere along the line this effort has evolved from flattening the curve so as to not overwhelm the healthcare system, to preventing any and all infections. Which is it? The message and the strategy is woefully badly articulated. We don't know what the exact game is or how to keep score. If we stuck with the original intent of flattening the curve, we would have plenty of people with immunity."
2020-04-19 05:53:32,"An excellent outline of the truth of what we are experiencing and the next couple of years.     My only concern is an issue that is not mentioned anywhere.  It is possible, or is it,  for a virus (as in some hepatitis B patients) to be ""carried"" in a recovered COVID patient. If carriers exist, they may well infect many others in society unknowingly. Needs examination by the experts though we would hope that the antigen would remain positive even as the antibody appeared so these persons could be identified rapidly. The subsequent quarantine of such a person could be extensive."

Someone told me that his parents are complaining that too many young people are still going to bars. One of the amazing things about South Korea is that they recommend that people don't do things, rather than making it a legal requirement, and they generally do it. Makes life a lot easier. In Australia we have a fairly strict partial lock down, so if I want to exercise on my own that is fine, but if I want to go out to specifically photograph that is not allowed, even though the risk is similar."

Why is there no clinical trial going on in the US to test the 100 year old Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine, regarding protection from Covid-19?  It is used in other countries to boost children's ability to fight off respiratory infections. It has been used safely for 100 years. There are 2 current studies, one in the Netherlands and one in Australia, where it is being given to physicians and other health care workers in a blind study, half get the vaccine and half get a placebo. Let's get US studies going right now. It has already been proven safe long ago. No reason to not try it. It may help our health care workers who are at great risk."

It is brutal, though to some extent necessary for a certain amount of time, and carries its own risks. Again, other countries that recognized these effects and immediately set up hotlines at least, could provide a model. I wonder whether encouraging people to set up temporary households of two anyway, would be helpful. As an American in Germany, I am watching the developments in both countries."
2020-04-19 06:26:30,"I’m reminded of family members who need medication for stable mental health. When they first were put on their medication, they hit a point where they were feeling good decided they didn’t need the medication. They could handle this on their own!

So they went off their meds only to figure out later, when they crashed into chaos again, that they had felt good because they had been taking the medicine, and not because they had control of their brain chemistry. 

Our country has been on medication to stabilize public health. That medicine is social distancing. We may be feeling good right about now, but that’s because we are taking our medicine, not because we have control of this virus. 

Stay on the medicine! Please stay home."
2020-04-19 06:26:31,"History repeats itself.

Over several years, consumer spending/investment dropped, causing steep declines in industrial output and employment as failing companies laid off workers. By 1933, the Great Depression reached its lowest point, 15 million Americans were unemployed. It was when President Hoover (R), appointed a Cabinet consisting largely of wealthy, business-oriented conservatives, established many commissions that were sponsored by private donors rather than by the government, and spent large amounts of money on farmers. It was an era of income inequality dangerous market speculation over valuing stock. There was the tariff war that Hoover started as well.

Hoover alienated the African Americans and to cut immigration to the United States he signed an executive order requiring individuals to have employment before migrating to the United States. With the goal of opening up more jobs for U.S. citizens, Secretary of Labor William N. Doak began a campaign to prosecute illegal immigrants in the United States. Doak’s campaign most strongly affected Mexican Americans.  Deportations were overseen by state and local authorities who acted on the encouragement of Doak. During the 1930s, approximately one million Mexican Americans were forcibly ""repatriated"" to Mexico; approximately sixty percent of those deported were birthright citizens.

Hoover avoided direct federal intervention, feared that allowing individuals on welfare would permanently weaken the country.

Next was war"
2020-04-19 06:55:20,"If you gave me a year, I predict it will be finished closer to 10 months than 2 months. I think it will be infecting people across the globe and not eradicated well into the New Year. I hope that the number of infections and deaths go down, but you could see this thing sticking around. Evolutionarily, the virus that mutates to live the longest usually survives. If there is a similar, cumulative effect for the species, perhaps the species will mutate to live the longest way it can."
2020-04-19 07:18:31,"This is a great article.  What is missing in the national conversation about re-opening the economy is a simple fact of math.  Experts believe that somewhere between 48 and 60 percent of the population may ultimately be infected with this virus.  Unless other factors such as a vaccine (likely at least a year away) or reductions in virus cases because of warmer weather (not really supported by current evidence) reduce the virus’ impact, the same number of cases, and largely the same number of fatalities, will occur regardless of lockdowns and social distancing.  It will just take longer and our hospitals will be less overwhelmed, which will save some lives.

Until there is a vaccine, this is far from over.  Like he has always done, our President is looking for the easy way out of this trap.  Think of all his bankruptcies and how many times he has stiffed creditors or contractors.  Our country is in this trap through his negligence, and there is no easy way out.  The choices are American lives, American livelihood, or really hard work testing, contact tracing, and isolating over the next year or two.  This last option will be anathema to the crazy, assault weapon toting “don’t tread on me” right.  Our President will never do this and so we will will pay for our livelihood and our liberty with American lives.

How is this making America great again?"
2020-04-19 07:27:35,"The 800 pound gorilla in the room that no one wants to talk about is world over population and crowding.  World population is now nearly 8 billion, up from 2 billion in 1930, and 1 billion in 1800, and going up over 80 million people a year, every year for the last few decades.

We should all support birth control efforts more, everywhere, but especially in the poor half of the world where the birth rates are so high. Then the whole world can enjoy the many benefits of a flat and falling population, especially more living space for each human, and more habitat for the natural world.

Hello, has anyone heard of the very large problem of global warming, which is not helped in any way by a growing human population that consumes more and more every year?

Do we all want to live in a very crowded country like China, that requires very strict and authoritarian government to control pandemic diseases and many other societal problems?

World air travel has doubled in 10 years, and is up 10 times since 1975, to 4.3 billion passenger flights per year.  Why are we better off with such risks of human disease transmission with so many people traveling everywhere?  And why are we better off with rising noise and air pollution everywhere with so many planes flying?

Why are we better off with ever more crowded cities, and ever more humans and goods traveling everywhere, raising the risks of both human and natural world disease transmission, everywhere?"
2020-04-19 08:00:03,"South Korea is reporting a 2% reinfection rate, this early in the outbreak. There is a chance that - observed over a longer period of time - this 2% might rise significantly. To me this would mean that either our bodies don't produce viable antibodies or that the immunity from those is very short lived. 

Since any and all vaccines rely on the immune system to work (they just trick it into thinking it's been infected and to produce fitting antibodies) this would be very problematic. Either there can be no vaccine at all or it would have to be re-administered on something like a weekly basis.

This can't be provided by the medical system, it would have to be ""over-the-counter"", which the FDA probably would have kittens about. Also there is the price. Imagine paying $10.000 a year for your weekly Corona vaccination.

I just HOPE I'm wrong. But if I'm right the phrase ""Live as we know it"" doesn't even touch on the changes needed for humanity to survive. We would be a species under constant threat, just one step away from catching a deadly disease, over and over again, until - at some point in time - our bodies simply would give up. 

Life expectancy would plummet like a rock. And any disruption to our lives, like wars, strikes, economic crisis, even just a fire at a chemical plant or distribution center, would have dire consequences. People would die. How does politics deal with that? Force ""essential"" workers to work? Ban unions? Martial law?

Tough times ahead, friends..."

How can I and hope to avoid exposure?  I survived AIDS and this is even harder BUT I will survive it by not taking any risks until treatment comes along, it’s that simple."
2020-04-19 09:10:17,"People living in advanced economies forget that infections diseases had been the leading killer until improvements in social hygiene, and the invention of vaccines and antibiotics.  They remain the leading cause of death in many developing countries.  We remember the black plaque and the 1918 flu epidemics, but in fact, syphilis and tuberculosis have had epidemics lasting centuries and killing more people than any other cause throughout history.  Without antibiotics, these infections would still be the leading cause of death worldwide, as there are still no effective vaccines.  In that light, and without effective anti-viral agents and vaccines against Covid-19, we could indeed be living with it for a long time."
2020-04-19 09:16:32,"We are destroying the lives of hundreds of millions of people over a disease that, if its deaths increased tenfold, would still be less than the number people killed by smoking every year.

That is not to diminish the tragedy of any death. But people are reacting to fear more than to an accurate assessment of risk
7500 people died in the us yesterday. Only a fraction from Covid-19. Is a Covid-19 death somehow worth more attention than a car accident? 40,000 people die in car accidents every year and yet we have not banned driving unil a cure is found.

Hiding in our homes, ceasing to live life, and inducing widespread suffering until someone has found a way to eliminate all risk from life is not sustainable or realistic.

We need to find a way to help those who are most vulnerable to reduce their potential for exposure. But it can't be making most of the population never leave home again for two years. That's crazy. This is not a police state."

2020-04-19 09:25:06,"You are missing one fact that should shorten the quarantine. Specifically, since the virus travels in stealth mode, and often doesn't present symptoms, it's spreading immunity silently too. Guesses range from 25% to 100% times the number of infected people with symptoms.

So, instead of 735,000 Americans infected now, at 25%, we'd have 900,000 true infections.

But we don't know much of anything because Trump has failed to test. Does this confer immunity? We don't know because we don't test. Is it safe to open up? We don't know because we don't test. Why do some people get hit harder? We don't know because we don't test.

And, we could fully open up safely IF we could test, then contract trace anyone exposed to that positive individual and quarantine them as well. The worst inconvenience most people would get would be a two-week stay at home order.

Since we started late, we'd need to be able to do 100 million tests a month but the number would drop as we gained control.

I'd give Trump a week to get adequate testing plans in place, and if he didn't, I'd immediately remove him (and Pence) from office. We really can't wait till November for competence to arrive in the West Wing."

What else could we have expected given the lack of courage, fear or aversion to take very hard decisions early that the people might not have agreed with?

All those responsible knew this would happen if nothing was done to quickly isolate those geographic areas where the virus hit hardest. 

China proved that was the only rational choice, Italy cut off the North, Spain, France, Nordics and most countries impacted closed both external and internal borders, shut down travel without a ""pass"" - the only way to slow spread to places where there were no cases. 

""Isolation"" NOT as targeting but for the opportunity to focus ALL medical and financial, psychiatric and social efforts to support those first centres rather than allow the spread cross the country, making it harder and harder to offer/pay for/find the personnel to deal with a spreading threat nationwide.

Choices were made for what experts and deciders believed were the best reasons they had, around the world.  

Those decisions/choices are only proven right or wrong far too late. 

Finally, it is always harder to be truly effective in a Democracy .. much easier in a centrally controlled State with an all powerful executive. That is not what Americans would easily accept, whatever the threat - but the price for that preference will be very high."

For the first time in living memory, Human race as a whole has been challenged by Nature. Countries with weaker economies have decided to avoid the virus rather than fight with it by enforcing strict lockdowns. Richer countries are not showing signs of fear and are challenging the virus by refusing to curtail their freedom of movement.

2020-04-19 10:02:00,"We have to listen to the experts, but can't rely only on the scientists to guide us forward.

The idea that we can remain closed down for months, that we can segregate the elderly, the infirm, the sick, isn't tenable. Repeated closures, cell phone tracking –- all the proposed solutions are extremely complicated.

Imagine you are 95 and don't even get to decide how you want to live the rest of your life? Perhaps live a bit longer in isolation, perhaps die sooner but with family and friends. Shouldn't that be your choice? 

Our political leaders need to listen to the scientists but they also need to listen to the psychologists, the sociologists, the educators, the economists, the philosophers. How we come out of this stronger may have much less to do with medical advances than we may think. 

We have seen that poorly funded public health systems are disasters waiting to happen. France (where I live) has been reducing medical budgets for years and French emergency room doctors had been on strike for months before the virus arrived. The U.S. private health system is a disaster. If we had a strong public health system in place, with ample beds, protective gear and ventilators, we may have been able to avoid any massive shutdown. 

If we fail to address the outrageous inequality – economic, racial, social -- in our society then the current situation may simply be a prelude to something far more lethal than COVID-19."

In that case, they might have spare vaccine plant capacity."" 

Why not thinking about the same scenario in the US? Why don't we hope that the virus moves quickly through NYC, Miami, or Boston? We would lose millions of citizen but we would achieve herd immunity. If we lift the lockdown, remove social distancing, and reopen the economy, we will certainly achieve this."
2020-04-19 10:05:02,"This comprehensive and provocative article is basically excellent with one glaring exception. It states flatly that ""the incubation period for the virus is 14 days"".  Not true. This too-common error  should have been caught during proof-reading.

The incubation period for the disease called COVID19 ranges from a couple of days to approximately 14 days. This range is based on solid empirical data (observations of many COVID19 patients by epidemiologists).  The ""magic number"" of 14 days is the UPPER LIMIT of the COVID19 incubation period. Based on the data gathered in examining many past cases, the median incubation period for this disease is believed to be around 5.5 days.

In a related and often incorrectly understood process, the period of quarantine used for COVID19 is set at 14 days because healthy people who have had significant virus exposures either will or will not develop symptoms/signs of COVID19 at some point within 14 days of their putative exposures. Exceptions are extremely rare.  The logic that underpins the mechanism of quarantine is obvious. The process automatically accomplishes preemptive isolation of new contagious disease cases at the earliest possible moment."

The third thing will be a changed profile of jobs and employment shifting to flexibility in work place and conditions. Finally, more and more societies demanding more accountability and socually oriented governance agenda, specially a better public health quality and access, from respective governments."

We have useful data involving baseline morbidity and mortality (or would have if we had wide-scale and reliable testing). Now is not the time to be entering an 18-24 month pipeline toward peer-reviewed journal articles establishing ""science"" with an arbitrary level of significance.

Every country needs to have their own means of producing vaccines, testing equipment, and medications. Every country need to be able to produce at least 80-90% of the food needed for their population. It is wrong to allow or expect/allow a few countries to produce life essential things, dead wrong.

Huge improvements must be made in access to medical care and treatment. Huge improvements must be made to the social welfare system in the US. Strong laws must be passed to protect people from discrimination in all aspects of life and consequences of the person and/or company committing the offense are is swift and severe with decades in prison for the people and the removal of all licenses to do business for the company. Work from home must be a legally protected option.

Housing, food, water, medical treatment, education and work must be legally protected and made available to everyone. Pollution must be cleaned up not just buried deeper.

2020-04-19 10:59:04,"There is a better approach. Treat every county in the U.S. exactly the same. Lock them all down for 60 days. During that time, in some safe, secure locations, ramp up testing capacity. Devote whatever resources are necessary to get testing levels up to a point where they can monitor small outbreaks early. Quarantine people who become infected.

In short, reduce the virus to near zero prevalence, nationwide, and then, when the virus starts to re-emerge, isolate it, and reduce it again. Repeat as often as necessary until a vaccine becomes available. 

The key to doing that is treating the entire nation alike, and timing the cure the same everywhere. That, of course, is a non-starter politically, because President Trump will not be able to see any way to get electoral advantage out of it. He wants a,""solution,"" which lets him pick and choose—punish enemies, reward friends, and lavish resources on those who might swing either way. Down that road is protracted agony for the nation."

All of these so-called 'two-dozen experts' didn't see COVID-19 coming and they have no immediate safe and effective plan to control the Mother Nature of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is no 'scourge'.  COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign.  Outside of a living host cell a virus is an inert camouflaged chemical chameleon with a genetic information package poised to hijack cell machinery in order to reproduce itself.

Among the 1200+ types of coronavirus that are naturally endemic to 1200+ species of bats are four types that cause the common cold, SARS-1 and MERS.  The coronaviruses seem to favor an intermediate mammal hosts before jumping to humans like camels, civets and pangolins.

It isn't in the evolutionary fit interests of COVID-19 to kill it's hosts. COVID-19 is driven in infect and spread to as many living host cells as possible for as long as possible. 

Favoring contagion power over lethality is the most effective long term strategy. A long asymptomatic contagion period aka 14 days is brilliant in it's simplicity.

Although the difficulties have been increased by having a president who has more faith in his own hunches than he does in facts, I think this article also reveals that we have some systematic problems.  

The highly fractured privatized health care system and equally fractured system of governments makes it difficult for us to develop a comprehensive and efficient response. In most instances a fractured competitive system leads to more experimentation and innovation, but in a time of emergency it does not work as well.

The high value we place on individuality and freedom (for those who have enough money to be free) could prove to be the greatest barrier to our ability to respond intelligently.   

The only ray of hope I see on the horizon is that when all those sharks teeth finish chewing us up, one city and county at a time, that the devastated populations in rural America will finally realize that we would be better off with a national health care system and a single payer insurance scheme.

The size of the investment to begin the production of this vaccine is huge and J and J got to their leadership position by investing in vaccines they saw as winners.  What is needed now is to vastly expand our testing capability and our political leaders have muffed this challenge badly.

2020-04-19 11:18:57,"I think that the recognition that this doesn't have a clear ""end date"" upon which we then restart our economy and go back to ""normal"" is going to have a deep impact on the psyches of many people. I'd expect a deep depression to set in for many when they realize this is going to be a long-haul process. That there is just no way we can go back to crowded bars, theatres, stores and sports arenas anytime soon. That many of our businesses and jobs have disappeared for good. That we may be facing a long-term unemployment rate of 20% or higher. That college campuses may not be able to operate. 

For those living in places like NYC, much of why they lived there was the access to restaurants, theatres, museums and other crowded venues. Why live in a place like this if you're going to basically stay home and cook? 

I think far too many are counting on a miracle vaccine to arise. It doesn't help that our government leaders have been more or less telling us that we will have one soon and then get back to ""normal"". We desperately need leaders who will tell the truth, even when it's just that they don't know. 

The notion that getting the virus and surviving it will lead to ""immunity"" is a dangerous one as we just don't know if this is the case. I don't think suggesting this is a good idea."
2020-04-19 11:32:19,A very good in depth article. Looking at the economic fallout and damage we can conclude that things will not be the same -- and must not be the same. We need the universal medical coverage of Medicare or All. We need a minimum income tied to the cost of living and we need to enforce responsible journalism to prevent blatant misinformation and incitement that endangers public health and safety. A return of the Fairness Doctrine would be an important step in this.
2020-04-19 11:32:49,"This is an interesting exercise in science fiction, and I say fiction because we really don't know what the coming months and year before the advent of a good treatment or vaccine will look like. We don't know how many people have had subclinical infections, we don't know whether they are immune (perhaps), and therefore we don't know whether most people, because of ""herd immunity"" can resume their normal lives.

We simply don't have enough testing, nor the right kind of testing, nor enough scientific evidence to make these determinations. We don't even have accurate statistics about the mortality rate.

We do know that the whole society cannot shelter in place for  18 months, so we must muddle through as best we can, hoping not to overwhelm our healthcare system. That is the purpose of sheltering in place, not avoiding mortality—some mortality is inevitable as we continue forward. All the rest is speculation."
2020-04-19 11:33:04,"The population of the county I live in is approximately 700,000 people.  To date we have had approximately 2000 confirmed cases.  If we multiply that number by 10 (which is a pretty large number) to account for the people who may have had it, we would have 20,000 people that have had the disease.  That means approximately 680,00 have not had the disease.  (We are really practicing social distancing and sheltering at home.

When we reach the peak, the disease will NOT be over.  Flattening the peak simply means not so many people will be getting it at the same time.  680,000 in our county will still possibly get the disease.  Two percent would die.  

It only takes one person who currently has the disease to infect those not yet infected.  The country has to stay closed to completely eliminate the virus (or until we reach herd immunity.  
I plan to stay sheltered until at least a month after our governor has said we can reopen or until we get a vaccine or a treatment. 
No one has told us how many people in the country have not had the disease.  It is certainly more than three quarters."

I also personally know a conservative who lost his father to the coronavirus. And he uses the fact that the coronavirus killed his father to justify his opinion that this whole thing is “overblown.” I was at a loss of words when he told me that. I literally said nothing to him because I was speechless.

Carefully staggered approach to reopening, widespread testing and surveillance, a treatment that works, adequate resources for health care providers —  an effective vaccine is certainly the way to go. But this does not account for the idiosyncratic human behavior pattern.

A study at the University College London (UCL) on the  amount of effort required to do something influences what we think we see, suggesting we're biased towards perceiving anything challenging to be less appealing.

""Our brain tricks us into believing the low-hanging fruit really is the ripest,"" says Dr Nobuhiro Hagura, who led the UCL team. ""We found that not only does the cost to act influence people's behavior, but it even change what we think we see.""

Prof Patrick  Haggard (UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience). ""Our results suggest these methods could go beyond changing how people behave, and actually change the way the world looks. Most behavior change focuses on promoting a desired behavior, but our results suggest you could also make it less likely that people see the world a certain way, by making a behavior more or less effort intensive. Perhaps the parent who places the jar of biscuits on a high shelf actually makes them look less tasty to the toddler playing on the floor.""

Incompetent regimes rule around the world, dictators or wannabes at the helm: Trump, Putin, Johnson, Erdogan, Bolsonaro, Duterte, Orban, Abe, Suu Kyi, Xi, all hanker for supreme power at the cost of humanity and competence.  It is no coincidence that it these countries, with their misanthropic philosophies intact, bear the greatest risk and potential tragedy of all nations exposed.  Germany, which historically waltzed with fascism before rejecting it for robust democracy, is the first western country to control the virus and begin to reopen, its losses mitigated by testing borne by social conscience. The Nefarious Nine above simply fiddled while their capitals raged.

Speaking of which, Trump’s response is to rally social strife while his people die in droves. Putin doesn’t have a clue how to treat a spiralling pandemic. Johnson, in a wan attempt to stay home, protect the NHS, and save lives, did the opposite and became a state burden instead and remains so in convalescence. Bolsonaro fired his health minister for preaching health, Abe was asleep at the wheel as the virus rebounded, Orban established a new tyranny, Erdogan likewise, Kyi denies a virus exists, and Xi obfuscates his losses.

Our future lies in rational people reasserting gravity into politics. It is brutal to watch democracies give up on themselves and elect obvious charlatans, fools, and fiends."

The opposition, the Green Party and the Right Wing Party AfD certainly don’t like this and want “the freedom of people” back. Quite a change. The Greens are trying to establish all kinds of restrictions to save the climate and the Rights try to enforce their freedom. Typical for the indoctrination “Children are crying because nobody thinks of Greta anymore.”

you take key facts then completely drop the ball following thru. to wit, you mention the Chinese (who true, lie about as much as the orange guy) took everyone testing positive and quarantined them. yet did you ask some absolutely key questions like 1) how many who tested positive even had symptoms? (most Navy sailors confirmed as infected had NO symptoms) so why all the wrist-slitting when majority have NO symptoms? why does everyone refuse to answer key questions like this? 2) of the Chinese who DID exhibit symptoms why do we *refuse* to create a credible profile of those who DO get sick? in your owns pages, multiple times, you've written how 90% of the sick exhibit a small cluster of well defined preconditions; age, lung conditions and a cluster that majority of the time go together, morbid obesity and its cohorts; high blood pressure, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

so anyone like thinking it thru, could conclude referenced groups need to continue quarantine while the majority, who seem pretty impervious to this with few to ANY symptoms, and are therefore are no threat to each other, should go to work, lose the paranoia and see if we can avoid another Bush-type recession."

2020-04-19 01:14:38,"Sorry folks. 

As long as the US cannot mobilize your vast resources, but consistently fall prey to petty partisan propaganda and shortsighted grifting, you are increasingly irrelevant in any kind of global solution.

This virus is dangerous, much more deadly and contagious than the seasonal flue. But it is not the plague. It can be handled by more rational and less greedy societies, and it will be.

When the US cannot even count your real casualties, but ignore or politicize the toll in many states, how can you ever understand the challenge, or map the real threats? 

When your ""leader"" peddles miracle medicine proven dangerous and unworkable, how can you get a grip? When your president consistently alienate potential national or international allies, who will cooperate with the huckster?

The US is currently unique. Your testing stalls at about 150k per day, and you consistently record about +30k new cases. It's a consistent 20% of the daily tests as a national average. If the US could test more, your positives would explode. If you dared to test your dead, your real casualties too. The US is not India or Brazil, you will not tolerate a 5-10% toll of your population. But how to avoid it with an ostrich approach?

Just face it. The US is a large successful experiment in how not to handle a pandemic. How to divide an already deeply divided nation even further. 

If someone tried to design an attack on the fragile and unsustainable US society, this virus is just perfect."

2020-04-19 11:23:53,"Some thoughts on quotes from the article:

1) ""In truth, it is not clear to anyone where this crisis is leading us.""
Well, I can tell you where this is leading us - recession, depression and collapse. This virus is NOT causing the economy to collapse. The mismanagement by our political overlords is causing the economy to collapse.

2) ""Without a vaccine, the virus is expected to circulate for years . . . ."" 
Yes, the virus has shifted from a pandemic to endemic. Of course the WHO and all the geniuses who run developed countries conveniently ignore this.

3) ""The best hope is that fatalities can be held to a minimum."".
And here is the nub of the problem - hope. Hope is a fool's bargain. Hope is thin gruel. The best solution is to a) accept that the coronavirus is endemic, b) stop this lockdown nonsense and c) accept that people will die from the disease.

Suppression has failed. Now it is all about mitigation. In mitigation, it is prudent to focus on number of deaths. In my view, killing off the global economy will kill many more millions than the virus will. Trump has blundered into the same assessment. However, remember this: just because Trump finally gets it does NOT mean it isn't true. Even a blind man knows when the sun is shining."

As a psychiatrist, I reassure my patients that we will get through this time together, as one. I tell them, that maybe the silver lining in this will be the destruction of the system of injustice that is prevalent and the formation of a true democracy where the government cares for the weak, the old, the orphan and the needy. I reassure them that we need to rely on each other more and be there to lend a hand to all who may need it. I tell them to protest by making sure they vote in November.

We need to think less about locking up the entire country, and more about locking up the people who run our nations nursing homes - that's where 70% of the problem is.

Potentials: Fauci and company need to come up with a viable long term plan, and disregard the daily spam show! Perhaps the proposed vaccines, immunities and procedures, will change annually or more frequently, just as our current flu vaccines do, for periodic, scientific updates against this ever changing virus. We have the best, let them do the rest!

Futures: We must end discriminations against all groups/classes and countries, to keep ourselves unbiased and functioning to address this plague, which it is. 

We need to help and maintain all of our governments, and our local, state and federal businesses and economies,  functioning without prejudice or bias, for us to continue to succeed.

Instead of finding ways to control the spread of the virus, he wants to bow down to some foolish protersters, whose main demand is that public places should open so that they can enjoy their life as before. How will we keep the virus at bay, asks some. As long as the beaches and other public hotspots kept opened for the public, there is no way that you can keep the virus at bay. It will also depend on how individual Americans behave during this quarantine time. I presume that Trump is running short of ways and ideas to control the virus spread. I adviise him to put down his ‘dignity’ for sometime, and take views from experts from medical field, from administration and if need he can take help from those nations which are handling the situation far far better than the US. In fact, no dignity is lost, if help is sought from experts and from taking help from other nations. I promise him that by doing so, his dignity is touching greater heights than before."

It's not a vaccine for covid-19 but no harm in getting it to give your system a helping hand because it is the pneumonia part of the virus that drowns your lungs and you die.

Your actions protesting your ""freedoms and rights"" will be compromised all the more, because you WILL be spreading the virus.

How will your businesses reopen or your jobs return, if people are unable to buy your goods and services? If your place of business has closed, due to the ever expanding virus impact, which you helped to spread? 

Your customers and employers could be sick, or afraid, or even deceased. Your family members could become sick and die.

We can have a rational approach to the virus and devise successful ways for all of us to live through this, but we need rational leadership - not in sight until November, unless Congress wants to take another run at impeaching the wretch, put him out of his misery.  Wish they would.  Can’t see Republicans backing him with the country in such dire straits.

We need to continue isolation until testing can be ramped up.  The plans that are in place definitely need tweaking and more money thrown at all citizens.  If the whole country would just shut down for a few months, with only necessary people working and also supplied with adequate protection, we could get a better handle on transmission, but Trump can’t handle that level of leadership, so as many people as possible will just have to stay at home for the next few years.  By staying home, until testing can determine who might be infected or asymptomatic, we save others from getting infected and possibly dying, we save space in hospitals and we save the lives of healthcare workers and others that go to work and make our lives easier."

  The future depends on authentic, honest, inspirational and visionary leadership.  As paraphrased from the book of proverbs,  where there is no vision, the people perish.  

 Whether clearly recognized or not, the United States along with the rest of the world has embarked on a new reality.  This new reality is one in which highly contagious microbes are with us into the foreseeable future, maybe forever.  The next major assault is potentially escalating climate change and depletion of natural resources.  We are currently as unprepared for these as we were for the pandemic.

There will be no return to what was perceived as normal before the pandemic.  Of course, in the shortterm, there will be an attempt to return to business as usual, with disastrous consequences."

That was during a time when our population was about 103-104 million. Those deaths were about 10 times what were during WWII. Let us all hope, over the course of this pandemic, we do not approach those relative numbers.

What is the purpose of bringing this up? Should we be more optimistic than many now seem? We have far more tools than we did in 1918, although maybe far less unity?

1. The country will go back to being shut down and he will not have to deal with how to open the economy. Plus he can put the blame on the governors for opening things too soon.
2. If the pandemic is still on close to the election he will try to delay the election so he can remain in office."

Remember always that the NYT is out to make Trump look bad (and he does deserve some blame) and they will leave out facts which show that he has not done that badly.

Fighting the virus and blaming Trump are NOT the same enterprise.  True, Trump does deserve some blame, but so do Cuomo and de Blasio who slept while California and Washington were active.

I am 71 and more than concern for myself and my wife I worry what will the next 10 years be like for my daughter and all her friends.  This is a nasty virus. Certainly social distancing works to slow the spread, but how long can millions of people stay at home with no work and no income?  Planning on the assumption that some day soon there will be a vaccine, or a drug. or ""herd"" immunity is foolish because we do not even know whether  or not there will be a ""when"".

Our hospitals and medical workers are in dire need of support.  Equally so for the huge number of unemployed.  People will need food, housing, clothing, education.  Tax revenues will be stagnant at best.  If we are to hold our social fabric together for future generations, we must borrow.   But who will be lenders?  Quantitative easing?  

I believe a 3 year plan that will run in many trillions of dollars that provides security to every citizen is mandatory.  The alternative could be an ugly confrontation as people become desperate and afraid.  We are the United States and so let us act like it.  This requires a change in leadership in Congress and the Presidency.  Trump and the Republican Senate have had their chance and their failure must not be allowed to continue.  The crisis is severe and stern, thoughtful action is mandatory"

Isn’t this a huge gaping hole in the (often excessive, neurotic) safety measures being taken? 

From a quality-of-life perspective, what’s going to be done about most humans’ need for professional hair care? Do we all shave our heads or walk around for six months or a year like newly released POWs? We’re getting into the crazy zone. Certainly, by June 1, small businesses, including hair salons, must reopen. Maybe the workers and customers all get their temperatures taken and at least the employees (in the case of hair salons) wear masks and wash their hands between customers.

Houston, Harris county I feel has not tested enough people to get an accurate view of what's going on. Our numbers are really low for a metropolitan area and I'm perplexed as to why we don't get more in house glimpses of what is truly going on in the local hospitals. Here in Houston one would think no one is truly infected because we have few that are dying. True we are not as dense as San Fran or NYC, but our numbers trouble me. 

I know of 2 people who probably had Coronavirus:  both went to Urgent Care; both were sent home, untested for Corona, tested negative for 'regular' flu and were told, ""only call 911 or go to ER if you feel like you are dying"". One figured she had Corona because she started hallucinating. Both were dreadfully ill for about 2 weeks and stayed home. So far, no other family members have gotten sick. 

Folk are getting restless, and not respectful of COVID-19. They are not wearing masks, not practicing social distancing  (in my neighborhood in many homes family members come and go). If people are getting anxious, getting restless, how do we contain The Beast amongst us???? I do believe the low numbers here give people a false sense of security.

All of this is so surreal: our possibly new reality. Who would have ever thought that a microscopic virus would shut down darn near the entire world in a matter of, truly, a few days?"

2020-04-19 10:24:36,"One aspect of this ""crisis"" that nobody is writing about is how isolated most Americans are from death these days. 

I grew up on farm out in rural East Texas where birth and death were as common as sunrise and sunset.   I don't mean just in animals, but, in people too.

First, back when I grew up, the local hospital was tiny, and, very limited in what it could do.   When people got cancer, they died.   When people had a heart attack, they died.   

Most of the time, honestly, people died and nobody had any idea how it happened.   

But, the next day Keri Ann gave birth to her new baby Andrew.    And Susan and Jim had a boy whom they named James.  

And, the cow we named Sally turned up missing.   I personally walked the fields for days but could not find her.   Eventually, when I stopped looking, I found her.   She was not coming back.  But, Sassy gave birth a healthy little calf.

Now, Americans are addicted to knowing every detail of how someone died and how much money they spent trying not to die before it caught up with them.   

Americans seem, honestly, to believe that dying is for people from Mexico, or India, or China.

But, ladies and gentlemen and and reporters from America:  Dying is for all of us.

And, 1200 extra dead bodies a day in a population of 360,000,000 is not exactly going to result in a substantial reduction in the population.   

This from an old man that grew used to death back in the day when it was not a novelty in American life."

I think it will be possible to reopen parts of the nation soon without devastating results, but those places will not be the ones where the coronavirus has not yet struck. The headlines say that the virus is spreading to the suburbs and popping up in rural areas.

Already in these rallies we see folks disregarding distancing guidelines. It is as if this part of the population simply decided that they were done with this, so it is over. 

It is stunning that the POTUS, who one day was laying out a reasonable, if vacuous and shallow, ""plan"" for reopening, could suddenly tweet his support. It is as if he, too, thinks that it can all just be over because he is tired of it all. That only shows that he still does not really understand what is happening. Repeated shut-down moves will be harder and harder to call and enforce. That is truly sad and likely will be tragic for many"

NY is going to take much longer than Ohio, California or Washington state to reopen.  Perhaps some more focus on the reporting of the localized responses can help citizens determine who actually leads their states and cities well and what approaches are working and not working.  That is what we need to know.  

The local health expert in Ohio,  a relative unknown before this crisis focused on one thing,  she just did her job.  It would be great to have a panel of the state and local health officials in your next article.

The irony could not be starker, as communities under lockdown flee to parks and beaches at the first opportunity, putting themselves and others at risk, those less fortunate are forced to make heartbreaking choices, with leisure being a distant thought. An out of work migrant worker in Gurgaon, India, pawned his mobile phone for $30 dollars so that his family could eat before committing suicide.

Governments all over must ignore optics and double down on the difficult choices. There aren't easy ones especially in India and Brazil.

The article mentions that Brazil and India both have large vaccine industries, and, ""If the virus moves rapidly through their crowded populations"" they could develop herd immunity and free up capacity for export.  But Brazil is not particularly crowded. It  has a third fewer people than the US in a space larger than the 48 states.  

Famous images of Brazil are the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, but near 95% of Brazilians don't live in favelas even if they're poor.  Most live in single-family homes on paved streets across sprawling towns and cities. Rio is crowded mainly because it's built like Hong Kong, tucked between mountain and ocean. 

More hopefully for building herd immunity without extreme suffering, both India and Brazil have younger populations than the US or Europe or even China.  Brazilians are also relatively healthy. Besides strong preventive public-health programs, minimal opioid abuse, and three times as many hospital beds per capita as India, Brazilians smoke a third fewer cigarettes on average as Americans, and a fifth of what Italians smoke.

Many hospitals, including in NYC where my daughter is an ER nurse, responded very positively, had adequate equipment and supplies, and were not in a state of chaos, again,that’s all good news!

What will testing do for us? It will create three classes of people, those who tested and came up negative, those who tested and came up positive and those who haven't tested at all. As far as the latter two groups go, they need to stay at home if they haven't reached the point of hospitalization yet. 

As far as the tested go, they may be able to resume some semblance of normalcy if they spread out and wear masks and take other precautions.

(These facts have been reported in the NYT, and confirmed to me by my doctor, an infectious disease specialist at Mt Sinai in NYC.) In fact, in CT, where one needs a referral from a doctor to get a test, the positive rate is only 30%, which implies that either people are not getting COVID-19 or the testing is inaccurate.

Furthermore, the antibody studies in Santa Clara suggest that there are 50-80 times as many people with the antibodies than have tested positive in the county.  This, combined with the paucity and inaccuracy of the testing, implies that the virus has spread through much, much more of the population than public health officials and the media report.

But this is good news, because it appears that the vast majority of people are either asymptomatic or have symptoms so mild as to not require medical attention.  And it could mean that more people than thought are developing an immunity.  However, it also means that large swaths of unsuspecting people are transmitting the virus.  

These are the factors that we need to consider as we map our way forward through this pandemic."

All it can do is complain at this point , what kind of sad leadership is that???  There should be a ground swell of new opportunities to solve the problems presented in this article, all I am reading is about roadblocks,blame and how we can’t do anything to scale all while “waiting” for the government.

The masks cost pennies, so retooling factories to mass produce or getting the government to produce them seems like a no brainer to me, but all of the talk is about vaccines or treatment. 

I have worn masks when sanding wood, working in the garden (allergic to mulch), making art and now when I leave my apartment.  It's not ideal, but it is better than dying.   I know some companies like 3M are trying to double their production of the N 95, but still that is not going to be enough.

This is not without it's sense of satire though, as sitting in India, I read about morons in Florida flocking to reopened beaches, while a desperate migrant worker sells his mobile phone for $30, hands the money over to his starving family, before hanging himself to death. Juxtapose the two, it's more satire than tragedy.

The disease is already accelerating the average daily death toll in many nations, eclipsing the number of daily cancer and cardiac deaths in America. The toll in India is still 'only' 521, almost flippant when you consider that 25 people die in motor accidents every hour and an age old tuberculosis scourge still claims 1400 lives a day. The shrill reaction of the Indian news channels appears disconnected from reality, do they milk the epidemic for all the airtime it's worth or debate the looming starvation that awaits the daily wage labourers, induced by the lockdown? It's an Hobbesonian choice.

A vaccine is still months away, but the needed scale to inoculate billions does not bode well. Will a terrible price be exacted from the poor, let's say sub Saharan Africa to access the drug? Will it only reinforce the economic divide? Time will tell."

Yes, testing needs to ramp up a lot, but it's not going to happen quickly enough, and not be as accurate as it should be. And yes, people who are older, infected, and have symptoms, need to stay home for the most part. And yes, a vaccine would be great, if we ever get one - which is far from certain. Is there one for the common cold? No. But for perhaps 300 million people, we don't need to continue being shut-ins. We can't and won't be able to ""live"" this way.

What if the Federal government (especially since they're anti-testing) had 350 million N95 masks manufactured and distributed to us all? We would ALL have to wear them when outside (at all times, other than when having a restaurant meal), and also continue to be physically distance from each other, but to a lesser extent. If resuming somewhat normal lives is possible, who wouldn't agree to abide by the aforementioned two measures? Many (but not all of us) are doing it now, but we ALL need the top-of-the-line mask. We also need enforcement. Police departments should hire non-officers and give them the authority to issue citations.

But yes, it is valid to worry about the economic cost-benefit of a nationwide shutdown, and no, you are not a right-wing conspiracist, you are not killing my grandma, you are not delusional for wanting to open soon. It is legitimate to wonder if closing schools and universities is actually helpful when one of the virus's main targets is nursing homes. It is legitimate to look to countries with different strategies like Sweden, Iceland, and South Korea.

The media reports that this virus is easily transmittable because ~50% of carriers are young, a-symptomatic spreaders, but in the next breath writes that it is ""deadly"" for young people. The Times picks a ""Top Comment"" that says the Covid death rate is 5%; we know this is not the case given testing in Iceland and Germany.

Kindly note the US is not discussing facts, you do not even employ your wast resources and scientific expertise to seek real knowledge. The US numbers on this pandemic are politically biased, not done in a uniform way, and thus not a solid foundation for viable policies. 

John Hopkins University may make the largest and most reliable mapping of the pandemic on the planet. But it relies on politically biased numbers and lack of testing. Just look at the Florida or Alabama death counts, or the many unregistered deaths outside hospitals, and realize many of your numbers are not from the real world, but made to support various fantasies presented by your joke of a president and his bimbos and errand boys on Fox ""news"".

After three week of government fiat we added 22,000,000 people to the unemployment roll. If the shut-down continues that number will climb to even more astronomical levels and the population made paupers. So, it is easy to see that the country will re-open in the next few days, at most a couple weeks. and the opinion of medical experts are irrelevant.

It is also clear that people will not accept the mental scurvy, loneliness and frustration now imposed on them by government fiat for more than the same short period of time. The restrictions will be lifted or each day will see hundreds of millions of cases of civil disobedience and what, then, will the government do?

Public acceptance of mutilated civil rights may be tolerated a bit longer but not indefinitely. If police raid churches, synagogues and mosques the public response will be immediate and possibly violent.

2020-04-19 10:56:48,Funny. Mass transit was supposed to save us from climate change but now it too dangerous to go on because of COVID. Mother Nature sure is an odd duck.
2020-04-19 11:46:44,"Sorry. I started laughing and couldn’t keep reading after the author mentioned “American ingenuity” ... as if that’s still a thing.

No, for the past couple decades there’s only been American brute force ... and that’s not going to work with a virus."
2020-04-19 02:44:00,"Trump played golf , held political rallies and lied to the American people about Coronavirus .

He even enlisted Hannity, Limbaugh Ingram to spread his lies that the virus was a hoax.  Trump gave the Coronavirus a 70 day head start before he was forced by hospital admissions and bodies being loaded in refrigerated trucks before he came forward.

He should be removed from office and criminally charged.

Trump is a delusional boy child now encouraging 
Loyalist to disregard the law and join his lies.

This will not have a good ending for America and should have a disaster ours ending for Trump and group.

No
Nation in the history world survived when the leaders lied and the citizens died.  America is not an exception."
2020-04-19 02:53:20,"Face masks seem like a good idea in densely populated areas. A month or more after this started and Gov. Coumo FINALLY this week makes them mandatory?

Nearly 20 years after 9/11 and NYC hospitals don't have stockpiles of basic supplies: gloves, gownns and masks? 
Yest last year de Blasio allocated hundreds of millions of tax dollars for ""free"" healthcare for illegal aliens. 

And people still want the government to be in charge of healthcare?  NO THANKS!"
2020-04-19 03:32:38,"It’s not clear what’s going to happen, but yet the NYT expects every decision by the government to be spot on perfect. Oh the irony."
2020-04-19 09:51:06,"What can you say in a comment section, to people who do not want to hear the truth, or to accept facts as they are, or who set up their own idea as to what the truth is, or who follow an ignorant, depraved man who somehow became their leader down a dark treacherous road.
I become enraged as to what these people are doing to my country. The fact that they are fighting for the right to destroy themselves is insane. If they wish to destroy themselves, why don't they all line up on some pier somewhere, and march off into the water like the lemmings they are ? I will not stop them, or hinder their wish, but I do not want to join them.
Doctors, and scientists work to find solutions to the problems or puzzles that confront our lives. The fact that we are too stupid, selfish,or egotistical to utilize their information, and advice shows us why we have failed lately as a nation. 
Why would you expect this nation to accept their cautionary advice on keeping the social distancing , and economic shutdown. Has this nation listened at all to the warnings of climate experts in the last 50 years,or more ? We see what is going on in the world as far as global  warming. We actually elected a clown who proudly announced if elected, that he would rescind laws put into effect meant to reverse the global warming trend, and cheered, and supported him when he did .
This is just another instance of the war on the population of this country waged by a madman, our stable genious our ""Wartime President""."
2020-04-19 02:10:48,"“It’s not clear where the crisis is leading us,” reads the headline to this story.  It’s clear enough to me that it will lead to more of the same in the NYT and CNN; anything republicans do is wrong while everything the democrats do is enlightened and correct. That is tiresome and simply not true."
2020-04-19 05:37:05,"We are all leaving in a different world now. Forget about Trump, the fool is dead meat anyway . It is time to start a new way of life without any guidelines...Best of luck to everyone of you"
2020-04-19 05:57:00,"Its funny millennials hurled insults at ""Evil Boomers"" (Greta et all) because of their lack of empathy for another generation in relation to their habits (Boomers consume, make policy, own fossil fuel stocks) fueling climate change.

But hurl the insult and same accusation back ""You should think of the older generations who have 20-30+ good years left.

They say - ""Nah we're going to have co-vid infection parties!"".

Hypocrites."
2020-04-19 12:19:49,there's no such thing as an expert on the fate of the nation. these folks know just as much as your neighbor bill
2020-04-19 01:12:49,We still are fighting two plagues at once. Covid 19 and Trump and the Republican Party.
2020-04-19 02:32:45,"Now more than ever; what happens in Nov will dictate America's direction for generations to come.

This Country will not survive another 4 more years of this kind of  exploitation at the hands of the ultimate domestic abuser, Trump."
2020-04-19 02:36:54,Will there be a nonfiction book about the COVID-19 pandemic once it's over?
2020-04-19 07:44:29,"In this otherwise worthwhile summary, the writers -- or editors -- just couldn't resist editorializing about President Trump. And, bizarrely, they take such a gentle attitude toward China and the WHO, whose behavior at the very least is worthy of strong criticism.  What motivates them to distort their reporting this way?"
2020-04-19 08:02:13,When looking for guinea pigs for testing vaccines perhaps Trump and his denialist followers could volunteer.
2020-04-19 11:25:27,"I fear that the pandemic will soon hit the rural areas hard. I frequently drive through PA's slice of Appalachia, and the parking lots of all the big box stores are full of pickups. There are even more than normal times, since other diversions like diners are closed.  Another reason is that Trump has cast the response to the pandemic as a test of his supporters' manhood--social distancing is a sissy Democratic thing."
2020-04-19 12:10:41,"The correct course is clear: continue quarantine of the big blue heavily hit metro regions ... including preventing anyone not tested twice to be virus negative and twice antibody positive from leaving for any reason, while letting up slowly in areas that are not afflicted. This means principally New York, Boston, Chicago,
New Orleans, etc.

Places like downstate Illinois will not be in trouble unless new cases come in. We've dropped to less tha one new tested positive case per day ... and we now are seeing less than 6% positive test rate. We are not the big bad New York with a disfunctional leadership and population and crowded subway system. We will have a bus problem next fall when the students come back, but that can be fixed by having them walk ... its not too far! 

The problem as always is politics: if the Democrats would just go away and let the Republicans run things NYC would be much better ... as evidenced, of course, by history: its was Republicans that got crime and subway graffiti down. We can do that sort of stuff for the whole country."
2020-04-19 11:35:28,"Trump needs to stop testing all those entering the white house daily, and live like real folk. It would do him and us a lot of good."
2020-04-19 11:53:05,"Noting that a progressive way forward requires cooperation both domestically and internationally all under a sphere of transparency is truly sobering when compared with Trump's inane recovery plan based on inaction, obfuscation, and his clear effort to use propaganda as a vaccine for CV-19.  

Obviously at this point we cannot get there from here with Trump in office.  Still I fear that as Trump politically implodes, his narcissism will only make things go from bad to worse. 

During the last months of World War II, Hitler's narcissism was such that he ordered the destruction of Germany's infrastructure, the ""Nero Decree"" given that the German people had failed him and so he wanted all of them to go down with him. Ultimately, I wouldn't expect any real progress until Biden assumes the presidency. 

Until then the monetization of our recovery will continue.  For one, Jared Kushner's Project Airbridge is anything but a lend-lease operation. Instead taxpayers are subsidizing shipments of PPE for around $1million per flight. The PPE is then given chiefly to private distribution companies who sell to whomever--even oversea customers. No lending or leasing in that equation. Instead it is a Trumpian Recovery that bypasses policies, procedures, and laws laid down years ago and borne out in lessons learned from decades of responding to disasters. And so many of us stagnate knowing that a deathly virus is readily around all of us---this is not sustainable."
2020-04-19 12:02:18,"Thoughtful, thourough.  Read it to the end to feel opitmistic about bluer skies and increased socioeconomic equality.  Live until then to enjoy it~"
2020-04-19 12:06:13,"People who want to get back to normal now should consider this fact: rural areas were hit harder by the 1918 Spanish flu than urban centers were. The infections just came along later. <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110427092049.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110427092049.htm</a>

As this piece states, the virus is now spreading to suburban areas. If we don't continue to practice serious social distancing until widespread testing is available the spread of the Spanish flu will be our model for today."
2020-04-19 11:42:19,"A little reality to clear the mind:

In the 1918 influenza pandemic, some 75 million people died worldwide out of a total human population of 1.7 billion. That is a death rate of 0.04%.

In the current influenza pandemic, about 150,000 people have died out of a total human population of 8 billion. That is a death rate of 0.000017%.

34,000 US deaths from 675,000 infected people in the USA is a loss of 4.9% of those ill.

150,000 deaths from 2,200,000 infected people worldwide is a loss of 6.7% of those ill.

Bad Trump! Bad Trump! Bad Trump!"
2020-04-19 11:57:57,"Lockdown is not a black and white option. We can do both.

Set up lockdown zones that range from unrestricted to completely safe. Require people who want to join a specific zone register so we can identify them if their death rate begins to spiral out of control. Open our parks back up, for example, so people will have a place to escape their confinement. Cordon off an unrestricted “Z” zone, say a picnic area or shelter, where those who want to risk their lives and the lives of others can congregate and spread their infection only among the willing. It’ll help develop herd immunity and will sacrifice the lives of only those who chose to risk death. At the other end, assign an “A” safe zone, other picnic areas and walking trails, where responsible and considerate people can gather under prudent rules for safe interactions.

Extend this concept. Open Z zone restaurants and bars. Have Z shopping days, work days, school days. Set up zones at work sites and offices. Set up other appropriate zones as required, maybe an “I” zone for probable immunes and an “H” zone for health care workers.

Now society can focus on isolating Z people so that they don’t spread the virus beyond their zone while also allowing A zone people more places to roam, de-stress, work, and play."
2020-04-19 12:12:21,"Imagine… duplicity, treachery and hobgoblins; I don’t know why, but watching the wily antics of political Jesters alias journalist and pundits associated with the mainstream news media reminds of the old film ‘Network’ written by Paddy Chayefsky.

Imagine… you remember that old film don’t you, it was a satirical drama written about a fictional network struggling with poor ratings. Whose corrupt executives were willing to crawl in a gutter with hobgoblins to satisfy their whimsical notions of political and financial gain!   

Imagine… comparing our current day political wunderkinds and their cunning news jesters to a fictional drama like Paddy Chayefsky’s Network. Or thinking the antics of our political zealots and their news jesters might be relevant to ‘One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest’ in their search of macabre duplicity."
2020-04-19 11:49:14,"So, you people are still optimists? 

At the current rate of spread through the population, it will take 4-5 years to reach enough people to start providing the benefits of herd immunity. 

Current unemployment rate is probably north of 25%  and more is to come as the secondary effects, along with a second wave in the wake of over optimistic projections take hold.  

State governments are now walking dead, with no income taxes or sales taxes coming in. 

The Fed is in the hole for 10 trillion, if current trends continue.  

The rural states, the breadbasket of America, are about to hit reality.  

This is going to be way worse.  Though I could be wrong, I don’t see any way out of a death-spiral for this country without a realization of the facts as they are, and not a fantasy about a miracle cure."
2020-04-19 12:13:28,"Another well researched and written report by the Times. Thanks for keeping us properly informed and by telling the truth, showing us all a road back to some type of new normalcy."
2020-04-19 12:16:22,"If only we had a President, the leader of our country, who, instead of blowing smoke at us, would lay out the realities of what our lives will be like in the next two years. As so many of the comments state, we can get through this if we are in this together...which I believe is what most Americans are willing to sign up for. But Trump, everyday, rips at the social fabric of this country that only worsens a very bad situation."
2020-04-19 12:01:51,"Complete absence of nonChinese in China is what next year will look like. China has always had nearly zero foreigners as a percentage of Chinese population, but Chinese are very happy that a perfect society is now within reach. It is the silver lining and on the cloud. The virus was worth it"
2020-04-19 11:58:30,"Until we focus soley on hating the virus, our collective efforts will be greatly reduced while we waste energy hating political leaders. We, the people, can fix this crisis through common sense behaviors and medical/scientific innovations. Political leaders come and go. Corona virus is the enemy, not some senator, governor, mayor or president."
2020-04-19 12:10:14,"As soon as Joe Biden is inaugurated this crisis will end.  Joe  will apply a literal lifetime as a senator, and a career as a vice president, to quickly create and implement health care policies to wipe out this plague and economic policies to make Americans richer than they can ever dream.  Eight years of experience is hard to top.  He still looks sharp, you know something is still happening deep in his mind.  Joe will save us all."
2020-04-19 12:29:41,"There are lots of unknowns presented here, but one thing that is not unknown is that President Trump is NOT the leader we need now."
2020-04-19 12:30:49,"If we are to learn anything from this virus then possibly it is summed up in the ending of your article.  We still have time to improve our  air quality.  In a short time, every city has seen nature blossom with blue skies, clean air, and even dolphins returning to the canals in Venice."
2020-04-19 12:32:45,"The example of Mr. Cuomo in connection to isolation is misleading. Of course his wife caught the virus too. Not because isolating one person from the rest of the household doesn't work, but because by the time his symptoms showed up, he had already passed the virus to his wife."
2020-04-19 12:33:29,"I disagree that ""America First"" is over. In fact that is the end of globalism and the rise of a new nationalism and localism."
2020-04-19 12:36:33,"To fight this crisis, we will have to rethink what the economy is. On some level, the nations of all the world are going to have to all sort of agree that money is just a social construct and token of faith in the that nation’s government, and print enough “money” to beat this thing."
2020-04-19 12:42:30,"The Europeans are smart enough to stay close to China. If China produces the first vaccine, I see America waiting in line behind Europe. That could be a good lesson in humility."
2020-04-19 12:43:39,"The media is very focused on containing the virus and developing a vaccine for it, and that is reasonable--those two factors are critical to our well-being.

But there is another issue that I'd like to see more in the media: treatment of the disease. I suspect advancement in that area will occur at a faster pace than preventing the disease.

""Without a vaccine, the virus is expected to circulate for years, and the death tally will rise over time.""

Yes, without a vaccine the virus will circulate. But if we develop more effective treatment, a rising death tally will not necessarily follow.

Just something to keep in mind."
2020-04-19 12:45:04,"The best article that NY Times has written about Covid-19 in recent days. The fact and truth telling in a widened discussion is admired and appreciated.

China's number of new cases is in single digit and maybe double digits with imported patients, and ours are in 4 digits over one thousand minimum.  China did not allow Wuhan, Nanjing or other cities to reopen until intensive surveillance found zero new cases for 14 straight days, the virus’s incubation period. Compared with China or Italy, the United States is still a playground.

And we dance around the subject of a lockdown with social distancing and wearing masks to entertain our self. We are convinced that that will be enough. Vaccine is around the corner that can help us soon.  But none of those arguments are valid.  

Scientists of Harvard Medical School are constantly in touch with leading Covid-19 scientists in China.  Dr. Bruce Aylward led the WHO investigating team to China and Wuhan in particular.  Their words to combat Covid-19 should be treated carefully and thoughtfully."
2020-04-19 12:45:51,"Back in the day, “American ingenuity” might well have produced advances to ease the burdens, as the article states. But the current administration has cut the legs out from under “American ingenuity” and that’s why we are seeing other nations, rather than our own, rising to the forefront with strategies that will contain and eventually defeat the virus."
2020-04-19 12:47:54,"It’s amazing to see that even a pandemic can’t bring people together.
This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, notwithstanding Trump’s idiosyncrasies.
An Obama administration would have been just as unprepared in terms of scaling testing capacity or producing protective gear. It’s because of structural problem of relying on China for everything.
Sure, we shouldn’t pick a fight with China in the middle of a pandemic since we are at their mercy. But whether we pick a fight or not, we have to realize that this situation was caused by China while our values are not aligned with theirs. We have to do address that issue."
2020-04-19 12:48:42,Thank you Donald McNeil and NYT for this well-researched and comprehensive article. I imagine this was a Herculean effort and I truly appreciate your hard work.
2020-04-19 12:53:00,"The demonstrators; what do they want?
Many lined up to buy more weapons at gun shops
Many thought about letting the older, more vulnerable die.

They need to understand the vast majority of people will not go there until the infection rates go down.

Factories are starting to reopen, most construction continues,
What are they trying to achieve?"
2020-04-19 12:53:57,"I can appreciate the drastic social restrictions necessary to curtail the virus but awareness of the economic devastation needs to be equally considered.  Consider the businesses that have been destroyed by this shutdown. I am familiar with individuals who have spent most of their lives building a successful business, employed many people and are now looking at bankruptcy.  Serious depression has so ensnared these people I worry for their lives.  The PPP supports their employees, for a short time, but it does not provide customers, nor does not assist in necessary refunds for cancellations and a mountain of bills.  Light at the end of the tunnel?  Many will never get there."
2020-04-19 12:56:26,"Count me shocked by this quote: 

""Surges are inevitable, the models predict, even when stadiums, churches, theaters, bars and restaurants remain closed, all travelers from abroad are quarantined for 14 days ... ""

How is it possible that we're going to leave churches, bars, and restaurants closed while still allowing travelers from abroad?

Isn't traveling from abroad, by plane -- mixing with so many people an airport, sitting for many hours in the recirculated air of an airplane, and standing in a crowded customs & immigration line -- far more risky than going to a restaurant, especially one that leaves space between people?

Not saying restaurants should close in phase 1 of the reopening. Just that if it's not safe enough to reopen restaurants, we shouldn't be allowing international travelers either.

And really, short of an ankle bracelet, just how is that quarantine going to be enforced?"
2020-04-19 12:56:47,"The coronavirus is scary, but even scarier is the reality that we have an administration in Washington that is not up to the immense challenge of marshaling the resources necessary to combat this scourge, uniting the country in a common cause, or re-opening the economy in a rational, fair way. A president takes aim at the WHO - the  one organization equipped to coordinate a global medical response; a patchwork of statewide closures that allows gun shops to stay open so the most unhinged among us can arm themselves, while failing to organize healthy access to beaches and parks; a chaotic federal bailout, driven by the swelling ranks of lobbyists, that hands out $20 million to a high-end steakhouse chain (Ruth Chris), while disbursing next to nothing to the states for testing. And rampaging through this house of cards a president who spreads false hope and misinformation, who continues to sow divisiveness, and who puts his re-election prospects ahead of  the welfare of Americans, regardless of their political preferences.  Unfortunately, November is 6 months away."

2020-04-19 13:08:09,"Thank you for a very inciteful article that clearly explains why this isn't as simple as a few weeks of shutdown and everything going back to the way it was. It is worth noting that some subset of recovered individuals may experience chronic, or permanent health problems after this virus, like decreased lung, heart or kidney function. Also, at a time when it is clear that air pollution and its associated health effects increase risk of developing more severe viral disease, the Trump administration is pushing ahead with weakening environmental protections while the public's attention is on the COVID-19 catastrophe. In recent days the administration has loosened regulations on auto emissions, soot and mercury releases from industry, coal ash pollution in waterways and used the pandemic as an excuse to suspend enforcement of laws that remain on the books. Truly diabolical."
2020-04-19 13:09:01,"Who speaks for the tens of millions of families in the next 6-12 months, who will be evicted or foreclosed, out on the streets and penniless and with no health care.  What happens to them both in the time pending vaccinations and then in the future?  Do they have a future?"
2020-04-19 13:12:02,"True that the actual virus takes a terrible toll, though the death rate is likely much, much lower than we know since there is very limited testing and we have NO IDEA how many people actually have the virus. I would argue the bigger toll is being thrust on society at-large through the unprecedented isolation and quarantine measures. Those, I fear, will lead to increased economic problems. And those will lead to job losses, decreased access to medical care, depression, suicide and drug/alcohol dependency. Every action has a consequence,  and I just hope the consequences in this case do not outweigh the good of the fight against this terrible disease."
2020-04-19 13:19:08,"Kudos to Mr. McNeil for this article. There are a lot of takeaways, some optimistic, some not so optimistic. I appreciate de-politicizing the presentation. However, I can't help but chuckle the obvious politics in the Trump's naming the initiative ""Opening Up America Again"". Sound familiar? 
A pun if I may. When I grew up, tetanus toxin was made from horse serum. I was allergic to horse serum. When asked for known allergies, I used to reply horse serum. Most healthcare workers had no clue as to this allergy. I stopped mentioning it. Now, I have to remember. Otherwise a Covid-19 vaccine might neighgate my survival."
2020-04-19 13:20:16,"The economic and debt picture, that is getting a lot of coverage, is  certainly bad but perhaps premature to even be thinking about seriously.  A lot of analysis begins with the premise that the ""pandemic passes"" but, as this article makes clear, we aren't sure when, or even if it will.  Trump keeps feeding the meme that we are past the peak, treatments are available and a vaccine is just around the corner when NONE of these things is true.  And premature reopening will only extend the pain and economic suffering as the virus finds fresh victims and creates new secondary peaks.

The key to Trump's motivation, of course, is re-election, so he keeps pushing the happy talk to boost the stock market while he has his fingers crossed that some of the more optimistic possibilities actually come true in time to save him.  With the challenges to finding safe treatments that work and the realistic time frame to develop AND manufacture a vaccine... which in and of itself is not a slam dunk... it's not a bet I would join in on."

Presumed safe. Presumed immune. Went grocery shopping. Delivered groceries to highly vulnerable friends who are staying home. 

3 days ago, I got tested again so that I could donate plasma. I tested positive again and am now in another quarantine!  

We can’t resume anything without testing. Period."
2020-04-19 13:28:18,"I wish we had Angela Merkel instead of Trump and Cuomo. 
Many leaders in the USA are politicizing the issue. The federalist state structure shows it disconnected fragmentation, with Cuomo playing victim while slashing health expenses state budget, and Trump being the opportunist bully. 
Merkel spoke clearly to German people, with scientific data and scenarios. 
Cuomo seems to add some Greek tragedy performance, that many seem to appreciate, but that I find excessive and artificial. 
The mayor of Seattle tackled the outbreak in her city with competence, and in an interview she showed a sense of responsibility and charge. 
I am in Brooklyn, family is from Milan, Italy. Friends and relatives had warned me early on. The mayor and governor underestimated the dangers. They left schools and businesses open too long. 
The early policies were “blame Trump “"
2020-04-19 13:28:38,"The problem with the death rate statistics is that hospitals are doing post mortem coronavirus tests and if a patient dies for ANY reason, a heart attack, cancer, whatever, and then the postmortem test is positive for coronavirus, they get listed as a coronavirus fatality. There are financial incentives to do this as hospitals receive substantial funding for every coronavirus case, whether the person dies or not. The media is ignoring the financial incentives on so many levels with the coronavirus situation. Of course the most glaring one is to convince people to panic so that they purchase a vaccine when it comes out, even though the vast majority of people have little to no symptoms. But there are other, behind the scenes financial motives for skewing the numbers, as I describe above, that are being completely ignored by journalists. And sadly, by doing that, they are contributing to the demise of American society far more significantly than the actual damage the virus is doing to people's health."
2020-04-19 13:28:52,"Thank you for this well-written thought-provoking article.  

The premise of the ""United"" States has been trashed beneath our feet for the agenda of the !%.  What remains is an extremely divided nation.  We have no existing Federal Government, the purpose of these united states were stated in our Constitution.  That we the people would decide our course.  How to work together to build a nation for all who are willing to pledge that together we can. 

Now we have a divided nation filled with hatred, selfishness, and fear.  Our Federal Government has stated that they have no responsibility, if we are to survive we are on our own.   Clearly, we either secede from this union and form a smaller union within the regions of the various states or appoint a totally new Federal Government that will represent us the people.  The America of the American dream is dead, the time is now."
2020-04-19 13:29:58,"It would be very helpful to know whether the daily death rate for heart disease, cancer, pneumonia and diabetes have dropped since the beginning of the month. And if so, how much? It would help answer the question of just how many people dying of Covid19 would have died of those other diseases.

It would also help to know whether and how much the daily death rate has increased the past 2 months."
2020-04-19 13:30:17,"I sense a certain arrogance, a privilege, to the ""keep the country closed"" chorus. I feel like those people must have all their ducks in a row and are able to continue to lead their lives somewhat normally despite the quarantine. They are either retired and have a comfortable pension, can work from home without issue, or are independently wealthy and can afford to sit back and ""embrace their down time"". 

I empathize deeply for the people whose lives have been torn apart by the closures and who will never fully recover from the COVID shutdowns. Consider the millions of people losing their jobs, any meager savings they had being decimated and the resulting homeless. People are living in their cars.  That kind of poverty is near impossible to recover from. Contracting the virus (which affects most people in a mild or even asymptomatic form) might be the least of their worries at this point.

The largest group seem to be Millennials, the people from 20 to 35, who are just starting out their lives or had finally found some semblance of security. They had the rug pulled out from under them with these blanket shutdowns. And for what? Cases are still rising, according to reports. Deaths are a lagging indicator, but cases are not and we are entering week 5 of the shutdown. 

When will the rest of country's financial/economic concerns being taken into consideration?"

Recent Chinese data. USS Roosevelt, recent Boston homeless shelter, etc.

Beating up on Trump or Governors will not help. China is halting exports for their Customs inspection given the millions of defective exports (Spain, the Netherlands, maybe more). There are many companies in the US switching to masks, PPE, sanitizer, etc. All good for future coverage.

Mr. McNeil wrote an excellent article. May he inspire the young'uns at NYT."
2020-04-19 13:40:05,"The long term difficulty we are facing is that all of the prescriptive approaches for containing the virus, as described in this article, are predicated on nearly 100% cooperation from the populace. Keeping everyone at home during ordered lock-downs, testing everyone, isolating every positive patient, vaccinating everybody. The reality is that we'll be extremely lucky if we can get 50-60% of the population to comply with even one of these. I do not see anti-vaxxers making an exception and lining up to get a Coronavirus shot once it's available.

Many people have commented that staying alive under a months or years long lock down is not living, it's merely surviving, and as time goes on the number of people willing to endure this is going to decrease, with a corresponding increase in the number of infections. We are barely 3 months into what, compared to other countries, is basically a voluntary effort, and already we're seeing strategies emerge for getting out from under the controls: self-infection, immunity certification, outright defiance. Imagine this scene 6 months or a year from now.

As important as it is to develop the vaccine, we also need to develop a plan on how to deal with the constant presence of this virus in a society that will eventually refuse to follow medically based directives to stay at home. I fear this is going to be a constant presence in our lives for many years to come."
2020-04-19 13:41:07,"When the world comes out the other side of this ordeal, the same tolerance that has existed for greed and corporate control of governments will be changed;  The world will not run out of PPE for a century and health care systems will rightly become more important than nuclear weapons."

Now, out of work, I'm planning and planting the biggest garden I've ever had: watermelons, tomatoes, squash, strawberries, lettuce. I'm also fortunate to have chickens who happily eat the dandelions I dig for them. I've got a beehive that has stood empty for a few years. This year I hope to catch a swarm to finally fill it.

This is my year ahead. One seed, one egg at a time."
2020-04-19 13:47:49,"Not to be unduly alarmist, but in addition to dealing with COVID-19, our public heath officials should still be on the lookout for the next potential pandemic. Viruses don't line up, waiting their turn to infect humans. My local newspaper reported that a COVID-19 patient had also tested positive for influenza. A particularly opportunistic virus might take advantage of bodies weakened by COVID-19 to move in."
2020-04-19 13:48:42,"Fantastic article!  Even if depressing and worrying.  Bravo to the Times!

I’m 75 - living in a non-profit retirement community that has amazing administration/infection-control.  So far we have not had one case of the virus.  Group activities were ended early on.  Visitors were forbidden.  While we can go outdoors to a small park that adjoins our community, there is only one way back in now.  The main entrance.  Via an employee who opens the door.  There’s a “check-point.”  Initially temperatures/travel history of residents was taken.  One by one, at our apartment door.  Employees go through a health check every time they come to work.  They wear masks and gloves.  

I feel safe here.  I am able to drive my car (and keep its batteries charged, about every 10 days).  Nearby grocery stores have “elder hours” - employees wearing masks, signs reminding people to distance.  I’ve gone twice, entering with a list,  getting exactly what I need, and leaving quickly.  Washing everything once I get back.

BUT, as I had already foreseen, and this article makes clear, this will have to go on FOR A VERY LONG TIME - if we elderly residents are to stay safe!  

BUT we are also dependent on the outside community to protect us.  We need society to COOPERATE.  Which takes what we already have - excellent administration and infection control. 

The nation lacks what we have!

Civil Unrest - authorized by Trump - puts the whole country at risk!"

2020-04-19 13:53:28,"AS our lives are altered, in so many cases shattered forever, another question comes up.  That question has sometimes been here in the Times, but rarely, and certainly without any actual importance, has it been put forth.  The facts have become clear that while it's not certain at all that all this was a deliberate action taken by the Chinese government, it is a fact now that they deliberately spread the virus world wide.  When the virus was already known to have human to human communication, China quickly sealed off the Wuhan area from other parts of China.  However, they allowed about a million people from there to travel outside of China, and thus spread the virus throughout the world.  Such an action has significant implications.  How can they be trusted in any aspect of trade?  How can that government be trusted in any way?  Such a malicious and murderous action means we cannot and should not trust them.  Their intentions are dangerous."
2020-04-19 13:56:23,"Iv’e been waiting for a realistic assessment of the “return to normal”for the public for some time. I am very glad to see this article. I feel that most people still believe this is a quick fix and that we will all be back to work within a few months. Sadly, it may take a year or two before that is even a possibility. I look at the people angrily organizing for the right to go back to work. I understand the dire economy, but the very sad fact is that going back to soon is a big mistake. It could take all these months of shelter in place and make them all for naught."
2020-04-19 13:56:24,"For weeks, this paper and its reporters and editorialists have acted like mortality and economics are mutually exclusive. It's writers and readers have acted like its ghoulish to debate whether closing the economy will have significant negative impacts.

When we talk about the economic impacts of the corona shutdown, we are talking about mortality and morbidity. It's indirect and in the longer term, so it's not as evident as deaths in nursing homes, but it's more insidious. Every increase in the unemployment rate will translate into a higher death rate among the unemployed--sure as clockwork. Every worker kicked off their health insurance will become much more likely to suffer from poor health outcomes that will increase mortality. Every month that poor students have to submit to ""distance learning"" and don't receive reliable meals through free and reduced lunch programs is going to result in measurable worse long-term outcomes (with higher poverty and mortality attendant). These negative outcomes will almost certainly dwarf the current numbers of Covid-related deaths. If the economic shutdown continues, it's not unrealistic to believe that it will ultimately have a much more significant and negative impact than the virus itself. 

It would certainly be nice to believe that you are making altruistic decisions solely related to health outcomes when you insist upon the economy staying closed indefinitely; alas the truth is much more nuanced and intertwined."
2020-04-19 13:59:42,"This article gets some things right. For example, ""The gains to date were achieved only by shutting down the country, a situation that cannot continue indefinitely. ""  The lockdowns are already doing substantial harm; not just to mental health and well being, but they are themselves causing loss of life as the global economy shuts down. We are already running out of some food products, this will worsen, and shortages of medicine and failures of our infrastructure will become common.  The catastrophic effects of indefinite draconian lockdowns are as inevitable as deaths from the virus.  We face a Sophie's choice and we must face it head on.

Yet intelligent behavior by us call can dramatically reduce the death toll. History is not encouraging in this regard. For example, in the US alone 20,000 to 40,000 die each year from influenza; a toll that would be substantially reduced if everyone got annual vaccination.  Yet, over half the population does not.

Similarly, there are over 30,000 automobile related deaths each year, a figure that would be substantially lower if we all wore seat belts whenever we're in a car. Yet many don't. Air bags help, and were developed because so many refuse to use set belts, but universal use of seat belts, as required by law, would do even more good.

At some point we'll likely have a vaccine against corona.  Rationale social distancing (what we have now is beyond rational) will help.  But will we all behave with wisdom and good sense?"

2020-04-19 14:04:09,"I'm not sure why all the experts are convinced the economy will bounce back quickly.  After WWII our systems of production and consumption were still primarily contained within national borders. Now they are global, with a high degree of complexity and interdependence. And after WWII there was still a huge amount of opportunity, even in the developed nations, to create transformative new technologies and accelerate the transition from agrarian to industrial societies. Our opportunities for growth may be more incremental and more focused on the developing world now. I can see a scenario where we simply don't have sufficient resources to either invest or consume, making what's coming much more like the Great Depression than the post WWII economic boom."

I realize that isolation was originally requested to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with patients, but opening up now doesn't mean the virus has gone away. Hospitals will still wind up being overwhelmed, it seems. It just means that the state won't be on the hook to pay anyone to stay home, which is really the goal here, isn't it -- avoiding having to give money away. When it comes to Texas, the phrase ""your money or your life"" has taken on new meaning, and the correct answer is, according to the state, ""your life."" Our rate of infection in Texas is still rising. We had four cases in mid-March in our county, and those four cases have continued to multiply steadily, bringing the total case load to more than a thousand. Yet, according to Republicans, it's no big deal, and we should all get back to work. I guess we'll see whether or not our hospitals are overwhelmed in late May ... Pardon me if I look upon Republican policy with a jaundiced eye."

No attendance to services in their churches (or shall we call them “place of business”?) means less money coming into their own personal bank accounts from the milking of their parishioners.

It is the most important single thing he can do for the US to get the schools and businesses open. The govt could subsidize the extra needed dollars so that the manufacturers can make some money.  Not a lot, just some.  They would be doing their part like the rest of us.  The Defense Production Act……please use it. Without the rapid testing, we have months of sequestering and waste."
2020-04-19 14:15:24,"The Boston Globe reported last night on a just released Harvard researcher generated antibody test done in one of our hardest hit communities (Chelsea, Mass. pop. 40,000) that showed that 33% of the randomly selected and tested inhabitants carried the C-19 antibodies.  None of those tested had active symptoms of C-19 or had ever been tested for C-19, but half had reported having a mild symptom or two, weeks earlier.

Many more antibody studies here in Boston are going to be done in the next few days and weeks, but this one study has hit like bombshell...33%!!!  If, this holds up in other studies to come, then we are a lot more infected than what we have been led to believe, and are a lot closer to herd immunity than any of us think.  Also, the virus probably cannot be contained.   Again, if 33% of a population is already walking around with C-19 and doesn't know they have it, good luck trying to contain infection with testing and tracing.

Because of federal regulations, they cannot recoup the estimated 15 million dollars they spend on feeding others (while putting themselves at risk by cooking and delivering the food). 

In that same article, I bump into this expose of a young, entitled, deluded conservative who gets paid by ""prominent GOP members"" to foment dissent:
""... the pandemic has showcased Mr. Kirk’s influence, providing him with ample fodder to stir up fellow conservatives against a full menu of enemies, real and perceived.""

So the road ahead isn't just bumpy, entire mile-long stretches of it are missing.

Examples:

o Testing, testing, testing.  There are countries that test more people per DAY than the US has in total.  Buy from the WHO, other countries, crank up production.  Whatever it takes.  

o Other countries are covering peoples’ mortgage or rent during the shutdown.  And some other expenses. This ultimately helps the economy.   

o Paid sick leave.  If you can’t bring yourself to pass it permanently, then at least do so for the duration of the crisis.

2.  Hire the temporarily  unemployed to jobs that are needed NOW.
This article points out we have very few contact tracers there are maybe a couple thousand currently,  if we need 300,000,
Where is the call for more??? This should be a huge priority.  Until you can get this virus spread down to contacts and away from “community” spread we aren’t “safe”.

3.  Mobilize for the current treatment of virus patients and mobilize again for the longer war and eventual vaccine.  Again where is the mass hiring of people needed to build more ventilators, syringes, hospital beds, whatever??

We shouldn’t be arguing over when to “open” the economy , we should be “arguing” over which job opportunity can I take to help with the response. 
This is the part that really boggles my mind.  I really thought our democracy and capitalism would function so much better than it is. Where is the capitalist reaction to this??

Trump, like the amateur workman that he is, only knows how to use a hammer to fix every problem. Pushing for a resolution without facts, testing kits, and logic leads to more deaths and discord. First he tries to circumvent constitutionally mandated states rights, cedes to the legal authority of states, then cries for armed insurrection against Democratic Governors. Is any of this helping to eradicate Covid 19? Is any of this saving lives? No, it’s just more of Trump's circus exacerbating the problem and succeeding in making it worse."

Testing for Covid-19 and immunization must become part of our regular health care regimen. This line intrigued me (about China); ""...virtually everyone infected in its first wave has died or recovered.""  One would think so unless there is an unknown aspect of the virus that we carry around after suffering its worst symptoms which might be immunity but also contagiousness?  Regular visits to your doctor includes the bloodwork to look for heart disease or cancer.  They are common in any (yearly?) checkup and now include testing for Covid-19."

This article is full of opinions that will surely not come true, and some that may; it is short on useful facts and long in speculations.  Outside of providing a living for the author its benefits are too small to measure.

This virus has provided me the opportunity and time to watch a lot of TV news and read newspaper articles etc..., which in turn has shown me the hopelessness of the human condition i.e, just what a catastrophe organic life is, especially human life

""I think human consciousness, is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware, nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself, we are creatures that should not exist by natural law.  We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self; an accretion of sensory, experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody is nobody.  Maybe the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight - brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.""

No one cares, right? IF YOU have money that is. Like Marie Antoinette -- let the poor and unemployed EAT CAKE! the charlatans are the Media who has shut down thinking what a long term depression/hyperinflation can cost -- INCLUDING DEATHS.

--Families including children are already going hungry.

--Families have lost their income and some may go homeless. This will increase suicides. Also alcoholism and illicit drug use.

--Charities will lose their funding. Overseas, this means starvation. Irrelevant, right?

--We lose funding for other good causes like fighting global warming.

Let's focus on what we can do to mitigate this terrible disease.

--required masks and social distancing and hygiene -- because a low exposure seems to be what helps people get over it naturally. (And our poor health workers are getting a heavy exposure regardless of shutting down the economy or not!)

--emphasizing good food and vitamins that help our immunity systems. We save MORE people from other diseases too this way.

If you’re not sick enough to stay out out the car just stay home-influenza is contagious too. Just because your COVID19 test is negative doesn’t mean you can go out and about with the flu. Antibody testing however is another thing-who has the antibodies for plasma treatments for severely ill hospitalized patients, who doesn’t need to stay indoors, which of my colleagues can prance into a COVID19 patient room without fear or the N95 mask?

The virus was apparently here in the late fall - many people suffered from fever/chills etc. of unknown origin and tested negative for the seasonal flu.  Many of us worked with such people and/or suffered those symptoms ourselves.  People travelled to and from China and Europe all along and evidently brought it back and forth.  What surprised us with COVID19 was the quick spikes, the lack of a medical solution and no vaccine.  Which lead to part two, our response.  Unfortunately it was fear driven, based upon multiple and conflicting estimates.  So fear-based decisions life worsened things by closing down the economy and destroying businesses - that feed and provide for employees, our neighbors, families and friends.

But there is no plan other than, re-open!  That's because we're dealing with someone who has no concept of public service.  His fundamental mentality is that he is answerable to no one.  He acts like the trillions of our tax-dollars are his; he has no regard for the fact that that is OUR money, for OUR benefit; he is OUR public servant charged with meeting OUR needs.

There are some viruses that live commensally with us at all times and do not become debilitating until our immune systems become less able to keep them at bay. The herpetic (herpes) viruses e.g. CMV and EBV are examples. Herpes zoster remains latent (viruses can be either ""latent"" or ""lytic"") until they enter the ""lytic"" phase wherein they again attack cells. The influenza virus lives in the guts of ducks, never attacking the host but ready to jump out and into (say) a pig and voila, we have a novel flu outbreak. Ducks fly long distances to share this stuff with us and our pigs. 
One of the worst outcomes of all this could be a scenario where SARS-CoV-2/COVID becomes very much like the herpetic/herpes viruses, spreads and lives below the surface in all of us ready to pounce when we become vulnerable. In that case it may or may not be vaccinatable. I don't believe EBV and CMV are vaccinatable and they are capable of being fatal. EBV causes Burkitt's lymphoma. 
Right now, our vulnerability lies with the aged (me), and certain comorbidities. 
If those comorbidities became permanently vulnerable to COVID, and SARS-CoV-2/COVID were to become inactive/latent within us, we would see a very dramatic reduction in population over time. 
Oh yeah; some of the human genome is thought to be former viral particles. You can't make this stuff up."

I share your hope that people will develop a desire for deeper understanding of physical reality.
It is the ground layer (hardware) on top of which social, emotional and economical (software) realities are standing. 

The problem is most people are disconnected from the need to understand physical reality beside their own body mechanics as they interact with the world through technology that ""magic"" to them. Press a button and there is light, turn a faucet and there is water. 

We are much more consumed by our interaction with the social, economical and emotional world than the physical one. Those things are more shared virtual reality than things following rigid physical rules like conservation of energy. 

Because of that, I tend to not be too judgmental of people  applying the wrong set of rules in assessing physical reality. 

This crisis hopefully will increase the awareness that we cannot just wish for the present reality to be a thing that it is not and have honest discussion of what it is [like for exponential growth curves]. 

However, we should also celebrate our ability to wish for a different reality and often make it happen in the future by the shear miracle of purposeful interaction with the world [plant seeds - get crop...]."

As a Canadian who has the good fortune to spend the past 6 winters in Florida and coastal Georgia, I offer a word of caution, especially to those Southern governors thinking reopening soon means business as usual: do not look toward Canadians next year to support your local economies.  Until a proven vaccine has been distributed in Canada, travel health insurance will be unavailable or totally cost prohibitive. I’ve spoken to several snowbirds since arriving back home and whether property owners, RVers or more short-term visitors, we all are of a like mind: international travel, particularly to the U.S. is off the table for a minimum of two years.  This does not bode well for Florida real estate."

Although every death is tragic, I think it would be a valuable exercise to consider how many deaths could be considered “slightly accelerated”.  For example, when most of my older relatives have passed, it was described as “it could have been any number of things that eventually got them”.   Right now that may be Covid.  My healthy teenage daughter was hospitalized with what we suspect to be Covid in February (before anyone was tested in Oregon), so I know that it can be brutal, and I supported the current stay at home orders.  However, they are meant to be temporary and mitigate, not eradicate, the virus.  At this point, ~70 people have passed in Oregon.  We can’t keep the economy shut down forever.  We need to gradually reopen the economy, knowing that some will get sick - flattening, not removing, the curve.  Of course there is risk to that, and we may need to slow down if the curve gets too large again, but the virus isn’t going away."

(BIG SIGH)

I lean liberal (but not on everything). I try to give differing points of view fair consideration. I tend to be an optimistic cynic (if there can be such a thing).

I want to believe that every person WANTS to to the right thing, and when we disagree, it isn’t out of hatred for one another, but out of ignorance (and I mean that in a positive way).

We can never really know the motivations behind what a person says or does. Typically, we react to the words and deeds of others based on our frame of reference (which is limited by our ignorance of other frames of reference). Most people think their frame of reference is the right one. If they didn’t, they would change it (and many times throughout their lives they do change it as they become less ignorant).

What’s my point?

Ignorance is our problem. Ignorance is our enemy. Ignorance is our virus. Ignorance may very well be our downfall.

Medical experts. Economic experts. Politicians. Citizens. Generally, we all want the same thing: the freedom to pursue healthy, prosperous lives. Freedom, health, prosperity. If you have any of these, would you want to lose them? Not me and not anyone I know.

Therein lies our dilemma. Each of us assigns value to our individual freedom, health, and prosperity, based on our specific frame of reference. Some of use are willing to trade-off one for another (freedom for health, health for prosperity, prosperity for freedom).

Some are not."

And studies will prove that aside from restriction of travel and encouraging social distancing none of the mitigation efforts including statewide shutdowns will have made any difference in propagation, hospitalization or rate of deaths- and the flattening of the curve is merely the natural decline seen in a viral outbreak.

Curiously a part of hearing he will not move on this is hearing from Drs Birx and Fauci that testing is coming and will be fine within a few weeks or so. This is also a bit of magical thinking , since it is clear that the states cannot afford to do this, and Trump has told us quite clearly that it is not his responsibility.

Even within the US, businesses have consolidated into oligarchic/monopolistic single points of failure and concentrations of wealth.

In the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, I have noted a sudden relaxation of social distancing measures .

2020-04-19 17:00:20,"I was intrigued by the statement that the virus will probably produce milder variants over time. It makes sense if, as people become less ill and maybe even asymptotic, they’ll be more likely to spread their variants. 

Given this natural occurrence, it offers another type of control strategy. If scientists were to be on the lookout for evolving variants of much lower pathogenicity, it might be possible to actually facilitate the spread of that variant thus ensuring milder disease and producing naturally occurring immunity well before an effective vaccine arrives. 

Unfortunately, I don’t believe it’s possible to serologically determine the particular strain a person had after the virus has been eliminated. So we’d still need widespread testing for active infections followed by contact tracing and back-tracing to identify and define illness severity. But we might get lucky and then simply facilitate large numbers, maybe only those without risk factors, to get infected with essentially no more than a bad cold."

We have to find the spot where we keep covid infections in check while causing the least amount of deaths from other things, like poverty or or suicides. But as a culture we have decided that those people are less valuable.  President Trump got elected because of the perception that the intellectual elite doesn't care and here we go again. The people making the decisions can afford to stay home. The people protesting at the State Capitals cannot. 
Yes there are more covid19 deaths than reported but there are many people that have  had the disease and were never tested because of lack of tests. So the death rate is much lower then 1%. Only when there is a reliable anti-body test  and if we test everyone will we really know the infection and death rate. You say that this is killing more people daily then heart disease. Just heart disease kills 650,000 Americans every year and has for decades. This is not worse.

Trump should be more sensitive to loss of human lives rather than inciting right wing folks to open up economy in three blue states.

Perhaps pick an infamous collective of known offender inflammatory molecules, that are highly likely to be present in the case of an infection. Maybe those who already have a higher immune inflammation may have a more welcoming environment towards this highly infectious virus. Of course this depends on whether we have available tests for such cytokines. 

Also while it is heartening to see so many brilliant minds focused on solving the problem, please also advice the population in general on what might keep us baseline healthy apart from a decent diet, social distancing, masks and hygiene. Would taking extra vitamins, especially C and D help?  Are certain over the counter medications helpful or harmful with this virus? For example, it affects our ciliated epithelium causing those infected to drown in their mucus. Would taking an over the counter mucus thinner at the inception of this infection be detrimental or beneficial?

Unless I am seriously mistaken (though not likely, given that I have an MS in molecular biology and my wife has a PhD in virology), those who test positive on an antibody test ARE NOT NECESSARILY CARRIERS. They are people who have had the virus, but whom are EITHER currently infected, BUT ASYMPTOMATIC, in which case they may be INFECTIVE, or else they had it and beat it, in which case they are NOT INFECTIVE.

Patients must be at least actively infected (positive on a PCR test, proving the presence of virus) in order to be infectious.

Although  Trump was pressured into issuing mask, and distancing orders to the general public, he has now decided to wipe out those controls by trying to get states to re-open. He has followers ""who like him"" that are protesting without wearing face masks and standing together closer than 6 feet. By failing to warn his people to retain face masks and social distance, Trump may LITERALLY cause his base of support to die in large numbers before the November election.

It only makes no sense if Trump is determined for states to take the fall if there’s a subsequent upsurge in cases.

We need to find a team of people that have a similar dynamic of the likes of General Leslie Groves and J. Robert Oppenheimer, a master organizer and a man with the ability to manage super-geniuses like Oppenheimer and his team. 

We need a national commitment to real leadership and an all hands on deck approach to defeating this invader.  

We have evidence that upwards of 50% of those infected don't have symptoms.   So, we don't have any idea if our models are based on actual data.   When we ""open the country"" back up without having the reliable, ubiquitous rapid response testing and contact tracing systems in place, we could see secondary and tertiary at much higher levels.  

The only reason that we are seeing the divergence from the initial (non-social-distancing model) and what we are seeing in models now is that major population centers like NY and California took decisive social distancing actions and have bent the curve.   If we stop social distancing, things get bad quickly without a Manhatten Project approach to testing, contact tracing, isolation, and treatment.

If we can spend $2 Trillion on stimulus, we can put $1 Trillion to eradicate this virus and be prepared for its mutations and other future viruses.  Since Trump won't; Congress must."

Everybody is placing their faith in the development of a vaccine for this virus but if the vaccine for the (2019-2020) version of flu is any guide, that  vaccine is effective in only 2/3rd of the cases.

But the nuttinesses that are coming from the president (lower case intentional) and his devotees are not much fun at all. I think it’s probably because the idiocy of watching lockdowns go into place, watching the numbers drop, watching the virus spread into rural America and the poorer parts or the world where there aren’t any lockdowns, and concluding that therefore the lockdowns were pointless and everybody should go back to work, is gonna get a lot of people killed.

Some people are not able to genuinely social distance - because they are low-income, and they work in a situation such that in practical terms they can't really social distance. Like, for example, an Amazon warehouse/packing facility, with an employer that has a long history of using Taylorism tactics to leverage and drive workers. There is the lack of testing, and the issue of asymptomatic carriers. Medical facilities, in some areas, have apparently shut down. Cuomo hasn't drafted all of them to work in NY - they just aren't available to patients. So if we are going to be stuck with wave after wave of corona virus for a long time, I have to suspect we need an approach that isn't driven by media-led mob politics, but something more complex, more precisely crafted. Corporations can't borrow forever. If corporations had the breathing space of a re-opened economy, could the Feds leverage that breathing space to force, say, Amazon, for example, to re-construct the structure and workflow of their warehouses to make social distancing practical long term? Could we restore checks and balances, and other values essential to Constitutional legitimacy, and stop letting society be driven by unaccountable, ""executive orders"" from on high? Could society pay a lot more specific and direct attention to how workers are actually treated on the job, and be real about ""social distancing""?"

2020-04-19 18:24:27,"The more likely path to get past this virus is to go right through it.  That means it burns through the population at a steady (no hospital overwhelming surges) but non zero rate over the next 12 months with the more vulnerable holed up until we reach the herd immunity.  Some antibody tests suggest we are 10x, 20x or even 80x further along than confirmed cases would indicate.  So the lethality isn't 3% but more likely a fraction of a percent.  And with treatments to get critical patients through the worst of it, the mortality rate would be lower still and maybe flu like.  If 200 million get infected, about 200,000 would die given a 0.1% rate.  That's 4x an average flu season.  Nobody will advocate this approach but it will happen because people at some point will push back against all the restrictions.  

What?  You want to sacrifice lives so we can have our way of life back?  We already do just that.  We accept an average of 50,000 flu related deaths every year.  That number could be much lower if we just did extreme social distancing from October through March.  But we don't.  We go to concerts, ride subways and pass on the flu.  Yes we vaccinate but giving up our way of life could save more."
2020-04-19 18:31:53,"I do see a few glimmers of hope in this article, if they are accurate.  New reports from Wuhan show that a far greater of the population were carriers but asymptomatic.  That may show that the % who became critically ill or died was far smaller than first thought.  The Stanford Medical Center report (not in this story) appears to show far greater exposure than reported.  Also encouraging if accurate in this report is that mutations may be more benign and less deadly.  

That doesn't change the fact that we to main vigilance, social distancing to slow the spread and protect our ability to treat those who become ill from any serious illness in our hospitals.  We need test for the virus and for antibodies so we can safely open up our economy again."
2020-04-19 18:32:46,"Consider lowering Medicare, and maybe even Social Security on a sliding scale, to age 50.

Although all ages can get the virus, people over 50 generally seem to be more at risk for severe effects.

I think the average age of hospitalization for the virus is 47.

Therefore, I think it would only make sense if Medicare age was lowered to age 50, and maybe even Social Security. 

This way older workers who are more vulnerable to the virus would be given the opportunity to retire earlier so as not to put their health at greater risk."

So the virus has increased the normal death rate by only a little with a cost that has been economically devastating to millions of people, mom/pop businesses, and large corporations.  
To those who regard the disruption to keep the virus caused death rate to only 1800/day as worth the price, consider the fate of the 14,000 and what national disruption we should pay to prolong their lives.  Sounds like a nonsensical question until you consider the cost the nation is paying to ‘flatten the curve’ to in an effort to stretch out the deaths from this virus."

In  Verhagen 2012""The Tierra Solution: Resolving the Climate Crisis through Monetary Transformation"" I seminally presented the ethical, commercial, intellectual, ecological and strategic dimensions of a carbon-based international monetary system with its carbon monetary standard of specific tonnage of CO2e per person  to deal not only with the financial crisis, but especially  and the greater challenge and threat of the looming climate catastrophe.

 Now as part of the forthcoming Tierra Pathway I am proposing national conversation on the comprehensive notions of justice and sustainability as the foundation of the two pillars of just and sustainable  global governance system. 
A money-based financial system rather than the present debt-based financial system and the above carbon-based international monetary system. Evidence will show how we are beginning to shift from a debt-based financial system to a money-based financial system where quantitative easing and grants are increasing. It is argued that the Fed, Congress and the Department of the Treasury have to reclaim their duty to be the  sole creator of money and that privately owned banking systems are to become regulated utilities without the privilege of money creation."

One thing I do know, can we keep the far left and far right politics out of this...PLEASE..we were warned that something like this would happen for 20 years and we didn't prepare for it, similar to 9/11,..we could bicker about how we got here but in the end,  we're still in the same place. The 2 major issues we have are testing and how we will socially distance each other going forward until a vaccine is found. The thought of opening things up will be interesting...how do you keep people 6 feet apart in an office, restaurant, retail store, or in public transportation...it appears that social distancing is working but how long can this go on....every aspect of our economy...except for Amazon, will be negatively effected, and all of you are right...our states depend on tax revenue to pay for everything, how do you pry money out of people that don't have it.

2020-04-19 19:45:21,"Excellent article. I would like to address one issue, the ethics of a challenge trial where volunteers are given a unproven vaccine then purposely exposed to the virus as a faster alternative to the current standard phase 3 test of giving the unproven vaccine or a placebo to large numbers of individuals and compare infections rates over a much longer time period. A challenge trial puts the volunteers at significantly higher risk, a risk some call unethical. In the framework of clinical trials in “peacetime” it could easily be characterized as unacceptable. However, we are not at peace, we are in a global war. On April 2nd, Elliot Ackerman wrote an excellent piece in this paper “There Is an Antidote to Our Fear. It’s Called Leadership.” He vividly describes the preparations for the 2004 Marine assault into Falluja. The casualty estimate was 70%. To ask your Marines to step up to that level of risk is not unprecedented but rather the norm in wartime. We, as a nation, have become very complacent about contributing to the welfare of our country. Rather any inconvenience can be portrayed as an imposition on personal liberty – even paying taxes or staying home. Let us ask what we can do for our country and step up when we get the answer. I was a Lieutenant in the Army for two years, I stepped up then and I would step up again."

Depending on the lenght of unemplyment for many Americans, they won't have the resources to spend on anything other than basic necessities - food, shelter and other maintenance items (past due payments?). Where will the robust spending come from???"
2020-04-19 20:06:13,"The pandemic curve may appear to be flattening, but this is not a result of happenstance, the bend is being achieved through diligence. There are many, many 'social distancing' fingers in the dike holding back this contagion, which if they are removed will result in the pandemic climbing still higher. We should keep in mind that we are still very near the peak, and as a result, the daily identified case-rate and the daily death-rate are not far off the maximum.  There are city-by-city charts from the 1918 pandemic which should be looked at closely, as they illustrate the various consequences of in some cases maintaining lockdowns and in others prematurely lifting them.  Some charts have the familiar simple bell-curve shape - but many more describe a double-hump, which has resulted from the lockdown being lifted prematurely.  It's all very fine to plan for the lifting of social-distancing measures - but this 1918 experience indicates that lockdowns should only be lifted once the death-rate drops down to 10-15% of where it was at the peak.  We are nowhere near that effective tipping point yet. There is history here to inform us that needs to be respected... as otherwise,  lockdowns will have to be repeated - which would also be repeating past histories.  If anyone wonders what outrages that might stip up, one has only to look at historical commentary that accompanied past failures."

The CDC says flu killed at least 61,000 Americans last season, fare  more than COVID-19 has killed far this year, and the number of COVID-19 infections is declining.

As of April 17, the CDC count, which is based on actual death certificates, shows 582,565 Americans have died since the COVID-19 outbreak began in February. A total of 19,032 of these deaths are attributed to COVID-19 and COVID-19 with flu.  So COVID-19 has caused about 3.2 percent of deaths since the beginning of the outbreak.

Unless commands can be *enforced* (good luck with 331M+ people), a ""restructured"" work/play environment still has far too many holes to ensure mitigation of contagion.  Too many people have sloppy hygiene, have no clue what 6 feet means, don't anticipate collisions inside stores, etc.
There are two options:
Put every American inside an isolation cell, including within their own homes -- perhaps monitored by some evil video tool linked to law enforcement (i.e., totalitarian state)
or
Accept mortality, mistakes, and imperfection as part of the human condition.

To my surprise, I have discovered that suddenly all government officials, all media outlets, and most people reading the NYT, find the latter utterly unacceptable.  Not a single cell of any virus or other biological enemy of the body must emit from anywhere before our earthly lives resume.

Now he’s abandoning testing all together|. The nation was left totally vulnerable and in a place of ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" as trump deliberately over the last three years dismantled all the important measures Obama had taken to protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and guard against other possible infection situations in the future."

the only thing worse than the last few months would be a repeat of the situation a few months from now. just like a coronavirus patient, it's difficult to recover after having been on a ventilator for a few weeks, a weakened patient who needs to go back on the ventilator has an even lower chance of survival.

the united states is the weakened patient and the stimulus spending thus far has been the ventilator. 

a recovery interrupted by another spike in cases will make recovery that much more difficult. 

trump can't have it both ways. treat the patient properly now - with testing, with a Manhattan Project-like effort to find a treatment and a vaccine, and with more testing. or rush the patient out of the ICU with the likelihood that a recovery won't materialize and the patient will die.

This system of natural medicine is inexpensive and widely available. One of the doctors I have studied with has treated over 150 cases of covid 19, maintaining all cases with only mild symptoms, even the cases that were becoming severe before treatment. This is a system of medicine that has a strong track record in epidemics, for hundreds of years. It is not mainstream medicine, and some people believe it does not work. However, if the practitioner is skilled, results are good. This is a time to be open to any and all solutions. I sincerely hope that people will become more open-minded.

If I were only concerned, for example, with saving lives, I would never let anyone drive over 35 on the freeway--both for themselves and for others. If I were only concerned about lives, I would never let anyone smoke or eat fatty foods--both for themselves and for others affected (including in lost relationships and cost to taxpayers). If I were only concerning about saving lives, then I would outlaw all extreme sports and things like skydiving. If I were only concerned with saving lives, I would fine anyone who had sex without a condom. The list is easy to draw if you think about it. 

Well, why don't we do these type of things? We don't do them because freedom is an essential human good. It cannot be shut aside as easily as it is now. Even the Ancient Greeks in part understood this. We know that doctors will never address these political goods because that is not their job. They will always look exclusively through the lens of what is good medically. But we should be very careful assuming always that what is good medically is what is good in terms of rights and freedom and the common good. At some point, and I don't think it's far off, Americans will simply refuse to stay home. Why?

The vast majority of citizens will, if necessary, sacrifice the lives of the largely elderly population most at risk in order to resume their own lives.

Politicians who refuse the public demand to an end to this quasi-police-state mentality will be run out of office.

It is idle to suppose that a third-billion people will allow themselves to be pauperized and kept under a form of house arrest.

Other nations, e.g. Germany and Sweden, have either refused to goose-step through this epidemic or are rapidly ending their subservience to the worst warnings of the medical profession.

It looks like about 20% get terribly sick and have to be hospitalized.  That's 32 million hospitalizations.  Again, a staggering amount.

That's precisely why mitigation is so terribly important.  We absolutely cannot let this thing go wild and free.  

Conservatives are making false arguments that the virus does not pose that much of a threat if only 60,000 die.  This is a false argument because that death toll is predicated upon widespread mitigation.  If we stop social distancing, the 60,000 grows to millions really fast.  

Travel of all kinds has to stop.  We must stay within our local communities.  Travel can make anyone a new source of infection.

The faster we implement widespread testing, the faster we can move around within our local communities.  We should be implementing a WWII level production of testing kits.  We should be training an army of testers.  (There are plenty of people looking for work now).  We should be developing a national data base to accurately track test results and assist those who must stay home with food, medicine and emotional support so they don't go nuts.  Getting infected should not be be a punishment.  

We could do all of this is we had a president who would use his power for the people instead of boosting his ratings.  Otherwise, we are in for a long haul."

genuine disease immunity, children and adults would not
be susceptible to the illnesses against which they were
vaccinated. 
There is no way to know what the rates of infection will be in this ""novel"" virus.
It may be the case that we should allow for children to become infected ( as the suggestion has already been made that they are either asymptomatic or at little mortality risk), but isolate and/or vaccinate the most vulnerable populations. 
One can look the corresponding examples as measles was a scourge for centuries. We did much better when we had 20th century therapeutics available to treat what became thought of as a ""childhood disease."" Only the combination of a largely naturally obtained immunity and better treatments did things truly improve. The introduction of a vaccine came late in the cycle. ( 1963).
From my perch, devising the best therapeutics for Covid19 is more urgent than the assumption that a vaccine is a cure-all solution for the long term."

What about schools, what about bars eateries and clubs, what about sports, both participation and attendance, what about work and shopping, travel/tourism. Although all of us will contend with these questions, these younger folks probably account for a greater percentage of ""consumption"" of these activities. Some of that is unavoidable, some of it optional.

It is vital that people in this ""group"" understand the consequences of their choices and that they are informed and willing to look hard at their options to limit their consumption. If that does not happen we will be in for a very long and rough ride."

Yet, Weld County now has well over 1000 cases and 61 deaths compared to Larimer County with 212 cases and 12 deaths.

 Why did it spread so much more and is more deadly  in Weld County?  

 Is it because Weld County is a GOP stronghold?  Patrick Neville, GOP minority speaker of the house compared (Jewish American) Polis' stay-at-home orders to Naziism.

The Colorado Springs Gazette published an editorial condemning this on Saturday but it is still out there for the fringe crazies protesting the stay at home orders. 

Could it be Trump with his dismissive attitude and his lame and delayed response to the virus and his fantasy outcomes of re-opening the economy where he is the hero?  

Could it be that much of the population is Hispanic and poor (undocumented)?  Meat packing plants there  continued to require workers to work when sick.

You won't hear about them from the mainstream media that accepts the ultra expensive reductive pharma model as the one and only healthcare model - even though our outcomes are dead last amongst the industrialized countries (11th) and 27th in the world - even though our industrial healthcare kills 440,000 people every year with avoidable medical errors, and drugs correctly prescribed kill another 100,000.  

Even though our expensive healthcare failed abysmally against this virus.  

No one questions these obvious failures.  

Why?  

Maybe they think there's no alternative, but there is.  Other countries use a more systems-based approach that hits the virus from every direction.

There are many many molecules that are not patentable but directly act on the genes this virus uses to do its damage.  

They directly interfere with viral function, mechanistically.  This is exactly what the pharma labs are trying to develop synthetically so they can patent them.

Think about it.  The highest estimate of the US death toll if we didn’t shut down was around 2.5 million mostly elderly or ill people.  We are a country of 330 million and those who are seriously hurt by the shutdown but at almost no risk from the virus are people with decades of life ahead of them.

The Whitehouse should encourage the remaining States to organize themselves into similar regions, and allow these areas to independently manage re-opening.

2020-04-19 20:26:25,"Listening to The Constitution Canter’s excellent podcast, “We the People” about, among many other things, the SCOTUS’s transition to hearing cases via teleconference, and the current and likely impacts of the pandemic on elections.  It and various pages on the non-partisan organization’s website are important, valuable resources for all of us and for our kids.  <a href=""https://constitutioncenter.org"" target=""_blank"">https://constitutioncenter.org</a>/

The most recent podcast and NTY articles on SCOTUS, however neglect to address basic concerns raised by teleconferenced and/or zoomed (or other web-based) lawsuits.  Among the neglected concerns: since the courts will be unable to see, or see much of, the various participants’ total surroundings, how will they ensure that not a single person (party, judge/justice, lawyer, witnesses or jurors  (the latter 2 in lower courts), etc.) are safe undue influence up to and including even mortal threat — Particularly if/when such hearings persist past COVID stay at home orders/advice? Courthouses have somewhat rigorous security screeners and trained, well-vetted bailiffs and sheriffs officers present and security cameras all around and attended to at all times.  Private homes and offices do not.  

Similarly, can the courts truly rely on the honor system, without meaningful verifying measures, to ensure that no one’s cheating in some manner? I’ve experienced a fair amount of specious behavior by lawyers, who are granted unwarranted & unreasonable benefit of the doubt by fellow members of the Bar."

2020-04-19 20:25:13,"Thanks, NYT, for assembling a pragmatic assessment of America's situation and prospects.  Unfortunately even acknowledged experts continue to pussyfoot around the most dangerous reality we're facing.  

The Trump Republican party, led by Murdoch's Fox News propagandists, continues its delusional assault on science-based responses to the pandemic.  Lockdown protests (cheered on by a president who has abdicated responsibility, funded in part by Secretary of Education Betsy deVos) and rightwing vilification of Tony Fauci, are symptoms of our more serious illness--the denial of facts.  

A few voices, like Paul Krugman's, seem willing to call out these enablers of catastrophe.  The tragedy is how many informed and intelligent people seem to be silenced by fear of Trump's tweets and internet flaming.  It's hard to imagine a leader more unfit for a genuine crisis than Donald Trump, whose only thoughts are for himself, and whose response to adversity is to find others to blame.  Mitch McConnell comes to mind, though, and his Senate (R) toadies.  They're blind to the obvious truth that science-based action is the only path back to a functioning economy, and that political posturing only makes things worse.  

The Republican party looks more and more like the Death Panel they claimed would result from Obamacare (I remain a registered Republican after 60 years, to my shame).  How long can it continue, and will the Republican party ever recover the integrity it once had?"
2020-04-19 21:20:27,"President Trump’s overt support (via Tweets, naturally) for protesters who are demanding that Democratic-led states quit public health isolation policies, is much worse than politics as usual.  Of course the same protests are occurring in Republican-led states, but those states were not included in the all-caps Tweets egging on the protests.  To me, this qualifies as domestic terrorism.  From our president.  To say I’m shocked is an understatement.  I’m devastated.  I have been for over 3 years, but it keeps getting worse.  The months between the election in November and the inauguration in January have potential for very serious civil unrest, provoked by our own president.  Adding in a global pandemic is fuel on the fire of division that was lit by Trump himself."

Not to mention the ability to reach the last mile for thousands of rural communities.

2020-04-19 11:59:12,"First, what's weird about Trump supporters is that you can easily pick them out of any crowd based solely on their manner of dress (Ripped jeans, Molly Hatchet concert tees, and anything by Carhart.)  It's not a political revolution, it's a regression of fashion.  

Trump's initial strategy (It's under control, it'll disappear like magic) was informed not by himself but by his political taskmasters, the hidden puppeteers who control both parties, who sought to elbow Bernie Sanders out of the primary by delaying awareness of the virus's economic impact until after South Carolina, ensuring that the redistributionist agenda would die a death and be off the table only days prior to the total failure of late-stage capitalism.  Bernie's communist/socialist/progressive agenda would now be quite viable here in the United States, at least for the time being.   

The success of Trump has been maintaining the status-quo (China supply chain, tax policies for trillionaires, anti-labor policies) while paying lip service to his campaign slogans, thereby tricking the good citizens of Bumpkinville again. 

It's phony populism, folks."
2020-04-19 11:48:01,"Obviously, ""Trump's"" recommendations did not come from him but from some underling talking with  Dr. Fauci and others who are trying to be sensible about ""reopening,"" because Trump is already ignoring them and urging his base to fight any restrictions in states with democratic governors.  If this isn't ""politicizing"" the crisis, I don't know what is.  The only sensible way forward is the way we've been forced to take - spotty approaches depending on who the governor of a state is and whether he/she is listening to scientists and medical advisors or political ones, like Trump.   The spotty approach will allow the virus to go where the people are out and about, and people will travel and bring it to wherever they go. I'm continuing my more cut-back life for the foreseeable future until the death count stops going up and reverses to come down.  Meanwhile, MY thoughts and prayers are going to the health care workers and grocery store clerks and delivery people who are on the front line of having to interact with the sick and dying.  I am not praying for Trump or his foolish followers."
2020-04-19 13:29:41,"It is realistic to think that without a vaccine which will take a couple of years to produce in quantity, we will have to live with the virus. 
But from recent observations many are asymptomatic (data from Iceland, Dutch blood donors, French and American sailors on airplane carriers) and the overall mortality is low. 
We can not control the virus, but we can control the factors that allow most to die of covid. American have low vitamin D levels, the food industry sells sodas packed with high fructose corn syrup, snacks have low nutritional value and too much sugar and unhealthy fats. Type 2 diabetes is rampant. Those factors can be addressed.  Maybe if the soda super size ban in ny would have passed a few lives might have been saved."
2020-04-19 23:13:16,"The year ahead there should be a deployable safe vaccine that will help acquire protective immunity to COVID-19 and there could be a safe antiviral with no adverse effects to treat the confirmed positive cases. I am not so sure that relying on hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir will be a safe bet. We need more options especially safe broad spectrum antivirals that will not only be effective against the current pandemic but all future enveloped virus pandemics like Influenza, Corona virus, Ebola etc. 

Currently in the absence of any deployable vaccine or a safe antiviral treatment, we also need to acquire herd immunity now and that can only happen if we are truly the home of the brave. Sweden health minister thinks that their bold response will lead to herd immunity in a month. I believe it will. Our response has been a knee jerk reaction without proper thinking of the consequences. I fully support the travel restrictions across our International airports and school closings but closing eg clinics, dental offices, fitness centers was going way too overboard and we will suffer dire consequences for those local orders from governors, mayors and cowards of the county. By staying home in our bubblettes we cannot acquire essential  ""herd immunity"" for the ultimate long term eradication of the pandemic. I therefore support all non violent protests to reopen the country to tomorrow. there is no scientific evidence to support not to, except in the COVID-19 ill prepared areas of the US"

Wealth imbalance is the root cause of poverty and the whole system is set up as a wealth-imbalancing machine.

CostCo seems to treat their staff well but Amazon no so much.  I am a member of CostCo and Amazon Prime and, right now, Amazon seems to be one of the few companies that's thriving during the pandemic; we order stuff from Amazon and it arrives in a day or 2; order from other places and it takes a week or 2.

That's the way markets work and suppliers have to accept it.  Suppliers, many being autocratic governments like Russia and Saudi Arabia, that depend on it to fund their governments always increased prices when demand increased or supply was restricted due to war so what's the problem here.  They should have set aside some of their excess profits for days like now.  Remember the low prices help everyone else now who are financially harmed."

2020-04-20 12:56:25,Trump wants to kick start the economy to aid in his reelection. Never mind that countless more Americans will die because of his actions.
2020-04-20 12:55:57,"Don't use the term ""conservative Republican"" anymore. That breed is extinct. These are Trump cultists and they only care about themselves. They care only about their ability to shout inane slogans about liberty when they despise anyone who is different from themselves. There is a high likelihood that some of them will infect someone when they go home from these rallies. They love a President who is everything they long to be. Their crudeness is only exceeded by their love of finger pointing and blaming others for their own failings, just like their ""dear leader"" in the Oval Office."
2020-04-20 13:40:49,"A central challenge to most Americans is the strategic alliance formed between Donald Trump and what might be termed the ""pillage and plunder"" wing of what used to be the Republican Party, those interests generally subsumed under the label of conservative Republicans. Initially Trump saw his election as a grand opportunity for grift and self-aggrandizement but his enthusiasm and lack of self-control rapidly plunged him into decisions ranging from legally dubious to borderline treason. Consequently holding on to political power has become not only profitable but necessary to avoid spending his post-presidency in prison.
Meanwhile his allies saw Trump's greed and disinterest as an opportunity to ravage the budget, destroy health and environmental regulations, and pack the courts to their advantage. Not only was there no resistance from Trump but he realized Republicans would turn a blind eye to his cupidity and defend him fiercely as long as he gave them free rein. Those segments of American society most gratified by imposing cultural preferences on others, whether those others are poor immigrants or eminent scientists, recognized opportunity.  International bullies realized he would not defend American interests as long as they stroke his ego. It is now in his interest for Donald Trump to drag his heels on fighting the pandemic, exploiting the social strains it creates and hoping it cripples his electoral opponents. As long as pillage offers profit this behavior will continue."

2020-04-20 13:42:24,"If the reason the small business loan money ran out before smaller businesses got a shot is not obvious to you, here it is:

Banks make money on loans.  They charge origination fees, and they collect interest.

If two borrowers show up and ask for loans, one for $10,000,000 and one for $25,000, guess which loan generates more income for the bank?

I suggest that there are managers who tell their loan officers “Handle the biggest loans first, because we make more money that way.  Your bonus is dependent on how much the loan generates in revenue.”

Three guesses what happens next.  (Hint: The little guy gets to wait, and wait, while the big loan is rammed through as fast as possible.)

Does that help your understanding?"

Look at the cities with clean air and less traffic, I think most people would agree that’s better than smog and congestion. The new marketplace will cause businesses to change or fail for the same reason that slide rules and tube radios are found at antique stores and museums. Sacred cows will be gored and those that own them will be hurt financially in the new society, but this is the capitalist tradition.

I enjoy getting to Destination X more quickly than driving, but in general, I hate airlines, airports, and the masses of entitled, angry people flying along with me.

Perhaps the industry needs a big fail to figure out how to do it better, more efficiently, more environmentally friendly.  Perhaps the world needs to reconsider the idea that going anywhere anytime is perhaps not the best thing for the world (thus yourself, if one extends that logic fully).

But oh no...can't tell people they don't have a ""right"" to fly when and where they want.  Can't tell airlines that they are just businesses, and businesses do fail.

Can't tell Congress and others than their stock portfolios might not be too good this year because their investments were in part supporting industries that do what they do inefficiently and just plain badly.

We bailed the auto industry out years ago and what did we get? Really big, really environmentally UNfriendly, road-hogging, massive vehicles.

I say let the planes stay on the ground.

Which if we had grounded them back in mid-February, btw, much, if not most of this pandemic may have not hit the USA because if you don't fly it in, it just doesn't magically manifest.

Not all small locally owned shops are paragons of virtue.

Small shops generally refused to give you your money back even with a receipt and recently purchased.

I used to live in a village in northern USA where there were several independent hardware stores throughout the region.  

Without exception, they hated DIYers and catered to contractors.  They ignored me or were rude. The prices were MSRP.  Small power tools were locked up behind glass cabinets.

Today, how would they rank the importance between having a savings account or having an unnecessary 'thing?' How many spend money on cigarettes?

OK, I'm old. I was born during the Great Depression and grew up during WWII and rationing. My grandmother saved rubber bands and string. We sewed our own clothes and cooked our own food. ""A penny saved is a penny earned"" was our mantra. Frugality was ingrained. A college friend of mine became a multi-millionaire...and was trying to break himself of the habit of going through the 50% discounted items in a grocery store.

Crude oil has almost no intrinsic value; it is only useful if you can run it through an incredibly expensive, complex, dangerous and environmentally risky refinery. There has been no new refinery in the US since 1976, although capacity has been increased via increasing technology squeezing more fuels out of each barrel. 
This will pass, when consumption goes up and storage capacity is freed up. I hope it does not create a giant hole in supply down the road, as is presently happening as crops and livestock are harvested and destroyed or not replaced. 
This economic shutdown, a first, is going to have very dangerous ramifications. 
So far this pandemic has not been as serious in terms of lives lost or ""life years"" lost as even the flu season 2017-18, 1968 and probably even 2009.

It has been clearly documented (written and videos) that this opposition was point of either ridicule or outrage, depending on what side of the political or business spectrum you were on. From the get-go it was all about adding Stricter supervisory amendments or Clauses to make sure the distribution of the funds were allocated to the smallest or smaller businesses that are not supported by chains or groups, like Mom and Pops´. 
Also on video , the present tenant in the WH was brazenly clear that he did not intend to respect the final Aids package supervision clauses in the bill when he signed it, and even said to the World that HE would supervise the distribution himself.

I posted this argument a few days ago:

“Loan Money Runs Out While Small-Business Owners Wait in Line”

If the reason is not obvious to you, here it is:

Banks make money on loans.  They charge origination fees, and they collect interest.

If two borrowers show up and ask for loans, one for $10,000,000 and one for $25,000, guess which loan generates more income for the bank?

I suggest that there are managers who tell their loan officers “Handle the biggest loans first, because we make more money that way.  Your bonus is dependent on how much the loan generates in revenue.”

Three guesses what happens next.  (Hint: The little guy gets to wait, and wait, while the big loan is rammed through as fast as possible.)

Oil demand is not going back up any time soon.  Since the places to store oil that is pumped out of the ground are running out, the oil producers will all have to cease or reduce production so that there will not be ""excess"" oil production to store.

But shutting down oil wells is expensive, and it can cause damage to the wells themselves.  So the oil companies are reluctant to even do that.

Demand falls for two reasons: some people who might have the purchasing power are doing less that depends on oil, and other people do not have the purchasing power are doing nothing.

If demand falls lower, they will have to cut even more."

From the article, people say over 60, who stopped working because of a high risk of catching a potentially fatal covid, may not be eligible.

Unfortunately, a barely-known aspect of the interaction of state Medicaid estate recovery laws with the ACA may also do real harm to older people who have just had income reduced, by the covid crisis, to expanded Medicaid zone of the ACA (138% of the Federal Poverty Level or less).

In about 10 states, many of them ""blue"", like MA, NJ, and MD, all medical expenses paid out by any Medicaid, including ACA expanded Medicaid, are, for people 55 and over, subject to estate recovery.  Thus, though these people may think the government has their back and they still have health ""insurance"", they really have only a loan for medical expenses until death.

The problem is only in certain states.  In other states, like NY, WA, OR, CA, MN, VT, and PA, the estate recovery laws are such that they do not recover ACA or for any non-long-term-care services.  Often, this was a change reaction to the ACA, done starting  2014, when the local press pointed out that much ACA coverage would be just a loan unless laws were modified.

They are trying to convince all who will listen that incremental is equivalent to being Republican. It's all really very sad."
2020-04-17 13:44:03,"I may not agree with all of his position, but Mr. Gates and the foundation is spending$ and effort to find a solution. I bet all these haters will be rushing to get the shot if proven viable. I am sure many don't see the irony in bashing someone using MS products..."
2020-04-17 13:44:06,"Much of the problem is that ANYONE can say ANYTHING on social media with no recourse, no matter how viscous and untruthful it is.
The nature of the internet is that it allows Lies to sit equally with Truth
We know Putin has an army of people doing this right now. Along with the various right-wing sources cited.
Snopes does a good job of trying to keep things honest but it requires effort and time.
So here's my suggestion: (to Mr. Gates or others in his field).--
We need a fully automated ""Truth APP"" that will automatically flag obvious lies. It could be set up to allow legitimate difference of opinion. But outright lies would be flagged in real time.
Any such APP would obviously need to be hack-proof and verified by some recognized standard committee. 
In my mind, this seems possible, useful and critical right now."
2020-04-17 13:45:19,"OK, I get why this might be a story.  Gates is powerful and makes news with his commentary and his Foundations's contributions.

But when the source of the criticism is Laura Ingraham, the anti-vaccers and Roger Stone, it simply becomes another right wing conspiracy diatribe.  

I would have liked to have seen a bit more information on the money Gates and his Foundation have contributed--GIVEN AWAY--for charitable enterprises that attack global health problems.  Included among those are contributions he has made recently in the United States to aid in the treatment of COVID-19 issues. 

Then, I would have preferred to see some analysis as to HOW GATES WOULD PROFIT from these contributions.  He has pledged to give away almost all his money and is clearly doing so.  How is he going to profit by aiding African nations in their response to disease?  What is his end game?  Power?  Fame?  There is no real answer from these conspiracy critics. other than he is making Trump look bad, and that in itself must be bad.

Why we continually give an audience to hit men without a true critique is not acceptable to me."
2020-04-17 13:46:18,"Medical personnel (doctors, nurses) have known for years that another pandemic like SARS was possible and would happen. Now we have it: SARS - CoV-2.  There is no conspiracy but there will always be the simple minded, the fearful, the crowd which disdains logic in favor of prejudicial thought. It is not just Trump acolytes, although they are vociferous in their praises of him an in their disdain for Dr. Fauci and Mr. Gates.  

The big blessings I see are: 1) Science and logic will win out, and 2) The daily Donald show serves to reinforce that he is not fit for the present job he holds. Narcissists usually are not well suited for positions of great power. It never turns out well. The after action reports will come some day and hopefully donald is long gone from the public scene and pack to building edifices of great wonder and beauty emblazoned with his name: Trump."
2020-04-17 13:50:05,"I am glad to live in Bill Gates's neighborhood. Last month, when there was no tests in Seattle- the Feds were saying there were tests but noone could get tested. Bill and Melinda Gates stepped up and gave money to develop tests for the citizens of Washington state and beyond.
I guess that's a conspiracy too. 
No good deed goes unpunished. At least not in today's America."
2020-04-17 13:54:09,"This is how having a president that fuels conspiracy theories and relies on the votes of those who ignore science and logic, can destroy our nation.  If we had a president who fostered collaboration instead of divisiveness, we would mostly be working together in the U.S. and across the world to beat this virus and get back to work sooner.  United we stand, divided we fall."
2020-04-17 13:54:12,"The conspiracy theorists including those mentioned in the article, conservative pundit Laura Ingraham and anti-vaccinator Robert F. Kennedy Jr., should be treated just like the delusional Alex Jones: close their social media accounts and de-platform them.  

Perhaps advertisers should maintain a blacklist of harmful characters (ie anti-science, anti-fact fake news creators and amplifiers).  If advertisers boycott their shows / sites etc then they will hopefully lose their ability to influence and mislead others with their fake conspiracy theories."
2020-04-17 13:59:47,"There was a time when Americans had common sense and were able to parse data and see if it made any sense with their common experience. Now we have delegated any analysis and judgement to talking heads and ""news"" profiteers.
We exercise little or no judgement and rush to conclusions and hold fast to them and refuse to refute them even when faced with incontrovertible data. The data then becomes ""fake"". 
On top of all of this we have religious zealots of all stripes holding forth based on theories that modern science has shown to be wrong or irrelevant. The only common factor is that all of this fed by organizations that have one main objective - make money from spreading disinformation and fear. 
Gun sales are up, ammunition sales are up, fear is everywhere and Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity are laughing all the way to the bank. Fox News and the Murdochs are rubbing their hands in glee. Talk and reality show hosts are becoming politicians (Dan Patrick in Texas is a good example) and furthering their own ends by spreading even crazier ideas.
Freud said that the sex drive is the strongest urge in a human being. Showing that one is right and all others are wrong seems to be even more powerful. If this is not a recipe for disaster, I don't know what is."
2020-04-17 14:02:22,"Despite the all the press conferences, tweets, and headlines, the US government is leaderless and rudderless on many issues of importance. 

I'm grateful to Bill Gates and governors like Andrew Cuomo, Jay Inslee, and Gavin Newsom among others for stepping up and trying to fill the void left by Individual 1's abdication of responsibility for taking care of the country and the people."
2020-04-17 14:10:18,"Are the negative comments directed at Gates bots or people who just want to yell? Unless the public space for the exchange of ideas is grounded in reality and fact, solutions and compromise to a situation such as this pandemic will be difficult to find. This space has it’s own peculiar virus now and will likely be with us forever. Another means by which those with selfish motivations divide us."
2020-04-17 14:12:52,"Look on the bright side.
These conspiracy paranoids are driving republicans away from the party.
Along with the flip flip president, there are surely less republicans now than there were in 2016."
2020-04-17 14:14:47,"What has happened to America that anyone who may disagree with our president, about anything, immediately becomes ""a target""?

Does the alt right really wish to squelch all free speech and debate in America? It's odd behavior for a group that continually rails about ""personal freedom."" Peel back the curtain and it's easy to see the trump right isn't about ""freedom"" at all - it's about control. It's like they missed the most fundamental civics and history lessons - the alt right doesn't seem to understand America at all.

Their ultimate (albeit often unrecognized) puppetmaster, Vladimir Putin, must be proud."
2020-04-17 14:18:52,"Anything complex or complicated is a target for mockery when it comes to followers of FoxNews. Any problem that requires heavy thinking is just too much for an audience that demands simple solutions, because supposedly back when America was great everything was so simple."
2020-04-17 14:20:40,"First, Laura Ingraham hosts a talk show; she is not a journalist.  She is fashioner of vacuous opinions and, as Plato taught, opinions are the lowest form of knowledge.  Second, why Robert Kennedy has emerged into such a medical conspiracy nut is beyond all levels of reason.  Third, why is there such a concerted effort to discredit honorable persons via the safety of social media.  Has this mode of operation become more popular on account of the example of the Twitter-in-Chief?   Last, there is no Fox News.  That term is a misnomer.  Fox is an entertainment channel, which spews nonsense.  Years ago there were warnings about Murdoch and his ways on there BBC shortly after the announcement that Murdoch was opening in America. No conspiracy theory."
2020-04-17 14:22:19,"These people, including the president, really do live in an alternate universe (I wish that were true literally, not just figuratively), where hunches, gut feelings and conspiracy theories take precedence over facts, data and science."
2020-04-17 14:25:45,"I feel like he will be a target of both the right and left.  Why is the guy who made Windows 95 supposed to be the person who saves the day?  Why do billionaires get insanely rich beyond any belief at the cost of our governments and then expect it all to be OK when they decide to toss us all a few crumbs later in their lives?

If these people have been paying taxes for the last 50 years we wouldn't need them in this way."
2020-04-17 14:26:31,"This is how humanity will die out.  It will be mundane, like the ""banality of evil.""  In this case, it will be the human drive to be RIGHT, which is apparently stronger (for some) than the human drive to survive.

We uninfected have been ceding control of our common fate to the 40% who are deep into an ideological reality distortion field  of ecstatic ignorance, fact denial, irrational priorities and paranoid anger. 

Hence, Fox News -- which is never held accountable for so often getting things WRONG while just stirring up fear and loathing  -- is most trusted by the 40%.  ""It tells me (them) what they want to hear"" (a quote from a ""conservative"" friend).

This critical mass of people have been infected, taught to be outraged by those who get things  more than occasionally RIGHT.  To these ideologically infected converts to ""alternative facts"" , there can be no actual expertise,  no actual ""facts"" or science-based evidence -only ""biases, prejudices, politics.""  

Hence, is it surprising that those who do actual research and actually get things RIGHTare attacked as ""haters"" who must have CAUSED the thing they predicted? 

Reality is taken as a mortal threat is it makes The DEAR LEADER and Fox News appear WRONG."
2020-04-17 14:27:00,It’s the deconstruction of truth that is the villain here. That campaign is being waged more from St. Petersburg Russia than from the offices of Bill Gates. Fight for truth and justice. That used to be our way.
2020-04-17 14:29:10,"This is not surprising. We must confront our own relatives coworkers and friends on this, those Republicans the are hurting, and make sure their anger has the appropriate target."
2020-04-17 14:30:04,Fortunately Mr. Gates does not and should not care about these lost and delusional souls and has both the privilege and the ability to keep on doing his work while ignoring their unlettered rants. I am glad our country has people like him.

Not entirely by themselves, but in recent times they’ve been the key force that’s done the hard last miles and driven a stubborn disease nearly off the face of the planet. Independent experts think the Gates Foundation has probably saved about 120 million lives to date. Bill is one of the few good billionaires. Who are these people?"
2020-04-17 14:36:11,"Most of those who are critical of Bill Gates can be written off as uneducated conspiritists who have nothing better to do. But Kennedy is not one of those, or at least I didn't think he was. However, his anti-vaccine crusade has me wondering. 
Fox news should be considered a threat to society. Their blatant disregard for the truth is in lockstep with Trump's view of the world we live in. If it goes wrong, the blame belongs to someone else. If it goes right, he is the hero of the day. 
The Gates Foundation has been doing charitable work around the world in its effort to combat disease. What has the Trump Foundation done other than purchase a painting of Trump with foundation funds?"

Unfortunately, like a virus, they have spilled into the mainstream, given that Fox News has numerous out of control presenters.  They have contributed to the current cultlike environment where you are either a believer, or you are the enemy.

Lachlan Murdoch of Fox News needs to step up to his responsibility, and disinfect the poison spewing from his powerful broadcasting network.  It is going to be hard enough to get through this pandemic without half the country believing that the other half is trying to use coronavirus as a malevolent reason to control them."
2020-04-17 13:53:23,"This should not come as a surprise. Trump both mirrors and exacerbates the hate and vitriol of his followers, and they in turn do likewise with him. They are all parasitic of each other, dependent on one another’s venom to sustain themselves. One by one we see this attempt to knock down those who speak and live truth to power, who are guided by science and facts as well as morality and ethics. Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates are the most recent targets. Who next? Our doctors and nurses sacrificing their lives to save ours?"

2020-04-17 13:49:26,"This is yet again this where the world cringes for the lack of adults in the room to point out how dangerous and ludicrous such conspiracies are, of how they play to even Putin’s desire to simply sow disinformation to further foster distrust in our governments. He may well not start such ridiculous theories, but he certainly knows how to propagate them online. This is where you want a leader capable of slapping a hand to a table and crying out, enough. Such talk is literally seditious in the midst of a world wide pandemic, for it most surely will get people killed, and we desperately need those that will call it out and not allow it to foster among our ranks. There is a reason we have different rules during war and strife to deal with looters and deserters very differently during such moments, because their actions get others killed."
2020-04-17 13:58:43,"Between this and what’s happening in Michigan it’s so clear the far right, fueled by Trump, have never been so committed in their bizarre disdain for science. They have deified ignorance completely, and unfortunately we all have to pay the price of living beside them."

2020-04-17 14:30:15,"The right will never stop in their quest to find new villains. Without villains, the Fox personalities and radio gasbags would have no effective way to boost ratings. In my lifetime, I've heard that LBJ secretly planned the assassination of JFK, seen the ""swiftboating"" of John Kerry, endured ""Whitewater"" coverage, read about eight GOP investigations of Hillary Clinton, watched the coverage of ""Pizzagate,"" witnessed the grotesque rumors pertaining to the supposed murder of Seth Rich. The list goes on and on and on. 

Since Trump became president, the list of villains has exploded. Biased  jurors and judges, rigged polls, ""diseased"" migrants, fake media, ""that woman in Michigan,"" China, state governors, George Soros, Anthony Fauci, the W.H.O. And, of course, always the Democrats and now Bill Gates. 

Who knows, maybe you and I are on the list somewhere. Even though we haven't done anything wrong, it may be that we just haven't looked with the same degree of scrutiny as our potential accusers. All we know for sure is that is never never them."

Critical thinking has left the planet..."
2020-04-17 14:29:53,"The real virus is rightwing media, unleashed by Reagan’s abandonment of the fairness doctrine, and now supercharged through social media. It’s always been true that a portion of humanity revels in conspiracies, trolling, hatred and spite, it's just never had the kind of access it has now to potentially infect so many minds so quickly. The only vaccine is more truth. Like “invasion of the body snatchers” the ones gone over, like Kennedy, aren’t coming back and will continue to infect certain vulnerable types, but for now anyway, it is a war of words. With truth, facts and accurate news coverage the only medicine we have."

America is a country of 350 million people. A significant, but smaller majority than one would hope, knows that this pandemic will change our lives beyond anything we imagined less than five months ago. Most Americans also realize that this virus wants to kill us. Most Americans realize the hard truth that they could, in a matter of days, end up in the I.C.U. saying our last words to the people we love over the phone right before the nurses insert a vent down our throats all because of a chance encounter with an infected person in the grocery store. Trump has failed badly. It is easy to be President when things are good. Things are no longer good. Things are terrible. The virus has exposed Trump like nothing else has ever done. He is a bombastic fool who has been overwhelmed by events. His followers will dwindle as the virus burns through our society. Come November every American will ask: ""am I better off than I was four years ago."" The answer is to that question is crystal clear."

2020-04-17 14:40:31,"Gates owns the Codex Leicester. Trump doesn’t read and likened Capt Crozier (who tends to lengthy sentences within lengthy missives), with Hemingway.

On the other hand, Bill Gates has put his personal fortune and reputation at stake to help solve this crisis. I think that tells you where the real leadership is..."
2020-04-17 14:44:24,"We  desperately need to understanding the need these conspiracy theories feed in the persons who embrace them.  It is easy, and wrong, to simply attribute it to ignorance and be done with it.   There is a  real ""need"" here, however irrationally desperate it may seem.  What is it?  What drives the need to believe?  

My mind points me toward a more general question, ""What is the need for  faith?""  We can then try to answer how, in some cases, the faith is so obviously  inappropriate to the need it feeds.."

If anything, one would think that medical expertise in the time of pandemic would be lauded, governors would be respected for their expertise, and our journalists would be praised.

But no, it appears we truly are living in a time of ignorance. Don’t these people think maybe, just maybe, Bill Gates and others who warned of the pandemic, would see there are people actually attempting to inform the public and keep them safe?

This is frightening. And we are to blame for underfunding our schools, poorly paying our teachers and forgetting that critical thinking is a positive skill.

Let’s shine a big light on these people, their motivations and who is backing them. And who is perpetuating this nonsense through cable news, talk radio, the Internet and conspiracy- oriented blogs.

And for those who continually tout personal responsibility, these actions prove it doesn’t apply to them. Only others.

For some reason, it feels good for those not curious enough to read and understand, to name a villain when things in their own lives are out of control. 

We need the sane voices to be just as loud. Let Bill Gates know that the majority are grateful for his Foundation and further more, despite his human flaws over time, his overall contributions to society."
2020-04-17 14:53:40,"Yes, perhaps I'm not serious enough about this story, but the people you write of are not rooted in reality. I'm trying to muster an accepting view of the facts as presented but they don't comport with any sense of reality. It's beyond that which one would be concerned about. It's the last gasp of sanity from a public following misled into a frenzy of fantasy as one person seeks to excite the rest in some strange ritual of tribal act to bring everyone together. Sure it's all baloney, but I wonder if the radical right has transformed from a previously serious sought after way of life to a way of self delusion to be happy."
2020-04-17 14:54:23,"To Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - perhaps you have heard the biblical expression: to whom much is given, much will be required.  You have been given a great name and much more.  You have chosen to use that name to be an anti-vaxer.  Fine - no issue there.  But in this case, if you have been paying attention to Bill Gates you would understand that his obsession with a vaccine is to address the fact that undeveloped countries do not have the health care systems that will be able to manage the impending southern hemisphere Covid crisis by smoothing the curve - or by taking the extraordinary actions of a Massachusetts General Hospital, for example.  Not vaccinating your own children based on spurious ""evidence"" is your choice even if it is of questionable ethics.  But denying the vaccine to the underdeveloped world is outrageous."

Beats me.  

For a scientist, that is a sure-fire way of failing quickly.  Nature does not look kindly on those who think they know better than nature does.  They are being sorted out in no time.  

Somehow, however, we have managed to set up an ecosystem on the framework provided by Facebook that allows these otherwise unfit individuals to survive and even flourish in an artificial environment.  

That is another powerful example of evolution in action.  Even though it will ultimately result in the overall failure of the species."
2020-04-17 15:04:12,"Y'know, one reads this stuff, and you just have to wonder how many right wing loonies there are out there. Bill Gates is a genuine self-made billionaire, not like this 'thing' we have in the White House. The latter had his initial fortune given to him, and he's really done a poor job with it. 
   Granted, Bill drove Micro-Soft with a firm, nearly iron hand as he built that company up to the international heavyweight it is today. I do remember his firm often referred to as the '900 pound gorilla in the room'. However, that's how success is done. He also did it with much government restrictions, laws passed to control business titans. He can easily be compared to and in the same classification, as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, JP Morgan, Henry Ford. All men that literally changed the world, and in the long run, much for the better. 
    He's also much like one of those titans of yore that I so admire personally, Andrew Carnegie. Whom we know, that after he made his enormous wealth, went about trying to give it all away. Andrew's only problem was, his wealth was so massive, for a while he couldn't give it away as fast as interest was earned on his wealth. He did much in building libraries, schools, concert halls and more. That was his thing. 
   In like turn, Bill Gates is following the same path, but his thing is world health. He's solid with the science, and we all know what happens in the world of disease without vaccines. Picking on Bill is ludicrous."
2020-04-17 15:04:28,Would like to see more of Bill Gates.  Have seen a number of  people finding Gates using a lot of his money to help people.  People like Trumps never use any money for them..

Is it the elimination of liberals and the educated?  Is it a purely white Anglo-Saxon society?  Who will be their leader, or are they anarchists who prefer no government with atomized leadership informed by folk truths?  Do they believe in natural law, and if so, what version?  And why does the New York Times, perhaps more than its peer media outlets, have such a morbid fascination with them?  I would hope that the Times and other outlets would demand answers to these questions, rather than serving as a megaphone for their demands and theories."

They are always, ALWAYS, aggrieved, and perpetually tilting at bizarre windmills of their own or others' fevered creation, egged on by irresponsible media entities like Fox and Rush Limbaugh who could give two rips about them and play them like cheap fiddles, and underwritten (as in Michigan) by amoral billionaire puppeteers like the Devos family (as in Betsy Devos).

The gratifying part of this is that they won't know what hits them when the the full weight of a majority of Americans  - who have had it up to their eyeballs with Trump, Republicans, and their know-nothing ""base"" - comes crashing down on them November 3, 2020."

Imagine hundreds of crazy people in an auditorium all starting with a few conspiracy theories until five or ten minutes later the whole darn place is yelling out their own theories trying to outdo each other with new delusions and reinforcing additions.

They believe in their infallibility, and they contend that the world owes them something. And like trump, due to their own skewed perception of reality, they cannot understand why they have no social mobility, why they haven't achieved the American dream, and why it must be someone else's fault.

In essence they are willfully ignorant, willfully poor, and they have to project their failures on those who have worked hard to not be like them."

2020-04-17 13:57:53,After reading this article as well as the ones concerning protests for reopening the country. I have come to the conclusion that the red states are going to open and I’m ok with that since they can have large gatherings and infect each other and cull the herd much like what they are protesting about mr gates. I’m not going to worry about my fellow citizens who feel that because they are not prepared for much of anything other than where they can get the next roll of toilet paper are having a difficult time or not. I’m certainly glad that my family ensured that I had enough to an education to understand that not everything is always going to go perfectly but that you can actually be able to survive with a bit of common sense and a little planning. I kinda wish I was younger because then I could do what the republicans will do.... begin buying up properties and businesses that are on the verge of failing due to the down turn from the virus.

But it is time for everyone to acknowledge the role this platform plays in the dissemination of false information and heresy and consider how their participation promotes such surreptitious activity.  Oh and by the way, Facebook does indeed censor information, but their censorship appears to be only targeted at information critical to their nefarious ways.  Several months ago, when I left Facebook, my last post included critical information of the company, including a NYT article about Facebook's refusal to pull the doctored video that made it appear that Nancy Pelosi was ripping up Trump's State of the Union speech while he honored the 100 year old Tuskegee Airman.

He was Bezos before Bezos, and was ordered by a Federal Judge to break up his monopoly.   He is evil to the core, but it is much more standard grift, graft, and corruption.  He is an enemy of both the left and right and humanity at large.  The conspiracy theories are nonsense and a distraction from antitrust crimes staring us all straight int the face, and a neoliberal winner-take-all philosophy and collusion with government (NSAkey) who then look the other way that set the stage for Bezos, Shkeli, and the other parasites who drain America's vast resources at put them into the hands of a few grifters and hoarders who do not have the intellectual capacity or ethics to use them properly."

It is  perplexing that they are not able to comprehend, or simply deny, how wonderful it is to have vaccines against devastating diseases.  Why would any parent subject their child to measles, mumps, or any other illness that can be prevented by a vaccine.  Many of these parents were vaccinated as a child and are blind to the suffering they willingly inflict on their child, or simply do not care.   I will I will never forget my mother's reaction when the polio vaccine became available.  The pure joy, and relief, she felt that day when her five children left for school knowing they would receive that vaccination.  

Why are people so willing to believe the most inflated and calamitous messages about vaccinations?  The hype of antivax pushed by an ignorant former Playboy Bunny, Jenny McCarthy.

Consider how Trump is confronting our global health pandemic:

- Blame the W.H.O. and cut off vital funding
- Blame and remove the captain of an infected aircraft carrier popular for standing up for the safety of his crew
- Threaten to fire Dr Fauci because he’s one of the few epidemiologists speaking truth to power in a time of mortal danger
- Blame China (a standard card in his deck of the “blame game”)
- Speak to lemmings with prolonged, incoherent daily briefings, evocative of a functioning stroke survivor rather than a rationally functional human being
- Immediately reject oversight and steal 25% of the ginormous CARES funding for purposes of self-dealing and favors (quid pro quo's, anyone?).

Unfortunately social media can spread disinformation faster that Covid-19 spreads.  And social media sites are reluctant to pull right wing nutjob disinformation because it is seen as politically biased.  The vast majority of anti-science conspiracy theories come from the far right and removal of false information therefore is politically slanted.  If they remove too much disinformation, then the CEOs of large social media sites get dragged to Washington to explain to the republican senate why they are disproportionately removing ""pro-Right"" posts."

What we are now seeing on the internet is foreign trollsters who sound exactly the same as they did against Hillary Clinton.  They are just substituting names.  Bill Gates could use some of that money to assist Democrats in sweeping the elections this fall.  What he is doing by contributing huge amounts of money to ""defeating"" this virus is, in many ways, enabling those who would defeat his purpose for the sole goal of enabling  Trump and radicalism.   The same goes for Soros who contributes large amounts of money to causes which dont seem to go anywhere."

The guy couldn’t tell you the price of a loaf of bread. Or a gallon of milk. I saw him fail that test on Oprah. His recent obsession has been vaccination crusading in Africa, to ensure that even more babies and children survive into a world of starvation and poverty. The ultimate in virtue signaling.

It is nice to see that having made far more money than he ever would need for the support of his family (for as many generations into the future as one can imagine) that he is now using those funds for the betterment of society.

That the right wing would attack him is unremarkable, because he is basing his philanthropy on science and rational thought, rather than on being committed to Alternative Facts that only hold true in some Alternative Universe.

What is the right wing going to do, take his money away?

I am sure that Bill Gates does not care at all what they say, but rather that they can go pound sand."

Had we had someone in the White House with the mental capacity and intelligence listening, the US would have been far better prepared. But the sad fact is, the narcissist shouts out ""I'm the King of this land"" and I rule all, except when he's looking for scapegoats, then everything is not his fault. It is beyond me how his supporters cannot see what's been right in front of them all this time, he is the biggest liar, and an ego maniacal nut job.

Public communications which support the genocidal delusional thinking of the nineteen forties in Europe and frankly Russia, is extremely unsafe, and therefore censored. 

Similarly, broadcast pseudo-journalism which persuades individuals to misunderstand every aspect of infectiousness of a virulent virus that the SARS-CoV-2 is, should be criminally sanctionable, in these United States. 

There aren't any first amendment rights to the spreading of dangerous beliefs in this time.  Sorry ACLU. 

The way Fox News has been conducting itself for the last four months, I think is criminal and the FCC should seek criminal charges against that entire broadcast for its dangerous politicizing of this epidemic, as a Right versus Left issue.  It's not. 

As for the aspersions lauded upon Mr. Gates, clearly, the Roger Stones and his like are ignorant of corporate medical teams. All US large corporations have local doctors with public health degrees.  Industrial medicine is practiced world wide.  They advise corporate execs. on pandemics. 

A former CEO of a global corporation would be thoroughly educated about epidemics, to protect its global employees.

It is inevitable that in a time of high threat and uncertainty that gullible people will look for available targets like Gates and Fauci.  The problem here is that there is a tendency to project on to these individuals a certain god-like quality.  Dr. Fauci, who without doubt is a great American hero, is first and foremost a physician scientist.  He has been very canny about his political beliefs and has been a survivor in the turbulent political environment of D.C. and the White House.  Gates is a billionaire philanthropist, who, after ruthlessly making a fortune, is now trying to redeem himself with charitable giving.  He is not an epidemiologist and yet the press seems to regard him as such.  He is not a prophet.

Throw in a lack of critical thinking and we have the ingredients for chaos. The Democrats would be wise to focus on transparency and a push for the truth moving forward. So many of us are hungry for the truth and long to trust our government again.

There is a traceable signature to the underlying instigators of Bill Gates' suffering.

Remember that the nation's Republican leadership vested in the Congressional leadership and ranks made a years long effort to repeal Obamacare over fifty times. They also effectively convinced the base to vote for them several times even though the Republicans promised to repeal that which would have saved their lives ultimately. The base actually voted to lose their health care after a years long media blitz by the Republican leadership.

Now the attacks are on a man who sincerely wants to save their lives. Imagine the incredible psychological techniques deployed by Republicans that would have done that.

Republican's fingerprints are all over this injustice directed at a man who wishes to save their followers lives. Imagine that. 

I point the finger at Congressional leadership behind this ridiculous abuse of their own followers that endangers them."

2020-04-17 15:32:21,"Facebook, more than any other social media organization, is knowingly propagating conspiracy theories by taking no responsibility for content.  Using algorithms does not abrogate responsibility.  I understand the impossibility of monitoring billions of messages but what they COULD do is: 1) require a user agreement whereby account holders warrant their identity and the truth of their supposedly fact-based posts, 2) have posts color coded for truth or opinion - which the user would have to choose before posting, 3) do random checks for identity and truthfulness of fact-based posts (hey, bet they can come up with an alogrithm for that!) and 4) flag accounts ""under review"" which fail the checks and delete accounts of repeat offenders.

Now for the far right to grouse about Bill's being aware of the threat of viruses to the world suggests to me the far right's IQ is on the far left of the scale - medium double digits."
2020-04-17 15:39:23,"Mr Gates has made himself more vulnerable by supporting digital identification, e.g in India for Aadhaar (he saw no problem at all with biometrics according to an Indian news report), and by his (foundation) support to the Identification for Development (ID4D) activities of the World Bank. Both examples show a, perhaps understandable considering his Microsoft past, seemingly boundless and naive faith in digital technology, in this case used for people to assert their identity. His foundation also displays a baseless faith in 'financial inclusion' through the use of digital identity. 

There is also Gates's investments in pharmaceutical companies, and creative constructions to use donations to such companies that bypass tax otherwise imposed. 

There's in my mind a lot of good that happens with the philanthropy of Gates, but it seems to me that he has brought that for a part onto himself. Other than that I don't think that anyone should be having the extreme wealth that he has."

By contrast, the Trump Foundation spent its charitible dollars illegally promoting Trump's presidential bid, paying off Trump's business debts and purchasing portraits of Trump for his hotels.  As a result Trump was ordered to pay $2 million in damages and his children (Don Jr, Eric, and Ivanka), who served on the foundation's board and oversaw all those illegal activities, were ordered to undergo training.

War, nuclear war, threats from North Korea, Russia, China, and the pandemics  are real threats but it is Trump's naiveté and ignorance that is the true threat. His lack of understanding, neglect, and willful inability to accept responsibility of his actions as well as his dangerous attacks on our enemies and on our friends as well as his know-it-all attitude about every topic is the greatest danger to our country and the governments of other countries.

Clearly, Trump is the true danger as everything he is or does affects the security and health of this country."

If you listen to most right wing outlets, disinformation campaigns are all the rage. These algorithm/big data led campaigns are more targeted and in turn more influential. It is how Trump got elected.
 Unfortunately, this type of phycological warfare isn't even considered by the public. It is and will continue to be used, without guardrails. We as humans have considerable weaknesses when it comes to being misled."

For, that is all they are. More voices shouting, as though their simply saying it makes it so. There is not a lick of thought in any of this.

He was completely  ruthless, violated antitrust laws, wrote contracts highly favorable to MS and forced them on his business partners, sued people who wouldn't cooperate, etc, etc. 

These aggressive business practices have made him an object of suspicion.   Is his foundation really a charity, or is it a continuation of what he did before in a new arena?   Yeah, he pals up with Warren Buffett to give away billions, but in the mean time they both get richer and richer.

The W.H.O made it clear that Covid-19 was going to be a bear to contend with.  Our President called it a hoax.  Pompeo continues to explore the possibility that a Chinese lab let the virus loose on the world.  Scientists have shown that most of the cases in the US originated in Europe.  Bill Gates has used to his fortunes to address ills of the world that require large sums of money.  Our President buys a painting of himself with his spare change.

As a licensed clinical holistic health provider, I have been horrified to see these vaccine/5G/Bill Gates conspiracies flooding into social media groups in my profession, which is majority progressive left. While many of us can easily work within traditions of healing and still respect and admire the advances of modern medical science, far too many others are showing an increasing resistance to believe any information that comes from ‘mainstream media.’

I’m afraid that the efforts to stem the spread of misinformation by Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter are simply being interpreted as more evidence of the intent to ‘brainwash’ the populace into being vaccinated. The presentation of facts seems to do nothing to change minds. The belief that all credible sources of information are beholden to billionaire interests and therefore without merit is impossible to shake."

Normally, we would pay little attention to the flat earthers except to pity them.

   ""The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices...to be found only in the minds of men.

In fact, we are struggling. Even the indigenous Amazonian could not escape from the transmission. Bill Gate is not a prophet or he portends. As a veteran in overseeing infectious diseases and their research development, he understands tremendously how the human races can be deeply affected by the problems and their hosts on wild animals. However, with a normal sense, infection or diseases are part of the co-existence. Since HIV, we have known that most often humans‘ conducts are the colossal reason. In line with conspiracy brainwashing, superstition and unscientific boasting on rare animals’ organ, body fluid or body parts treatments is found with grounds that this is how we got ourselves in the crisis. First of all, we need to focus not on bickering or conspiracy but we need to rethink of our behaviours. WHO has an explanation to do. Why did it deny the seriousness when the cases were already causing such a high rocketing sickness and death in Asia and Europe. I watched the press conference. Clearly, the WHO representatives were doubted by almost all reporters who were not health experts. They flagrantly insisted that no pandemic was concluded."

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given away $50 billion according to their web site. The good the foundation is doing, number of lives it has saved is incalculable. It is more than a shame that there are such ignorant forces at work doing the equivalent of standing in front of an ambulance trying to get to a sick patient in a dire emergency. Facebook and other social media should use technology to identify, arrest and convict these people and start putting them in jail where they belong. Then maybe we can put an end to this insanity."

They're pro-choice the same way pregnant women who insist on control of their own bodies are pro-choice. They're insisting the truth be told about the corrupt pharmaceutical industry railroading an excessive vaccine program for billions of dollars of profits. This has NOTHING TO DO with crackpot theories about Bill Gates inventing C-19. It's shameful to lump the two together.

I don't even want to hear about the ""right of expression"" or ""freedom of speech"" right now.  As a whole, this country is going to go through trials never before imagined and it will not take much to see events escalate and become very dangerous.

Sad, frightened, people who are unable to view a world beyond their local shopping mall and Main-Street Diner --

People who become threatened and fearful of anything which might upset and run contrary to their own comfort zones --

In reaction to that fear - they lash out at the perceived source of the intrusion - and apparently have no other useful manner with which to sopend their valuable time --

I've followed Bill Gates' efforts for a long time and have worked with some of his most recent technology ventures focused on sustainability. 

George Soros politically aligned himself exclusively with one end of the political spectrum just as the Koch brothers did. No issue, but they brought the backlash on themselves. 

Bill Gates has devoted his golden years to solving urgent global issues through a combination of philanthropy, science and technology. His solutions have cut across the political divide (just look at Gates Notes around nuclear power, clean water and CO2 emissions).

I tell my high school biology students the same thing every year; viruses and some bacteria are the things we should fear as predators to the human species.

“ In hard-hit states such as New York, although hundreds of COVID-19 deaths are still occurring daily, hospital admissions appear to have plateaued. Credit might be due to effective physical distancing measures that limit community mobility. But progress in preventing the spread of COVID-19 has come with economic havoc—at least 17 million Americans are unemployed, a number that could ultimately surpass the Great Depression, and take years to correct. A new impasse is forming around the Trump administration’s eagerness to boost the economy by lifting restrictions, just as mitigation efforts by the states are yielding results. The degree to which the USA stalled in taking aggressive action to curtail the spread of COVID-19 is directly the product of an administration marked by consistently poor timing, intent on making decisions in favour of economic interests instead of those that are guided by science and to protect health. The rush to reopen the country puts dollars over deaths.  The Lancet”"

2020-04-17 16:31:01,"Hardly surprising when 90% of Americans believe in a 'higher power'.
Like Alice's exchange with the Red Queen:
""Alice laughed: ""There's no use trying,"" she said; ""one can't believe impossible things.""
""I daresay you haven't had much practice,"" said the Queen. ""When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.""

2020-04-17 16:31:33,"An excellent article.  People like Ingraham and Kennedy, conduits of Putin’s regime, have spent their careers as asymptomatic carriers of the Russian misinformation germ, manufactured for the deliberate effect of destabilizing the American citizen’s faith in their democratic institutions.  

It is a necessary function of good citizenship for Americans to make an effort at distinguishing between a media outlet of a free society (albeit even the polarized extremes of a Fox News or a NYT’s) versus one like RT Network, a media outlet of a controlled society, whose sole purpose is to guide the Ingraham’s and Kennedy’s and the other Russian sleeper cells into amplifying outrageous mistruths by repeating them so often until it temps even the the casual, undisciplined observer into confusing it with mainstream news."
2020-04-17 16:32:25,"It sometimes seems like we are living in medieval times, in which superstition and overactive imaginations reign supreme. Historically, conspiracy theories have been especially comforting for some during times of fear, outbreaks of diseases and plagues, and social upheaval. If clear answers are not forthcoming during a time of crisis, storytelling (i.e., spreading conspiracy theories) helps some to feel more in control. The trouble is that all too often, such theories involve attacking someone. Someone must be to blame for all this terrible illness and death! Take your pick as to who that someone is."
2020-04-17 15:59:17,Stories like this make me almost give up on the human race.
2020-04-17 16:33:36,"Bill Gates is guided by a moral compass.  Those who attack him have an absence of morality in their DNA.

The absence of critical thinking and fact based analysis categorizes a fairly large swath of the American public.  There has always been this segment of the population, radical, extremest, prone to conspiracies and every manner of delusion.  The difference today, is the access to social media and every manner of internet access that enables fringe groups to find a platform and to disseminate their extremest notions that are then picked up by mass media and spread to the general population.  Without a platform, the widespread use of the internet by these groups and individuals they would not see the light of day.  What we are seeing is the underbelly of the internet where the downside  becomes more and more damaging to society."
2020-04-17 16:33:49,"I don’t vote republican, I despise Trump, I don’t believe in conspiracy theories.  As a research methodologist I am wary of funders.  They usually have an agenda they want to push.  It’s the reality for those of who depend on a paycheck from funders.  We may not fudge numbers, but we only answer specific questions, stop research that is not giving findings we like, reframe findings, samples are skewed with not many minorities, I mean I can go on and on.  

A clear example is the current study on the anti-malarial drug being trialed.  The RCT is conducted with some receiving the anti-malarial and other getting Vit C for prevention.  Why is the placebo not getting an inert substance?  The findings will probably go something like this: anti-malarial has no effects on covid19.  Well of course not when it’s paired with vit C which is also being used for therapeutic effects!"
2020-04-17 16:34:03,"Vaccinating your kids means admitting to yourself that your kids live in a dangerous world and for the horrors of virus's the only way we have to protect our children is to put them through the fear and pain of vaccinations so they can prepare their bodies to fight off these dangers. Parents that refuse the vaccinate their kids are making themselves feel better by not having to cause kids pain and by pretending that their kids are special ""with strong immune systems"" or ""eating organic food;"" lying to themselves that their kids won't get sick.  The graveyards of my childhood are filled with the bodies of children with ""strong immune systems"" as were the special ed classes with the deaf and paralyzed and brain damaged. This decision makes the parents feel better at the cost of their children getting sick."

2020-04-17 16:10:22,I bet a lot of folks who write such vitriol and misinformation are sitting at their computers waiting for their Covid unemployment and stimulus checks to arrive in their mailboxes.

2020-04-17 16:12:52,"And herein lies a powerful example of the errors perpetuated by Facebook, Twitter, and their like.  While they are ""fighting"" to quell the misinformation that riddles their sites, people are still allowed to cry ""Fire!"" without repercussion.  Zuckerberg and Sandberg have without question created and sustained a product that, despite all of its benefits, acts every hour of every day to erode public discourse and our democracy.  History will consign them to the ranks of the infamous ... they are no heroes.

One may also argue that one of the greatest other threats we face besides rampant pathogens and the prospect of nuclear war is the growing widespread menace of groupthink and brainwashing.  When entire segments of our society, and other societies, don't have the the wherewithal to challenge and stop extremist baseless nonsense, our way of life is threatened as much as it is by covid and bombs."

Lets not let the billionaires who support them off the hook either. Hear that Mr Koch, Ms DeVos, The Mercers. These clown complain about George Soros, his money is nothing compared to the influx of billionaire cash into the extreme right PACS."

Also, the author disregarded everything that was thrown at Bill Gates, but never gave any proof or evidence to the contrary.

This is simply an opinion piece at this point."
2020-04-17 16:26:57,"It is notable that many of the protesters in Michigan stayed in their cars and wore masks. They're not congenitally stupid; what they are guilty of is human nature. People are terrified & angered by both the loss of income and the virus.  People feel powerless. (The working class, to generalize, have probably felt powerless for some time, as evidenced by real factors: decline in wealth, increase in mortality.) Powerless people seek to find a reason for their distress, making them susceptible to conspiracy theories. Powerless people seek relief for their distress, a miracle or savior, making them susceptible to quack cures and public figures who act as if they have the answers. Given the wealth disparity and the influence of moneyed interests on public policy, the economic environment for the ""average"" person feels as out of control, random and chaotic as a mutating virus. To that is added the pressure of the American mythology that the individual controls their own fate and is completely responsible for their situation. While that belief, and its credo of effort leading to upward mobility, may have had some truth in the past (with the unacknowledged exclusion of certain groups), how can it apply now, when the recently legislated coronavirus financial assistance went overwhelming to the wealthy?"
2020-04-17 16:30:24,"Well, Dr. Fauci, his academic and professional credentials notwithstanding, is becoming a target.  He is being accused by the far-right of secretly shilling for the Democrats by destroying the economy to derail Trump's re-election campaign."

2020-04-17 16:11:30,"This is not rocket science. Trump has trained -- brainwashed if you will -- his loyalists to consider tolerating ANY negativity towards his positions -- no matter how rational (and indeed rationality seems to be the antithesis of Trump) -- to be a sign of WEAKNESS to be ""hit back at HARD.""

As dangerous as that is, it should hardly be unexpected."
2020-04-17 16:14:04,"It is disheartening that all the wealthy people whose consciences prod them to a genuine philanthropy, and who are great and deep thinkers are demonized by the anti-intellectual movement on the right and the Trump cult who bought his argument that ""only I can fix it.""

2020-04-17 16:21:03,"These people attacking Mr. Gates (and others) with their paranoid theories are a danger to all of us.  They need to be held responsible for their libelous behavior.

This paranoid theorizing is grandstanding as an attempt to gain more attention, and it *will* cause deaths.  Charges of criminally negligent homicide should be considered against those individuals who have promoted these unsupported paranoid theories."
2020-04-17 16:11:55,"Right wing “news” media and social media did not suddenly create angry, simpleminded people and mentally ill conspiracy theorists. They’ve always been with us. They used to be comparatively quiet, shamed by public opprobrium, and denied a voice by professionally staffed news organizations. Now they have direct access to self-published, unvetted messaging though the Internet, right wing news media serving the interests of the wealthy, and a loudspeaker in the White House broadcasting their message and inflating their impact. We need to find ways to silence them and shame them back into their dismal holes. Turning off the loudspeaker in November is a good start."

2020-04-17 16:20:53,"These attacks on science by some segment of humanity reminds me of the horrors of some of the ebola plagued nations in Africa.

There we see HEALTHCARE WORKERS, DOCTORS, MEDICAL EXPERTS, attacked, driven away, and often murdered by some segment of humanity living in that area. The murderers think the science community is there to harm locals.

C'mon America - we can do better than this right? Don't be part of the group who attacks the experts. It's ok to have been wrong. New data can help you make smarter choices in the future. But you have to admit and process the new data."
2020-04-17 16:04:35,"The right has used this tactic for decades, and under Trump, it has metastasized.  Attack anyone who disagrees with falsehoods.  Unfortunately, it works. The media must find a better way to combat this."

2020-04-17 16:49:53,"Even before the emergence of COVID-19, right-wing conspiracists were denouncing the existence of climate-change and evolution and, of course, the dangers of vaccination. What is it about science that so frightens them? Respect for science is an implicit respect for facts and reasoned argument which addresses the world as it is and undermines a nostalgia for the past. It is this yearning for an ideal past of white picket fences and stay-at-home mothers, of minorities knowing their places, of America unchallenged before Vietnam, 9/11, Iraq and Afghanistan which fuels this hatred of science. Naturally, because scientists have education and fancy degrees, they are easily lumped in with liberal elites who look down their noses at ordinary, ""real"" Americans. Then it isn't a big leap to see science as a plot to control these ""real"" Americans for the liberal elite's nefarious purposes."

The heightened profile our modern era of immediate media exposure affords likely encourages this mania. The truly frightening aspect of this phenomenon is the credulity of those who listen to this agitprop. At least in pondering this level of ignorance one can begin to appreciate the concept of infinity."
2020-04-17 16:19:34,there is no doubt Gates mental set is dispassionately skewed toward collections and control.  tbat is not freedom and helps no one except him and people that think like him.  not good.
2020-04-17 13:34:17,"Lets not forget that Bill Gates bullied the computer industry for 30  years.

Just cause he is rich doesn't mean his word means anything.

Remember he is a businessman.  He bought DOS from another company and sold it to IBM.  He didnt even create that.

I have never been a big Bill Gates fan.

He committed dozens of Antitrust violations and only got off when the Bush Administration dropped the Antitrust case against Microsoft.

Bill Gates has done lot of harm."
2020-04-17 16:53:44,"The thoughtful mind confronts the instinctive mind. Gates is the centrist politically but he thinks rationally. He is presenting the rational self interest perspective, the considered way to satisfy not just immediate needs but to incorporate future needs. The right are the base selfishness approach, grab what you need/want for yourself and then keep it to use only as you want—take the money and run. The right always needs help dealing with surprises because they are focused on present needs and don’t try to see what is going on further on."
2020-04-17 16:54:44,Malicious and false accusations have always been - and will continue to be - tools of manipulation. The number of citizens who believe such accusations is a measure of a society's wisdom.
2020-04-17 16:57:17,"So the booming national market in hate has a major new item flying off the shelves, a viciously distorted caricature of Bill Gates, a person currently doing more good in this world than almost all the rest of us. Many of the leading hate merchants are working hard to grow their businesses by taking raw inputs (like fear, now even more plentiful due to COVID-19; dehumanization of political opponents; and anger born of resentment), distilling them into bile, and promoting the product through social media as well as older channels like radio and TV. 

In a society where we indulge our greed by letting market values increasingly crowd out the sacred and humane values which have sustained us for millennia, social media are a reflection of ourselves in the marketplace of ideas. Along with reaching out to share our lives through these media, lots of us consume the agitprop that is the equivalent of bad fast food — greasy, salty, empty calories that feed our passionate need for connection but impoverish our souls."
2020-04-17 16:58:56,"With this article, I am getting to be convinced that Trump is more the symptom than the disease itself. The disease lies in a large population of people who can no longer distinguish fact from fiction and tribalism has trumped their common sense. At the same time, this group of people is abetted by snake oil salesmen and saleswomen in Fox News and even worse outlets who probably know better but pander to the Know-Nothings' fantasies because of power and money."
2020-04-17 16:59:18,"My cognitive dissonance knows no bounds of late. Add this to the list. After a career dedicated to using & promoting Free & Open Source Software (e. g., Linux) I find myself supporting Bill Gates.

Kudos to him for providing not only some of his incredible wealth, but also his wisdom and words, for the betterment of us all."
2020-04-17 17:01:00,"Sad to say, many folks are willing to ""suspend disbelief"" when stories give them a rush of adrenaline.  This means better fund-raising, more volunteering, and way more vitriol which is encouraged in a pure Mercantile economy rather than a Capitalistic one.

2020-04-17 17:01:20,"Determining the cause of the pandemic is an urgent objective. However, it would be nice if the right stuck to the likely, reality-based upon options of a natural species jump at the seafood market or, more likely based upon current evidence, an escape from a lab."
2020-04-17 17:02:49,"I worry about many things. These responses to Bill Gates makes we wonder how so many people in this country move through their lives without questioning, anything, without curiosity, and, it seems, without compassion. It's another form of deadly virus."
2020-04-17 17:12:07,"Some days, this being one of them, I can't really rise above the depression that follows seeing more examples of so many people buy into utter nonsense. I have no idea how to respond to or combat these flagrant divorces from reality. I just get stuck on the thought that civilization is racing backwards."
2020-04-17 17:12:31,"Truly astounding to see rightwingers (no longer actual conservatives) throw out their reasoning and good faith towards others (aren't they strongly supported by evangelicals?) to attack people like the Gates? People who have hearts for those living on the edge?

Logic and reasoning is no longer at the root of the division between Fox/Trump and their base and the rest of the country. A sense of humanity, or even spirituality now divides us. It doesn't take much to see where Trump and his followers go on this."
2020-04-17 17:12:44,"Why give Laura Ingraham, Kennedy, etc., more free publicity, such as in this article? 

Bill Gates doesn't have to prove a thing to educated rational people who can look beyond their own self interests. He has done more for the world's citizens than the rest of us will collectively ever accomplish - a million times over. Yes, he has the funds to do this. He also has a moral compass complete lacking from this president."
2020-04-17 17:15:37,"So sad that our society has so many deluded, gullible people lashing out at one of the truly bright lights of capitalism.  How many other captains of industry have given back like Bill Gates, only to be vilified for the effort by the likes of Laura Ingraham, etc.?  Certainly not the Trump family who were the primary beneficiaries of their own charitable foundation.

I won't speculate on why Trump needed clarification on HPV."
2020-04-17 17:18:04,"If Bill Gates wants to REALLY fix Trump's wagon, he should announce (and follow through) that ANYONE that Trump and the Trump campaign threatens to sue for ""defamation"" well get the best litigation attorneys in the nation, full time, absolutely at no cost to themselves, that he'll foot the bill!  He can extend it to the reporters Jerry Falwell, Jr. is trying to silence, etc.

That will stop Trump cold in his bullying efforts to stop people criticizing him, because they won't need to fear being bankrupted fighting him. AND those lawyers will definitely want to depose Trump!

Of course, Gates could sue Roger Stone, Laura Ingraham, Glenn Beck, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (what a disappointment he'd be to RFK) , et al for knowingly defaming him and the Gates Fund.  Turn it back on them."
2020-04-17 17:18:18,"If I were one of Mr. Gates' detractors, it might do me well to remember, I'm maligning a guy whose software enabled me to make the rant possible. (These guys all use Windows® right?)"

When it suits their agenda ..."
2020-04-17 17:21:27,"My great hope is that attacks on Bill Gates, and other current and future attacks on tech giants, will unite the tech industry and community to fight back against the cesspool of ignorance, hate and evil that has infected a big chunk of the online world.  Once that resolve has been gained, look for some quick and pervasive victories for truth and civility.  It will be an unfair battle when the true geniuses who have created computing and the internet harness up."
2020-04-17 17:22:13,"In a culture where freedom of speech and freedom of the press is revered, there is no natural defense against propaganda. 

Here's a question: what is the root cause of propaganda? Who initiates it and why? Can the perpetrators be found out, proven to be liars, and publically shamed? Somehow the fight against propaganda has to become more sensational than the propaganda itself. And a parallel question: why do people buy it? What makes them susceptible?

I fear that truth is no longer enough."
2020-04-17 17:18:43,"Before we despair - and there are reasons for despair - I think it instructive to keep in mind the role of nefarious actors behind such falsehoods: Russia and its army of cyber trolls, China, with its own army of trolls, and other such actors with avowed objective of sowing discord in democracies. Sure, we can blame the right-wing nutters (and God knows there are reasons enough), but these are clearly organised attacks (i.e. on Dr. Fauci and anyone else who makes a good target) by well-funded actors.

But, here's the thing, if we are in a cyber war (and clearly we are), why are we not retaliating  . . ."
2020-04-17 17:19:58,"Trump likes to boast of his intuitive-based genius. So too do many of us take pride in our intuition. It's easy to jump to conclusions that just ""feel right,"" especially when knowing an answer leaves us feeling a sense of self-assurance rather than the opposite. For many of us, it's easier to pluck the low-hanging fruit, no matter it be unripe, lack evidence and be of shallow thought. So too is it easier for many of us to jump on an ad hominem bandwagon attack on Bill Gates as a means of saving our sacred cow in the Oval Office."
2020-04-17 17:24:22,"Lies is not free speech. 
It this time to stop this and sue police power to force these person to either prove the truth of what they are saying or go to jail.

2020-04-17 17:27:54,"When this is all over I fear we will not be any wiser. This disease,  unfortunately affects some groups more severely than others. It affects the old and the people with high Blood pressure and Diabetes much more severely than others. I worry, if we as a society, make some people more dispensable and move on - a country without a soul! I always thought senior citizens were a power block of voters that can influence elections. So rise up! If you do not speak up now these demagogues will sacrifice you. This is an American plea! Not Republican or Democrat issue."
2020-04-17 16:35:05,I’ve not paid much attention to billlionaires-turned philanthropist articles as I fear they reinforce the idea that infrastructural issues are best solved by individuals rather than government.

I can only think of that old expression “Never let a good deed go unpunished.”

The more dangerous pandemic, though most Americans appear to be immune, is the misinformation spread by the know-nothing right wing in our country.  They seem to genuinely value being ignorant and embracing conspiracy theories despite any evidentiary basis to support them.  

Their success in sewing doubt and falsehoods into the American fabric has lead to the most ignorant, mean-spirited and dishonest individual in American history occupying the Oval Office (although it is again worth noting that 3 million more people voted for his opponent than for him).  And frankly even more concerning, a base that revels in its own ignorance and cruelty.  

What happens to the soul of a society so infected by such deliberate misinformation, seemingly more focused on disruption that accomplishing any meaningful good?  If unchecked, it will destroy our common link to one another and turn our nation into a dog-eat-dog perdition where kindness symbolizes weakness and trust merely demonstrates the need to be exploited.

The difference is that Mr. Trump cannot admit he is wrong, he needs constant attention and he lies constantly.  Mr. Trump has not influenced society for the good as Bill Gates has.
Were you to look at Bill Gates history, you would find that he has influenced the world in a positive way with his company Microsoft.  Bill Gates also has given away billions to charities, tells the truth and is a learned person.

You couldn't ask for a more perfect target. 

Additionally, not only did his money buy him direct access to the WHO, it also bought him access to the Obama administration to implement standardized-test-based policies.

But SARS Cov2 has other unique attributes; especially pernicious is the ability to infect without showing symptoms.
Very stealthy; unnaturally stealthy. HIV stealthy.

SARS Cov2 is a clear improvement on the SARS coronavirus that reared its ugly head back in 2005? in southern China; the one that quickly killed hundreds. It killed so quickly that it was able to be identified easily and contained; once the virus met its host, the host succumbed; now novel Corona Virus hangs out and grows, and in 100% of the sailors on the Roosevelt that tested positive, 65% are asymptomatic. 75% of these infected will eventually show symptoms. They shed the most virus spores 2 - 3 days before showing symptoms. It is a super-spreader.

Can Bill Gates profit from making a vaccine? Who knows...But HIV has been studied and a vaccine has not been found for it.

One report early on reviewed early insights noticed by scientists looking at the genome when it first was released and notice that SARS Cov2 has 4 segments in its DNA chain that appear to be identical to HIV DNA. Until this is figured out, a vaccine will be elusive."

2020-04-17 15:20:18,"The conspiracy nuts are just jealous that Bill Gates actually gives away more money to charitable causes than their cult leader's entire net worth.  They are jealous that a REAL businessman, who built an empire from the ground up, is also a progressive."
2020-04-17 15:23:12,Another instance demonstrating how decency and integrity in America have been ransacked and gutted by the sound of mad dogs barking.
2020-04-17 15:36:20,Stuff like this only makes those silly folks on the right look even sillier.   It’s hard to take these conspiracy theorists seriously.   The dumbing down of America continues.
2020-04-17 15:56:31,"Maybe I’ve missed the stories or maybe there was nothing to report back then, but since Trump was elected, the U.S. has become a bit of a cesspool with an increase in conspiracy theories, hate crimes, and other acts of despicable behavior by humans. I don’t know if our country will ever recover from this. Yes, there were plenty of conspiracy theories re. 9/11, but this is a higher level of stupidity, fear mongering."
2020-04-17 16:01:31,Bill should direct his programmers to track down each one of these pyscho's and render them impotent by shutting them down. The ignorance they promote is as dangerous as the disease.
2020-04-17 16:08:04,"Every single American who voted for a presidential candidate that went on Alex Jones' radio show and told him ""your reputation is amazing, I won't let you down"" shares the blame for this. 

Every single American who voted for a president that welcomed QAnon lunatics into the Oval Office shares the blame for this. 

Every single American who shared or believed a viral message about anti-vax, or Pizzagate, or Jade Helm, or Crowdstrike, with zero evidence that would pass a sane person's laugh test, shares the blame for this. 

But most of all, the leaders of the Republican Party -- who welcomed paranoia, the death of facts and data, and the destruction of American institutions, because they thought it benefited them politically -- own the blame for this. 

In a time when public health demands a citizenry that knows the difference between madness and science, thousands of deaths will be on their hands. (I'd say ""on their consciences,"" but I know better.)

2020-04-17 16:13:27,Seems like a second Dark Age. Up becomes down. Left becomes right. There is never any argument against stupid. Bill Gates should be lauded as a hero as he speaks up against the fool who is the king of the fools. Thanks Mr. Gates for being a voice of reason in unreasonable days.
2020-04-17 17:02:21,"It is as if the far-right shares the same brain but only one member can use it at a time. 

It is inconceivable how these folks can be so willfully ignorant and so incapable of learning anything.

2020-04-17 17:50:32,"I doubt this post will make it to print, but one can only hope that those who think viruses and vaccines are hoaxes are the first to suffer the ultimate irony  that such a position makes likely. 
People who are stupid enough to doubt the science and say ""liberate Michigan"" or ""don't vaccinate your children"" deserve what fate has in store for them; sadly, though, their hubris will involve much collateral damage for us all.  
That a site like Infowars still even exists is shameful and says much about how gullible and self-destructive some of us can be; and as for someone like Roger Stone, why can't he just shut his mouth and serve his time?"

2020-04-17 16:15:31,I would like to see Jerry Hall and her children stand up and make Rupert Murdoch more responsible.  Stop inciting hate and fueling mistruths and anger.  They have a responsibility to society even if they don't know it.  Fox News is a dangerous tool in this hate incitement machine.
2020-04-17 16:29:39,"Bill Gates, a billionaire who really made his wealth by not cheating, by his talent and hard work, to make our lives easier and more productive, is now being blamed for having ulterior motives for having called our attention to this viral pandemia. As to why some of us believe more in lies and conspiracy theories is beyond belief; indeed, stupid beyond measure. No decency here, in listening to those in the know, based on the facts, the truth, reality as is? Utterly shameful to try to destroy somebody's integrity, in a totally baseless fashion."
2020-04-17 17:06:13,Bill Gates created the COVID-19 virus?  Well now I’ve heard everything.  Time and time again during this crisis I find myself asking how and when America got so stupid.  Was it always like this and I was in denial or oblivious?  Or have large swaths of the population simply sunk to new lows of dumbness over the past 15-20 years?
2020-04-17 17:10:02,"What the lunatic fringe, who think that the coronavirus is a hoax, or purposely spread by Bill Gates, do not realize is that there is another real virus infecting a tragically large part of our population. It is  one that has infected their brains.
It evolved from the tea party virus, that ravaged our country over  a decade ago.
If they ever realize that they have it, maybe they can blame Gates for that one too."
2020-04-17 15:46:55,"I've often thought that the only thing that has really changed in 6000 years of civilisation is the technology. People are essentially as smart or stupid as ever they were, and easily led by the nose."

Does the conspiracy crowd address these questions...
Who donated the most money to Covid19 research or charities.. Trump Foundation or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?   Whoops... is there still such a thing as the Trump Foundation or did it officially die when it was fined and exposed as a tax dodge? 

Have any of the Bill Gates accusers..e.g.,Robert Kennedy Jr., Roger Stone and Mr. Trump ... published in a peer reviewed medical journal as did Mr. Gates (e.g., New England Journal of Medicine)?

What tiny fraction of his supposed wealth has Mr Trump (all of his relatives, Roger Stone, INFOWARS and the others) given to accredited charities... or covid-relief... in the last year? The answer is zero but feel free to make up facts that you like."

2020-04-17 17:32:53,"The fact that there are even ""NYT Picks"" in regards to the comments section so blatantly reveals that information, whether we know it or not, is consistently filtered by a hierarchical structure which values ""certain"" information over truth. The views of the writers at the NYT might vary differently than those in Nigeria. Blending righteous anger and action from those who have been hurt by people like BIll Gates with right-wing extremists is one way to completely eclipse their existence. Stay awake to the positionality of each writer, news source and organization, and the tendency for one to be exalted above another."
2020-04-17 15:49:41,"Only a media desperate for advertising dollars would publish this obviously anti-Trump lunacy.  I'm sure you could find similar claims about the media darling Kennedy, but they'd never get published."

Or maybe I'm just one of those idiot ""sheeple"" that the peddlers of implausible conspiracies laugh at in their online forums."
2020-04-17 17:20:24,Bill Gates when he ran Microsoft was an alpha male super predator. Hope this gets him made enough to do something about it. Trumpies should not kick wasp nests.

2020-04-17 18:01:09,"This uproar is not really about Gates; its about Right-Wing efforts to disrupt and undermine the safety and security of America. Nothing they're doing or saying aligns with making America great. Their efforts are intent on damaging, tearing down, and destroying America's ability to function well in a crisis. No patriot would do that, ever. So who are these people who align against us really working for? Clearly, not America. And it appears from many indications, neither is our current POTUS."
2020-04-17 18:02:32,"Bill Gates (who has spent vast amount of his fortune for public good, who has committed to donating most of it after he's dead, who has recruited a big list of other wealthy people to do the same) represents the noblest side of humanity; his hateful naysayers represent the basest side. 
The two instincts have coexisted within humans since the very beginning and pulled each of us this way or that. Sometimes it's a miracle that we are not already doomed. How to be more like Bill? For one thing, look to the light rather than down the abyss."
2020-04-17 17:58:45,Disgusting. Bill Gates isn't a saint but this constant desire to demonize people with the most outlandish theories as pure evil. Very tragically typical of authoritarian supporters and regimes.

2020-04-17 18:03:02,"Another example of the monsters among us. We have taken the time to read the history of those who pioneered vaccines, and so many of us would not be here now had it not been for those who found a way to keep us all alive. Now we need to find a way to thrive as well, and it's not going to be based on the monsters among us. We wish Mr. Gates and his efforts the very best, with gratitude."
2020-04-17 18:04:01,"I know this is awful, but when the anti-Gates folks refuse to get vaccinated and nature takes its inevitable course with them, I won’t feel particularly sorry.

I just hope that innocent bystanders don’t get caught in the backwash, and when a vaccine is offered, I’ll be first in line (after the health-care workers, the essential front-line workers, and the people with underlying health conditions get their doses, of course)."

Where are people now getting the information on which they ACT?  And how -- in this campaign year and in the year(s) of coronavirus - do we ensure the public has authoritative information?  That is for the Bill Gates, and the Michael Bloombergs, Zuckerbergs to sort out - now.....they have the resources and staff with the knowhow to make a difference."
2020-04-17 18:06:14,"Of course the right will come after him....just as the left comes after conservatives.  ""Move On"" is a perfect example of the latter.  It's politics.  We should not make a big deal about it.  I will remind the Dems that Bill Gates is one of the 1% that Bernie and Liz have no tolerance for.  He's very philanthropic, but he's still obscenely wealthy and progressives and Dem Socialists don't want that....is he one of their exceptions?  Therefore, I find it ironic that the Dems are so upset about this."

One is Covid-19.  

The other is the epidemic of epic stupidity that has long plagued large portions of the American population, led to the election of Trump, and seems to be culminating in a denial not just of science but of reality itself—replacing reality with ludicrous fantasies and moronic conspiracy theories.  

It’s hard to say at this point which of the two epidemics is more destructive to the nation."

As a physicist, ""theory"" has a definite meaning: an idea or concept that satisfies all known facts and laws, etc., and has predictive capability for yet unmeasured facts or laws.

In popular usage, ""theory"" means ""iffy"" and not really solid in any way.

So, let's start using ""conspiracy fabrication"" because that's what we are really talking about with these totally unsupported, even counter factual, claims."

How could they believe that their president didn’t know about the pandemic until mid March?  They, like he, are peddling false information that is dangerous to our society.

During the decade during which computers appeared on every white collar worker's desk, productivity grew about 0.5% more slowly each year than in preceding or following decades.  That is a net loss of about 5% in gross national product ($1 trillion per year), which cannot be made up.  People spent time trying to make the software (on which he had a near-monopoly) do what it promised to do, but didn't do, beginning with contending with the ""blue screen of death"".  This took time away from their real jobs."
2020-04-17 18:35:41,"Wow, Gates is giving massive dollars to help the world here. 
He already has way way more money than he will ever need.  I guess these conspiracy folks also reject fossil evidence of evolution, so evidence is not part of their approach. Why any US voter believes them is hard to figure out.  Next time these folks go to the doctor, will they say ""don't rely on scientific evidence in choosing my treatment, just use what most people on the internet think is best""?  Where the rubber hits the road, I bet they choose evidence. But what they don't realize is that their rumors here will hurt others or maybe even their own family."

2020-04-17 18:50:36,"In my long life I've had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Gates twice, in Albuquerque and almost 20 years later in Redmond. His intelligence was evident in his attention to detail while maintaining focus on the larger goal. He achieved every objective except a popular smartphone. The firm he started and products MSFT develop employ millions and millions, when you look down from ISS at earth. Since he and Melinda turned their focus & resources on global health I have been deeply impressed at the number of lives improved and saved and I still am."
2020-04-17 18:51:40,"Since Trump's logic trumps everyone, we should request he create the most beautiful, bug free operating system the world has ever seen. When we get the orange screen of nonsense, we can blame it on Intel for not knowing how to flatter his code."
2020-04-17 18:52:37,This is Cyberwar and Bill and Melinda Gates should retaliate with facts and outrage over these accusations.  Staying silent is not an option. I would launch a daily twitter response and updating as often as possible.  Twisting facts and creating a new reality is what the alt right have been doing to grow and control their base.  Gates needs to twist the facts back into shape.
2020-04-17 18:56:15,"Bill Gates billionaire status is for me a problem, but despite this  he has decided to commit the majority of his wealth to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to help humanity. He deserves great credit for this because not many  of the ultra wealthy are committed to using their wealth to focus on healthcare and other philanthropic projects to make this world a better place.
I recently watched a Netflix documentary  about Bill Gates and I was really impressed how he immersed himself in facts, evidence and obscure governmental reports, so that he was fully appraised of all aspects of the projects he was working on with his foundation.
The appalling people who attack Bill Gates regarding his views on Trumps failure to handle the COVID-19 epidemic, and his work on vaccines are profoundly ignorant in contrast to Bill, and ultimately their illogical and anti-science views will lead to their demise. If you do not protect yourself with logic and science then you are left with purely Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory of the survival of the fittest,  and the odds of just relying solely on this at this present time are not good."
2020-04-17 19:00:56,"The real conspiracy is funded and supported by the right wing media and its supporters. Keep people mired in anti-science to exploit them globally. It got Trump elected. So you can manipulate the mass of ""undereducated"" people. It works. It keeps people against policies which would benefit them economically and in terms of their own health and upward social mobility. Too bad a lot of us ""educated"" people are being dragged down and exploited along with them."
2020-04-17 19:05:43,"I just want to say, the misinformation isn't limited to the right. For example, there was an effort recently in this paper to portray the coronavirus as originating from Europe rather than China. A lot of liberal readers seized on that narrative and started deluding themselves that the virus didn't originate from Wuhan China, and their comments were highly recommended. In truth the article was that a mutated version had originated from Europe, not the original version."
2020-04-17 19:09:20,"When a government fails in its duty to the foundation of its culture, the family unit, generations of inferior citizens who are more emotionally reactive than logically and rationally engaged, are the result.
 
We Americans work hard and deserve healthiest, best and brightest citizenry on the planet rather then the illogical, irrational, emotional sector of poorly parented, unhealthy, poorly educated, mediocre citizenry that results from governmental neglect of the family unit.

Why did this occur?  When a government itself becomes greedy and serves the privileged few rather than the citizenry, tyranny is the result.

We have all taken oaths as American to fight all Tyrants both Foreign and Domestic. I regret to inform you that domestic tyrants rule today in Washington D.C. and that it is every citizens patriotic duty to overthrow this Tyranny.
 
There are many way to overthrow Domestic Tyranny. Let our efforts begin with our votes this November and continue to reinforce our governing Constitution in such a way that thriving and healthy families are the rule at all levels of American society."
2020-04-17 19:20:31,"I urge all who doubt Mr. Gates' goodness to pass on the vaccine once it's developed, as the vaccine will contain tracking devices and mind control devices. Not even aluminum foil beanies will provide any protection!"
2020-04-17 19:23:33,"Freedom of expression is a fundamental pillar of our democracy.  But misinformation from right and left are a great curse, amplified by the media bubbles associated with internet age.  Some countries try, but no one has developed a way to define and root out misinformation without undermining press freedoms, so I think we have to live with this.  It raises the question of education, however.  Why do so many Americans fall for obvious conspiracy theories and faked ads, or spread misleading memes?  A healthy democracy depends not just on freedom of expression, but quality education including critical thinking skills.  I am convinced there are still enough critical thinkers that Mr. Gates will emerge with his reputation enhanced."
2020-04-17 19:24:08,"Bill Gates words were relevant to the work the Bill and Melanie Gates Foundation does.  They are dedicated to fighting disease, and donate millions to that cause.  

Trump can't stand anyone else getting applause.  I wouldn't be surprised if he started the rumor himself."
2020-04-17 19:26:22,"What is left? What is right? There is only One. This One is but Oneself. Oneself seeks nothing but Love in its illusory otherness for the sole purpose to escape loneliness. We are but One, we are but One and Love is all that matters quite literally so. Love is all that matters... all that matters is Love."
2020-04-17 19:27:37,"I hope Mr. Gates spends a significant fraction of his wealth assuring that November's election goes to Democrats across the board. Really, this is more important even than beating COVID-19 in the near term."
2020-04-17 19:28:56,"People have lost trust in those institutions that were traditionally upheld as the standard-bearers of truth, such as the media, politicians, higher education, etc.
Couple that with the over-reliance on digital media, screens, social media, and the substitution of news with digital infotainment, and it's like fertilizer to conspiracy theories."
2020-04-17 19:30:40,"Bill Gates did not create this virus but as billionaire I resent his statements supporting the WHO. I pay taxes too, he can donate to the WHO if he chooses but why am I supporting it and who is he to tell me I should do so?

All of the warnings the WHO sounded in January were too late and because they opposed travel bans meaningless. Israel adopted strict travel bans, quarantines, and trained medical personnel (Palestine personnel as well) in early January. If you extrapolate their 13,000 cases to our population we’d have nearly 800,000 cases.

China became aware of new viral infections in early December and tried to suppress news. This is when the WHO became aware but they were complicit in China’s denial. They repeated fallacies pushed by the Chinese government such as it couldn’t be transmitted from human to human.

So tell me Bill, what is the WHO doing for America? Vaccinating Bangladeshis for polio is laudable, but not if when it comes to my health they choose to be deferential to China. Let Bill pay to vaccinate Bangladeshis-I choose to have my tax money spent on America’s health.

The WHO spends an enormous amid time condemning Israel’s health system without cause and like the UN is beholden to dictators.  The WHO is silent about the reopened wet markets and China’s lies about their infection numbers.

I enthusiastically support the President’s decision to withdraw funds from the WHO and I resent Gates’ lectures about where my tax dollars should be spent."
2020-04-17 19:36:29,"Businesses must realize by now that a corrupt government is much worse for business than slightly higher marginal tax rates. But then again, how much should we bet that big businesses will actually come out ahead after this crisis?"

They've been saying we have to reduce restrictions and get back to work for about a week.  It's hard to know if the purveyors actually believe this stuff, or whether it's just a way of casting doubt on liberals and helping the GOP in November  It doesn't matter--the effect is the same."

Since retiring he concentrated health issue and donating to areas that benefit the needy. By way of his actions Trump is appalled at the thought of doing such things? The poverty rate here is about 10%, that's about 35 MILLION people. What does Trump do, he cuts rations and benefits of the poor and needy.  Essentially stepping on their collective throats.  Trump couldn't be more in the dark if he were on ""The Dark Side of the Moon""  (Yes, most people have had issues with Microsoft produces) That said, exactly what has Trump done???  He rolled back air and water standards which allows auto companies to pump more toxins in the air and water.  Who closes a casino? TRUMP!  Why was that? no one show up? perhaps mismanagement? Most civilized countries do business with him strictly out of necessity while holding their noses.  I could see Trump yelling, ""NO, you can't have more porridge"""
2020-04-17 20:04:36,"It's amazing that anyone who publicly critizes, or is seen as possibly criticizing, Trump is immediately set-up as a traitor to the country and false information is spread about them. First Dr. Anthony Fauci and know Bill Gates, of course there have been numerous others. What about all the things Trump has done that has hurt this country like the disbanning of the Global Health Security and Biodefense unit, responsible for pandemic preparedness, and the lack of response to the pandemic. All he seems concerned about is his ratings and talking about how great he is. And FOX New certainly doesn't help any, catering to his every whim and spreading false information themselves. I find it absolutely disgusting how they pander to him.

I'm a Republican and I'm ashamed of the Republicans we have in office today. We need new leadership in Washington. Leadership who will take responsibility for their actions and not be afraid to call out the actions of others in a professional and respectful way. I applaud the way the governors have been handling this crisis."

With every additional intelligent leader that they attack, they are showing their increasing fear of being defeated in November. Fear and anger define them and with Hannity, Limbaugh, Franklin Graham and the truly frightening Dr. Robert Jeffress, the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas as their leaders, they will lose because intelligence beats hypocrisy, and it has never been more apparent than now."

I think the fact that these odd widespread conspiracy theories and enormous amounts of what seems to be uneducated folks are truly the undoing now. What do we do about this? I think should be the question. How can we live as a Country like this?"

2020-04-17 20:38:42,"Sure, sure Bill. Per your op-ed in the WAPO states the entire US needs to shut down. That must be easy to say for a billionaire who can sit back and watch the next great depression x 10.
Other countries have shown that by distancing and thorough testing an entire country does not have to shut completely down.
People don't seem to understand that the entire country of China did NOT shutdown. Not even before the peak.

What this country desperately needs is a complete infection and antibody testing for all with reliable tests. The current testing has a 30% margin of error. 30%! 
Only when these tests are done effectively can we know the full picture of pandemic.

If the tests for infection and antibodies finally happen, what is the public reaction going to be when, say 60% of the country find out they have already had it? All the jobs lost, economy wrecked only to find that the fatalities happening now are and outlier of the virus and the R-naught is less than 1. The public response won't be pretty 

You can't have an accurate model and projections if you don't know the true R-naught factor and how many have already had the virus. All these projected death tolls are based on an incomplete model but they are scared no one will listen to the advice.

But how scared are some people? Not very. A friend who is an RN heeded the call to help out during the New York build up. She's still there. To help? No. She's paid $10,000 dollars a week for her service. This hero."
2020-04-17 20:41:17,"Such a sad sorry situation for what was at one time supposed to be the greatest country on earth. No longer. A divided bickering small minded nation.

Lies are a funny thing: They only work for awhile.
Take Trump, for example.
In just 4 years of having to listen to him, most of us no longer believe a word he says, if, indeed, we ever did in the first case.
His first lie he told after announcing that he was running for President was to deny that he had hired real actors , at $50 bucks a whack and a free t-shirt, to hold signs claiming they were real Trumpers.
For most of us, that lie was that, the end of a very short relationship.

But his real followers didn't care that he was a liar.
They like telling big ones, themselves.
Daily.
On any subject.
The more far-fetched, the better.

Do I like the Gates Foundation?
Nope.
I see it as a failure of our tax system.

But a bigger failure of this nation are the Kennedy's, Ingraham's, the Roger Stone's, sly folk who make their living off the product of bile, spite, lies and sneers, and never pay taxes.

Thanks for this article, NYTimes - expose them.
Don't ""normalize them"" as you have, in the past, begged us, your readers, to let up on Trump's lies.

Never.

2020-04-17 20:16:50,"These people would be better off using their brains to come up with ideas for a cure. Perhaps common sense or scientific investigation of what actually exists is too much work?
 But I have to say that this is the sort of epistemological thinking that computers have convinced people is the way to arrive at truth: binary logical thinking is the way we achieve it. 
But if your premise(s) are false or inconsistent, in logic, you can prove both truths and falsehoods and still have a valid argument. 
Computer theorists, like Bill Gates though, know that ""Garbage in; garbage out"" Just running a program won't  yield something useful.So you need something outside of the system to validate its truth. Like real world data and facts.
Conspiracy theorists pay no attention to this. They just build baroque logical structures based on questionable, often false, premises. The results are systems as far removed from truth as they can get but they applaud themselves that they have somehow arrived at it."

The other side wants you to stay the heck away from them until there is a vaccine, while holed up working remotely, if take-out and Amazon is still delivered. 

We have two Americas now. Climate change or Covid, it is the same, Red vs Blue, we stay with our side. 

But maybe this pandemic plays out and changes things.

Short of WWIII or Aliens invading it is hard to fathom some event that could possibly convince the other side they might be wrong and bring the country together again, but this might do it. 

Liberals and Conservatives that occupy the middle 80% of this country will look to science and facts and data to fix this problem... eventually.

 With 1% of Americans tested so far, the facts and data are not in yet. So why is anyone looking to open things up again? It is easy to see who is betting with your life these days America.

Then they started calling for old people to sacrifice themselves for the economy. Then they obsessed about and demanded everyone focus on a useless drug they knew nothing about. Now they're defunding the WHO, bashing Europe and spreading hideous lies and conspiracy theories about every serious person working to help society, from Bill Gates to Anthony Fauci.

At what point can we openly start talking about this movement being a fifth column in the human species, without being accused of being ""mean"" and ""partisan""?"
2020-04-17 19:29:26,Only in America gets someone attacked who has spent his fortune literally saving thousands if not millions of lives and improving the lives of others. How sick has this country become?
2020-04-17 20:30:07,Trump has green lighted fantasy thinking and conspiracy theories so this is no surprise.  I hope the next occupant of the White House brings America back into reality.
2020-04-17 19:15:44,"It takes only two things to get to the top of the right wing crazies' paranoia list, like Gates and Fauci:

1) Say something negative about Donald Trump, or that might be seen as negative about him, or that might contradict what Trump said;

2) Do some good in the world.

If you want to know who the good people in the world are, just look at who Trump attacks."
2020-04-17 20:02:17,"It's hard to believe that US citizens believe these ridiculous conspiracy theories. Are we sure this is not another contribution from Trump's pal Putin?

2020-04-17 20:33:49,"Many young Americans have lived their entire lives in an alternate universe of video games, snarky cartoon shows, dystopian movies and memes, and authority figures whose political correctness denies human instincts. No wonder they reach a point where they will believe any sort of ridiculous garbage, and given the opportunity, lash out at a major public figure like Bill Gates. This is the world we live in today. A world where, in the middle of a global pandemic, every thinking individual has to become an expert in epidemiology in order to feel secure about their survival. There is no center, no reliable source, no extensively researched analysis which cannot be questioned. Welcome to the 21st century. It is going to be a wild ride!"

No school in almost the entire 2020.

When/if the American infected cases and deaths explode because of Trump's rushing to reopen, and the bodies from Coronavirus fill the streets, Donald Trump will blame the media for reporting it, calling it fake, and will declare it's all hoax by his political opponents.  Will Trump supporters make death threats to ..."
2020-04-17 14:39:46,The conspiracy theory that Gates is trying to capitalize on the Coronavirus is just as crazy as the conspiracy theory that Trump was colluding with Russia to win the election.   The point being that we are all susceptible to conspiracy theories.

It is also very important to remember this massive violence and theft committed against our lives occurred under the watch of the President Trump and the Republican Party.  

The Coronavirus flare went up in 2019. Yet, Trump did not act until the second week of March, 2020.  This changed our lives forever. And you still let hit spin the wheel. Trump is the antithesis of Bill Gates.

This is what you get America. This is what we all get.

Perhaps ""Thanks"" or ""You get what you deserve"" are in order, but not today. I love the United States. Just not when you continue to behave like this."
2020-04-17 21:01:00,"To say I respect Bill Gates - would be an understatement.

But I think when he wades into political stuff like commenting on POTUS understanding of viruses or whether America could have done better - having thrown his hat in the ring - arrows and slingshots are bound to follow.

I think he would have been a lot more eloquent by simply upping his donation to match what POTUS was suspending from WHO.

And leave it at that.

Messr. Gates, Buffet have made much of the fact that they intend to give every penny away.

Now, with Americans facing a catastrophe - I challenge these billionnaires - why are they waiting to give away everything before they die - which could be years away.

Why not now?

Say, by buying American treasuries or even single handedly funding some unemployment costs.

If it is true - as they say - charity begins at home.

Well, the home today is full of desperate folks needing charity."
2020-04-17 21:05:53,"In the early 1960s, in San Antonio, then a conservative, military town, in a conservative state, people flocked to the North Star Mall to receive free vaccines for various diseases.  People were grateful.  People believed in meritocracy, the government, and science to eradicate crippling and deadly diseases.  Education was the means to beat the Russians to the moon.

Meritocracy gave new social mobility to the previously disposed.  Ordinary people like Gates, Clinton, and Obama rose to new heights and changed the world.  

The radical right resented change, wants to shut the door to social mobility. Thus, the radical right must attack education and science.  When the radical right cannot debate the merits of science, it resorts to the ad hominem attacks we saw in the movie “Idiocracy.”  

The present attacks are merely designed to appeal to the Clevons of the country."

Food security, potable water, sewerage and medical care are the horses that go before the cart. Most recently I have been impressed by his wife’s efforts to remedy the lack of contraception in many countries. The countries that pay no heed to family planning are all mired in poverty. The Catholic Church’s opposition to artificial contraception is a particular problem, the Philippines being a prime example of the damage done."

Ultimate goals of this hodge-podge of know-nothings, profiteers, limelight seekers and a few who are simply demented are less clear than the modus operani which is to vilify science (global warming and virus), technolgists (Mr. Gates), and, of course, Jews (Soros) and academics.

I'll never know how much wealth Bill Gates created with Microsoft, but I suspect it's immense. He has been taking his part of that vast fortune and putting it to good use through his various foundations, my hat is off to him for that. It's too bad the clown in the WH hasn't used his relatively minor fortune to do the same. Instead he's used it dismantle our world order, that while admittedly imperfect was working better than before he crawled out from under whatever rock he called home. Bill Gates is attempting to clean up the mess we find ourselves in, no simple task. The man is doing good with the means at his disposal, would that those with like wealth were following his example. I know he's not alone but I also know that there are vast fortunes sitting on the sidelines. Kudos to Bill Gates for his efforts, you won't hear me criticize him, we need a lot more like him."

2020-04-17 21:28:05,"Bill Gates is a smart person and enormously successful at building a software company. The problem becomes when people believe that somehow a person's smartness and business success rubs off onto other areas of complex problem solving.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invests in projects of the World Health Organization. There are projects that have had a modicum of success, and there have been colossal failures the most recent and costly failure has been a HIV vaccine. None of this is surprising since these big complex issues require soldiering on in the face of failure, hoping success is just over the next hill. What is required though, a belief that the process of inquiry, that information from trials is manage with integrity and can be viewed by others because the evidence is easily available for others to see.

What the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, leadership within WHO has allowed his/their social/economic belief system to truncate information, which it turns out was imperative to getting the word out that there was a serious viral threat. Protecting sources; accommodating political expediency; delay and obstruction behaviors warrant intense scrutiny.

Bill Gates does a disservice to the dialogue on WHO by appearing on media programs as a credentialed expert when he is no more of value than any other entertainer whose opinions are sought to bolster some narrative."
2020-04-17 21:28:08,"I am usually surprised to hear about all the junk that is on Facebook, because I don't see it.  But I did see lies about Bill Gates. Just for the heck of it, I signed up for a ""Trump Strong"" group that I had to be approved for.  Almost every post contained false information, including a video where a woman claimed to be a healthcare professional, and who repeated the lie that Bill Gates created the coronavirus. I spent the next half hour reporting the posts as ""False News,"" but eventually gave up.

I think these private groups are a big danger on Facebook. Most of us never see all this dangerous misinformation, and by the time that Facebook catches up with them, a lot of damage has been done by the sharing of lies and misinformation."

These dudes also keep the money from beyond the grave in the form of tax-exempt foundations. One would think that when they go to that vast Swiss bank account in the sky that the public would get the loot via taxation but, no -- they manage to take it with them.

Rockefeller and Carnegie, once retired, did not act as policy gurus to the nation. They founded hospitals, universities and libraries without insisting that being rich gave them unusual moral insight.

It is time to get back to a world where telling lies about people or companies is ILLEGAL. People need to be charged with crimes. Nations that use the internet in this way need to be blocked and anyone telling LIES with no backup facts need to be liable to lawsuits with financial consequences. Just as newspapers can be sued for not checking the truthfulness of what they publish there should be similar laws for the internet.
These actions cause deaths--from teenagers committing suicide over being shamed to the  people who won't vaccinate their children (though not ALL vaccs. are necessary) to rumors like the one against Gates, Soros and others that interfere with people getting help they need.
The Supreme Court long ago declared Free Speech doesn't cover yelling fire in a crowded room. The internet has given a lot of people who need to feel important the ability to shout FIRE without consequences. It needs to stop.
Gates and his contemporaries have the money to push for laws to fix this. It is time they recognized their role in creating this monster and push to get it fixed."
2020-04-17 21:58:04,"This is the key graph:

Misinformation about Mr. Gates is now the most widespread of all coronavirus falsehoods tracked by Zignal Labs, a media analysis company. The misinformation includes more than 16,000 posts on Facebook this year about Mr. Gates and the virus that were liked and commented on nearly 900,000 times, according to a New York Times analysis. On YouTube, the 10 most popular videos spreading lies about Mr. Gates posted in March and April were viewed almost five million times.

This is a sign of the times. How much of this social amplification is purposeful, driven by third party actors? It's widespread opinion marketing. The right wing fever swamp needs a target, a person to attack and discredit. Why won't they name the whistleblower? Soros, Hillary, WHO, China! It's not just blame shifting, it's reframing. Arguing facts is a losing proposition for the right wing mind that insists on looking at a biological problem through a political lens. Unfortunately, this isn't mere rhetoric but will result in not only defaming Mr. Gates but also increasing our COVID death count."

While Mr. Gates has incurred some emnity from higher IT thinkers over the past four decades, it's been for computing related reasons, not biologic concerns.

Dr. Fauci's sin is that he is a reknowned scientist with impeccable integrity. His credibility is constantly in contrast with the bizarre statements by Donald Trump. Bill Gates, who has been a stalwart in addressing global health issues both with his mouth and his money, also has impeccable integrity. So now he too is on the MAGA hit list.

There will be no ""coming together,""or ""we'll all get through this together"" It's an optimistic effort, but nothing more than a fever dream. The division in our country is too extreme, it can never be healed, never brought back under one big, loving umbrella. This is the effect of Rupert Murdoch and his propaganda machine at Fox, Infowars nut job, Alex Jones, and the advent of social media which encourages a weigh in or comments by the masses. 

We should accept this fact and move on to creating separate ""States of America."" Those afraid of big government, who use their religion as cover to discriminate, the people incapable of accepting science, who carry assault rifles to local chicken joints, can be in their own tidy states where there won't be any immigrants or welfare recipients. Let them make up their pretend worlds with each other and leave us out of it. 
The rest of us will reside quietly away from them while we take care of each other and govern by a woman (hopefully) whose only goal isn't to divide us and steal our money, but rather lead these States of America to real freedom."

Then if you consider that the bottom quarter of the middle 68% are not quite as dumb but still very dumb you get around 33% of the population in the ""stupid"" category.  Interestingly, this number matches very closely with the so-called hard-core base of Trump supporters that never varies in the polls no matter what he does.

2020-04-17 19:00:08,"I think it's terrible to spend so much time on re-iterating baseless claims. Hundreds of ""conspiracy"" theories exist. They only gain traction when reputable media outlets as this repeat the claims. There are more cutting statements about Gates cited here than about the doubtful credibility of the statements or the people making these claims. The article should have spent its efforts deflating these claims rather than reiterating them. This is a terribly formed article and I'm disappointed NYTimes chose to post this."

In none of these center/right publications have I read anything of the sort alluded to in this article, which seems like an exercise in stawmanship unless the reader is satisfied with reading the obvious: that the Internet has enabled extremists who in previous years would have remained deservedly obscure (pre-Internet, standing on a street corner in rags with an ""End Is Near"" sign took much more commitment than hiding in Mommy's basement and posting on 4chan or unz.com), and that they come from both the extreme Right and the extreme Left.

I was appalled at the lies, distortions and invective directed toward Bill Gates and his generous, evidence-based efforts to contribute to the global effort to safe millions from the Coronavirus through mitigation and development of a vaccine.  I despaired at seeing so many expressions of support for RFK Jr's comments from similarly hateful, misinformed people, many in the grips of the most ridiculous conspiracy theories imaginable.  Who are these people? What are they thinking?  I was heartened to find the words of so many caring, rational and publicly-spirited commenters in this thread.

I have facebook friends who love to eat up any conspiracy theory. they are either Trump or Bernie fans and seem to have lost their ability for critical reason and are very emotional about their beliefs and hostile to anyone who questions them. They read things and watch youtube and then are 100% convinced of some scary theory, such as that Bill Gates is an evil man trying to do all kinds of nefarious things, when he is actually using his resources to do as much good as can in the world.  Maybe not every idea  he has is good,  same as with anyone,  but unlike some other billionaires- he cares and is doing his best.  Strangely, these friends are not up in arms against the Mercers, DeVos and family , Kochs and others with a seriously malignant motivation.   No- they are worried about Gates and Soros,  two who are doing great good in the world and should be admired and thanked."
2020-04-17 22:18:02,"I've been watching the hate directed towards Bill Gates for a couple of weeks now.  It is like the anti-Vaxx contingent has merged with fringe fundamentalist christianity and settled on mindset of Alex Jones.

Over and over I've seen comments about how Bill Gates is planning to use vaccines as an excuse to insert microchips or tattoo millions of Americans.  This is of course ""The Mark of the Beast"" a sure sign of the apocalypse which is somehow predicted by plagues and what not.  

It would be funny if it wasn't so sad that people actually believe this."
2020-04-17 21:29:22,"Trump supporters will believe any conspiracy theory even when it is off the wall. People whom Trump admires, like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, reinforce these ideas then claim innocence because they claim to be entertainers. The problem is that their undiscerning listeners believe everything they say or imply. 

While neither of these may be guilty of this particular lie, they reinforce conspiracy theories in general and endanger innocent lives by constantly haranguing their listeners that those who are not Trump admirers are out to get them and are emboldened when the president says neo-Nazis are fine people."

2020-04-17 22:28:03,"This whole mess -- Gates-wise -- is typical of the Trumpian/Tea Party strategy.  

When the truth can't get you the results you want, make up a new truth.  When the made-up truth is exposed, make up an even more bizarre new truth that so outstrips the old one, as to affirm the original's falsity, while diminishing the latter's ""unbelievability.""

Trump spent all those years convincing investors, bankers, regulators, audiences, worshipers, and his fellow grifters that he was a sound and successful businessman. 

The lie IS his truth. 

He has made an art out of getting his supporters to believe the unbelievable and then to get them to act on his behalf so as to make his lie their reality.

Just because I can't stand Trump does not mean I automatically oppose what he says. He may be right on this one. I am personally MUCH more afraid of Bill Gates agenda than of the virus (and I am old)."
2020-04-17 21:22:49,"The NYT published an excellent article recently about how the Russians have a massive intelligence program to use social media to divide Americans. Putins's trolls are pushing vaccine conspiracy theories while Putin himself urges Moscovites to get vaccinated, and while boasting that he gets his own vaccinations early.
These are acts of war against the US, that will result in American deaths. 
I think it's very likely that Russian trolls are behind the Bill Gates conspiracy theories too. When will we fight back? It would take a large technical effort to shed daylight on the source of this trolling. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation focuses mainly on health, but this trolling is also a public health issue. Perhaps they should kick off such an effort."

2020-04-17 22:30:28,"Folks, there is no reason to despair or get disheartened, the United States is already a third world country. I suspect we will also be the among the most poorly educated people fairly soon.

Bill Gates has probably done more for World healthcare than most any other single person and yet he is being denigrated and hated by an army of misinformation merchants and trolls. Its sad to read that Robert Kennedy's son is part of this conspiracy mongering group. 

Three Kennedy brothers who helped build this country are being followed by a generation that will never come close to achieving what the previous generation did and as this Kennedy is doing, will actually harm people with wild anti-vaccine theories. 

If and when an effective coronavirus vaccine is discovered I hope Mr. Kennedy and these trolls reject it. After all natural selection has to do its work. Humanity's evolution depends on it."

Attacking the people who are helping you is exactly what frightened people and animals do. These right-wing groups are almost surely fueled by a bigger source. 

Come November, it will be very refreshing to have the opportunity to vote for a person and a party that will surely take these folks to task. I'm confident that our intelligence agencies will be able to reveal the full sham of all of this noise in quick order once they are given the chance."

There is an inevitably that a large number of people won't understand much of the world they live in, even if they're smart.  And the more ignorant a smart person is, the more complex the weave of ideas they can meld into conspiracy.

Some conspiracies theories are perfectly valid.  Some are not.  Who are we (anyone) to judge how the human intellect perceives overly complex situations?

We have people a mix of people in the world living in conditions contemporaneous with nearly Iron Age days with nearly Interplanatary traveling days.

How good are people?  Suspicion leads to conspiracy theories.

We can lay this to rest immediately to anyone interested:  Bill Gates is not part of any conspiracy against the people of this world.  He's the opposite of that.  He's almost entirely good, and thank his better half for that."
2020-04-17 23:40:59,"One thing that ""might"" be behind some of this hating on Bill Gates is the low rate of taxation of the rich and their inordinate influence on politics and policy.  I wonder if there was a wealth tax and a fairer tax system, where Jeff Bezos and Amazon pay such low taxes, would some of this hatred decline?  Bill Gate's Foundation is one of the most non-democratic uses of wealth on the planet.  Only he and a small group determine who gets help from those resources.  Maybe if there was more diverse and broad input into those decisions people might not find it so emotionally attractive to attack the rich, even if irrationally.  Maybe Bill should fund a campaign asking for a wealth tax on people like him.  Warren Buffet seems to support it."

2020-04-17 23:47:38,"What’s most astonishing for me in my fifty-six years is the total abdication of citizenship of Trump’s base. At one time, it was understood that your obligation was to be ever-skeptical of power, to be informed, and to make decisions on what was best for the country. At least that’s what I was taught in school. In my exchanges with Trump supporters, they gleefully spread their party’s disinformation and buy into any narrative Trump sells. Sixty-three million people, more or less, have outsourced the only thing the state can’t take away—their minds—to a demagogue. They decry socialism, but they’ve already capitulated to that ideology’s pernicious objective: to destroy the individual in service to the state. The next election will determine whether the American idea survives."

The irrational approach, encapsulated by the ""liberation"" protesters, is going to get them all sick. That's because the disease is patho/psychogenic and acts on the rationality/irrationality dyad. It most likely affects our prefrontal cortex, which is why you see some people with it have neurodegenerative effects. What we need is a supra-rational approach.

For example, Bill Gates, a philanthropist, is seen by these ideologues as spreading untruths for profit; while Donald J.

Meanwhile since he has sent on other equally moronic conspiracy theories which I have also rebutted with facts. Again I asked him if he did his research before forwarding and was told no.

Steve wanted songs to be able to all cost the same – $0.99…

Bill wanted prices – of anything – to be able to vary up to 10-100X, or more, across national borders…

  But years ago, I stopped wondering why.  I'm just glad that Fords, Buffets and, now, Gateses are doing it.  They can't take it with them, but they can spread it around some while they are still here.  And do some good.  

  Bill Gates is about the only tech whiz kid I can think of who seems to understand the world beyond zeros and ones.  Many  are simply in over their heads -- are you listening, Mark Zuckerberg? -- and do not or will not see that they have any obligation to the society that has made them rich.

  Gates probably has skin thick enough to withstand lashes from the childish and peevish Laura Ingraham and the truly scary Alex Jones.  (If there is a reason to take him to task, it is his support of genetic engineering, which is unleashing millions of tons more of artificial and usually petroleum-based herbicides and pesticides on the food we eat.)

This illusion preys on the fear that the risk of tracking is so high that it must be conceded to mean lost individual liberty and improved systems of self-governance.   

What exactly do people think they lose or gain by not taking legal control, and designing the tracking system that places individuals in a fair and balanced agreement?

The right wing - I have been seeing them since Bill Clinton got elected - has stopped at nothing.  The response from the mainstream is non-existent, and that from the left is weak and counter productive [dumb wish statements such as 'cant we all just hug and make rainbows'].

The top billionaires can buy out FOX, and tie up each right wing hate group in courts in ways to bankrupt them all, and imprison them when possible.  Time to think through this one.

From what I am told and can read in books, our nation, as well as the UK, rallied together. 

Today we are blessed with all sorts of technological resources, especially in the fields of science and medicine,  that if used intelligently would allow us to confront many of of our present fears such as COVID-19 and global warming. 

But not so fast, instead we have idiots on the right and the left that seem to have ignored the wisdom of the past and instead generated a fear of the very thing that can help us - science. Gates may have been ruthless in some of his business pursuits, but today he is putting significant resources and effort into using science to make the world a better place. Hopefully his efforts will contribute to reducing some of our fears because our elected leaders are too impotent to do so. Thank you Mr. Gates."

All parts of this are enabled and abetted by social media and Fox, (not exclusively),  both of which are far more dangerous than Covid will ever be, so ironically Gates is wrong in that respect. No mere virus infests the mind permanently with no detectable symptoms like jealousy, fear, and ignorance, which are the mainstay drivers of the far right's  mentality.
    I hate to say it but there is a need for some level of censorship in media. A very large portion of the population simply does not possess the sense to discern reality from fantasy, and if we want this stuff to stop, there has to be a filter. Better education would help, but that is not happening."

Bill and Melinda Gates have done more to advance world health, perhaps, than the WHO itself. They personally took on a war against malaria, the biggest health problem on the planet. It was the perfect answer to the question people used to ask: if we are so advanced and if Americans are so affluent, why can't we eliminate poverty? And they have fought that battle for over a decade (over two, I think, but I'm not sure about when they started that effort). More than vaccines, they have provided mosquito nets, education, treatments, and beyond. 

May these lies be revealed for the world to witness and may those who make these false accusations be put to public shame for their misdeeds. May those who seem to profit from these lies be undone by them."

However, that reality should not blind us to the good that some very rich people are doing with their money, energy, and reputations. Categorical generalizations about the rich are no more valid than such about Blacks, single mothers or any other group. While we wait for the Revolution or the Messiah, let us praise the good done by Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, and the like.

Once upon a time we had a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriot and a genuine wartime leader, who federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when the governor, Orval Faubus had used the state's National Guard to surround the schools and prevent integration under Federal Court order. 

The situation is now largely reversed. We have a President who is neither a leader nor one who served his country. This time we need governors to call out the National Guard to enforce the law. 

The lesson of the Sixties and Seventies is essentially that if you really want to make change and not just complain, you'll have to do it in the streets, not online, taking concomitant risks and likely making significant sacrifices. (And that is a lesson these demonstrating Trump supporters have learned.)  Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman, Liuzzo, Kent State, Jackson State. These were not people complaining online.

I respect that side of his work and I hope he does a lot more.  But I also remember his monopoly on tech and how he refused to play ball with federal regulations.

Misinformation or outright lies get into the mainstream when someone posting on social media gets notice. Unfortunately, this president seems to be helping promote that notice. Conspiracy theories spread and gain credence.

It could also include simpler people who give away large percentages of their smaller wealth.  It would be a badge of honor, and if a person with significant means wasn't on the list, an indicator of dishonor.  It would include, undoubtedly, Democrats and Republicans, of all religions and nationalities.  We need to see, as a nation, that there are good people who got lucky, and who are sharing significant parts of their wealth.

Now he is in the line of fire, accused of crimes against humanity, and linked to various conspiracy theories like using vaccines to dominate the world health system and suppress  the global population etc. 
Right-wing media and Trump supporters pick a fight with him, because he’s critical of Trump’s handling of the health crisis.
I wonder if Russian trolls are behind this “widespread of all coronavirus falsehoods” –  given the 16,000 posts on Facebook this year about Gates and Covid-19 that were liked and commented on nearly 900,000 times.
I read an article by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania about politically polarising tweets by Russian trolls about vaccination that included pro- and anti-vaccination messages, and targeted at people with specific political inclinations in 2016.
Perhaps they are active again in an effort to polarise the nation ahead of the November elections.
The troll farm, Internet Research Agency, based in St. Petersburg, is no stranger to US intelligence agencies.

She speaks passionately about the damage inflicted by domestic violence and elder abuse. Today, she unloaded about her irritation with Jay Inslee, followed by lots of FOX regurgitation. She's very annoyed that Washington may be late to re-enter normal because of his 'liberal' stupidity. She concluded that Inslee is to blame for all of the trouble rolling out testing, PPE, etc cuz that's a state job.

Since this is not a military refight, everybody on the other side is fair game and should not be saved from their stupidity.  Innocent children will die, as they do in any war,  and their deaths do not stop the war.  

We did not ask for this war, but we have to win it.  If fighters on the other side want to endanger their lives and the lives of innocent relatives and neighbors, so be it.

 We have a worldwide pandemic, the leader of the richest nation with the “best economy ever” doing nothing except holding  2 hour rallies and infomercials for drugs not fully vetted by the FDA. This same world leader boasted about spending billions for new military weaponry, can’t muster the strength to reach across his desk and try and procure cotton swabs, PPE  and the reagent needed to test for COVID19?  This is the world leader who is  let his “best economy ever” slip through his fingertips because he had a hunch that the virus would have been gone over two weeks ago.   
But equipped with their Microsoft operating systems, ( perhaps the only thing that is fully functional in their lives) we have mentally compromised, dystopian groups positing their theories that Covid19 was masterminded by the man who created the platform they spew from.  Left unanswered by these conspiracy theorists is WHY would Bill Gates want to control the global health system?

Ms. Ingraham and Robert Kennedy should be forced to work in a nursing home or a hospital in a hot spot area for a week before they spout their nonsense. But let’s be clear: the vast majority of Americans are listening to the medical and scientific experts.  That is why we are flattening the curve. Why, though too many people have died, there are many fewer than would have without the patriotism of Americans. Yes, we want to restart our economy. Yes, we want to hug our children. Yes, we want children back in schools. But we need to get there in sensible ways.  The CDC document contains some very thoughtful material to help guide the Governors and their advisors as they decide what is best for their states. Last but not least, the Governors are heroes, Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, making decisions not based on misinformed talking heads or a few protestors, but on science and medical expertise, and certainly not on Trump’s reprehensible Twitter attacks."

NOBODY OWES ARTISTS A LIVING.

Art is something an artist, or person, would do either way. If you have to work a job you will still make art in your spare time.

Coal miners made old-time and bluegrass music in their spare time.

Country and Blues musicians always had ""real jobs"" while playing.

 Walt Whitman wrote poems on the ferry to work.

John Prine wrote songs while delivering mail.

If people can make money in good times for their art then fine. 

But if art is a ""necessity"" it's only because it will happen anyway in true artists. Nobody has to pay them for it or feel they should be monetarily singled out for support.

Yes, if they have to support themselves by other more practical or direct ways as a human being firstly, so be it. Being an artist doesn't make you special when it comes to simply having to survive like everyone else. 
In fact, most people are creative in one way or another outside of their occupation."
2020-04-20 18:35:27,"So many sad stories right now.  Unfortunately the Arts have always been underfunded and under appreciated.

I appreciate that Tesla has been willing to let us enjoy their music through YOUtube.. But then, most artists are very generous when it comes to sharing their talents with us."
2020-04-20 18:45:16,"I have thought of such groups often during this crisis. I know many string quartets and freelance musicians and have donated to groups along the way. Our daughter is in a quartet but is fortunate enough to have landed a residency, which pays a little, and their contract is valid for at least another year so they do have something to look forward to. But even those musicians in well recognized organizations are hurting. The Met Opera orchestra is not playing and will only be paid through the end of this month. But that is still better than groups like the Tesla. If you have a chance, please give to maintain the arts. It is one of the things that keeps us human."

2020-04-20 19:25:53,"On a strictly practical basis, the Tesla Quartet is a small business and should be eligible for business assistance just like a small flower shop or shoe store. Sadly, the way the government is handling this, it could be months or longer before they see a cent (if they get anything at all!)

On a “quality of life” basis, especially during normal times, virtually everyone loves “the arts!” Which art??  Well..to each his/her own!
Yep!  Everyone loves the arts until they, as a society, have to pay for it. The arts are disorganized enough (as opposed to a Wall St.) that when it comes to queuing up for government financial aid, art is always last in line. Plenty available though for conglomerates who don’t need it. 

Shakespeare said;

The purpose of art is to give life a shape!

So true....and yet so many choose not to support it. It’ll be their loss, and our loss, once it’s gone! A pity!"
2020-04-20 19:34:10,Thank you for sharing your beautiful music.  I loved every moment.
2020-04-20 17:31:18,"Even international stars like Ray Chen and Hilary Hahn have been affected. I guess TwoSet Violin is still making money off of  merch. But every musician, not just classical ones, is hurting. The only thing left is practice.

I'm so sad Menuhin Competition was cancelled.  The only time I would get to go."
2020-04-20 18:27:32,"As I am a fan of String Quartets, I supported this group  by going to:
<a href=""http://www.teslaquartet.com/store"" target=""_blank"">http://www.teslaquartet.com/store</a>

and paying $10 for a Download of their album in 320K/MP3 format.  It sounds great. I am glad to have purchased this."
2020-04-20 19:53:35,"Two of my uncles, at the time young men with young families, were sustained as human beings and artists by the WPA. Already accomplished, they were enabled to use, increase and share their talents with the public because of the WPA. One went on to become a university professor, the other taught music privately.
Now, we are in the midst of a dog-eat-dog society, where the big dogs are getting the real meals, and everyone else gets scraps, and everyone's future is far from assured."
2020-04-20 20:12:04,"I have an undergraduate degree in music.  (Am I the only one who read 'Barber Adagio' and burst into tears?) 

But mine was but a mediocre talent and so I went another way after undergraduate school.

We live in a world where even highly talented and accomplished musicians live hand-to-mouth, even before the pandemic struck.  Over the last 40 years, it's become very sad to realize we inhabit an increasingly ugly, cheap and auto-tuned ethos.

My heart breaks for Tesla and all the many other musicians whose lives have been rent asunder by this pandemic."
2020-04-20 20:28:26,"If we want the arts to survive, we need to think of another model than the fragile market based one we have in this country.  The Arts have to be subsidized if not totally supported by the State.  The amazing talent, energy, determination and hard work associated with playing a musical  instrument at this level is mind boggling.  We cannot let this situation to continue.  Tax dollars need to be allocated to the Arts and away from useless military budgets which just are used to destroy and in an incredibly inefficient way at that!"
2020-04-20 20:30:43,"I have a question: why would musicians with such precarious income want to live in  New York City? Understandable if it is pop, rock, blues, jazz, hip-hop or any other popular urban genre. But classic music? Live in  New Paltz or in Europe and the bottom will not drop out."
2020-04-20 20:43:56,"As for the Barber Adagio, I'd feel honored to hear Tesla play it on YouTube. Is any piece of classical music more appropriate for these times?"
2020-04-20 21:24:10,"I admire the Tesla Quartet and was privileged to hear a live performance about a decade ago. It is a tragedy that such a well-known and successful group is imperiled by the Covid-19 closures. The way in which such dedicated and talented artists are paid is deplorable, and the reason why I cut off my own music career in the mid-1980s. 

Musicians practice a lot. Four hours of practice as a group -- every day, the Tesla group's schedule -- is actually pretty common. It doesn't take into account individual practice time, and as musicians know all too well, practice is not remunerated. The many hours it takes to be a great musician are unpaid labors. Many musicians teach to make a steady income apart from performances, but when one already plays 4-6 hours a day as part of a group, tecahing time is necessarily limited.

The patronage system, which historically kept many artists and musicians from starvation, seems to be dying, if not dead.  The performing arts have been gutted as unnecessary in schools, and musicians criticized for not doing anything ""productive."" If superlative performances by groups like the Tesla Quartet are to survive, we need patrons, a robust Endowment for the Arts, and a better system of support for artists, especially in times like the present."
2020-04-20 22:20:23,As a self-employed artist doing the music festival circuit--I can totally commiserate.  Fearful times.  I would love to barter some silver earrings for a CD sometime...
2020-04-20 21:11:59,"The truth of the matter is that these incredible musicians possess more talent in their pinky then our pop culture idols who make millions. It is a sad state of affairs that even our once lauded institutions such as the Kennedy Center Honors, Pulitzer Prize for Music and the Gershwin Prize for songwriting are now mere extensions of the R&R Hall of Fame, Country Music Grand Ole Opry, and Rap and HipHop genres. Ours is and ignorant, vulgar, ugly culture and the devolution of fine art is only one of its victims. I once had an online debate with a major newspaper music critic who professed that Rap was as sophisticated and beautiful as a Bach Fugue. How to argue with such insidious ignorance? 
Is it therefore any surprise that these marvelous musicians will be among the tragedies this plague will render obsolete?"
2020-04-20 21:37:47,"I wonder if the musicians have considered applying for either unemployment insurance or grants under the paycheck protection program? Both programs have been expanded to include sole proprietors and independent contractors. I would think that the members meet the requirements for these programs.

Below are links to (1) the Fed’s overview of the PPP, and it clearly states that the program covers sole proprietors and independent contractors, and (2) a link to New York’s unemployment insurance 
webpage listing a flowchart that indicates that self unemployed people are eligible for unemployment benefits.

I sincerely hope that these wonderful musicians qualify for these programs. I believe they do, and they are unquestionably deserving of the benefits of these programs. Their livelihoods have been taken away by government. It’s only fair that government makes some attempt to compensate them for the losses they are bearing. The very very best of luck to them.

2020-04-20 23:21:07,"I have had quite a number of classical music concerts cancelled due to Covid-19 that I was planning to attend and to which I already had tickets, most as a season ticket holder. Rather than take the offer of a refund or exchange for a concert later on, I chose to donate the tickets back to the orchestra for a tax deduction. It helps them, it helps me some. Unfortunately, it wouldn’t help a group like Tesla. But I hope many people will do the same. These musicians are a national treasure."
2020-04-20 23:22:17,"Don’t forget about the recent graduates from Juilliard and similar programs whose job prospects have disappeared, and the current students whose summer internships and gigs have vanished. 

Even the most talented among these groups will be completely deserted, as they have no savings from previous work, no status to apply for the few grants around, and insufficient resumes to compete for the very rare positions that may come available. 

The next generation of artists face potential extinction of traditional funding. It is likely that priority will be given to more established competitors and more “essential” industries."
2020-04-20 23:33:19,"Nice article - in many ways the Tesla Quartet represent all the artists now having to rely on the kindness of others.  This pandemic will take away the livelyhood of anyone who depends on performing before a crowd - whether musicians, singers, Broadway stars, and perhaps even sports figures.  Ironically, our desire to join together to appreciate someone can hurt people now. Hopefully, this quartet will weather this stormy period with the help of generous people."
2020-04-20 23:53:31,"Someone once wrote, ""Without music, life would not be fair."" All the more true for classical music. One doesn't study to the point of mastery for the money — but without funding, it's not possible for artists like the Tesla Quartet to sustain themselves.

The measure of a society is its priorities. Many of us remember that 60s poster that said, ""Imagine a world in which the schools had all the money they needed, but the military had to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber.""  Imagine a world which placed musicians near the top tier of society. Instead, especially today, these musical healers who help sustain the soul of our world are an endangered species. Never more than today."
2020-04-21 00:56:08,"Such an important article.  While highlighting the Tesla Quartet, the same text and subtext can be applied to so very many of the wonderful and inspiring  ensembles we’ve come to cherish.  They, like so many other chamber groups, have been working non-stop since COVID-19 caused concerts to disappear, to rethink just how they can still ‘perform’ the music we so badly need to hear.  

I for one hope this article is just the first in a series, a series highlighting other ensembles in crisis, and most important, writing about the creative thinking that is emerging from these important musicians about how they’ll be getting their music to us.

They may be struggling without us right now, but we too are surely struggling without their music as well."

2020-04-20 18:02:51,"This is amazing and shows that need really is the mother of invention. That being said, I am seeing a lot of these projects going on around the country in an uncoordinated way. My undergrad, Rice University, has designed a super cheap system that uses bag valve masks (They call their system the ApolloBVM for those who want to look it up). The professor who runs my lab at my graduate school is also working on a ventilator project. These may be targeting different markets. For example, I believe the Rice project is targeted at lower income countries. I am just wondering if everyone is competing for the same parts from an already stretched supply chain, will anybody get everything that they need?"
2020-04-20 18:02:56,"Remarkable story and worthy of serious awards. What matters is that bureaucrats, technicians, politicians and investors set aside ego and personal glory and went to work and built not just a workable tool but something of value and easily copied all over the world. Thank you."
2020-04-20 18:03:53,"Crisis , like current pandemic, brings many people together in effort to resolve or alleviate the problems. Some of proposed solutions may even be useful. Would Ambu Bag based MIT ventilator be one of those valuable ideas? I seriously doubt. Medical devices are still suppose to be approved by FDA and something tells me that this one will be rejected. There are much better solutions to resolve shortage of ventilators, giving supplemental oxygen and turning patient prone on the stomach (proning) is one of those. Other solutions would be to utilize anesthesia ventilators, which are idling in many hospitals and surgicenters. In Europe patients are transported to less effected regions, where hospitals resources are not stretched. This is done in France and Germany. We should act decisively and promptly, but still follow safety regulations, besides, we seem to pass the peak and now we can concentrate on ""higher quality"" solutions than 3k $ ventilator."

It’s taking us slightly longer to get into production because we are designing for simultaneous manufacture on all six populated continents. To make sure that our design is relevant to improvised ICUs, we are ensuring that it does not require electricity to operate.

We are basing our design on the once ubiquitous Bird Mark 7 ventilator but with modern safety features added.

2020-04-20 19:50:48,"As always, a great job by intelligent, innovative and resourceful people.

But, my big takeaway here was that Cuomo and deblasio were screaming about how many ventilators NY needed and trump has blood on his hands because he wasnt providing them fast enough. Deblasio likes to say that his ""doom and gloom"" scenario is going to happen ""next week"", or by ""the end of this week"". Deblasio and Cuomo were so far off on their predictions its laughable. They both were literally the boy who cried wolf. And, had they taken federal social distancing recommendations seriously and implemented it from the start, they could have saved more lives and lessened the spread. But they chose to keep NYS & NYC open longer than many other states/cities.  On March 13th, NYC schools were still open and deblasio was giving Broadway show recommendations while declaring ""NYC is OPEN for business!""

And in the end, all the reporting is about how trump didnt take charge.  Seems to me governors/mayors didnt take charge and their estimates of the spread in their own states/cities was so far off as to not even be meaningful.  So after blasting trump about his early optimism and not taking it serious enough, he turned out to be more right than cuomo/deblasio.  And now as trump is looking to reopen the country in a phased, localized approach, the same governors/mayors who were so wrong the 1st time around are now saying trump is totally wrong again and they intend to disregard his advice, again. Cant make it up"

Assuming Democrats win in November, Biden has to convene a commission to evaluate and reduce outrageous costs for medical equipment, services and pharmaceuticals.  It’s the least he can do if he remains so opposed to a single-payer system.  

I just read of a coronavirus patient released today after a month in the hospital.  I can imagine him having other health problems once he sees the astronomical bills start rolling in.  We must control healthcare costs if we want any system to work effectively for us."
2020-04-20 20:43:01,"The NYT just reported a disaster when the FDA allowed the distribution of covid-19 tests from China and elsewhere under an expedited approval, without the usual testing -- and they gave false results. 

Now they've allowed another product under an expedited approval, and as far as I can tell from this story and a quick Google search, they approved this too without clinical testing. 

When you create a new, innovative medical product, you have to do clinical studies to demonstrate that it's just as good, or better than, the existing products (or not using any products at all). 

What you need, at a bare minimum, is a study in which first one patient, and then several patients, are treated with this new device. Then you need a study comparing the new product to existing products, to make sure more people don't die with the new product. That's why product development takes so long. But when you skip these steps, patients die unnecessarily. 

If a patient is sick enough to require a ventilator, the chances of his surviving the ventilator treatment is about 50% (depending on the conditions). Pulmonologists have put a lot of work into getting those survival rates up by about 20%, in randomized controlled trials. 

Have they actually tried these ventilators out on an actual patient? On a group of patients? If so, where have they published their results? How many patients died?"

It pains me to see that our politicians can't even get it together to mass produce masks, gloves, or testing kits. All far less complicated than ventilators. Open up some of the many vacant manufacturing plants, tool them up, hire workers at a decent wage and screen them for covid. Have 3 shifts and get on with making PPE.  But no, this would be socialism and Pence and Jared don't have the expertise anyway.  Where is the wartime President?  Likely sneaking out to play golf with no photographers."

""It's an impressive feat of American engineering, like, this is American exceptionalism, at its best!"" 

No it's not, it's an embarrassment.

This ventilator should have been made in 100 hours, but OMG!, that's just too hard for these so-called engineers.

Why didn't they simply take apart an existing ventilator, reengineer with computer simulations to upgrade it - and redesign it to use off the shelf parts for manufacturing efficiency?  Too hard?

That's how the Mercedes F1 team made one in 100 hours.  For initial conception to the hospital in two weeks.

Not the first and probably not the last idea of this kind in a recent frenzy of inventions. Many of those ideas and devices seem plausible and functional at first thought, but then they are dropped from view. What happened to Navy Hospital Ships, how many patients they are accommodating now? In many parts of this country Operating Rooms are utilized at fraction of capacity. Anesthesia ventilators idle there and can be used as ICU ventilators. They are much more reliable and sophisticated than ""Spiral Wave"" but still not as good as ICU vents. Most if not all Surgicenters are also closed and their vents can be used. We can either shift patients to areas of more resources or resources to areas with more needs. Oh wait, it would require leadership, which this country is  lacking!"

Private companies and cottage industries, mom-and-pop startups (at least some of which owe their existence primarily to the dire situation) - forced to come into existence and create because of the near utter failure of the federal government, led by the Usurper - that's right - Individual One - to 1) take personal responsibility; 2) take responsibility merely as the head of the federal government, e.g., ACTING as the federal government; 3) fund, or continue funding, in the first instance, of the agencies that could have made a competent, or even mediocre, federal response, possible - have been, therefore, forced to fill the gap.
This is inexcusable.
This is a SIN against the People.
This is tantamount to an INFAMNIA.
And you know - the Right will, in the future, point to this as an example of how LIMITED government - one of their watchwords - works, and how this justifies right wing claims for limited, and more limited government, more deregulation (viz., Seema Verma's recent comments); etc.

It does not breathe for the patient, it just makes overpressure. The mods were minor.  Unrelated, and extremely simple device present on nightstands all over the world.

And no one is going to pay for that nor am I convinced the device would work reliably for weeks at a time.  Journalists and Readers of the NYT, welcome to reality.   It’s very unlikely You will ever hear or see of this thing in a hospital ever (or any of the dozens of similar ventilator challenges launched all around the world).  So it’s time to move on.

To really make that happen requires that we come to our senses about making sure there is a thriving industrial base including integrated supply chains within the physical borders of the USA.  It is insanity that we have allowed it to wither.  Inability to respond quickly to emergency situations like covid-19 is only one bad effect.

While I'm glad to hear about some of the networking and teamwork that enabled the low cost ventilator project to get its sensors, the overly breathless tone of the description of that work is an indication how far we have to go.  That kind of collaboration and fast production, while always useful, would be considered much closer to business as usual than unusual brilliance in a place with a culture of making things, and a commitment to keeping enough knowledge and manufacturing capacity here."

The real message contained is the process by which groups of academics/scientists, entrepreneurs and execs in manufacturing got together to create this device. Not only did this create a functional prototype in a compressed time frame, but it was created in a re-purposed manufacturing site in NYC. All of those who claim that manufacturing in the U.S. is dead (or at least moribund) may need to re-think their opinions.

2020-04-21 15:14:03,"The underlying problem that is highlighted by this ""wartime effort"" is that, absent the pandemic, there is no incentive to make a medical device cheaper if there's an expensive solution with a reimbursement code.
In the absence of Pandemic, make a device that has every possible bell, whistle and option built in. Test it enough to show it works as claimed, and it becomes the standard of care. Its cost is built into the reimbursable amount for every procedure, and everyone, no matter how simple the requirement, gets the Cadillac version.
As noted, the genius in the garage who makes a cheaper device gets noticed, made somewhat wealthy, and the idea goes away forever.

“There’s a lot you can’t see in a model,” said Charles Boyce, the founder and chief executive of Boyce Technologies. “And if you can’t manufacture something at scale, it doesn’t matter. It’s not going to have an impact.”

The idea that we sub out all of our manufacturing to China is stupid when you see what happens in times like these.  Design, engineering, and manufacturing work best when they take place in close proximity. And in times like these, they MUST take place in close proximity.  All the MIT eggheads in the world wouldn’t have mattered if they had not the means to scale up and build right there and then."
2020-04-21 04:19:06,"What occurred is a form of concurrent engineering: a pool of cross functional expertise with reduced transaction costs between them for communication purposes.

Those of us who worked in the automotive field in the 1980s, of course, knew all about ""lean"" business principles before the book came out but that book help spread knowledge of the practices far and wide, including ""agile"" system development methodologies. 

Get a bunch of experts in a room from different but complementary fields, give them a white board to make lists,  and diagrams and set them loose. As long as they are decent, reasonably polite and well meaning, anything can happen. Kind of like the movie ""Apollo 13"" or ""The Martian."""

As an infectious diseases physician this haste terrifies me. People seem to think the danger is past. It is most definitely not. It is out there and waiting for the careless and impetuous to make their mistakes. And we all pay. 

I wouldn't be so concerned about the protesters if they were the only ones to become ill. After all, they said it was okay for them to get sick. But they will be infecting others, including their elderly parents and grandparents, who might not be so cavalier about prematurely shedding their mortal coils. And it further endangers nurses, respiratory therapists, EMTs, hospital ancillary staff and doctors, who are exposed to these protesters if and when they become ill.

The government is paying companies to on pay employees who keep employees who cannot work. Out hospitals are open to everyone with no fear of cost.

Instead of anticipating serious problems (such as a pandemic) that could harm Americans, he belittled it, and even called it a hoax -- wasting valuable months. Instead of preparing for the massive testing to track the spread, his administration failed to produce them in sufficient numbers (to this day). Instead of heeding sound medical advice, he constantly contradicted them in public, and treated them as competitors for the stage. Instead of taking responsibility for managing a crisis, he has found scapegoats everywhere else, from Obama, to the Democrats, to the WHO. And instead of uniting the country in times of trouble, to work together and act in concert to defeat this disease, he is openly leading dissent and disobedience to the lockdown orders. The head of government is leading an anti-government charge. Such is the extreme level of contradiction, that history writers - if they survive - will have plenty of fodder.

This may be the saddest part of this terrible development: naive, science-denying conservative supporters of President Trump risking their own lives for the cause of political solidarity against a virus that still has the potential to kill thousands of people, including them, the Fox News reporters egging them on, and the president. As moral citizens, we must save our American siblings from themselves.

The countries that speak Germanic languages are actually the most developed ones of the world, but the English-speaking countries don't seem to belong to them in this regard anymore, and most certainly this is not because of the larger amount of Romance loanwords in the English language. It would be nice if the US would align more to Europe, because as far as i know, the US is the child of the UK which in turn is the child of the Anglia Peninsula/Germany. Not to forget all the Germans that arrived 1880-1950. It would hence be nice if the US would behave more like our grown-up child who has  become taller and stronger"

Trump does have blood on his hands.  Opening up too soon, without needed testing is leaving the elderly, minorities and all others at risk.  Watching Pence on Meet the Press and his repetitive answers to Chuck Todd avoiding the lack of testing accessible to states said it all.  I don't think Trump's administration wants to know the real number and certainly not for us to know either.   

We all need to be tested.  I could be a walking carrier along with everyone else.  Where is the safety and peace of mind in that?"

2020-04-20 11:44:44,"“These people love our country,” Trump said of protesters who were rebelling against the restrictions, “They want to go back to work.”

Actually, the protesters love themselves and the conspiracy theory leaders who are leading them like lemmings them to protest against reasonable caution and against health experts who say the infections and deaths will spike if we open up.

The protesters seem to have little regard for making their countrymen fatally sick.

That's not love of country; that's contempt for science and society.

They are public safety threats, as is the President."
2020-04-20 11:43:22,"The great tragedy right now is the absence of a Trusted and Mature Leader in the White House.  Someone with compassion and Eloquence and Humility in the face of a Pandemic, which cries out for leadership able to explain and exhort the nation on behalf of our common destiny, not just within the US, but with the entire world.  Someone desiring to appeal to our highest ideals and virtue, not the lowest common denominator of rabid hatred and individualistic entitlement.

We need someone to call us to mutual sacrifice in the service of our mutual freedom, not the pandering to selfish assertions of “freedom” cast as rebellion against a common enemy - the virus - which we only fight through solidarity and the temporary sacrificing of gathering in herds.

It is agonizing to watch sociopathic Trump appeal to and side with the most malignant instincts, rather than what’s needed:  an appeal to wisdom, to compassionate solidarity and mutuality.

Even if a speech writer laid out in eloquent terms what is needed from a national leader, Trump would be unable to do more than give a rote, robotic delivery.   Because he lacks generosity.  He lacks authenticity.  He lacks emotional depth.  He lacks empathy and compassion.

We so desperately need - from our federal government - the inner strength and commitment to call all of us to join together, to stand together, not to give up, not to act selfishly.  

Instead we have the White House itself standing for Rebellion against what’s needed."

If that's the case we will start to see things go to the bad side, I hope not, but with who we have as our leader I am starting to fear the worst in these times. The Nov. elections seem so far away.

With no vaccine, thareputics or antibody test and very little viral testing, mitigation by social isolation, while crude, is our only defense against COVID-19.  When Trump failed in his attempt to exert authoritarian rule over the country, he's resorted to undermining the governors whose job it is to protect their citizens.

Going to the grocery store requires suiting up for battle. I simply do not understand these people who are protesting. Viruses do not know borders or Red from Blue states. All it takes is a few infected, asymptomatic people to create havoc in their communities, communities that are not equipped to handle the onslaught of seriously ill patients.

Their brains are susceptible to propaganda and can not process facts or distinguish between fact and belief.

2020-04-20 11:35:38,"Fake protests over “freedoms” and “liberties” are obvious covers for Trump’s failures and an attempt to put Democratic politicians on their heels before the election. It’s exactly what they did in 2009 and 2010 in the aftermath of the disastrous Bush administration. Because they’re obnoxiously loud and aggressive, they get plenty of media attention, which legitimizes what is an effort largely organized by far right special interests groups and Fox News. 

But unlike the media and Democrats, a virus can’t be shouted into submission. Nor does it care if someone is walking around with a big gun. It will do its worst indiscriminately on everyone. 

The people engaged in these protests may be presenting themselves as patriots—which isn’t very believable after what we’ve seen from Trump and his followers. Now, like hundreds of bankers, business people and ordinary workers before them, these so-called patriots are about to pay a very steep price for partnering with Donald J. Trump."

The fact that NPR and other outlets have decided not to feature them daily is dangerous, and an even greater failure to the public.  Full unedited transparency is what is going to take Trump down.  

This president does not care about we, the people. Encouraging anti-government protests really is no different than handing out free guns outside the local WalMart, and acting surprised when the death rate spikes due to irresponsible ownership.  

Let the people watch Trump’s cognitive decline as it happens live. The sound bites are not enough. Give us the evidence and let Trump be the maker of his own demise.

- Regularly sides with putin over US officials 
- Did not win the popular vote in the last election 
- Has never shared his tax returns after promising to do so on many occasions
- Has publicly admitted he he would accept foreign interference in the 2020 election 
- And has disavowed any responsibility for the 40,000  US deaths even though he has been in office for 3 years preceding this pandemic.

Are there no intelligent GOP colleagues in Congress? In the cabinet? Do they all really want fellow citizens to die because they confuse Trump’s campaign of hatred with real freedom? Why unleash viral hatred among the people unless you want the consequences? For shame."

Given a 1-2% chance of dying versus a nearly 100% chance of losing our business & livelihood, along with the spectacular failure of our national and local officials in providing the necessary relief to keep small businesses and middle class households afloat, I support these protesters and plan on going back to work the minute it's legally permitted for me to do so."

Stop covering the MAGA rallies-Corona press conferences, and please show the re open protestors to be a small group of partisans, not representatives of a legitimate broader movement.

FDR understood that the federal government had to be there to support the state governments and keep them from failing.

This is the United States of America and we need to have a plan that all states can abide by during this pandemic, we need a federal government that works with the states and not against them.

Social distancing and staying at home are no fun, but if they slow this virus spread down then we need to do it.

Now more then ever we need to listen to the medical people telling us how to live and not die and we need to thank the first line responders for being our army against this virus."
2020-04-20 12:02:17,"Trump's push to reopen America is dangerous.  His support of protestors to ""liberate their states"" is worse than irresponsible.  These people do not understand the effects of their actions.  

Look at he map in the article.  It plainly shows how the virus is planting its seeds all over the country.  In the southeast and east fo the Mississippi, there are little dots scattered all over the place.  This is how it starts.  

In New York, it was doubling every three days.  If a small town has 30 infected people and it doubles in five days, that's 2000 people in 30 days.  This is the danger of an exponential spread.  Before you know it, the sickness is everywhere. 

We have to keep distancing until the rate of new infections is exponentially declining.  The number of new cases must be rapidly falling off.  That means the virus is burning out.  Currently, we are leveling off and experiencing about 30,000 new cases a day.  And that means we are right in the middle of this pandemic.

The curves of disease progression are roughly symmetrical.  That means it takes just as long or longer for the disease to burn out as it did for it to ramp up.  This is no time to start reopening the place up.  Otherwise, face masks will become a fashion statement sold in boutique stores."
2020-04-20 11:01:51,"This is a win win situation for Trump. A true demagogue maneuver of washing your hands of it. 

First, remove yourself from all responsibility for the „shut down“ („governors call“). With the knowledge that the governors and mayors (compared to him) are obliged to follow medical experts and facts as they are in the front line.
Parallel even start blaming them for not doing enough. 

Then, start instigating calls for “liberation” and resistance against the shut down. Again with the knowledge that the governors still need to keep the shutdown where necessary.

Result: Trump can shine - standing for the “land of the free” “let the party begin again”. 
While all governors/majors  “aka government/deep state” must do the dirt job - standing for restrictions, misery and pain."

How much would it really have taken for him to truly inspire patriotism, to sacrifice for you family, friends, and country? 

How grotesque are these protests? First responders, doctors, and nurses risking all everyday to save lives, and these people protesting to do EXACTLY the wrong thing. 

My neighbor, a doctor at NYU, was coming home one morning, early in the pandemic, she looked exhausted. She said they had intubated a young man that day. She seemed scared. I didn’t realize at the time it meant he was not likely to recover.

People are dying that didn’t need to because we didn’t do what we knew we were supposed.
People are dying trying to save them because we didn’t do what we knew we were supposed.
More people are going to die, preventable deaths even now, because of the abject perversity of Trump and his cult following.

Those maligning these liberators - the global elite, the MSM, the fearful (and most commenters on these posts) - represent the repressive mindset of George III and Xi Jinping. They'll give up every freedom just to feel 'safe' from this virus. Sometimes, death is better than a life that is actually a living death - which is where we are now.

An example is Mayor De Blasio dredging up a headline from the 1970s "" Ford to NY: "" Drop Dead"". Ford, of course, did not say that nor did Trump. De Blasio and Cuomo are understandably desperate for money because of dropping tax and other receipts. They will get help but only after the replenishment of the the last Federal stimulus for small business. And there will be political fighting on the amount and size of the help. Finally, we are given a choice this year between a divisive President and an opponent whose ability, from a cognitive standpoint, deserves scrutiny. He should submit to a mental status test, administered at Walter Reade and release the results BEFORE the convention.

I think that says a lot about the current status of the self-proclaimed ""world's greatest nation."""

2020-04-20 11:43:19,Why is Trump’s behavior not treasonous????? He should be held to severe account for what he is doing: inciting violence.
2020-04-20 10:50:42,The Democrats are missing an opportunity. They should have operatives on social media encouraging tRump supporters to gather together to hug and shake hands. This would thin out the herd prior to November. Politics is a zero sum game. There’s just winners or losers
2020-04-20 11:11:42,"Let these very fine people congregate as they wish.   This could prove to be fortunate as the gene pool would clean up a bit quicker leaving only those folks left who want a progressive, compassionate, stable democratic government of the people for the people."
2020-04-20 11:33:49,"Why are you talking about these protests as though they are spontaneous— the people are protesting, sure, but they are being led by propagandists who seem to have no concern for human rights.  That should be thoroughly investigated and should be news every time you talk about these so-called protests.  Plus, 2000 people are just not that many people — but the news is covering this as though half the population is up in arms.  This should not be normalized — it is abnormal for people to fight against their basic right to life — which we may all give up if we make this seem like normal or, even, that it is what the people want.  We all want to get back to normal, but we’re grownups and know that sometimes we must make sacrifices.  History is filled with them — even their revolutionary war heroes sacrificed for the good of this nation.  Shame on these people who have stirred up others to take to the streets instead of protecting themselves.  Sacrifice for your country’s well-being and stop being spoiled children."

It also divides the nation into those who have the means and self discipline to follow informed advice to protect their lives from those not just the willfully uninformed, severely lacking delayed gratification and should know better with those unfortunate to have lost their jobs, health insurance or never had the resources for what the incompetence of our country's leadership demands they must have in order to stay alive.

It was a con job even then mind you, but it appealed to enough people to get him elected.  But now Donald Trump is President of the United States.  He is actively fomenting rebellion against....himself.  I suppose the question of the upcoming election is the one originally posed by Abraham Lincoln: how many people can you really fool?  Can you really fool all the people all the time?  I guess we will find out."

2020-04-20 10:30:40,That Trump is incompetent and corrupt was evident even before he became “president”. But his decision to divide and misinform the public to either prop up stocks or hide his colossal misjudgment during this crisis shows that he is evil. Pure evil.

This picture has been retweeted thousands of times on Twitter this morning.  My first reaction was one of horror - that these animals in the SUV could really do this.  But to see the nurse standing his ground in silence is one of the most moving things I have ever seen.  

Shame on anyone who sees this photo and can side with trump, or his deranged followers who would abuse the healthcare workers who are today's heroes and trying to save people.  Unfortunately, they cannot save people from their own ignorance and stupidity."

I guess we'll find out!) by characterizing the tests as ""beautiful"" and ""perfect.""

That was back on March 9th. Well, where's my test? Where's my aunt's test? Where are my friends' tests? Where are my neighbors' tests?

I know no one who has been tested. I cannot see how we can even contemplate getting the country back on track until we have widespread testing. 

WHERE ARE THE TESTS?"

I can't imagine them preventing Covid-19 with their guns. It looks like Trump knows he has trouble ahead and is taking out as many as he can before then.
2020-04-20 12:15:56,"The Federal Government is made up of employees who are important to our system. Trump has appointed people as heads of agencies who are barely more competent than he is.  The real danger here is beyond the virus and all the way to Trump. The states recognize their needs and limitations. Trump does not.  Incompetence, ignorance, laziness, narcissism and an abiding dislike for mankind are Trumps strengths. He is not going to give the states what they need. He cannot because he does not know how or why he should.  He manages to use our system to his advantage and to our disadvantage and here in lies the real danger."
2020-04-20 12:16:57,Aren't Americans tired of reading the latest craziness from Trump? He seems to be doing everything he can to hold on to power and avoid the lawsuits coming his way once he leaves the White House.

Let them suffer among themselves; let them march and yell in an enclosed space. It’s damaging to the responsible parties in many ways that you let them have their way; let them suffer among themselves.
2020-04-20 12:03:18,"The protestors strike me as extraordinarily childish and selfish. Their country has asked them to sacrifice to help stop the spread of a fatal disease. But instead of serving, they put themselves, their fellow citizens, and our heroic health care workers at even greater risk. These people can wave all the flags and shout ""liberty"" all they want: they are not patriots. They are shirkers, draft dodgers, avoiding their country's call to duty and aiding and abetting the enemy."
2020-04-20 12:03:31,"Governor Cuomo and some other democrats put millions of New Yorkers at risk by not mandatorily closing borders or enforcing lockdown as Trump once suggested. At that time to criticize Trump, Cuomo spoke nonsense like federalism under threat and ""civil War"" like scenario, etc. When Trump suggested that the Federal Government will make all decisions, all Democrats ganged up to say that the Governors need to be in charge.  So these guys spoke about how they need to be in-charge of the COVID-19 related decisions and yet criticize Trump for all of their failures when thousands have died under their watch? By the way New York City is also a sanctuary city which attracts thousands of illegal immigrants as they don't have to fear of getting arrested for their status. Now they are the ones who are most affected by the crisis. The democrats are responsible for their misery and deaths as they are the ones to encourage them to break law and settle in New york without making sure that the city has adequate infrastructure if they get sick."

You don't know what you don't know!.  Unless/until you test you have no idea the extent of virus-positive people.  This is especially true if there are individuals who are asymptomatic, but still shedding the virus; i.e. ""Typhoid Mary"" types!  Community isolation reduces the person-to-person contacts of any virus-shedders.  Take away those restrictions without knowing that those people exist, and the outbreak begins again!"

2020-04-20 12:04:54,"President Trump claiming that there are plenty of coronavirus tests currently available, while failing to acknowledge that there is a shortage of reagent, nasal swabs, tubes and fluid to actually carry them out, is the equivalent of  a deadbeat sending his creditor ten checks to pay his entire bill, without signing any of them or actually having any money in his account.   This kind of obfuscation may fool Trump's base but it isn't fooling the governors or anyone else."

Of course Republicans don’t want to reimburse states for their costs and expenses.  The ones in most need are blue states!  All the more reason for Dems to dig in their heels and point out the gross inequities in aid formulas and aid disbursed already.

That has weakened your persistence
To maintain your social distance?
Sick of hearing people ask,
As you try to multitask,

And enraged by quarantine    
Or by faces half-way seen
And that phrase, Covid-19?
Morning news sounds each day choral
While at night it’s all made formal:
“We are living the new normal.”
In or out of clement weather,
We’re still birds of common feather,
Feel the urge to flock together.
Let’s repel the fierce resistance
That would slacken our persistence
To keep up our social distance.
Watch how numbers downward spiral
When our self-control goes viral."
2020-04-20 12:09:47,"Our leadership, which bought its way into power with corporate money, is failing in its responsibilities to citizens, but our leadership faithfully fulfills its responsibility to its corporate sponsors. 

Wars, pandemics and natural disasters call for emergency measures--so we willingly give leaders emergency powers. These include the relaxation of regulations to facilitate the response to the emergency. The plutocracy we are governed by uses this opportunity to remove or relax regulations that corporate lobbyists have been fighting for years. 

(For clarity and brevity, I here omit the long list of additional obvious and egregious examples of rent-seeking, graft, bribery, revolving door careers, and good old fashioned corruption that passes for governance in the USA).

America has demonstrated that unrestrained capitalism has taken control, and that the profit-making framework imposed on health care, governance, incarceration, the military, transportation and communication have produced a neutered, powerless population in the stranglehold of corporate greed. 

And you thought our problem was a VIRUS! HAH!"
2020-04-20 12:05:06,I believe that testing capabilities need to coordinated at the federal level.  The problem is Trump doesn't want to own this responsibility because he knows he's in way over his head.
2020-04-20 12:16:17,"Mr. Schumer said the White House was “going along with” some of the Democrats’ requests, “so we feel pretty good.”

Once again the Democrats have caved.  The funding for testing is too little and way too late.  The same with funding for hospitals.  And the states are being blithely told to foot the bill for reining in the death toll and they are suffering the destruction of state economies, while the feds and Congress do nothing to help them.  Get a backbone Democrats in Congress, really.  Never believe that the Republicans will do more later, they are just lying.

As to the demonstrators, they should be arrested and their AK 17s taken away.  They are violating stay home orders and endangering the health of many people.  Take names, their leaders should be sued and prosecuted for reckless endangerment."
2020-04-20 12:21:50,"I get that a lot of folks are desperate. But instead of protesting not being able to return to the terrible way things were, shouldn’t they be demanding something better? Shouldn’t they be out demanding that the federal government take care of all citizens? Appropriately distanced and masked, of course!"
2020-04-20 12:14:23,"The GOP is operating in their ‘the cure is worse than the disease’ mode. They are bargaining with my life against the economy opening up. That does not appeal to anyone but the GOP. I would go along if they doing what it takes to lower the odds of my infection with C19. They are not however. They promise but do not produce. Therefore, I will not go back to work until I see their promises get to fruition. Keep paying me ‘my carry through money’ until they actually do what they promise."
2020-04-20 12:04:25,"This is one subject, Coronavirus   anti-body tests, and  Coronavirus diagnostic tests.   Don't snooze on this one.
Congress should do everything in its power to facilitate effective tests.  This is not US government as usual antics.  It should be a top priority, a unanimous vote.
The country cannot restart until reliable tests are widely available.
Trump's boast of 3.2 million tests posted on the wall behind in his briefings,, is not a boast,, it is a mark of national shame that so few have been tested.  There is a requirement,, for available, tests 100 times greater than that to get the country restarted.  Especially the anti-body tests, 300 million required minimum.   This is essential."

Last I heard there were two Democratic bills aimed at either providing citizens with additional, larger checks each month or temporarily halting the payment of residential rent and mortgages -- but no one in the media seems to be reporting or championing anything like that. $1,200 once was nice, but it's not nearly enough."
2020-04-20 12:09:40,"Encouraging regions to figure out how to get people out of their homes is necessary. Encouraging protests is toxic, and lethal.

To be able to reboot something that is a new normal for the next two years, we need two things, above all else.

The first is understand, contain, and reduce or maintain a plateau of serious infection. We cannot open doors and recreate the crisis. For that we will need a steady supply chain of medical equipment for BOTH Covid and normal medical needs. You cannot do cataract surgery, hip surgery, and dentistry, for example, without PPE. And you  need broad based testing, to determine the number of infections, the real mortality rate, and the ability to contain the disease to treatable numbers.

The second thing you need is public trust and confidence. Without testing, people have no idea of the real mortality of the disease, which given current data is hovering at 4-5%, numbers that are likely too high. If you believe your government is willing to sacrifice you, you are not going to anywhere you don't have to. Any business that relies on in person encounters will go under regardless of whether the economy is ""open"" or not.

This is Trump's mistake. He makes it seem perfectly credible that he is willing to sacrifice others for his re-election. Pushing protests shows him as more interested in re-election than reality - his survival trumps our survival.

The governors have their work cut out."
2020-04-20 12:17:30,"Note that Trump never explicitly endorses (rarely even talks about the substance of) this ""Open Up America Again"" plan. I'm guessing his only contribution was the title.

As with public wearing of masks, he agreed to this well thought out plan with no intention of using his influence to insure its proper execution. Rather, he will continue to undermine it (again as with masks) by muddling the message and supporting those gubernatorial actions/policies that fit his personal agenda.

Like an intransigent child, he agrees to follow the rules and guidance of responsible adults just to get them to leave him alone — all the while plotting to do exactly as he pleases."
2020-04-20 12:22:10,"It is finally clear that the U S does not or never had a safety net.  Not for individuals, not for small businesses not for institutions. We have been living on the edge, with no margin for any kind of disaster or way to recover when we veer of the road.  Most European countries have structures that cost money to make sure social structures survive. They are paying employers keep employees, they have laws, not suggestions, that keep people safe at home.  They have universal healthcare.  They have leaders that present clear messages to their people.  Instead of having structures to protect America, we throw money at problems, “hoping” it gets to the right place and not into the pockets of the already wealthy or to the loudest cries from powerful lobbies.  Even if this crisis gets worse, survivors will stagger out of it saying we have dodged another bullet and move on as if nothing has happened.  It’s the American way."
2020-04-20 11:37:45,The actions by this president encouraging unrest and violence is irresponsible and criminal.   Is this what we want in a president who blatantly foments an uprising because he wants to gain votes to get re-elected regardless of the consequences?? Not me.  Not anyone I know.

They’re actually slaves to a right wing ideology and politicians and talk show hosts who know exactly how to manage them. Freedom-loving sheep who think that just because the fence is hidden that it isn’t there.
2020-04-20 10:47:09,"Just when you thought trumps ignorance has hit rock bottom, he fools you and is enable to go lower!  What is truly upsetting is he doesn’t care how many people get this virus.  He has absolutely no empathy as to what Americans are going through between getting sick, having loved ones die, and losing their jobs.  He clearly has no understanding of science, or for that matter, economics.  Oh wait, that’s right, he is after all, the “bankruptcy king”!  So when it comes to decisions in the economy we have to all pray he stays away (which will never happen of course).  The irony of his recent chants encouraging people to defy the stay at home order, is these are the people who would be voting for him.  So if, rather when they get sick, they won’t be able to vote for him.  I mean, as he put it, you cannot trust the “mail in” vote..."

Sample this tactic by Trump:
""We’re going to put a hold on money spent to the W.H.O. We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it. And we’re going to see. It’s a great thing if it works. But when they call every shot wrong, that’s no good.” 

Reporter: “Is the time to freeze funding to the W.H.O. during a pandemic?”  

“No, maybe not. I mean, I’m not saying I’m going to do it, but we’re going to look at it.” 

Reporter: “You did say that.” 

“No, I didn’t. I said we’re going to look at it. We’re going to investigate it, we’re going to look at it. But we will look at ending funding. Yeah, because you know what, they called it wrong. And if you look back over the years even, they’re very much, everything seems to be very biased toward China.”

No, but the people who are out in the real world grinding it out are now captive to the government aristocracy.

This is a ""chain"" and you cannot allow any weak links.  I saw an article about a month ago about the small company up in Maine that makes most of this countries specialized swabs (no you cannot use regular cotton swabs).  It was stunning that the owner had already done all he could to increase production, but there was noting about the government stepping in to give him new machines and supply lines to increase production way beyond current capacity.

What will testing do for us? It will create three classes of people, those who tested and came up negative; those who tested and came up positive; and those who haven't tested at all. As far as the latter two groups go, they need to stay at home if they haven't gotten sick and reached the point of hospitalization yet. 

As far as the tested go, they may be able to resume some semblance of normalcy if they spread out and wear masks and take other precautions. That said, even the tested-and-normal can contract the virus on a moment's notice and become new carriers.

Trump still impulsively acts out, and Trump cannot stand being told that he cannot do what he wants to do when he wants to. Putin sure has in some ways weaponized the American presidency.

As of this very minute according to Worldometer tracking site the US has a confirmed death toll of  40,570.

That is over 7000 more than all the US military dead in the 3.4 year long Korean War.

Or another way to think of it is that is the equivalent of 700 Las Vegas Massacres.   Or an average of 8.7 Las Vegas Massacres each and everyday since the first US case was reported.

The WSJ editorial today focuses on hospitals dire financial straits because they are losing revenues for elective and other surgeries.  Total hospital revenues - not profits, revenues - nationally range in the neighborhood of $1 trillion dollars.  In the face of that amount of revenue, a $75 billion contribution is only a drop in the bucket.  This is a time when, more than ever, hospitals are a critical public necessity.  This bill needs to send hospitals a lot more money, more in the realm of $500 billion.  If we can spend that on large businesses, which have huge borrowing capacity in any event, we can spend it on hospitals, which are not large profit centers and which are key to surviving this pandemic.  Get real Democrats, push to fund the services we need."

By reality shaken, from sleep we awaken, and the nightmare persists unabated.
When each day arrives, the loss of more lives, leaves our souls and our spirits deflated.

From windows we peer, past our lonely frontier, at the world where we used to reside.
Those were the days, to quote an old phrase, before we were all stuck inside.

Streetlights count down, though there’s no one around, awaiting consent to start walking.
Neon still glows, but the ads presuppose, there is someone to see what they’re hawking.

Broadway’s been felled, the greasepaint un-smelled, with no chance of a roaring ovation.
Absent the din, you can now hear a pin, if you drop one in Grand Central Station.

And in Union Square, those who will dare, shop while maintaining our distance.
With faces concealed, and eyes widely peeled, we gather our means of subsistence.

Once home safe and sound, we scrub everything down, a process we cannot forego. 
The clock then resets, and we hope for the best, but we wait for the symptoms to show."

Professor Luc Montagnier, 2008 Nobel Prize winner for Medicine, claims that SARS-CoV-2 is a manipulated virus that was accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Chinese researchers are said to have used coronaviruses in their work to develop an AIDS vaccine. HIV RNA fragments are believed to have been found in the SARS-CoV-2 genome."

When they eventually go bankrupt government will lose 95% of that loan whereas the banks will have ""harvested"" most of the government money by calling back business loans and lines of credit.

She said goodbye. Millions of people are impacted by this. How dare this situation be politicized by those seeking to further divide the US in red and blue lines.

What a cruel slap in the face to the countless heroes risking their lives at the front lines, and who may be called upon to treat those deliberately sabotaging the recovery. 

Make no mistake, these protests are not about returning to work. If that was the case these people would follow safety guidelines in public protests, volunteer to distribute food, help educate their children, sew masks, etc.  (As someone wrote: the protesters are rising up against people who do not want to die.)  Rather, these are the faces of Trump’s army of aggrieved followers willing to risk their own lives simply to deflect attention from their leader’s failures.

Trump has been such a miserable failure at leading the country, that this tactic is simply another shiny object to distract and play to his base toward reelection. I blame Mitch McConnell and the GOP for this. Trump deserved to be impeached, but because the GOP essentially blocked it, we are stuck with a morally bankrupt and desperate president and his minions, all safely tucked away in the Oval Office while the rest of the country suffers.

Ask these virus sufferers (if they can still talk and breathe) for the names of people they had contact with during and after the protests. Then, go to this second-hand-infected populace and learn their fates. Later, investigate to learn how many doctors and nurses become sick or perhaps die from contact with these protesters.

It was summertime in our small supermarket in Upstate NY.  While we were year-round ""Weekenders"" back then; the area was rife at that time of year with the ""Summer People"".

While shopping we heard a woman's loud, unmistakeable NYC-accented voice, cry out for the entire store to hear: ""I NEED CAPERS.""

She was gathering ingredients for a recipe that had appeared the prior Wednesday in the NYT's Food Section.  I knew because I too had seen the recipe and found it intriguing.

As this voice pierced through the small store, startling all I remarked to my wife: ""No one NEEDS capers.  One may WANT capers.  But capers are never NEEDED.  You can go through life without capers.  They aren't air or water.""

Since then, whenever I hear people confuse WANTS with NEEDS I think of that day.

Yes, protestors.  We all WANT this to end and for life to return to the way it was six or so weeks ago.  But, we are facing a highly-contagious killer virus with neither a vaccine or cure to protect us from it.  We NEED to protect ourselves.

We all WANT to go out and cavort with abandon but we don't NEED to do so right now.

In fact, we NEED to stay the course and  follow the wise advice to do so.  So please stop following Trump, a man who's never understood the difference between NEED and WANT."

this country's failed response. The fact that CDC and then FDA veered from one extreme of caution to the other, first in rejecting tests from WHO and preferring development of its own tests (post the original contamination errors), then in approving any number of unreliable test kits ""subject to authorization"" but without actual certification is a severe
indictment  of these agencies' top rung decision makers. 

It exposes a very troubling level of managerial incompetence
that  must be fully understood. This makes all the idiocies spewing out of trump's mouth pale in comparison since his nonsense, while vile and dangerous to the social psyche,  has little true effect  at ground level in the trenches. 

I am not yet convinced there is no relationship between these
two errors of judgement  and interference from the WH. One can easily imagine chains of politically driven e-mail demands made to FDA to speed up the availability of tests that are fast but whose reliability is unclear. Similarly, one could imagine at a much earlier stage of the chaotic WH response that use of a WHO test was not politically acceptable since it implied our country was too dependent upon international agencies. 

It would be very useful for a group of journalists to dig into this issue via   many  FIOA requests. I wonder what would be found.

Especially when compared to what's being passed off as ""leadership"" in the White House by a former New Yorker who whined he was ""treated very badly"" by the powers that be in New York and so changed his residence to Florida. Don't get me wrong. I love South Carolina and it is my home. Indeed, I love it even more because come November I will be able to vote against both Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham."
2020-04-20 14:44:19,"Sean Penn, the actor turned disaster relief agent, has an aid group giving street-side testing for the virus, actually doing the single thing that will make Americans safe enough to stop sheltering in place. 

How many of these protestors are willing to volunteer to do testing? They could be spending their free time testing the first responders, who put their lives on the line, but as of today still aren't being tested. Test the grocery clerks in every town, who today still aren't being tested. Test the workers at the nursing homes, who have no tests at all. 

America needs hundreds of thousands of people out testing and tracking down cases, before we can let the public out.  Even Trump says that.  Pulling these protest stunts in front of TV cameras demanding government officials SKIP that process is literally like telling residents, its ok to turn your car around and go home in the middle of a wildfire.  

The only ones benefiting from this strategy are Trump and the virus, both of whom are solely interested in getting out into crowds.

And if Trump thinks the country is ready to re-open, why isn't he visiting New York, and Chicago, and Los Angeles himself, showing the public its safe? Funny we don't see him out 'liberating' some factories and downtowns personally, instead of hiding behind his gold desk, watching TV and his poll numbers, plotting his campaign."

Why now do we need ventilators for all of these elder patients.  If they contracted the flu...we wouldn't be using ventilators...it happens every year...tens of thousands die from the flu or some other issue...where a ventilator isn't used.

The inability or unwillingness to commit federal government resources to produce and conduct mass testing in the face of continuing State government pleas for help and expert opinion, and Trump's passing the buck to the States to deal with the situation as they see fit is disgusting toying and bullying.  

And then to rub additional salt in the wounds by encouraging folks to protest while hospitals are dealing with PPE shortages, full ICU beds, and scarce equipment doesn't just endanger the folks protesting, it endangers the rest of us.

This isn't just counter to the spirit of our Constitution, it's counter to basic human respect for life.  And for what?  To satisfy some depraved grudge?  To get re-elected to avoid prosecution?

While I agree with Sen. Bernie Sanders - for whom I voted here by mail in the Maine  primary - that the US economic system badly needs more accountability for how people are actually treated, more compassion, and more human fairness, at the same time, the last few years, prior to the coronavirus, have made it clear that a thriving economy really does help low-income people.

He says Trump's incompetence is epic and when we look back in 50 yeas...will see we put a NYC conman and reality TV star in the White House and got  a three year reality show circus.

And as outlandish as that sounds, I fear that with the SCOTUS majority aligned with Trump and all Republicans (except Romney) in lock step, it could happen."

Where is the promised support? Why is it not coming? I am fine with staying at home, but I don't know how much longer I will have a home if the state and the feds refuse to get their act together.

Such a national strategy should already be in place. Trump’s current fascination with small protest groups violating physical distancing restrictions is a showman’s attempt to distract media coverage away from his failure to swiftly and effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Without adequate COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, a rational, effective, and humane response to the COVID-19 pandemic is impossible."

Until then, for your own safety, and the safety of your loved ones, and the safety of the ambulance crews and healthcare workers who'll risk their lives trying to save yours, stay home.

And while you're at home, reflect on these two question: Why isn't the President who's telling us to rally showing up at our rallies? And why at this particular moment, given how very much the President loves rallies, is he telling us to charge up the rally hill alone while he ""leads"" from the rear? (Hint: bone spurs.)"

The national testing program is anemic - less than 3% of the population has to date been tested - yet Trump says we should all go back to work.  Then what?  It is akin to telling an aircraft' crew to fly at night in a storm, without radar to guide them.  ""Let's take off, and see where we land.""   Reckless endangerment is his recommendation."

Of course the small business need help and they need it quickly. But how on earth can anyone object to the items that the Dems fought for and caused the delay that the Republican are so mad about. Patients and Hospitals are just as important as small business, and since actual dead people might be the result of too long of a delay I would argue even more important."

It hasn't come, and the hospitals are actually empty and hemorrhaging money due to lack of patients. This doesn't seem sustainable."
2020-04-20 16:44:09,Trump doesn't want to test widely because he doesn't want us and the world to know how many Americans caught the virus while he was pretending to be President of the United States.
2020-04-20 16:21:52,"The protests of the stay-at-home orders are NOT indicative of even the tiniest majority of Americans. They ARE a cynically calculated attempt to create the appearance of a grassroots groundswell, so that the GOP can then try to shift the blame for the economic hardship that everyone is suffering onto Democrats, rather than wear it themselves as they absolutely should.

The Times and the rest of the non-Fox News media fell for this exact play in 2009 with the Tea Party protests. Rather than fall for the same flimflam again, the Times and the rest of the non-Fox News media would do better to start looking into who is organizing the protests against stay-at-home orders, and start getting those organizers on the record about why they are doing this.

Also, investigation into who's providing funding for these groups would likely prove (as it did with the Michigan protests) incredibly enlightening.

Finally, from an ER nurse who is a contributor on another site:

To the protestors: Your demand to ""reopen the country"" is nothing less than a demand for lots of other people, specifically the doctors and nurses who are spending every waking minute treating this disease, to die for your convenience.

So Ruth's Chris with, what, 6,000 employees, gets a total of $20 million when the cap per ""small business"" is $10 million.  By the way, their CEO made over $6 million last year and they let almost every employee except for cooks go.  So none of the fired employees stand to gain a penny?

2020-04-20 16:21:24,"Most are in agreement that Trump's ""liberate"" tweets are profoundly dangerous.  Lost in all of this, however, may be the perfect symmetry of the tweet in which he urged Virginian's to liberate their State because, so he claimed, their Second Amendment rights are somehow under siege.  On one level, of course, this tweet should make it clear - to anyone who might still be in doubt - exactly where Trump stands on common sense regulation of firearms to prevent school shootings and other gun violence by bad actors who should not be in possession of guns.  But, Trump's lack of concern for the adverse public health effects of gun violence is mirrored in the same tweet by his utter lack of concern for the adverse public health effects (not to mention the potential for violence) posed by the COVID-19 demonstrations he has instigated.  In both respects, the tweet suggests that loss of life is becoming increasingly less important to the man than reelection."

Employed Americans put money back into the economy.  Responsible Americans feel a lot better about their lives and futures when they're earning a living.

I have yet to hear an argument other than, ""It's the governors' responsibility"", as to why the trump ""administration"" refuses to use our tax dollars to advance the future well-being of our country.

We need a Manhattan Project to execute ubiquitous, high-quality testing of antibodies, for the virus directly and to make sure that anyone returning to work is tested and if they have the virus they should be quarantined, and contacting tracing should be done through centralized tracing.

If we had real leadership a command center for testing and contact tracing and information sharing as well as supply chain logistics, required manufacturing, assembly, quality control, and other required characteristics would have been undertaken six weeks ago.

But too many on the Left as seeing things in rigid Black/White terms...'you either agree with us entirely, or you are against us'.

We must consider the fallout of the lockdown itself.  It's not as cut and dry as 'avoidance of death' is always better than accepting death.  Nature throws curve balls at us all the time.  People die.  We all will die.  And merely 'being technically alive' is not necessarily always better than 'having no pulse'.   What does it mean to 'be alive'....'to live'?

The machines, by the way, are proprietary to the manufacturer, as are the requisite kits.  A lot of machines, with no coronavirus reagents/kits, etc. are a lot of useless machines wrt COVID-19.

The guidelines to reduce contagion aren't your mom yelling at you to take out the trash. It's not a matter of either save more lives or save the economy. The virus is not going to give in to your argument that you can't make a living right now. Your government and fellow Americans aren't the ones selecting option ""stay home for the duration;"" the virus is doing that. 

If you ""win,"" and in certain states that may be inevitable, you can return to work. That'll be fine until the customers, suppliers, and other workers fall ill. How long can an economy function that way?

I get the desire to have someone to blame, but it's childish. Who do you blame for a tornado? It's a drag, it's unfair, it's scary, but it's no one's fault. (Had trump attended to the multitude of informed warnings on time we might've contained it, but that cruise ship has sailed.) No one is doing this to you. You can't rebel your way out of it. It's not a liberal hoax or conspiracy. Science is not the bad guy. 

I understand how hard it is to tolerate those feelings of impotence. I sincerely hope this crisis is managed in such a way that you don't lose everything, that your children don't go hungry.

2020-04-20 18:19:24,"In most countries, continuing with the quarantine/stay-at-home/lockdown measures is a complete no-brainer. The US is an outlier.

If the growth rate in new cases is only just beginning to plateau in the US despite the stay-at-home guidelines, one can imagine the outcome if everyone starts mingling tomorrow.

If you don't want such restrictions in place, then at least work towards a feasible alternative. South Korea was able continue functioning more normally due to a high rate of testing per millions and efficient contact tracing. Even Germany which has the situation more under control than the US is only implementing a phased lifting of its lockdown measures. While some non-essential businesses are being allowed to open, most are still closed. Importantly, its testing rate is far higher than that of the US.

In some countries, treatment of the coronavirus cases has also been made free by the governments. It is free, not even subsidised under universal healthcare, because they realise it's a national emergency. Governments have also moved to reassure their citizens and help them preserve their livelihoods despite all the uncertainty around. Denmark, for example, has committed to paying all public servants for the next 3 months. If you move to help your citizens, you help to eliminate the desperation they feel and stave off descent into a free-for-all culture.

There is far more trust in these countries among the public and for the governments (which are competent)."

Obviously, this is sad beyond belief.  The scientific & demographic data on this issue changes rapidly from one day to the next. 

The federal government is literally paying businesses to stay closed and workers to stay home. Businesses are closed and workers are languishing at home because the government ordered them to close and stay home.  That, in and of itself, is totally unprecedented.  Unlike the Great Depression of the 1930s or the Financial Meltdown of 2008, the current shutdown was not caused by financial recklessness or by an underlying weakness in the economy; it was caused by a diabolically novel virus that originated in China and that has since wreaked havoc throughout the entire globe.  Before the medical scourge suddenly took hold, the US economy was running smoothly on all cylinders…and on the upswing. 

The devastating effects of a prolonged economic shutdown…in terms of our physical, mental and economic well-being…can indeed be worse than the original COVID-19 issue itself.

Heroes ARE everyday individuals who find the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming circumstances, and I have been surrounded by heroes all my life.  I have underappreciated most of them till now to my shame. 
The people we elect to office HAVE TO BE HONORABLE, EMPATHETIC, and CAPABLE, although without the first two traits the third is worse than useless.
There is always enough money to bail out big corporations. ALWAYS.  But there is NEVER enough money to build a public national health system.

We are in a pandemic but part of it truly is fictional. This in no way compares to the Spanish influenza. To date, there has not been even a million deaths globally. Not even close. Yet, our economy has collapsed. Oil trades negative, we are looking at north of 20 percent unemployment (40 million Americans without jobs that need/want to work) and we have a political battle in this country that is the biggest  that this country has seen since the depression.
The mismanagement has been mind blowing. When the populace learns how corrupt the distribution of stimulus funds have been combined with the massive inequality gap, there will very likely be riots. You can easily see Antifa and Trump supporters killing each other in the streets. This isn’t dystopian fiction, this is near future reality. 
Think about what an election will be like? The idea of a vaccine in 18 months is unlikely at best when the best minds in the world are not clear if humans can be “re-infected” from the virus. IF somehow a vaccine is discovered in perhaps a year, how long do you think it will take to make 330 million doses? We currently have capacity for twenty million. What if it takes two shots, not one? What about the rest of the world? Who will pay for it?

These programs need to have intense oversight and the money needs to be targeted.   The money that went to businesses that didn't need it needs to be returned to the program and all the companies that were actually financial dire straights as a direct result of the COVID-19 mandated shutdowns are the ones that should be receiving the money as should the smaller, established mom and pop shops; the delis, the small coffee shops, the dry cleaners, the gardeners, the small handyman companies, small insurance agencies and all those who are taking a direct economic hit.

What is even more bothersome is that quite a number of hedge funds applied for these funds and were granted them.

They are allowing that if you work in a personal office and you have no one else in that office that you do not have to have a mask on but if anyone comes in, even at much more than the the acceptable social distance that you must put a mask on.  Anytime you are in a common area, even if no one else is there, you must have a mask on.

I get the spirit of the order trying to address warehouses, manufacturing facilities, etc. and in general do not have a problem with it.  But just like so many orders we have seen they have been under ""Ready, fire, aim"" because not enough thought is given to unintended consequences such as them saying that landscapers when out working must have masks on. Lets see how well that works when the temps are in the 80s and 90s.

But the kicker was watching the governor's update and neither he, his sign language person, or head of the state health had masks on and they are all in a room with a bunch of media people.

It’s the government who has forced their business to shut down, the government has forced them to lay off their employees and it’s the government who is projecting things to stay this way for the near future.  

It should be individual people that decide what they can or cannot do with their business, their work and their lives.  Not the government making these decisions by pain of fine or punishment.  

There is obviously a price to pay for my opinion but the price of individual freedom and civil liberties is the highest premium one should expect to pay.    Giving the government unlimited power to affect our lives, then on top of that giving it even more and more power by virtue of a crisis is a slippery slope, and people are now seeing it’s far more government intervention that Americans are willing to allow."

Suddenly through the “exit” designated door three people with no facial covering but wearing MAGA hats entered the post office and went straight to the window.

For example: 
US meat plants are being granted permission to increase the speed of their production lines. This comes despite warnings that the waivers for higher speeds on slaughter and processing lines will compromise food safety.

The move will allow the additional chicken factories to slaughter as many as 175 birds a minute – the equivalent of 3 per second.

Under traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with individual regulatory waivers enabling line speed increases.

The line speed increases come as Guardian data analysis reveals that at least one in 10 US poultry slaughterhouses failed government salmonella tests last year. In some categories, failure rates are as high as 34%.

Targets to reduce salmonella disease outbreaks have also been missed, with a rise of 9% in the incidence rate over the last three years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As an American infectious diseases physician living and working in Geelong, near Melbourne I could relate to both posts, and I wish to echo the statements of both commenters.  

Here in Australia, the government enacted strong social distancing restrictions early on the epidemic curve and since January the COVID-19 testing rollout has proceeded rapidly. Right now in Victoria we’re doing more than 200 tests per week per 100,000 residents, more than four times the average in the US, and we have the capacity to double that number immediately should it be required.  Yesterday there was just a single new confirmed COVID-19 case in the state, and because of our high testing rate, we can be confident that we’re capturing most infections as they occur. 

There is talk here about staged reopening of economic activities, but no one argues that it should be done in any but the most carefully controlled manner. 

My mother, who turns 80 next week, is sheltering in her apartment in Boston.  My sisters too are old enough to be afraid of coronavirus.

What does a Southern parent working in one of those stores about to reopen now do?  The kids are still at home but the boss is expecting you to show up to work.

Of course, does the boss even realize that folk such as me aren't going to come into his store anyway just because the Governor said he could reopen?"

So, sweety, Georgia is about to turn their state into a petri dish with its citizen, and run a big experiment. Like any good science, there are hypotheses, experiments, and results. Let's go!

The Hypotheses:

- Not many people in the state of Georgia have the virus (seems true, only around 18,000 have been infected). 
- Of those who are infected, few enough (even those asymptomatic) are capable of transmitting the COVID-19 virus to someone at the gym, or to their barber or hairdresser (just inches away), or within a movie theater, or bowling alley, to cause a rise in the number of infections.

The Experiment:

Open up the above businesses, and others, and allow those willing (or trusting) citizens to patronize them. Watch the emergency rooms and morgues for activity. Plot the counts of sickness and death on graph paper, and see if it is flat or exponential.

Results:

I'm sure we will find out soon enough."

You'd need to test, well, everyone at the same time.  Plus all international travelers plus all undocumented immigrant arrivals.  And still account for the false negatives.  It's not possible to test and trace this into oblivion.  It will circulate the globe and be reintroduced here a thousand times over.

Look at LA.  Now we know the outbreak is much more pervasive than anyone previously knew (200k-400k, rather than 13k, cases in LA County).  The fatality rate will be far short of 1%.  And for low risk groups such as everyone under 44, it may only be 0.01%.  On balance, we can't lock down everyone under 44 for indefinite months where 999/1000 of them, if in fact infected, will be OK.

Look at NYC.  The curve has dramatically flattened.  We accomplished our goal and now we need to slowly re-open in stages in order to keep flattening (rather than only delay) the curve.  The case fatality rate for under age 44 is currently less than 0.011%.  We are winning.

This would be shameful statistics even for an underdeveloped countries. That no one seems to be concerned shows the rise of stupidity in this country, and the abhorrent idiocy of right wing conservatives. It’s also a reflection of our super expensive and inadequate health care system."
2020-04-20 23:22:27,"Opening up one State while other States are still experiencing increasing rates of new infection is the most myopic move any governor in US history has ever demonstrated since the South seceded.

Don't these Southern fools realize that people from their States will travel to others and bring the virus back home with them?

Besides being the most ignorant anti-science president ever Trump is also the devil incarnate for encouraging this type of civil insurrection that will keep America sick for far longer than necessary had he been an effective leader."

2020-04-20 23:31:01,How about they pass the development of the national testing strategy off to the National Governors Association with funds for them to hire an expert of their choice and suggest to THEM that it be--Dr. Fauci.  But don't say Fauci to because Trump will have a temper tantrum.   It seems stupid to hold up this legislation with a Republican vs. Democrat fight over a testing strategy.

2020-04-20 23:34:26,"Negative oil prices.  Negative interest rates.  Nothing like massive market manipulation by the Federal Reserve to create bizarre price distortions.  This is not a healthy market.  This is not even capitalism.  Capitalism isn’t about creating money out of thin air and manipulating prices to make even more money.

The purpose of the Fed is to sustain the “too big to fail banks,” which are now engaged in front-running, buying up distressed debt and selling them to the Fed for full value, since the Fed announced that they were going to support the private bond market.  Every dollar the Fed prints diminishes the dollar in your pocket.

2020-04-20 23:43:42,"Where is Dr. Fauci?
Georgia wants to open up though they have not had the required 14 day downward projections. 
People are going to die in Georgia unnecessarily. Kemp will have blood on his hands. 
Is Trump purposely keeping Dr. Fauci off the Coronavirus Task Force briefings because he knows he will tell it like it is? That Georgia is not ready?"

2020-04-21 00:22:00,"When NYT mentioned that treatments for other health conditions are being pushed aside because of the pandemic, I thought it was only going to talk about heart attacks, strokes, and cancer, which have been in the news a lot recently. Instead, brain surgery was also mentioned. I nearly started crying when I read someone finally acknowledging the toll this is having on people who need non-cancerous brain surgery. I was supposed to move to another area closer to university/research hospitals in March to find a doctor to help me. Yet, I'm stuck in rural PA with worsening skull-based tumor symptoms. It seems like far too many people incorrectly believe that anyone with major surgical needs can travel with ease right now, afford the disruption or even wait weeks/months for the care that they need."
2020-04-20 23:55:47,"So Georgia and SC are letting businesses, including nail salons, hair salons, tatoo parlors and massage/spas reopen.  But then said that they'll adhere to social distancing.  I'm wondering how you are able to get a haircut, tatoo, manicure, pedicure or massage with the person providing the service at least 6 feet from you???"
2020-04-20 23:57:37,"A little off topic, but I was wondering if any experts have expressed an opinion as to why, after a month of lockdown and social distancing, NY is still reporting 4,000 - 5,000 new cases a day. Is it that people are not complying? Or virus spreads more easily than was thought? Or masks are deficient?"
2020-04-20 23:54:42,"Well, at least one thing is certain in these uncertain times, the southern states can always be counted on to do the dumb thing.  I'm sorry for the reasonable and sensible people who live in those states, but I do have confidence that they will stay home until the medical authorities say that it is safe to resume normal activity.  As for all the rest, well, what happens to them is their own business.  Unfortunately, they will demand medical attention and take up valuable space in hospitals while using up necessary equipment.  Honestly, I don't know what's to be done when people  who know nothing about medicine begin to think that there is a Chinese conspiracy or that their rights are being infringed upon.  The real pandemic is not Covid-19 but unadulterated, widespread ignorance."
2020-04-21 00:16:43,"The governors call the shot on reopening the busybodies should stay out of it when it doesn’t concern their own state. Testing will help mitigate a future outbreak but will have little impact on the current one particularly in the hot spots. Get rid of these government programs that are merely the pet programs of lobbyists and politicians give the stimulus funds 
Equally to every man woman and child. They will know what to do with it and no bureaucratic red tape and minimum costs. I’m sick and tired of Trump , Pelosi, Schumer, allocating finds to their own pet projects."
2020-04-21 00:19:00,"Your country has not tempered the first wave of deaths or confirmed infections, which are now creeping towards 800,000, more than the next four countries combined.

And now some Southern States are going to create a new wave of infected people that will rob other people, who have been trying to self isolate and keep infection at bay, of hospital beds and medical treatment.  ￼"
2020-04-21 00:04:49,"The virus is in charge whether you like it or not. The virus will grow with any chance given it to grow. It grows exponentially, by leaps and bounds. But the most dangerous charcteristic is that what you see of the virus is two weeks behind what is actually there. This can be going the right way in social distancing or going the wrong way in crowds. Give it a chance and off it goes. There are people who want what they want regardless of anybody else that gets in their way. In this case they are courting death. Inviting death, for those they know and those they don't know. A bad death. Maybe for them too. Death is so final. Life is so precious.
Patience is a valuable trait to cultivate right now. It will help you through all kinds of issues for the whole rest of your life."
2020-04-21 00:13:31,"They can reopen all they want, but if I were over age 55, clinically obese (about 60% of African-American women), or with hypertension or other medical condition, you couldn't get me out of the house and into a Waffle House on a bet."

2020-04-21 00:26:26,"Rather than describing federal guidelines as non binding, how about “unenforceable suggestions “ instead. The language needs to be more precise for the reality."
2020-04-20 23:56:40,"Maybe I’m dense because I don’t get it. While I certainly appreciate the danger of social interaction under present circumstances, why (judging from the proportion of pro to con closure comments) are so many people so keen on keeping the economy closed for an indefinite time? Perhaps they are just getting accustomed to lazing around awaiting their government issued paychecks. Don’t they realize that if the government keeps printing money without production to back it up, the very money they are receiving will soon be worthless? This is unsustainable."
2020-04-21 00:03:12,"No surprise that the deep-south is opening up.  States that wholly depend on sales taxes--rather than tax land-owners--are hurting.  A Birmingham City council member just today argued that the city has to be prepared to make millions on up-coming events--sort of like asking people to die for the economy.  Also, no surprise that they're all red states:  like sheep they're content to follow Trump-Bo Peep, even if it costs lives.  Finally, this is commentary on the state of American society and the education system.  People are following their own convenience rather than the public good and following a leader who makes a mockery of intelligent decision-making and responsible leadership.  I would love to think that Trump will loose this November, but, then again . . . ."

Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. By spliting the response to the pandemic on party lines, leaders are not doing any favours.

When the need was for leaders, we have men."
2020-04-21 00:36:13,"The lie about this just being another flu gets bigger and bigger.  Physicals, mammograms, prostate screenings, dental and optometrist checkups, etc aren't little things that should be postponed.  High blood pressure can cause all kinds of problems.  Dental infections can spread to organs including the heart.  Optometrists can avert major damage due to glaucoma and retina problems.  My wife has twice had breast cancer that was treated relatively easy because of regular mammograms.  Reopening too early and causing a major second wave has consequences way beyond more cases of the virus."
2020-04-21 00:00:49,"This virus is coming for the old, the unhealthy, the poor, the unlucky and the stupid. Trump and his Republicans probably think this will make America Great Again. The sanctity of human life has no meaning to them."

2020-04-21 00:27:57,"Senator Doug Mastriano played down those risks. “A quarantine is normally for the sick,” he said, “but what the heck is going on here? I’m not sick.”

What an absurd statement - a US Senator should know all the facts about this virus, including that people who have it do not always appear ""sick"" but can pas it to others who will get sick. He and the rest of the GOP just appear so ignorant it's hard to believe."
2020-04-21 00:35:59,"It doesn’t surprise me that South Carolina will open things up in spite of inadequate testing and a Pollyanna view of this crisis. After all, Lindsay Graham did his best to ensure that his constituents, some of the most poorly paid people in America, would receive no meaningful financial assistance. Not coincidentally, these folks are predominantly people of colour. Making America Great Again by playing Russian roulette with people’s lives has distinctly racist overtones. Jim Crow is rearing his ugly head in  South Carolina and elsewhere. The statistics will tell the story."

2020-04-21 00:31:05,"Sweden has one of the world's best-run health-care systems that at no stage saw a shortage of medical equipment or hospital capacity.

Sweden has kept most businesses open and placed few restrictions on daily life throughout the spread of the coronavirus pandemic—and that strategy may be flattening the curve of new infections, health officials say. Rather than imposing damaging mass lockdowns, the government has left open schools, gyms, cafes, bars and restaurants and relied instead on citizens to act responsibly and choose to practice social distancing.

More than half of Swedish households are single-person, making social distancing easier.

With universal access to fast Internet, more people work from home there than anywhere else in Europe.

The country has reported more than 14,000 cases and 1,500 deaths, considerably more than the rest of Scandanavia but much less than in Italy, Spain and the U.K., and now, ""we're sort of on a plateau,"" said Anders Tegnell, the physician behind the relatively relaxed plan."
2020-04-21 00:35:38,"The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, mentioned in the article, purportedly supports the quarantine restrictions.  (58%)  Wait a week, it will be 50/50.  Two weeks: The majority will be in reducing restrictions.  Someone is eventually going to suggest the Northeast Contagion Zone should be impounded with total quarantine and travel restrictions.  The nation appears to continue its course to some type of Partition."
2020-04-21 00:35:47,"The map showing my area San Diego County having half the diagnosed cases (2,268) of my very much smaller former home county, New Haven, CT  (4871), was frightening.  

It showed how San Diego County's still restricted testing protocols  to those with symptoms is not truly reading the spread of the disease about me. 

Only when there is widespread testing here  to pick up those infected but not showing symptoms yet or at all will I feel able to go out safely. Even my N-95 mask I was given as a senior with special conditions I have to re-use is not fool proof especially when 70% of younger people still go about unmasked."
2020-04-21 00:42:12,Prematurely opening states as these southern republican governors are doing against scientific and medical advice is suicide.  Gambling with peoples lives is just plain sociopathic behavior.

2020-04-21 00:42:55,"What we don't mention, on top of Trump's epically destructive ineptitude and politicizing of a factual, but morphing, pandemic disease ... is how many people are sick and possibly dying from other illnesses, and are not getting the treatments and care they need, because the onslaught of Covid-19 has so drastically stressed our already insecure, fragmented, under supported health care system. 

And the fact that we have a President, a toady VP,  and a vile Senate Majority leader that probably do not give this a thought or a care, is entirely unforgivable. 

These men have not only failed our country, with their blind lust for power and easy fluidity of perpetuating lies, they have been complicit in overtly harming its citizens and increasing mortality rates in this nation."
2020-04-21 00:45:56,"Only the federal government can coordinate a national testing program.  It will be very costly.  We need the power of the  United States not the divided states.


How can the states with more testing, tracing and quarantining keep untested infected Americans from other states coming into their cleared areas?  

I am not optimistic.  Our economy cannot recover with terrified Americans afraid to go out in public.   We cannot keep letting nursing homes, rehabilitation centers and hospitals spreading the virus because there is NOT enough testing!  Prisons and staff are not safe. 

For godsakes, Trump has to go Nov 3.  He is killing us."
2020-04-21 00:51:55,"I think we should use credit score to determine who gets a ventilator if needed, using age doesn't seem fair to a 70 year old. I have more money to spend in this economy. If the economy is the most important thing at this time."
2020-04-21 00:52:32,"Hospitalizations and deaths should plateau, but number of new cases should go down more. Therefore, America is losing the social distancing battle and prolonging the interval of high hospital admissions. Look at the relapses in Japan and Singapore and learn from them!  We just repeat the mistakes of other countries and never learn. We denied problems early just like China, now we are opening too early just like Japan."
2020-04-21 00:53:42,I'm a nurse and I can say that it is a FLAT OUT LIE when Trump says that there is adequate testing and supplies. I know locally there is lack of lab capacity and testing swabs. The lack of appropriate federal response and Trump's complete lack of decency and leadership has cost lives.

2020-04-21 01:00:23,"Again (and again), any bailout of oil should be tied in to replacing fossil fuels, which are killing the planet, as an energy source.  To do this, put in a support price for U.S. and Canada crude at $30/barrel, BUT ONLY IF there is a permanent $10/barrel carbon tax put on all crude, domestic or foreign used in the U.S.  Use ALL revenues from the tax to subsidize the purchase of hybrid/electric vehicles, minimum of 50 mpg, and increasing this as the technology and production at scale improve.  This would apply to SUVs and pick-up trucks.  Further give the highest subsidies to the lowest priced vehicles to both encourage competition and make the vehicles affordable.  The idea here is to hasten zero emissions, and at the same time protect American production, until it, along with world production, is drawn down. 

It doesn't make sense to use the devastating effects of the pandemic to rebuild the same, when the overwhelming need is to switch to renewables, both in vehicles and the grid.  Any WPA, which will be sorely needed as work returns to somewhat normal, should address building renewable infrastructure into the grid.  An air conditioner should be a solar appliance with any extra energy used to run appliances and heat hot water.  Subsidize the both solar panels and installation.  In all of this domestic production can be mandated (suggest 80%).  

Make short haul flights obsolete by building high speed rail between major destinations.  At $15 billion, this would be cheap."

2020-04-21 01:02:36,"Why is it that Republican state governors are willing to drop the stay-at-home requirements and risk a. Second wave of COVID infections?  Are they not smart enough to understand the consequences of their poor decision to let the people roam freely about and make people sick?  Are the incapable of understanding the reasoning behind the need to stay-at-home?  Did they miss the part about there NOT being a vaccine to stop people from getting sick?  Did they miss the part about COVID being 20 times more likely to kill than the flu?  I cannot believe that people in southern states are less intelligent than people in North states; but it’s starting to look that way.  I can’t believe that people would be so careless with the lives of their families to risk going out needlessly to get a tattoo or get their fingernails manicured and pick up the COVID infection and then take it home to a family member that might get sick and die.  If you have to go out, go out for a better reason than getting a tattoo.  Go out and buy food for your family.  Do something useful. Think about what you’re doing before you do it; for a change."

None of the GOP governors in the south are going to want to cross Trump who is pushing for this.  He has shown little qualms of throwing members of his own party under the bus to keep them in line.

He has been encouraging states to open up before they should and when the inevitable disaster happens, with spikes of infections and coronavirus related deaths, he'll simply deflect blame with ""I left it to the governors to make the call on opening up their states' businesses"".  Of course if they don't open up real soon his surrogates will set up their organized protests.  It is absolutely irresponsible and it is patently obvious."

2020-04-21 01:26:47,"South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia are states that have not expanded Medicaid, so it is not surprising their Governors are wanting to put commerce over public health.

These states bought and sold human being until 1865.  It is almost fitting that they would  want to ignore the science and go on.  Get the economy humming – as the South Carolina Governor said.  

Everyone should now be informed about this virus, though, so now we will see how educated the people there are.

The excuse is used that people need to get back to work – but what it really shows in how weak our Capitalist system really is.  I will add cruel, selfish, and callous too.   A government that can not protect it’s population during the rare event of a pandemic is not the ‘greatest country’ in the world and certainly not exceptional or moral.

Spending on human capital is important.  A more robust and functional health care system and social safety net might have made this pandemic easier, if possible, to manage.

If more people in our country had access to good health care and could control their diabetes and hypertension, maybe there would have been less death this month.

For a long time I really could not understand why some states would not expand Medicaid.  Now I feel that they really feel some life is just not worth it."

[ScienceNews]

The coronavirus pandemic circling the globe is caused by a natural virus, not one made in a lab, a new study says.
 
 The virus’s genetic makeup reveals that SARS-CoV-2 isn’t a mishmash of known viruses, as might be expected if it were human-made.

Andersen assembled a team of evolutionary biologists and virologists, including Garry, from several countries to analyze the virus for clues that it could have been human-made, or grown in and accidentally released from a lab.

“We said, ‘Let’s take this theory — of which there are multiple different versions — that the virus has a non-natural origin … as a serious potential hypothesis,’ ” Andersen says.

Meeting via Slack and other virtual portals, the researchers analyzed the virus’s genetic makeup, or RNA sequence, for clues about its origin.
 
 It was clear “almost overnight” that the virus wasn’t human-made, Andersen says. Anyone hoping to create a virus would need to work with already known viruses and engineer them to have desired properties."

The question for all of us is why Deborah Brix would take part in this complete misinformation on the part of the Trump administration. She seems a sincere and highly informed public servant. Did she not know that what she was peddling was absolutely false? I have to confess that even knowing how blatantly she has lied in the past to cover the Trump administration I found today's presentation quite compelling.

When I found later that it was iike all the rest of  the bogus info sessions  I wondered again why is she doing this? She has nothing to lose but her credibility as a public health expert.

Not only do unemployed Americans have no help with healthcare expenses for their regular medical conditions, so far they've been unable to get medical expenses related to COVID-19 treatment covered either.

2. What jobs?"
2020-04-21 02:50:21,"Trump is suspending immigration.  Talk about pandering to his base!  Well, he has no wall to show them, the airports are essentially shut down, jobs are disappearing like water in a desert, so what should he do?  Stop people from coming to America!  That should solve all of our problems.  

This is a blatant diversionary tactic to drum up support from his base.  That is all it is.

Speaking of immigrants.  About half of the migrant farm workers are documented immigrants.  The rest are undocumented.  They are all vulnerable and open to exposure from Covid-19.  What is going to happen if they start dropping from the virus?  How are we going to able to harvest our crops?

These people are essential workers, super essential.  Instead of taking care of them and protecting them, Trump not only wants to get rid of them, he wants to make sure no more can enter the country.  That's one way to eliminate obesity."

2020-04-21 03:24:02,"Someone from overseas mentioned not understanding Americans' rush to get back to normal. It boils down to one thing: money. We have no money, we have no healthcare, we have no government support, and until we go back to work, we can't pay any of our bills or get our health insurance back. Our livelihood is tied to our jobs which all too often does not pay enough to cover what we need it to cover when we're working, much less when we're not working. Many of us know the health risks but can't afford not to work, unlike people in Europe. I'm a healthcare worker on furlough who is fortunate to receive a small Social Security check, so I'm not desperate yet, but here in Texas, the virus is spreading like wildfire still. 

Our governor wants to open back up already. We have nearly 19,000 cases here. And those are only the few who have been tested. Many more have not. I heartily disagree with his opinion that we should reopen. But it's not up to me. He wants TX employees to go back to their $7.25/hour jobs to avoid unemployment benefits being exhausted. It's always about money here. He doesn't even make a pretense of concern about our health."
2020-04-21 02:20:09,"Brian Kemp says the data in Georgia is moving in a positive direction. Reality has determined that is a lie. And a big fat brazen one, at that. 

Here are the facts: 

As of 7pm today, Georgia has 19,399 cases of COVID and 775 deaths. 42 of those deaths were added since noon today. 

This time last week, Georgia had 13,315 cases and 464 deaths. 

I fail to see how adding 6,000 cases and 311 deaths in the span of one week is “moving in a positive direction.” 

This historic data is publicly available. I browse it daily. I’ve been watching the death toll skyrocket in real time. How can he get away with telling bald-faced lies that will result in unnecessary loss of life when the truth contradicts him in plain sight?

The population of Georgia is 10.6 million. As of 7pm today, 84,328 tests have been administered. That’s a mere .7% of the population. Yes, I said POINT 7 percent. Not even a full percent! But hey, let’s reopen for business on Friday.

This time last week (4/13), 57,021 tests had been administered. They added 27,307 total tests in one week. 

The first case in the state was reported on March 3. Why has it taken 7 weeks to test POINT 7 percent of the state’s population? And now this considered a sound metric by which to base the governor’s decision to reopen the state on Friday? Really?

This ought to be illegal. Does he own stock in funeral parlors or casket companies, or what is going on? Georgians, please stay home. Your governor is a lying fool."

We'll not reverse this now...folks will look elsewhere, as they must, for leadership in this deliberate vacuum and I expect that all eyes will now look to Beijing.

Yet still, this morning while shopping with other seniors during “old folks hour,” which the stores instituted FOR OUR SAFETY, I saw other shoppers waltzing around with no masks like they owned the joint.

Unlike the sheep, we have the brainpower to know what is happening to us, but we let it happen anyway.

Oil is in the pits, the governors are battling the virus with little help, testing is woefully short and the federal incompetence continues across the board. Yet you are letting Trump control the news with political self-aggrandizement and overplaying a well-timed announcement that may prove of little consequence."
2020-04-21 04:05:15,"Trump wants to issue an executive order suspending immigration.

Maybe there is a kernel of a policy here, but the devil is in the details.  Too bad he has fired all of the cabinet members who offered genuine counsel instead of the sycophancy his ego seems to demand.  He doesn't have a competent cabinet left that can help him formulate a policy that might have a chance of being regarded as constitutional by the courts.

And that is the Achilles heal of the Trump presidency.  The president needs some basic competency in governing and in running his own White House staff or he makes ill-formulated proclamations that go nowhere.

What is actually possible?  Perhaps we should indeed declare a moratorium on considering new asylum seekers until the COVID-19 pandemic is past.  But somebody needs to design such a policy so that all the myriad special cases that might arise are considered.

Otherwise, Trump makes a proclamation that he's stopping immigration today, followed by a reversal tomorrow, and nothing effectual winds up being done.

That is the real tragedy of the Trump presidency.  He has no concept of how to govern.  It is painful to watch him flail about seeking approval which will never be forthcoming."

Do people not understand that this level of freedom comes from a strong government with laws based on a Constitution? 

And as for caring for others, why do so many people not understand the concept of shared risk? None of us know what lies in our future, thus having a safety net for those unlucky enough to have tragedies can be taken care of. 

I don't know about you, but I am happy to pay some premium to ensure all can have dignity in life and death. Personally, I am very grateful that I have been spared great great unfortune: floods, tornadoes, forest fires, chronic family illness, drug addiction, etc. But they are there. If we are citizens of this great country, we must support each other. The antithesis of this behavior I do not understand. 

I am an atheist, yet, there is a responsibility, and yes a duty to take care of ""my brother"". How is it so many christians have deviated from Christ's Beatitudes?

It may be the 42k deaths or the harrowing accounts of what it is like to have this virus. This result makes it unlikely that US citizens will flock to hairdressers, bars and restaurants once they open. This is probably one of the better arguments for widespread testing. Convincing people that the danger is past will be very difficult. One can only hope that the politically committed demonstrators who railed for freedom to congregate will be sufficient to open the US economy."

Right, because when field and slaughterhouse workers fall ill in numbers great enough to endanger the US food supply there will be plenty of Americans willing to take their place, just as Americans have always been willing to work the fields and meat packing plants at rock bottom wages under abysmal conditions--- it's just that, up until now, Americans had been muscled aside by those Central and South American immigrants!

Just when you think trump's made every wrong decision he could possibly make during the pandemic ... he makes another.

2020-04-21 04:19:57,"Closing the borders to immigration should have been done a month ago, and has the same justification as stopping international flights to the USA. It isn't a political issue. Not enough has been done to minimize travel to the USA as well as within the USA. This is as important as the stay at home requirements. A person carrying the virus can spread it great distances through long distance travel. There have been examples of this in terms of recent business travel. This is a time for prudence and common sense, not partisan bickering."
2020-04-21 04:03:40,"If we had a federal executive branch that knew how to govern we would have adequate testing and public health measures that would allow continued economic activity that would allow immigration as well as relatively Covid free work and play spaces.

This sounds like doubling down on the economic disaster that we already face. In any case, it is hardly appropriate to sow more instability when a global pandemic is going on.

Various states are now opening. In Georgia on Monday, you will be able to dine in restaurants. The virus has not even properly hit there yet. There are now more than 40,000 dead and many more cases than in any other country. Fauci predicted 11 days ago that 60,000 will die by August 4.

“We’re seeing an anti-science, anti-public health protest movement that actually is increasing exposure of law enforcement, and it puts law enforcement and mayors and governors in a trick bag, take measures against protests that violate public health and safety or, you know, they’re accused of looking anti-liberty, anti-free speech.”

“It’s a magic potion that could get us to violence very quickly,” added Figliuzzi. “We’re entering the most volatile period of this president’s administration.”

Australia's most recent cases according to our PM are actually coming from America.
I think that when we start having tourists again we may have to ban Americans.

Will Trump take responsibility should there be a spike of infections amongst his supporters?..............I think not, he'll most likely blame the Democrats and China."

This administration is in power because neither it nor the (significant) minority of US voters who support it are immune—to reason. 

This has been demonstrated; it’s as close to an objective, empirical fact as is the fact that the planet is more or less spherical. 

I do admire the faith some people have that, ultimately, reason will prevail; that is, I sort of admire it. But it brings to mind the faith many Brits, including Prime Minister Chamberlain, had in the 1930s, that The Third Reich would be friendly, respectful, cooperative, and peaceful once it controlled most of Eastern Europe, and that Hitler couldn’t possibly want to wage war on multiple fronts. 

Folks, faith in reason is sometimes delusional. 

This administration’s millions of supporters are so “high” on Trump’s Kool-Aid that reason can’t get through to them. 

Where does that leave the rest of us?  That is the question, friends, whether we’re ready to face it head on, or not."

Immediately started working the angles. Figuring out how to take advantage of network-wide ""daily updates"" in the form of 24/7 publicity and propaganda. Leveraging his power to punish blue states and reward red ones with lives at stake. Advancing his wretched agenda under the cover of an emergency. Turning American against American - and as always, figuring out a way to make everything about him, all the time and how to personally benefit from it.

Not likely many Americans are going into the fields and orchards to pick crops or man the processing lines.  Who are the health care workers and where do they come from?

A full third of our population has hypertension, which is a major risk factor with severity of Covid-19. Nordic countries also have bigger social safety nets in place and of course universal healthcare for their citizens. 

In the U.S., as we all know, you have to be employed to have health insurance, which honestly now, who came up with that stupid idea? And how on Earth did they convince others to go along with it?? The major problem with this whole system—besides everyone losing their insurance during a pandemic because of closed businesses—is that when people are sick and need the most healthcare that is precisely when they can’t or shouldn’t be working! Or maybe this was an intentional little gift for the insurance companies. Yep.. third round of chemo, the worker will quit and then yippee! We don’t have to pay squat!

2020-04-21 04:56:06,"History repeats

Over several years, consumer spending/investment dropped, causing steep declines in industrial output and employment as failing companies laid off workers. By 1933, the Great Depression reached its lowest point, 15 million Americans were unemployed. It was when President Hoover (R), appointed a Cabinet consisting largely of wealthy, business-oriented conservatives, established many commissions that were sponsored by private donors rather than by the government, and spent large amounts of money on farmers. It was an era of income inequality dangerous market speculation over valuing stock. There was the tariff war that Hoover started as well.

Hoover alienated the African Americans and to cut immigration to the United States he signed an executive order requiring individuals to have employment before migrating to the United States. With the goal of opening up more jobs for U.S. citizens, Secretary of Labor William N. Doak began a campaign to prosecute illegal immigrants in the United States. Doak’s campaign most strongly affected Mexican Americans.  Deportations were overseen by state and local authorities who acted on the encouragement of Doak. During the 1930s, approximately one million Mexican Americans were forcibly ""repatriated"" to Mexico; approximately sixty percent of those deported were birthright citizens.

Hoover avoided direct federal intervention, feared that allowing individuals on welfare would permanently weaken the country.

NYC knows the subways are unsafe to travel. Cuomo and DeBlasio know shutting them down would ruin the state, and their economy. The trains keep running. Has anyone come up with a “model” that can predict the future, if businesses and workers stay at home until it is “safe”?  The Great Depression ruined millions of lives and our standard of living.  The current situation is bad, but assured safety is not obtainable. Americans should make every effort to be safe.  Cities, states and the federal government have instituted plans to be able to treat people that are inflicted by the virus. Waiting for promises of safety is not a plan, it’s unobtainable. The consequences of an idle economy are far worse. People will continue to die. Trump will be held responsible, regardless of how many.  Will any economist with an ounce of intelligence come up with a “model” that deaths are unavoidable?  Will they explain the consequences of not going back to work as soon as possible?  I doubt it.  Generations of poverty, unemployment, and starvation are months away, if politicians don’t act now.  Our economy will save more lives than social distancing and being quarantined will save. Americans need to know that fact, and now."

From what I have read and heard, albeit anecdotally, Americans handled tough times better in the olden days. My great grandma, Nancy Momma, used to say, ""If we have another depressions, it'll be y'all's generation that ain't gonna know what t'do.  Im gonna know how to grow a crop in the backyard and feed all of us.""  Recently, I heard another centenarian offer the following hint as to how she managed to live so long.

For decades polling has shown that Americans want to drastically reduce or halt immigration and they have been ignored by their representatives in Washington.

From downplaying the threat, to opposing assistance to the Post Office and to states and cities, to instigating protests against governors' policies, to this latest suspension of immigration, all of his actions have been to serve his political interests. Imagine if Lincoln had fought the Civil War solely from the viewpoint of his reelection prospects, or that FDR had done the same during WWII.

There may well be other explanations for that non-occurrence, though. We'll soon find out what happens when other states ""open."""

In truth, I doubt most people who are protesting actually want to go back to work. What they want is some financial income to support themselves, and going to work seems the only way to get it. 

Funny how the protesters don't see this lack of income as related to the incompetencies of our government - a government who seems to think all people need to overcome this economic crisis is a $1200 check. 

If the government actually stepped in and provided people with a regular income, and or incentivized companies to keep their workers instead of laying them off, would we still be seeing these protests?"

Multiply this by the number of attorneys in the US that have children and household responsibilities.  Americans will not do this sort of work on a reliable basis meaning show up every day.

2020-04-21 06:26:21,"Trump takes advantage of the pandemic to send a message to rile up his base on immigration. 

Immigrant advocacy groups take advantage of the pandemic to send the message to us that immigrants are in terrible danger in detention and should be released, immediately, even though an immigrant who feels so threatened has the right to ask for his release to return to country of origin. Since so few do that, while knowing that their chance for asylum is slim, suggests that they don't feel as threatened as the advocates suggest.

It takes a lot of effort to understand messages.  Aggrieved people understandably see the ""rightness"" of Trump's message and fail to see the messenger.

Sympathetic people, as well as those who see government as evil, see the ""rightness"" of the Advocacy groups and fail to see the messenger.

As a result, aggrieved citizens, latched onto a paper champion because they had felt thrown away for decades and they  had no advocates in the Whitehouse, the Senate, the House or the Media.  

Immigration has been the fuel that lit that torch. Trump has the gasoline and he throws with abandon while the Democrats don't seem to able to be able to self correct and reach out to those they should never have lost to begin with."

Second best news is that Americans instead of Mexicans will now spend endless hours in scorching sunshine to put citrus on a rich man's table. But no, wait... again, we can't do that because that'd eat into Big Ag's profits! 

So we settle for keeping wages at Chinese/illegal immigrant level and employ Americans instead. Big strain on the welfare system (if there is one), definitely not a tax generator for government coffers but Trump's records suggest he does not understand finance very well. 

Next, we extend the travel ban and wreak havoc on the tourism industry, basically wiping out a big chunk of income of Florida, California, NYC et al. How's that gonna help the hospitality industry, I wonder?

Trump didn't create the virus, but there is little of anything right about how he and most of his administration are handling the effects of it. So NO to premature reopening. NO to Trump muzzling the actual public health experts he allows to speak only if they couch what they say in laudatory terms he approves of. NO to this immature overgrown boy turning on a dime without fact or logic and hurting every effort to heal the country, physically, spiritually and politically.

I despair that my country is doomed by the loud, angry, ignorant people who are so lacking in the ability to tolerate uncertainty or emotional discomfort that they have become a death cult. I don’t share their view that some human lives are inherently worth more than others and that this hierarchy must be preserved through dominance and enforced at any cost. I also know that no one will ever calmly listen to and consider a reasoned argument that their understanding of power is wrong and morally bankrupt. 

If you’re a person who is emotionally evolved enough to care about the lives of other humans beyond yourself and your own family, it is unbearable agony to see every ugly reason why mass collective action is impossible in the US. There is no collective. Selfishness and narcissism are our civic religion.

No, the coronavirus wasn’t made in a lab. A genetic analysis shows it’s from nature Scientists took conspiracy theories about SARS-CoV-2’s origins seriously, and debunked them [ScienceNews]

The coronavirus pandemic circling the globe is caused by a natural virus, not one made in a lab, a new study says. The virus’s genetic makeup reveals that SARS-CoV-2 isn’t a mishmash of known viruses, as might be expected if it were human-made.

Andersen assembled a team of evolutionary biologists and virologists, including Garry, from several countries to analyze the virus for clues that it could have been human-made, or grown in and accidentally released from a lab.

“We said, ‘Let’s take this theory — of which there are multiple different versions — that the virus has a non-natural origin … as a serious potential hypothesis,’ ” Andersen says. Meeting via Slack and other virtual portals, the researchers analyzed the virus’s genetic makeup, or RNA sequence, for clues about its origin.

It was clear “almost overnight” that the virus wasn’t human-made, Andersen says. Anyone hoping to create a virus would need to work with already known viruses and engineer them to have desired properties."

Canada is not perfect by any means, but we have always welcomed immigrants, especially those with so much to give.

Immigrants are a significant chunk of the essential workforce that make up agricultural labor, public health, care givers etc. Scapegoating the entire immigrant community that does a lot for this country just to divert attention from his spectacular failures is criminal, plain and simple. This would make the economic recovery even harder. All Trump seems to care for is the November elections and riling up his base.

2020-04-21 09:26:04,"2 important facts which seem to be lost in all the blather:

(1)  In the 1918 flu there was a false 'victory' so people ceased  their protective behavior and passed the disease on to others, creating a huge tragedy.
(2)  Presently, barely 1.5 % of our population has been tested.

The result is fear of the disease and total ignorance about it.

Reporters should skip Trump's daily 'press conferences' which are obviously publicly funded campaign speeches.  News outlets should issue a statement suggesting that Trump and his 'advisers' use this time and energy towards the objective of expanding testing as quickly as possible.

Otherwise, based on the progress we are making it might as well be 1918 or 1818 or 1718 or ... 18 bc or ...

He calls immigrants “threats” and criminals, ignoring the reality that by far most are hard-working contributors to the success of our country. Maybe where you shop, “essential” workers are often first or second generation immigrants, or they help care for your elderly relatives, or protect our health in our hospitals, or protect our country in our military or police forces.

2020-04-21 07:03:23,"? Validity of assertion by NYT re: reason for PA protest? 

‘Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Pennsylvania Capitol in Harrisburg on Monday to call for the loosening of stay-at-home orders so people could return to work....

At the Pennsylvania rally, there were calls to end “government tyranny,” Trump 2020 flags were flying, and some people embraced conspiracies about vaccines and Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder.’
———————
NYT states PA underlying reason for PA rally is so “people could return to work”

According to who? 
-Those organizing/promoting the protest? 
-Plurality of visual/verbal data observed among participant (eg signs, speeches, chants) 
-survey of plurality of attendees? 
-info from other media sources? 
-group(s) compiling data on these protests?

I think it’s important to be cautious when making such claims 

At the very least, sources should be cited; web  links to data as well would be ideal 

Far too many organized groups, etc. so far that have been cited by the NYT as objecting to, defying, protesting etc. have seemingly been doing so mainly on the basis of ideology & not economics

1st, 2nd amendment rights, “freedom” in general, etc have apparently been the key issues motivating them

It will likely become more common for some to claim that “jobs” are they key issues when they aren’t

some media has seemingly parroted unverified  questionable claims by some of these groups as if they were definite “facts”"

Turns out Panama's very rational neighbors, Costa Rica, won't let them pass through, as they usually do, because they're doing their very best to control COVID to protect their own people.  The virus is, naturally, spreading amongst the migrants and, surprise surprise, to the local Panamanians, and, believe it or not, these migrants are reportedly actually complaining that they're not being taken properly care of.  I'm sorry, but I'm speechless.

2020-04-17 20:47:46,"Excellent article. My 92-year-old dad is lockdown in a nursing home that now has a dozen confirmed infections, and it's very hard to get any information. I tried calling a number provided by the state of Massachusetts, but they just redirected me to the state government's website and to the governor's daily briefing, as if that tells me anything.

Visits have been prohibited for a month and now they have closed all the blinds to prevent residents' family members from peeking inside (the staff appear to not have any PPE at all). When all this is done, there needs to be a real investigation into the nursing home industry in this country. My dad's home is $13,000 per month and the quality of care is pretty bad (he now qualifies for Medicaid, so the cost is less). Where the money goes is a mystery to me, but it does not seem to go to the residents' care or to the staff who do most of the work."
2020-04-17 20:21:50,"I worked in a nursing home years ago as a housekeeper. There were no instructions or training provided on proper cleaning technique. Use of the same cleaning rag in patient toilets, sinks and room furniture were likely. Repeated use of rags in multiple rooms was common.  Even as a teen, the nurses and aids did not seem sharp. Aids were paid poorly. From all reports, things have only gotten worse."

2020-04-17 20:19:43,"Nursing homes are no way to live. They are expensive repositories for those who waste away with nothing to look forward to. As harsh as it may seem, this is merely Nature's way of enforcing the survival of the fittest."
2020-04-17 20:20:14,My father is locked in Brookdale Arlington Assisted Living.  The laws that govern assisted living allow them to live under the radar.  They are offering up to memory care and hospice in states with less regulation.  There have been at least 8 deaths and over 10 cases.  The administration of the facility keeps changing the information they provide families and lash out if you ask too many questions.  They began by avoiding the topic of testing with over 5 deaths.  Now they say they will test but no idea when.  They never advise on how to get your loved one out.  They are profit centers worried about their own bottom line more than actual care.  The staff is mostly very low paid people who are shared across multiple similar facilities.  They work hard to cancel that information.  This is a cry for help.  There needs to be a state and local inspection of these places where real data is shared with the families and the general public.

Sadly, the majority of property managers don't enforce.  I'll assume the virus can be transmitted through inhaling exhaled aerosols and second hand smoke."
2020-04-17 20:35:39,"After hurricane Katrina, New Orleans metro area nursing homes were found responsible for the deaths of many residents through their inaction. This example is even worse because of the secrecy from the homes' management. People went to jail in New Orleans for negligent homicide. This COVID-19 crisis will make that episode look like a blip on the radar screen."
2020-04-17 20:46:07,"These nursing homes have become death traps.  Families must immediately, if they can, take your loved one home to care for them.  If your not working you have an opportunity to provide for your loved one.  Don't risk them staying in these facilities."
2020-04-17 20:48:56,"I volunteer once a week in a well run nursing home but even an old priest who is there locks his night stand drawer if he has anything valuable.  Capitalism in the here and now recruits whom as elder care assistants...those who have no formal qualifications for any jobs and thus those who will take a very low wage and may live with large poor families in areas where masks might or might not be used.
Secondly, we gambled as a country on never facing a pandemic like this.  I bought an N95 mask years ago in Home Depot for ?$2 maybe since I was doing insulation work in my house.  Neither capitalism nor politicians with limited terms see the profit to them or need to store these in huge quantities in hospital or nursing home basements.  No one profits in the short term...for decisions based on a possible pandemic some year."
2020-04-17 20:49:47,My 60 year old uncle with Down Syndrome is in the hospital recovering from Covid-19.  The plan is to send him to a nursing home once his oxygenation levels are safe. I have resigned myself that if/when he is moved to a nursing home he will die.
2020-04-17 20:45:44,"Sadly many of the Nursing Homes are just seen
as Money Makers by the Corporations that Run and Own them.
I would be willing to assert they provided minimal protection 
for their staff from CV-19, while they vacationed far away

in their Villas paid for by the patients and Medicaid.
They hire as few staff as possible, pay them as little as possible
so the staff have to work at two jobs to make ends meet
and that means they work at different Nursing homes and 
bring any disease they have caught, unbeknownst to them,  
to the other Nursing Home(s) they work at.

If you wanted to plan a worse case scenario more poorly planned
out, you could not have done so.

Perhaps this disaster will bring changes to Nursing Homes

Meanwhile, Trump, McConnell and their allies refuse to fund assistance to those who need it most."

2020-04-17 21:02:42,"I think this is a big reason the Fox News crowd, and unfortunately many others, think this virus isn't much of a problem.  They look at the clearing out of the nursing homes as a positive since these people are really big ""takers"" in their jargon so letting them die is beneficial.  The other victims are not much better.  Killing people outright is a leap too far, but letting them die, is just a blessing."

2020-04-17 21:11:36,"Everything you need to know about why deaths in nursing homes are soaring--deaths of YOUR loved ones--in two statements:

(1)  About 70% of U.S. nursing homes are run FOR PROFIT, and PRIVATE-EQUITY activity in the industry has jumped in recent years. Since the start of 2015, there have been nearly 190 private-equity deals in the nursing-home industry totaling about $5.3 billion, up from 116 deals totaling just over $1 billion in the 2010-to-2014 period. 

(2)  Private-equity buyouts of nursing homes are linked with higher patient-to-nurse ratios, lower-quality care, declines in patient health outcomes and weaker performance on inspections, according to new research from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, New York University’s Stern School of Business and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

You know why your parents and grandparents in nursing homes are dying?  Private equity parasites--excuse me, I meant to say graduates of America's finest MBA programs--are taking over the facilities and cutting corners wherever they can to drive up profits.  

It's the American way.  Wall Street on parade.

They're not laughing all the way to the bank.  They're laughing all the way to the graveyard.  Business is good.  I guess you could say they're ""making a killing."""
2020-04-17 21:06:39,"Sadly, when it's your time to go, it's your time to go. You don't get to decide to have more time.

In Spain and Italy, which have very high death tolls, most elderly people live with their children; warehousing one's elders is not as acceptable there as it is here. In fact, many Spaniards and Italians probably contracted Covid19 from their asymptomatic younger family members.

Thankfully, I married a Spaniard. So, I'm sure that she'll keep me home as long as possible if I start to decline first (statistically very likely) and I'll do the same.

However, each of us has a durable power of attorney other than other should the other person not be able to make an end-of-life decision."
2020-04-17 21:08:43,"This article is an unfair depiction of the reality of this situation. If a patient with this virus goes to the hospital, they are placed in a glass enclosed, negative pressure room to stop the spread. How is a nursing facility supposed to provide that same environment? I have been trying to secure PPE for our staff for two weeks and every time we find a supplier, the hospitals are given buying priority over us. Not to mention, that we follow our state guidelines and what should have happened is the staff should have been told, by the states, to start using masks as soon as the visitation stopped. We all remember how long we were told that healthy people don’t need masks, right? And let’s not forget that all facilities have a population of patients that receive life sustaining dialysis and are sent out for treatments three times a week, exposing them to third party providers following a completely different set of regulations. I work in a deficiency free facility and even the best facilities could not have prepared for what we are facing. Let’s please stop blaming the facilities and instead look for ways in which we can support the care givers and the families that are knee deep in this unavoidable and terrible situation. All nursing home staff members are suffering along with every positive diagnosis and death. They are our residents and they have been like family to us as well."
2020-04-17 21:09:08,"This is a particularly tragic outcome of the utter lack of preparation the Federal government should have provided. But a pandemic does not enhance one's re-election chances, so it was ignored, minimized, denied, and politicized until the body count was too high to count. And still it is politicized, undersold, and massaged like it is all a ""witch hunt"" or some other topic to exploit. It is our mothers and fathers dying horribly and alone. Thanks, Donald."

2020-04-17 21:28:06,"It is refreshing to see so many people saying their loved ones were given great care at a nursing home. My experience with my grandfathers was the opposite. I have a feeling this is related to how much you can afford to spend. If you feel like the caregivers who work at facilities where good experiences are had are undertrained, underpaid, understaffed, and lacking needed PPE, imagine the conditions in budget options. 

Having seen family deteriorate inside a low-end nursing facility, I sincerely grimace at the thought of conditions in there. I also am saddened that family members cannot visit them to bring them the love and joy they are so desperate for, and deserving of."

 AARP, Medicaid, Medicare failed to effectively advocate for them and make a joint statement for emergency help to Governors and the WH.   Thousands of full care nursing homes in dire need for N 95 masks for residents and full PPE obviously for Caregivers.  WHO Testing kits in the interim at least. 

Another tragic mistake not to fully enact the DPA by our President.

2020-04-17 21:23:30,"Again and again, Covid-19 exposes the fault lines in American society: income inequality, inadequate healthcare system, greed trumping foresight. 

This article reveals dire problems in our nursing homes. A recent piece in The Guardian ('We're living in fear': why US nursing homes became incubators for the coronavirus) suggests that employees' low wages, which force them to work at multiple jobs (where they are exposed to the virus and then unknowingly pass it on to others) are a major driver of the Covid-19 death toll. More than half of fatalities are occurring in people over 80."
2020-04-17 21:27:29,"My father's nursing home - one of these ""death pits"" - loses money when elderly residences live a long life. I believe many of these elderly were allowed to die or literally murdered. Who knows for sure if all these people who died actually died from Covid-19?

2020-04-17 20:31:23,"The average life span of someone in a nursing home is two years. My experience with these homes, through my parents is that the hard working and highly dedicated people who work there are grossly underpaid but still willing to provide the best care they can for the elderly. The people that cared for my parents were wonderful; the best among us. The elderly in these homes are there because their families can no longer care for them. Most are in their last years or months. 
Please stop blaming the hard working people who run these places. They are performing herculean tasks daily and are willingly sacrificing their own health to keep these places open. We can and should certainly work to provide people the best life within the limits of our resources but we cannot stop people  at the extreme end of life from dieing (from something)."
2020-04-17 20:16:21,"Simply, there are a lot of good and brave people out there caring for our parents, grandparents aunt, uncles and many others.   I'm glad this piece reflects that. 

I'm hoping my mother's nursing home remains uninfected. They did initiate use of masks very early, and had been on a sanitizing frenzy since an outbreak of flu in January. Gloves have always been available ( if they have been able to get them)  But staffing is a problem in the best of times - - 

Now, without regular visitors who helped in feeding relatives or others, and sometimes in toileting , and others who entertained, or just socialized, there's more and more for CNAs to do. And a massive weight on the very limited number of nurses. 

When this has let up - -  these caretakers are going to be utterly exhausted -- they must be already -  yet it isn't as if there is a relief team ready to give them a real break.    The aftermath of this is going to be difficult to deal with, not unlike the aftermath of a war. 

Something that hasn't been mentioned: it is possible that some nursing homes will go out of business. They aren't being used for new rehab stays, because nonessential surgery isn't being done. And people may go to great lengths to avoid these residences. Yet with an aging population we still need to plan for an adequate supply of this type of care, in perhaps a new form."
2020-04-17 20:10:29,"My husband, because of Parkinson’s Disease, has needed to be in a senior facility for the past six years. What I have learned during this personal odyssey of challenges and struggles is that our elders are the Forgotten Ones. I speak mainly of assisted living and memory care institutions. The bottom line is profit for the owners. As a result, caregivers are more often than not incapable of giving even adequate yet alone good care to the more vulnerable. These caregivers’ salaries are pitiful, especially if one is trying to pay rent or buy groceries. To add to this, staff is kept to a minimum and according to the low bars set by the states. And keep in mind that the costs of these places are unconscionably high. If my husband did not have long term care insurance, we would have lost most of what we earned over 50 years of marriage. Sadly, I am not surprised at the amount of deaths in our care facilities due to Covid-19. But what an absolute disgrace that our seniors are treated so horribly. They deserve dignity and respect and love during their final years on this earth. Nothing less will do."
2020-04-17 20:22:56,"I am stunned into utter sadness by this wretched story. It is heartbreaking. 

If fires had swept through these facilities and took the lives of scores of residents, the police would be arresting the owners for negligence.  The virus is a fire and these administrators need to be arrested. It’s a crime."
2020-04-17 21:39:58,"It is truly sad to hear these vulnerable folks have met their demise from this virus. However, I would like to add that ""nursing"" homes are not the best place for old people to begin with.
My wife is an RN and she worked briefly in a palliative care facility, and at other nursing homes thru an agency. She told me that when started in that facility she came across patients requiring immense amount of care and when she raised her concerns with others (long term employees) and even the doctors, one of the doctor pulled her aside and said:""these folks are here to die, manage their pain and that's the extent of the care, or send them to a hospital if they become too difficult."" My wife resigned from that role soon after and has said that she will never work in such a facility, as she saw similar behavior in other such places as well.
My own mother is 85, lives at home with one of my sister and is fully mobile in her affairs. I have seen similar situations in other families from Muslim backgrounds. The old are not just thrown away to rot in a nursing home. They are cared for by the members of the family and they stay at home. The elders command respect. What I have noticed in the west is that the old are sent off to these nursing home prisons where they go to a lonely life and eventually die. The kids that these old folks raised, cared for, just abandon them.
This societal behavior requires a different playbook. The old should not be abandoned as small children are not."
2020-04-17 20:40:09,As a mother of a severely developmental ly handicapped adult (age 22) my heart palpitated with fear as I read your article.  Why aren’t the accreditation standards higher?  Why don’t the staff practice hospital standard hygiene precautions.   The profit driven motive of these privately owned facilities have been under the radar too long.  The voiceless and vulnerable need protection as they give us their unconditional love.
2020-04-17 21:46:06,"So nearly 20% of the Covid deaths in the US are in nursing homes, but the governors are closing such disease hotbeds as golf courses, department stores, parks, etc.  

Shouldn't our leaders be smart enough to recognize that some businesses/institutions have high risk of disease transmission and others have nearly zero?  

Have you noticed that all government employees are ""essential?""  While there are now more than 20 million newly unemployed workers from the private sector all government employees are still on the payroll.  Air travel is down 97% but we still have 100% of the TSA screeners getting paid."
2020-04-17 21:55:15,"The close quarters and frail nature of nursing home residents along with a myriad of chronic disorders they struggle with make them ready targets for infection and complications.  Not often discussed is the role of the nursing home staff in introducing infection.  Protocols for nursing staff need review.  For instance, do they undergo a health check, including body temperature, prior to starting each of their work shifts and are they restricted from physical proximity to patient areas until they pass.  Many work shifts in more than one facility, making it more likely that they carry infection.  For residents, it's a more than tragic way to die, away from family which cannot visit while so completely vulnerable to the virus which stalks them as they are helpless to protect themselves."
2020-04-17 21:41:02,"I fear the number is much larger. I heard from a friend ,whose father was in a nursing home, that his dad's death certificate stated pneumonia as the cause of death but when asked if his father was tested he learned he was positive for COVID-19. It seems lying is another contagious virus we have to worry about."
2020-04-17 21:41:46,"trump removed some health care regulations for Senior homes starting last July because they were a ""burden to the operators"". They removed the requirement to have a specialist in infections on staff. They didn't want to make regulations so burdensome that they ""hurt the industry"". In other words, let's make more money off of the elderly.  Who cares if it not only endangers the residents, but also of those who care for them? Just as long as the owners increase their income numbers all is good. The usual priority for the trump administration."

I lost my 84-year-old mom last October, and find myself feeling grateful she doesn't have to experience COVID-19 because she would have been at very high risk. Anyone who suggests, like the Texas lieutenant governor, that older folks should ""sacrifice"" themselves for the sake of the economy really should be exiled from the human race. Come to think of it, there's an entire political party that should join them...but only after they ""go first"" and put themselves and their loved ones at risk."
2020-04-17 22:12:25,"I read this article with sadness, compounded by having just read elsewhere that half the residents of a local nursing home are Covid19 patients and ten per cent have died. 
    For the past five years I have been part of the team who bring communion to Catholic residents.  As such, I care about them but can be reasonably objective in a way that I might not be if a close relative lived there.  
     When I visit, the activities director and I are greeted cheerfully by residents who are well cared for in clean rooms.  If tragic deaths can happen there, they can happen anywhere. Asymptomatic staff can unknowingly  spread Covid19.  I hope that the ongoing tragedy will not be compounded by scapegoating of people who are doing their best
     I hope very much that"
2020-04-17 22:18:13,"Nursing home residents require the daily face-to-face care of attendants who work with many people, often at multiple facilities.  Masks, PPE, and continuous sanitization were never expected or wanted.  Group meals and activities were ""therapeutic.""  Family visits were encouraged.  Social distancing (isolation) meant depression or abuse.

Accreditation standards never envisioned a viral pandemic this contagious. 

Absent some daily means to check all residents, staff, and visitors for infection or antibodies, any ""protection"" will be breached.

However, it would do no harm, and cost little, to demand that all residents in convalescent and nursing homes be given 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily.  Most of the elderly, indoors-bound residents have severe deficiencies, which greatly compromise their resistance to respiratory infections.  In fact, most US adults should get a vitamin D supplement.  Although not perfect protection against COVID-19, the return on investment would be vastly greater than money spent on ventilators or speculative ""cures."""
2020-04-17 22:25:31,"If we had a functional government that cares, we could push for standardized information on all nursing homes e.g. price, for profit/not for profit, staff to patient ratio, affiliation with hospitals, incidence of bed sores, infections, accidents. Gerontologists should advise on what factors to include in a rating system that the public can consult before deciding on a nursing home for their kin.

But we don't have a functional government."
2020-04-17 22:24:36,"This is terrible, but I cannot understand the comments asking why more couldn’t be done, or why the accreditation standards are not higher.  
How many nursing home residents or families pay for the care they receive? Very few... it is mostly Medicaid.  Medicaid is a terrible payer.  Too little.  The staff is bare bones out of necessity.  And every time a patient falls, there is a lawsuit as if it were preventable.  
Now comes Covid.  It is contagious.  How can nursing home patients be isolated? If the were, there would be suits for abandonment.  The staff gets sick.... are there loads of staff members waiting it the wings?
I know this will sound harsh, but nursing home patients are largely waiting to die.  I am not suggesting abandoning them, but nobody expects nursing home patients to live forever. But on a simpler note, where should all the resources “to have prevented this” come from?"
2020-04-17 22:09:27,"My dad spent 4 years in a nursing home before his death from Alzheimer’s  in 2003.  To watch this extremely intelligent man reduced to barely existing, lying in wet diapers most of the day, was torture for all of us in the family. When I walked into the nursing home to visit, I could immediately tell how the staffing was that day by how bad the stench was.  Nursing homes are basically a broken health care model.  I’m not sure what the answer is.  We would have welcomed CoVid ending his suffering before Alzheimer’s did."
2020-04-17 22:33:55,"Please stop quoting all of the lobbyists for nursing homes and their trade papers. They don't need the press time. What is needed is to re-align nursing homes as a place that gives care to patients and their employees. And what the public needs is laws that have teeth in them to monitor the leverage and brokering of nursing homes for profits that are divided up over the corpses of our elders. Just because people are low paid does not mean they are less than. Let's change that.
The idea of customer service over contagious disease happened because people who own nursing homes have no idea and often don't care until they get bad press."
2020-04-17 21:58:39,These facilities do what they can with the abhorrent reimbursement they are provided for such care.  The patients are more valuable to health systems as sources of billing for the likely-limited-benefit procedures hospitals will extract from their payor source before sending them right back.  We get what we pay for in this nation.  It just took this pandemic to show those who are not part of the front lines of medicine that the emperor has no clothes.  But we have known all along and are powerless to change it.
2020-04-17 22:16:40,"I hold no brief whatsoever for Individual One, the Right, or any of that.
But that said, the headline on this article, that quotes someone saying ""They're Death Pits"", while in the final analysis is probably true, still needs some perspective.
It is a well known time proven fact that Nursing homes and like facilities are regularly cleaned out during the cold and flu season because of elderly clientele, in close proximity, who catch these things, which go down into their lungs and develop into lower respiratory conditions that KILL them.
This is coronavirus or NO coronavirus."
2020-04-17 22:25:22,"All nursing homes and long-term care facilities are as risky as cruise ships for Coronavirus spread. They are communal living situations with high risk individuals with caretakers who often work several low-pay jobs. It is an epic disaster in the making. My advice is to have everyone make sure NOT to call the EMTs for respiratory distress, because the exposure for them and ED staff should be avoidable. Make sure everyone has DNR/DNI right on the front of their directives to avoid a futile hospital course. The mortality in this population rivals Ebola or bubonic plague, and that is not hyperbole."
2020-04-17 22:42:49,"It's beyond me why anyone would be surprised.  Unless they just crawled out from under a rock.

The majority of these are, in plain English, little more than warehouses for humans.  They produce nothing as an organization other than good feelings for the friends and family of those that live there.  Because of that, unless the resident has sufficient resources, living accommodations are minimal.

I've been in many over the years doing work.  Rooms, maybe 15' x 25', hold 3-4 beds with only curtains between them.  Many have nothing more than maybe a lobby waiting room and maybe a ""library"" or ""recreation room"" for residents to go to.  In many the doors may alarmed with temp locks.  The kind that sound the alarm if they try to open but will release the lock after a few seconds.

Buildings are old, HVAC systems haven't been cleaned or upgraded in decades.  Most of the staff pay is way down there, little better than what someone gets are a grocery store or big box.  Because of this turn over is very high.

Using plain English, again, they are giant petri dishes.  Many perfectly designed and maintained to insure maximum incubation and exposure for highly contagious diseases.  That's why so many have signs clearly stating if a visitor has the flu or a cold not to come in."
2020-04-17 22:53:38,Nursing homes are run by private companies who will do anything to earn a profit.  Most staff earn minimum wages and are not trained professionals.  This is what you get when money is the only object.
2020-04-17 21:42:40,"Americans dump their old and infirm into these inhuman places because children and close family members can’t be bothered with taking care of them, without realizing that they themselves will be consigned to this cesspool once their time is up. There they bid time, waiting for death. So sad and a wonderful gift of nuclear family."
2020-04-17 22:10:19,An enormous failure chalked up trump's Health and Human Services Department and Seema Verma's management of CMM Services. Republican moral depravity in full view.
2020-04-17 23:07:41,"Unfortunately, the economics is that it costs a lot to properly care for any human being.   And when they are aged, probably more in terms of mobility assistance, special diet, administer medication, providing physical therapy, etc.   Since many Americans do not retire with that much funds and their kids probably don't have much extra income, the market is forcing down the price of nursing home care, which results in the providers cutting services.    Would be interesting to see this data sorted by type of nursing home ----e.g.  maybe by price charged to resident and level of service such as how much sq ft allocated per resident and number of staff per resident.   I bet there is a high correlation w the covid infection rate."
2020-04-17 23:13:31,"I am a physician working in a senior care facility with COVID.  It is truly heartbreaking to have families separated from their loved ones at this time, particularly at end of life. It is totally unnatural and against the order of things to not be at your loved one’s bedside when they are dying, and it is a burden these family members will have to process and cope with for the rest of their lives.

However, it is also important to recognize the truly heroic work of our  front line staff and our entire teams.  We are doing as much as we possibly can in the face of much sadness and stress- pulling together to provide both care and companionship, facilitating calls and video connection between residents and families, and supporting our dear residents, stressed and traumatized families, and each other.  We are not in the ICU or the ER, but we are on another front line of this war."
2020-04-17 22:04:26,"My father is in a wonderful residence, all safeguards were put in place 5 weeks ago, and have escalated in severity ever since. I have not seen him in five weeks, though we talk every day and I do pop by and talk on the phone with him through his window. Having said that, I am worried all the time. Fortunately, Dad isn't. 

It's heartbreaking to me that Trump and the GOP seem to regard these deaths as nothing more than an inconvenience to their economy. It's evident in their unwillingness to move heaven and earth to clamp down on this thing, organize the churning out of equipment and supplies while offering, at best, a confused and anemic response to the whole thing. ""We were not designed for this. We have to get back to work. Our country wasn't meant for this."" Well, no country was. America is not 'God's favourite', as so many like to believe. This virus doesn't care if you're a orphaned refugee in a camp  with little or no fresh water, or a Wall Street big shot with three gold plated toilets. 

American exceptionalism is America's Achille's heel, and in Trump and his minions, they seem to have found their patron saint. I wonder when I see him hug a flag that it doesn't leap from his greasy clutches."
2020-04-17 23:28:46,"In all fairness we should have to ask about the reasons why this older population was interned in those nursing homes in the first place. Statistics and studies show that 90% of people dying in this pandemic are older than 60 and have several pre-conditions such as HBP, diabetes and CV disease irrespective of the place they were living before."
2020-04-17 22:32:10,Hmmm....a virus that primarily kill elderly patients is killing in places where elderly patients live. Wow...who'd have thought?
2020-04-17 21:30:13,"the nurses and cnas that work these places place heroic efforts, working long hours
 the nurse managers, on salary for 40 hours typically put up 80 work weeks, even before Corona virus. the deal with lack of supplies.

yet instead of all the love that goes to nurses in hospitals, these staff are abused both verbally and emotionally, no love, no support, the public just vilifies them"
2020-04-17 21:13:23,"It appears that the higher end, private pay retirement homes with a care unit component are not much better.

When the time comes I want to stay in my own home rather than one of these 'death pits'."
2020-04-17 23:37:58,"My wife has dementia and is in a long term care facility near our home.  It is a well run one.  The Coronavirus protocol has been very good.  Visitors were barred over a month ago.  Staff and aides are checked before they can go into the secured portion of the building where the residents, all in various stages of dementia live.  All deliveries are taken at the front door by a member of the staff.  On FaceTime with my wife I have seen staff and aides in surgical masks but with no other medical gear.  Aides have been offered the option of staying in vacant room although this is voluntary.

To this date there have been no reports of Coronavirus.  It would take only one, however, to ravage my wife's facility.  Although each resident has his or her own room it was designed with an open floor plan to promote interaction and a sense of free movement.  This was seen as therapeutic.  In normal times this approach is quite appropriate.  It is one of the reasons I chose this place for my wife.  These are not normal times.  I can only hope the protocol continues to work."
2020-04-17 21:15:31,It is obvious the US and UK have and are failing in the most abysmal way to look after their frail and aged. The truth is the harsh Chinese propaganda that the incompetent money driven Western aged care “system” is falling apart and allowing their residents to die while billions are pumped into propping up businesses. A truly shameful legacy is being created and the Nations leadership has Nothing to Say about it and nothing to do about it.
2020-04-17 22:11:42,I guess no one wants to think about getting old. But this a tragedy of values.  Other countries respect the elders but not this country.  This country deifies the young. Quite frankly youth is wasted on the young.  By the time you realize what life is all about you are no longer valued.
2020-04-17 22:30:18,Remember when the GOP was depicted as pushing Grandma in a wheelchair and tossing her over the cliff?  it looks like they are achieving this goal.
2020-04-17 21:56:57,"This should have bee a no-brainer.  Elderly and feeble, these people would be targets for any infectious disease out break.  Our system for caring for the aged is another piece of our broken health care system.  People are warehoused in these places because they either have no one to care for them, or physically family members can no longer manage the care.  Nursing home, many who charge in excess of 10K a month, pay very low wages.  Workers work at multiple facilities because they aren't given enough hours to have to be counted as full time employees in order to avoid having to pay any benefits.  This situation is also on the head of the Trump Administration who has failed in a spectacular fashion to coordinate testing and providing PPE to health care workers.  States also have some blame, but the Feds should have taken the logistical lead.  The only culpable parties are the actual providers of these supplies who off shored production to China.  Now we can't get it.  Will there be a serious examination of what went wrong?  I doubt it.  Trump is too busy assuming total command one day and urging his followers to revolt against government the next.  It's complete insanity and dysfunction.  Meanwhile, people are dying."
2020-04-17 23:01:15,"Mr. Parkinson is completely right. I was medical director of a hospital once and took over the nursing home which was used for subacute care without a change in staff.  It was awful. We re-admitted people often the same day back to the hospital at big cost and had a revolving door. As long as the length of stay was low in the hospital, that mattered.

We as a society don't want to see the elderly, especially those who are demented, incontinent, smell bad, have food on their clothes, yell, and are parked in the hallway half naked because the staff is so busy.

We certainly don't want to pay for such care, rather instead to pay celebrities of any group and CEOs of nursing home chains and hospitals, and national defense the big bucks.

Few want to volunteer there, either.  Before Covid is done, it will decimate the warehoused elderly infirm, many of whom if they had a choice would have preferred to have been given some fentanyl that some kid in a rural county is taking, and ending their own life in peace rather than the agony of coughing, fever, and air hunger.

As bad as hospital workers have been treated in getting PPE and exposure, let me assure you that the nursing homes are at the end of the line. 

My mantra the last several years; Disappointed, but not surprised. 

My feelings: they can't be printed here."
2020-04-17 23:44:04,"Another success our for-profit medical industrial complex. But countries with robust public health care systems seem to have the same thing happening. We are getting rid of the unproductive eaters anyway. It amazing that these people left like this to die are someone's parents, spouse or sibling. Maybe it's a good time to consider taking your loved one out of the home for a while, especially for the unemployed."
2020-04-17 23:49:40,"My father died of dementia and my partner, who I live with now, has early onset dementia. I have seen a few memory care facilities and nursing homes up close, and am not at all surprised by what is happening now. One thing people may not realize is how limited the options are for dementia patients, and how this contributes to them being funneled into ""facilities"" where they are locked in together and often neglected.. The government (Medicaid) will pay upwards of $6000 to these wretched businesses once the assets are spent down, but if you are a person like me who decides to stay home and give up employment to take care of a dementia patient, you are lucky to get anything. I am fortunate to get $800 a month from MassHealth, but only because we aren't married."
2020-04-17 23:49:03,"It is easy to paint nursing homes as the enemy but to do so ignores the root cause, which is the government!

1.  The federal and state government provide inadequate funding to provide high quality care, under normal conditions. It is immoral there is not better funding for our grandparents and great grandparents. 

2.  While government entities work hard to get protective equipment to hospitals they have done very little for senior care communities. 

3.  As things have fallen apart, regulators have come into these buildings not to help solve problems or bring additional resources but to write citations and impose fines.  

Further, most senior living communities remain either infection free or have been able to contain and care for the isolated cases they have.   It would be nice to see some stories about the senior living communities that are helping keep people safe from COVID-19.  It would be nice to see some stories about how Senior Living communities are helping people with COVID-19 get better."
2020-04-17 22:44:13,"If we have a new government in place in January, it would be great to see someone like Elizabeth Warren put in charge of an overhaul of all aspects of eldercare. The pandemic has made all of us more acutely aware of how many Americans live on the edge of disaster, exploitation, and despair."
2020-04-17 22:52:23,"Perhaps the correct action would have been to shut down all nursing homes... ""about a fifth of U.S. virus deaths are linked to nursing facilities"".  My son's neighbors were infected when they went to visit a relative in a nursing home.

Go for the greatest concentration and then deal with the random infections for the rest of the population."
2020-04-17 23:27:54,"Last week I sent an email to Govenor Cuomo's website saying that nursing homes are chronically understaffed and which staff has historically been grossly underpaid resulting in a high rate of turnover.  I have seen firsthand how the just don't care.  They put in their hours and go home.  Not motivated in the least to do the best that is expected of them.  Because they are undertrained, underequipped to deal with complications and not paid enough at the very least."
2020-04-17 22:59:54,"""Overall, about a fifth of deaths from the virus in the United States have been tied to nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, the Times review of cases shows. And more than 36,500 residents and employees across the nation have contracted it.""

I have always been a firm believer in keeping hope and faith alive, especially in the direst of circumstances.

But after reading this deplorable and almost unimaginable information, I feel as if the last ounce of hope has left my heart and soul for good.  I could not stop staring at the quoted paragraph above.  I understand it cognitively, but emotionally it is isn't registering.

Today, right now, I fear this virus is winning and we are nearing the bottom of the ocean with no light in sight."
2020-04-17 23:50:25,"After it was clear that the virus would be spreading widely across the US, but before any regions had mandated shelter-in-place orders, a number of healthcare workers I know were already in the process of pulling their loved ones out of assisted living facilities. 

This situation was entirely foreseeable. It’s a terrible shame that aleatorio action wasn’t taken to protect these vulnerable people."
2020-04-17 23:43:41,"This is devastating to continue to read about.

Doctors, nurses, and patient care specialists who are volunteering to travel to hospitals in need should ALSO be assigned to nursing homes. PPE and medical equipment needs to be sent to nursing homes. And tests need to be prioritized for nursing home patients and staff. 

If we want to stop the spread of this virus and if so many nursing homes are affected, this needs to be a major focal point of our coronavirus strategy. Done on the state level, of course, since we can rely on the white house for nothing but egging on protesters."
2020-04-17 23:43:18,"“The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.”

― Hubert H. Humphrey 

By that test, the United States is an abject failure, and has been for a long time and in a bipartisan manner. We can do better, if we want to."
2020-04-18 00:07:57,"This tragedy is of epic proportions, and not limited to the U.S. It has afflicted multiple European countries, including England, and is not directly related to inadequate staffing problems.
If the govt. has medics and other trained personnel who can assist, let them. But, PPE is a must, as it not only protects the caregivers, but the residents/patients, too.
In the future, it's long overdue to rethink how this country handles the frail elderly, but for now, send in the (trained) troops."
2020-04-17 22:40:21,"Looking at those most impacted by this virus with early death - elderly, disabled and those who don’t look like GOP “leadership” - I can see why the right wingers and fox people want to open things up right away. They really don’t care. I guess I already knew that but it’s crazy to see them actually taking life away in real time."
2020-04-18 00:29:38,"My husband's grandmother is 102 and in assisted living care. She said that long periods of time go by, sometimes all day, where she sees no staff at all.  We can only talk to her on the phone.  She is trying to keep her spirits up but it's clear that the isolation is getting to her and she isn't being cared for properly. It's heartbreaking, and she would rather see her family and take her chances with the virus than be kept apart and alone. We would take her out of there ourselves, but we think she is on oxygen and can't be moved."
2020-04-18 00:32:34,"The elderly are seen as ""commodities"", and that's the sad truth.  Look, even family and friends often abandon their elderly ""loved ones"" once they enter nursing homes.  What can one expect from staff paid paltry salaries and working in very hard conditions?  Although I'm still in my 50s, I've said all my life and reiterate that should the day ever come when I might need managed care, I will call a Lyft, take it to the Brooklyn Bridge, and roll my wheelchair off the side (or tip the driver extra to help me do it).  No way I'd EVER end up in one of these ""homes"".  I've seen them.  No thank you."
2020-04-18 00:32:40,My 92-year-old great aunt is stuck in a nursing home in Ohio. She was recovering from a broken hip and now her family is unable to get her out of the nursing home due to the coronavirus. It wasn't until yesterday that Ohio finally made nursing homes release information about infections and it was confirmed that there are cases at her nursing home. They cannot get her transferred anywhere else or to a home care setting despite the family having many members who could care for her at home. I believe the most lasting effect of COVID 19 will be the lack of trust in nursing homes. The reaction from our family has been many members saying that they do not want to end up on assisted living or nursing homes.
2020-04-17 23:56:27,My wife’s uncle has been recently notified of his Covid-19 diagnosis. He’s a very wealthy man and is at one of the most expensive nursing care facilities in the country. He also has advanced-stage Parkinson’s. All these comments of horrible conditions in nursing facilities as well as the elderly being warehoused are hurtful and they don’t capture the full reality of this terrible pandemic.
2020-04-17 23:59:54,"I am a single women with no children, siblings are much older than me. I have nieces and nephews that I love and I know they love me, but I would never burden them with my care if I am to be in one of these facilities and loose my dignity as a human being.

2020-04-18 00:08:06,"At least 7,000 of the COVID-19 deaths in the US which is about 25% of all the deaths are connected to US nursing homes. The older we get the more likely our immune system is weaker. Also nursing home facilities are not always careful to ensure optimal  balanced diet and appropriate protein intake and physically fit with daily routine of exercise or physiotherapy. A lot of the seniors in nursing homes are not as well cared for as they should be and job of nursing homes is to empower people to live longer, they cannot perform miracles to help them live forever. Our system of caring for seniors has to be reevaluated after COVID-19 crisis has blown over. We need to for as long as possible provide home care and medical support. 

Reuters reports that out of 600 confirmed cases of infected US Navy sailors on USS Roosvelt so far only 1 has died ie the mortality rate is 0.16%. Also 60% of the confirmed cases had minimal to no symptoms and the rest had mild symptoms. Survival of the fittest. Health is wealth and those who stay fit with a balanced diet and optimal protein intake and exercise daily are more likely to clear the virus if they are infected by the COVID-19. I have been saying that for the past 2 months after I observed that the fatality rate was higher in Italy, Iran, Spain than is Germany and S. Korea, countries that have a healthy protein intake. Another study also shows that obese younger confirmed cases have a higher fatality rate than younger normal weight persons."
2020-04-18 00:52:37,"Lots of folks in a small environment. Whether it’s NYC, a cruise ship, aircraft carrier or a nursing home, it’s only a matter of time. 

Add to that Understaffed, Underpaid, Under equipped with PPE and it’s amazing that anyone is still alive in these nursing/retirement/group homes. And before you blame them, what do you want to do? Put more people and visitors and LIBERATE them? The only thing you can do is add PPE, sanitizers etc, test all of them (maybe even daily), isolate etc. and pay the folks hazard pay to take care of the elderly. 

But - despite trumps lies- we don’t have enough testing - even for the sick."
2020-04-18 00:30:51,"Two thoughts about this --

First - After the dust finally settles from this disaster - the nursing home industry as we currently know it in this country will never be the same - it will be diffrent and changed forever -

Second -- My wife is from the Caribbean - where their culture has a completely different attitude and approach to this --

Whenever I mention articles like this to my wife - she replies -- ""Only in this country do people consider the care of their elderly parents and relatives to be a 'problem' -- for us it's an honor and act of love"" -

In her country - even an aging aunt or second  cousin will be taken in by relatives - not to mention one's own parents and grand parents -

They do have some type of ""nursing homes"" in her country - but they are for people with no family whatsoever - the equivalent of geriatric orphans -

Yes - the virus has arrived in my wife's country and it's getting bad - but you won't hear anything resembling these nursing home horror stories coming from there..."
2020-04-18 01:01:48,"Is anyone surprised by this?  You put frail, old people in a dense physical setting, with overworked, undertrained, understaffed care givers, and you have this.
And I already see the comments that say this is because the US is this-or-that.  No, in fact, the province of Quebec, Canada which has the most Covid cases of any province has bodies piling up in several nursing homes, in which the staff has essentially abandoned them.  The authorities are in the process of removing them and assessing the rest of the homes. This is going on worldwide. People become frightened and the instinct of the survival of the fittest takes over. Not pretty, but it is what occurs in all plagues."

2020-04-18 00:28:34,"Terrible but inevitable. Care workers coming in and out, many of them not terribly educated and from communities that were slow to social distance. The same workers going from room to room, vectoring. Patients who are aging and weakened to start with. I am impressed, under the circumstances, at the devotion of caregivers even to show up. I am not sure I would, out of care for my own family. I'm not proud to say that, but it is true. I am heartbroken at the idea that so many people who succumbed had to die alone."
2020-04-18 00:19:43,"I agree with those who abhor how we treat our seniors, 75%+ of whom, in nursing homes, struggle with dementia.  In Canada, we're no different.

I'm a senior, with a long career in health care.  I think COVID-19 is a call to arms for how we deal with end of life issues in North America.

But here's a question for the New York Times:  So far this year how has the number of deaths in nursing homes from infectious disease varied from a normal year?

I don't want in any way to minimize the risks of COVID-19 - a particularly virulent virus which is not yet completely understood.  But I look forward to understanding the data after you've done the 2019 to 2020 flu season comparisons."

Can't they confirm the efficacy of the same, as Gilead is doing, and then provide it to people in the nursing homes for free (as Gilead will not do).  Or, perhaps, to the whole country?  Imagine the public relations coup for Merck?"
2020-04-18 01:07:27,"When I was growing up in the seventies, my mother did not work in the ""professional"" sense. But at different times through those years she cared for three elderly relatives who lived with us through the last years of their lives. This was not seen as unusual then, although, of course, it would be now.

Society has changed a great deal, and the growing nursing care sector is a consequence of these changes. Of course there are benefits to the expansion of the workforce, but we should not be blind to the costs... And if anything can focus our attention to these costs it's the current virus."
2020-04-17 23:15:00,"The title of this article just makes me so angry. Death trap?! WHY write something that will just make anyone who has a family member in a nursing home feel terrified and anxious over their condition?! And completely powerless to do ANYTHING about it? Thanks New York Times!! Yes, it may be true, but geez, have some tact and compassion and stop making people so depressed and fearful."

2020-04-18 00:10:57,I provided 24/7 care for my mother for three years. She cared for her mother 24/7 for four years. She cared for her mother in law 24/7 for two years.  In retrospect I am certain that it was the hardest thing any of us had done with our time on the planet. Care giving is not for the faint of heart and growing old and impaired is not for sissies.
2020-04-18 00:43:25,"Civilized countries value and respect their most elderly citizens. Their institutions, from preschools to prisons, are humane. 
In America we have radically different standards for different people, and our system is set up to reward the greedy and ignore suffering. When profits come first, nothing else matters. In 2013, the owner of Valley Springs Manor, a local nursing home in the Bay Area,  abandoned all the residents and stopped paying the staff, all of whom left except for a cook and janitor, who tried to care for everyone before finally calling 911. The owner was captured trying to leave the country, and indicted on 14 counts of elder abuse, but reports of severe violations at the facility had persisted for six years before these events. 
Why are our standards so low? Why do we accept child poverty, vermin-infested nursing homes and manifestly unfit ""presidents""?"

She loves it there, she gets social activity. What to do? We read the increasingly frightening articles and feel disturbed about it. I guess it's her decision, and she is competent enough to make it, but it is the sort of thing that makes you wonder about acting unilaterally. The other thing is, if you bring a person with complex care needs home to be cared for by family members, it is not even clear that this would be safer. What if she gets sick at home and my partner doesn't know what to do? 

So, she's in the facility. For now. I hope she changes her mind. :|"

2020-04-18 02:20:06,"I have worked for several years in nursing homes as a professional and I wish to point out out that there are more than staffing problems to explain the high rate of infections and deaths in them.

Think of frail, ill, usually elderly people living together in a close community, most unable to care for themselves adequately, many confused, and with reduced senses ,,,  we would like them wear masks ... not hold hands ... stay on their side of a double room ...ask to be parked farther apart in the TV room and hallways .. be spaced apart in the dining rooms (dining rooms aren't usually big enough) ... control their bodily secretions independently at all times ...

Bless'em all, think of trying to herd beloved cats.

Yes, so many of the staff are underpaid, there are staffing shortages, yes, but, folks, think of what seems to be a near impossibility to properly isolate and care for a population who should each have 1:1 care 24/7 in these days to stay well."
2020-04-17 23:53:26,"Remember when Obama and the Democrats were working to pass the ACA health care legislation and Fox News and all the Republicans were hysterically screaming ""death panels! death panels!""? The accusation seemed so preposterous at the time.

My grandma used to say that people see in others the things that they are capable of doing themselves."
2020-04-18 00:48:37,"the answer is adult day  care in the daytime and home care in evenings and weekends. let the elderly remain in their homes, thats what they want, and its more efficient, more effective, more humane. nursing homes only make money on short term rehab stays, not custodial care. so, let them do short term rehab stays only. get the nursing homes out of the hotel business. and encourage families to sign up for long term care insurance.  state budgets cannot afford medicaid cost of custodial care in nursing homes, $4000+ per month. states should allocate more home community based services ""HCBS"" medicaid money, less to nursing homes, we need a total rethinking of eldercare, maybe the coronavirus will prompt some legislators to change priorities"

I want USA to map the city and area the cases of virus more and order lock down in that areas strickly and start testing each individual.

The second method is to isolate the patient out of city and make sure everyone follows hygenic rules by state provided."
2020-04-18 03:12:25,"Home forced air humidification systems are easily contaminated. Just suppose that once COVID 19 enters a nursing home through some infected individual, the ventilation system gets contaminated, the virus multiplies and is piped into the rooms of every patient at constant high exposure. Recently reported research indicates that is possible.

Why they are not testing the ventilation systems in every infected nursing home, cruise ship, aircraft carrier or workplace with local outbreaks since Seattle is beyond me."
2020-04-18 04:02:28,"It's also true that many families, if they have the means and others without the means care for their parents at home notwithstanding the sacrifices entailed. I don't question the devotion to parents of those who place their elderly parents in nursing homes. They are not all, by any means , cesspools of neglect and poor staffing. In this time of a pandemic the workers at these facilities show up and provide the best care they can. I have seen this as a brother and as a physician who consulted on occasion at nursing homes. The basic problem is that people are living longer, outlive their resources, develop chronic illnesses with aging: dementia, advanced Parkinson's Disease, severe disabling strokes etc. It's a Hobson's choice for families: keep them home with the burden of caregiving for an indefinite period of time or place them in nursing homes  where loneliness is a certainty."
2020-04-18 04:40:51,"Nursing home facilities in the West house the oldest and most infirm population in our society. It is the saddest outcome and mostly a last resort for families to place them there. Caregiving of the elderly is much more demanding than the care of children (I have done both). Neither is paid work, which says it all in terms of the value our society puts on this work. 

Children are institutionalized through daycare, which can be very fun and educational, with potentially positive outcomes. The old and infirm are institutionalized in nursing homes, which, for those that lose their mobility, is a situation that I hope never to be. I would rather live a shorter life than extend it in this fashion. 

False outrage at the outcome of COVID19 sweeping through nursing homes, with the inevitable high death toll of these people, is not helpful.  The pandemic showed itself first there in the US. This did not drive policy. The lack of commentary on this article also demonstrates the lack of true interest in this situation. 

Resources have been primarily allocated to serve the more able and less ill.  Still able to live independently.  There is a huge difference between assisted living and nursing home populations.  

In my mind, attempting (and failing)  to keep the slowly dying (the nursing home population) alive longer by enacting isolation of them, seems like the cruelest of all possible outcomes.  Protecting the caregivers seems more appropriate."
2020-04-18 01:51:51,The nursing homes in my hometown have many contract nurses who work at multiple homes. They stopped that practice weeks later than they should have. My sister is a nurse in one of them. She believes most of the CNAs will walk - they are already afraid and calling in sick a lot.  Their wages are pitiful. Two large facilities in town have cases - almost 200 total.
2020-04-18 02:31:15,"I'm sorry that all these elderly people had to die, I really am.  But, why didn't the doctors try an experimental anti-viral protocol on them? Thai physicians gave three patients at Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok the three-drug mixture. The cocktail of medications includes HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir – a combination known as as Kaletra – and the flu medication Tamiflu.   Now if you are at death's door what do you have to lose?
The physician who first treated an epidemic of Legionairre's disease just empirically prescribed Erythromycin.  He didn't wait for any cultures or any two year drug studies, he just prescribed the drug and it worked.
Now, Tamiflu and Kaletra and readily available and can be taken by mouth unlike Remdesivir which is given by IV. 

What are these people doing just standing by and saying ""Their old and it must be ""God's will? ""   
I don't believe that someone should die without putting up a fight.  It's too bad these physicians don't give this drug combination a shot.  Covid-19 is a virus.  We already have readily available anti-viral drugs so why not at least try them out? When someone is at death's door what do they have to lose?"

Memory care is super expensive in this area.  One family I know had to move the mother to Maryland at  70 K a year for the last two or three years of her life.   In many cases this is an example of pneumonia as the old man's friend.  Most of us do not want to go on with our lives causing economic burdens for our families.
2020-04-18 02:18:52,"The most culpable - Health and Human Services who have failed miserably over past decade to enforce regulations. There is no minimum staffing for facilities even though they are paid based on patient acuity.

I have seen soiled diapers put on over-bed tables used for feeding. Seen nurses going from patient to patient without changing gloves. Care supplies carried on top of bins used for medical waste (needles used on AIDS patients, diaper from patients with C. Diff, vomit, blood), that went room to room because it saved a few seconds of retrieving supplies from storeroom. Facilities routinely are out of hand sanitizer, gloves and patient wipes for days every week. 

Many with IV meds get painful infections as site is rarely cleaned. Infections allowed to fester until they result in amputations. 

Seen too many patients with pressure wounds advancing to sepsis and death because not enough staff to rotate them and routinely relieve pressure. Staff ignores door notices to not enter rooms without PPE.

Life Care facility in Washington with history of infection control violations fined $611,000 over 40 deaths. And given 6 months to correct issues or face suspension of CMS funding. How many other business could be found culpable in 40 deaths and get away with a penalty of about $15,000 per death?"

Also about half of the stats come from LTC. These homes are not part of the health system but pure profit oriented entities...but that might change."
2020-04-18 02:31:04,"There are 1.5 million people living in nursing homes in the US, most of them elderly or sick. This story tells about the number of people dying of a particular cause without telling us the number who were dying without it. Or, perhaps, how the rates today compared to H1N1 a few years back. How do we know that the numbers of deaths in a “normal” year wouldn’t be about the same? But even if they're higher, is that not inevitable?

Death rates from this virus seem to be comparatively low in poorer countries. Might it be because the sick die of other things and people don’t get old? In short, it’s likely not nursing homes, or the conditions therein causing the problem; the people there would be dying at home – or already dead – if those facilities did not exist.

ANY contagion will take a higher toll on the old and sick than it does on the young a healthy. Places which care for the old and sick will, perforce, be hardest hit. This story reports on the inevitable; disease hits the weak hardest. And there is little to nothing we’re going to be able to do about it. 

Ever."
2020-04-18 02:43:00,"Honesty, how can you expect someone making less per hour than a person working for a fast food chain employee to give the kind of care a person deserves. Nursing assistants, the people who have the most contact with these residents, are sometimes working at a 1:12-1:30 ratio, understaffed, overworked and undersupplied. They are treated so poorly, looked down upon and disrespected by the very institution that employs them. The nurses above them don’t respect them but they are the first ones called upon to help when it is needed. Treat your staff better and the quality of care will go up. You can’t expect respect if respect isn’t given."
2020-04-18 02:48:20,"As an addendum to my previous comment, the problem I discussed is systemic and cultural. I feel only sadness for the families who entrusted their relatives to these facilities and for the workers risking their health in them every day."
2020-04-18 03:03:58,"It appears that some of these deaths were caused by improper use of ventilators.  The latest research shows that covid-19 effects on the lungs is not similar to pneumonia and using ventilators does more harm than good.  In one study 80% of NY patients placed on ventilators did not survive.

The so called experts have been proven wrong again and billions will be wasted on unneeded ventilators. Instead of taking their time and thinking through the problems, we once again relied on technology to replace intelligence."
2020-04-18 03:15:01,"In addition to being “death pits,” my concern is this: is there ANY oversight at these nursing homes right now? What’s going on inside the nursing homes where NO visitors are allowed? Who is ensuring our loved ones are being cared for with dignity and respect? What would I find if I walked, unannounced, into a nursing home today? I have a loved one in a nursing home who cannot speak for herself, and despite our numerous requests, the home has made zero efforts to facilitate communication between its patients and their families. I have a terrible feeling about this. It’s absolutely awful."
2020-04-18 03:37:39,"My family is privileged to die at home unexpectedly of natural causes, like how late Justice Scalia did. This seems to be common for most families before the Medicare era.

2020-04-18 04:35:32,"People with disabilities have long regarded being “placed” in nursing homes as very similar to being incarcerated.  Indeed, their experience there often really were much the same, or even worse, than some prisons.

The fact that so many have become infected so quickly and so many have died (and that so many staff have been infected) isn’t just because the residents have pre-existing health conditions — and those in assisted living may have few if any such conditions.  It’s also because of the notoriously poor training and supervision of staff, overly lax care practices and oversight, and relatively low compensation, uninspired supervision, poor career development opportunities, and low regard for their positions encountered by the people hired to interact with residents every day, several times a day.  Low morale takes a toll.  Add to that the fact that many people in “care facilities” are shunned, ignored, or abandoned by family and friends on the outside, making it all the easier for careless or disgruntled or ill-trained or overwhelmed staff to do the same.

The way Americans, so focused on (the myth of) hyper-independence and youth (all the more so thanks to the baby boomers’ ethos in their younger years, and now that of their millennial children, and it’s both a deep shame and unsurprising that this is where we are."

She was not allowed to wear a mask either so elderlies were not worried about sickness.  A few weeks later, one part-time worker was diagnosed with COVID, and before you know it,  half of the nursing home units all were infected.  How sad!"

2020-04-18 02:41:03,"In the US, people routinely devalue the old. It is evident in the banal forms of patronization (saying old people are cute in sing-songy tones, etc.); demeaning terms (for example little old lady, which is literally belittling); euphemisms like “senior”, which are only necessary because “old” is pejorative; mocking (listicles about old people encountering new technology, etc.); and negative assumptions about capability that start in middle age and are so entrenched that most older job candidates do not ever get the chance to demonstrate how they stack up against other candidates. No way I’m ever going in one of those homes. I am keeping my fitness, nutrition and finances as strong as possible, preemptively, and will have a plan to kill myself before being a vulnerable old person in the United States. It’s a culture that values only strong and achievement above all else, until you are no longer strong and achieving. How do you stack up against that?"

One would think by now that this critical area would be recognized and practices put in place to alleviate the stress on these facilities, one of the first things known about this virus was that it attacked the elderly in a very high proportion. where do the elderly live often in care home and nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. From the top down you have to ask why the seniors of this country have been discarded. Mr Trump has to come out and say why this was never a priority for him. In any disaster you have to take care of the most vulnerable first. The people who built this country have been cast into mass graves by a narcissist who cares about nothing but his ratings on Fox. If he is as he describes himself a wartime President then he should be charged with treason because at every step of the way he has aided the enemy. The enemy that he espouses is microscopic, you can fit enough on a yardstick to infect every human in the world ten times over. It is singular in it's purpose and very effective. To defeat an enemy like this you have to emulate it and be very singular in your purpose, if you are not it will win every time. Any official who tries to relax too soon will see death upon their decision. We should respect the majority of the American people and keep everything shut down. Let those who have perished not perish in vain. Stay home. The resilience of us all will prevail."

They can either fend for themselves, or not.

Next, time to get the nation back to work. Shut down the defense dept and feed the hungry so that they can work and pay taxes. We need EVERY American 16 and older to be working and paying taxes NOW... otherwise, there is no point at all to being the USA.

There were exactly three certified nurse assistants and one registered nurse on duty at night.   The mostly young nurse assistants ran up and down the hall at night answering call buttons.  People were yelling for pain medication.  People were old, confused, and falling out of bed - breaking bones.  Having no family around, I had to advocate for myself and, being more capable than others, I was triaged into the ignore category as others had real critical needs.
It's unbelievable to me that our health ""care"" has devolved into this insufficient, inadequate  for profit model - paid for by our tax dollars by Medicare."

But even still i learned today there was 1 case. They don’t have the equipment or test kits they need to protect the other patients or staff and they can’t remove the case because his symptoms are not severe enough for hospitalization. Nursing homes weren’t designed for this kind of infection. I feel bad for the staff who work incredibly hard under normal conditions & are now risking their lives for ridiculously low pay. I blame the government for completely ignoring this massively vulnerable group & possibly worse, covering up the staggering death toll in these institutions. The CDC should be ashamed."

2020-04-18 05:01:39,"In a system where older people beyond a certain age are pushed into nursing homes because the younger relatives cannot provide them the space or support for various reasons, this bias towards who gets to live is to be expected. On one hand medical science has enabled an extended life span going much beyond what that society considers a ""productive age"" and on the other the economic system cripples the young from providing the support by making their lifestyles expensive, emotionally drained and egocentric. Nursing homes were never a solution to this. It was just a place where we could hide the unused and unwanted stuff we accumulate like the dark corners of our cupboards. It's time at least some conscious and sensitive people think how to fix this."

Workers are required to wear masks, but have to supply their own in the kitchen, housekeeping, and LTC.

Why is this being allowed? I have tried to reach the Illinois Department of Public Health. I left a message with the Cook County Department of Health. 
Governor Pritzker has done a tremendous job so far for our state in the dearth of required federal leadership. But, this cannot be allowed. We cannot introduce a fatal virus into a facility where vulnerable people are - basically - imprisoned.

2020-04-18 05:09:17,"Don't complicate this. The reason for this tragedy is simple. We knew that the risk of a deadly global viral pandemic was high and an existential threat to our nation and the wider world on par and more likely than nuclear war.  We either did nothing, acted too late or failed to seriously apply the most basic, proven, simple and universally accepted measures that would have, if not prevented the current crisis, significantly limited it. Scientists, doctors, public health officials, the military, the CIA, journalists, politicians, the films, novels and non-fiction books of our popular culture have been warning of the danger for years but our leaders ignored and even ridiculed them. We've passed through several global-pandemic close calls with SARS and H1N1 since the turn of the century and other deadly flu outbreaks over the last 60 years. Most educated people know of the millions who died from ""Spanish Flu"" 100 years ago, a total greater than the carnage of the First World War. We can't avoid taking casualties, but we do know how to fight back, we just didn't until it was too late. This has nothing to do with a special disrespect for the old or the real crisis that millions of elderly Americans have faced for years. All are dying for the same reason. The old are just more vulnerable and are taking the brunt of our fecklessness, stupidity and arrogance. Unless it's essential, stay at home, wash your hands and curse anyone who doesn't do the same."

The nursing home -- an expensive and highly rated one --talked a good game, but frequently fell down on the job, so for the next two years, we took on the job that we knew right from the start would mostly be ours. 

People frequently think of nursing homes as largely involving matters of money, but in actuality money is only the beginning of the problem."
2020-04-17 20:57:25,"The investigation into these nursing homes should include the corporations that own them.   They are a huge, lucrative business.   States pay for these indigent elderly people and the states are held captive to these corporations for the costs.   People cannot pay for the costs of having their elderly loved ones in these homes.  Who can pay at a minimum, $4,000 a month?  These homes hire people who are barely trained and pay them minimum wage.  They are rarely inspected.  What about the nursing home in Phoenix that allowed a comatose woman to be impregnated by a nursing assistant and give birth without anyone even knowing she was pregnant?  That nursing home is still in business.  Let's not forget about the huge real estate portfolio that these corporations own."
2020-04-18 01:48:20,"In too many cases ""nursing"" home is a misnomer. A ""warehouse for people waiting to die"" is often more accurate. And in many cases in the past these people would have died sooner, perhaps before needing a nursing home, but for the greater availability of life prolonging medical care.

My father spent the most of his last year, at age 95, in a nursing home which from our observation was a very good place for what they did. But even then, any time he would have some sort of medical episode, they would rush him to the hospital, I suspect in part to avoid having a death on their watch which might have impacted their ratings.

That continued until my mother and us, with help of their pastor, finally arranged for a ""do not hospitalize"" order. Four days later he had some sort of issue and passed away peacefully at the nursing home.

They never suffered the indignity and hopelessness of life in a nursing home but were able to participate in everyday family life until they died.My biggest fear, as an older person, is eventually being dumped into a nursing home but my children and grandchildren have assured me that it will not happen."
2020-04-18 11:56:32,"My company has dealt with the staff of America’s Nursing Homes for decades.  They are one million people of calling who care for the members of our society who no one else will.  They are rarely thanked or celebrated.  In the middle of a pandemic there should be family members and the community at large celebrating their courage and dedication to go to work everyday, in the most difficult situations, to serve our frailest most vulnerable population.  They may be less educated than hospital workers, and they are certainly poorer, but they are more dedicated and braver than most of us!  They are the very people the NYT would want to celebrate - now is your chance!"
2020-04-18 11:57:23,"Actually, this is not unexpected.   Nursing homes are set up to care for people with long term chronic conditions, not fast spreading communicable diseases.  The ""inmates"" are among the most vulnerable and frail population groups.   I commend the staffs and employees who remained on the job, risking their own lives, to contend with a no win situation.

Now, if we were to offer a ""glass half full"" argument, it is somewhat reassuring that such a large proportion of the total deceased were in nursing homes.   It means that the proportion of deaths among the general population not in such facilities is that much lower."
2020-04-18 12:04:51,"It is no surprise covid-19 is a dire threat to residents and employees at nursing homes. 

In our western democracies the death toll varies a lot. The nations able to protect their care homes are doing by far the best. But the protection must be prioritized also for the benefit of the rest of the population, so the residents of care homes do not fill up the available hospital beds and ICU. In the US such protection is obviously not a priority, and apparently the covid-19 casualties are not even tested and counted in many states and businesses, for obvious political and financial reasons.

From my point of view elderly care for profit is an abomination, leading to the businesses prioritizing real estate speculation and wage suppression over the well-being of the inhabitants. In Denmark these facilities are publicly owned, staffed with educated certificated nurses and carers, employed on public contracts guaranteeing high standards. But still not a highly paid job. The least a society can do is to protect the elderly and the employees the best we can. 

In Germany, Finland, Norway and Denmark we have so far avoided many infections in our elderly care, but eventually some will come. The protection very much depend on the general spread of the infection, the discipline of the general population, and certainly not the least tests available to a staff paid to stay away if they suspect infection. 

Care homes staffed with minimum paid zero-hour contract employees will fail."
2020-04-18 12:06:51,"Certain things need to be done to keep us alive. We can't live without food, energy, and health care. Near the end we can't survive without assistance in almost all areas.

Social distancing is impossible between a cashier and a grocery shopper or between an invalid and his or her caretaker, just as much as it is between a hospital patient and a nurse or doctor.

But while we would never ask a nurse to risk a maskless interaction with a patient, or allow one to risk infecting another patient by going from one to another without a mask, no one seems to understand how urgent it is to take the same precautions in all our other unavoidable contacts with others.

Cashiers, caregivers, takeout window and curbside pickup personnel and anyone else who has to interact with the public MUST be required to wear masks and to use hand sanitizer between EVERY interaction.

What good does it do to shut ourselves up in our homes for 7 straight days only to go to the grocery store on the 8th day and have our purchases handled by a non-mask wearing cashier who has probably been exposed to several infected people in the course of the last few days?

We need to protect our grocery workers. If they get sick, we all get sick."
2020-04-18 12:13:34,"When my father was 94 he could no longer live on his own.  My brother found a nursing home, near his residence in Texas.  In that state one  could get a license to care for two people with an extra bathroom and at least 3 bedrooms.  He was well taken care of in the almost two years that he lived there.  The cost was not excessive.  His modest pension, Social Security, and the proceeds from the rent of his former home not only paid for his care but was put in a fund to maintain his rented house.  His care was great and he died with dignity."
2020-04-18 12:26:48,"As indoor relative humidity goes farther below 50%, human tissue is being prepped for invasion of viruses. It is not unusual to find pro-virus factories with indoor relative humidity values of 20% to 30% in supposedly healthy sanctuaries such as medical offices, hospitals, assisted living facilities, classrooms, offices, and other rooms where large groups of people are sharing viruses. If you can find a nursing home with mitigation for winter dehydration, you have found a needle in a haystack. Low indoor relative humidity can extend well into spring in higher latitudes particularly if the polar vortex is in the right place."
2020-04-18 03:39:00,"For many years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has maintained a website which includes the Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing facilities throughout the United States.

The website address is: <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html</a> 
One needs to look at only a random sample of facilities across all 50 states to get an idea for how many facilities are given an overall grade of 1 or 2 stars out of a total possibility of 5 stars to understand the woefully substandard conditions under which facilities are operating day to day when there are no unusual circumstances such as our current pandemic.   
Having worked in a nursing home and served as a complaint intake analyst for one state’s nursing facilities, I can only say how ashamed I am of our collective lack of action in not safeguarding the rights of these vulnerable residents to live in a clean, safe, infection-free and nurturing environment. 
I hope this pandemic serves as a wake-up call for all of us about how we have allowed these persons, who are as vulnerable as the unborn, to remain so unprotected."

Trump administration has many task forces — but still no plan for beating covid-19 [WashingtonPost]

“Why don’t we let this wash over the country?” Trump asked, according to two people familiar with his comments, a question other administration officials say he has raised repeatedly in the Oval Office.

Fauci initially seemed confused by the term “wash over” but became alarmed once he understood what Trump was asking.

“Mr. President, many people would die,” Fauci said.

""The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump"" [Psychtoday]

John Gartner, Ph.D. is the founder of Duty to Warn, an organization intent on warning our country that we are in dire trouble due to our president’s mental instability. More than 60,000 mental health professionals have signed John’s petition, which states:

“We, the undersigned mental health professionals, believe in our professional judgment that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And we respectfully request he be removed from office, according to article 4 of the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which states that the president will be replaced if he is ‘unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”"

Horror stories about them, abuse, neglect, even beatings, were always the main media currency until suddenly we are shocked, shocked that so many residents in them are dying from Covid 19.   Maybe the current death toll will be a wake up call to what horrible places they truly are.  And maybe the virus is an angel of mercy to people left to suffer being cast off."
2020-04-18 07:18:26,"""Nursing homes"" is a misnomer. Assisted living facilities are not nursing homes and do not have nursing staff. Continued use of the phrase ""nursing homes"" by the NY Times and all MSM media obfuscates too many issues to cover here, but the basic flaw: assisted living facilities are For Profit businesses. A friend who worked as a VP at a large one summarized, ""it's basically a real estate and labor business model with a marketing veneer."" Frontline caregivers are unsung heroes to residents and families, but, as ""labor"", they are underpaid and under trained. Typically they work less than 40 h/wk to cut benefits. Again, NOT nurses. 

The need is real. Affordable long term care is desperately needed when a family member is not safe at home - perhaps dementia or physical frailties require 24x7 care. 

Some countries have better models. Governments of Canada, The Netherlands, England, etc., provide care as part of the continuum and do not bankrupt families as the US model often does. This virus is more deadly for the elderly. What countries provide better care that is not an automatic death sentence? 

MSM please STOP obfuscating differences between real nursing care and for-profit American ""continuing care"" or ""assisted living"" facilities. Please hold these poorly legislated, very profitable businesses accountable. Check out constant selling and reselling of properties for real estate gains. 

There is a better way to provide 24x7 care for our elders. We need to figure it out."

Thanks to Obama and Jim Clyburn and the religious leaders in the South we can be sure that is not going to happen.  The Black Congressional Caucus has been one of the strongest forces against campaign finance reform because they get so little money from their constituents.  Sanders made a strategic mistake in advocating finance reform and in showing that small dollars could finance a big campaign.  That is a message both the Rebubs and Dems don't want to get out.

China faced an unknown virus as of mid-Jan which unleashed never-before ferocity within days. But the US watched from far-away safety the hellish pall of death descend on China within days. Yet from 16th Jan, when WHO posted publicly the Testing Kit for coronavirus, Donald Trump & CDC & FDA & US Media did nothing to this day, over 90 days later, to even take the 1st Essential Step - Testing. Most children in the world are taught in school - a stitch in time saves nine. Clearly not so in the US. If the US had conducted a million Tests in early Feb of symptomatic & asymptomatic persons, with rigorous Contact Tracing & Quarantine & Isolation - like South Korea - it is certain less than 200 US lives would ever be lost. Sadly the American people & US Media chose to lap up Donald Trump’s Do-Nothing gibberish for over 70 days & even feel good ‘only’ 36000 American lives are lost (highest in the World) till date. Sadly, now the American people are wrapped up in ‘opening the economy’ rather than saving as many American lives as possible by whatever effort it takes."
2020-04-18 09:28:26,"380k a year die from infections in nursing homes? Yet we're shutting down the world for approx 150k deaths worldwide from c19? These covid numbers have never added up to the response. How have we been losing well over a quarter million seniors a year at nursing homes and that issue isn't publicized at all? Why then are they concerned with losing seven thousand seniors now to the point where we shut down global operations? And as long as we're all admitting that seniors in nursing homes are in such compromised warehousing type care to get them out of our busy lives....isn't covid quite a convenient savings for us all? Nursing homes run 5-10k per month. If we're willing to let 380k go with no mention due to infection, what's special about these 7k covid deaths? Our most vulnerable people to whom we are showing the least priority and concern are dying off by the hundreds of thousands due to negligent care and uninvested employees, but we lose 7k to Covid and it's a sudden state of emergency? I'm starting to fear we've been terribly duped on generating such an alarmist response to Covid. The flu death numbers were bad enough in comparison to Covid (we still haven't reached the same number Covid deaths as flu deaths per year) but to now hear 380k seniors die every year ANYway of infections?? And THAT number is never even discussed or released? ....well, You can't die twice. Guess these seniors were facing an infection death if not Covid. What an unsettling number to hear."

Most Nursing homes take in those elderly folks that families no longer want or can take care of.

Then, at some point, those nursing home residents die.

When they died of cancer, it was not news.

When they died from heart failure it was not news.

Whey they died from Alzheimers, it was not news.

The owners of these facilities look at them as a business, viewed only by the numbers...they're not a compassionate lot.

2020-04-18 11:52:31,"By definition, nursing homes are full of frail people, most of whom would have died earlier but for medical care that didn't exist 50 years ago. We are so accustomed to their advanced age we forget that this is the last season of their lives. More than a few frail elders who have lost much of their independence and many of their family and friends and relatives pray each night for God to take them.  Everyone dies of something, and infectious diseases like pneumonia and urinary infections provide the mechanism of death for for elders all the time, but rarely all at once. When an aggressive pathogen like the novel corona virus comes around it is like wolf at lambing season. Horrible but utterly natural.

At the same time the frail elder population provides a market for entrepreneurial souls. You can sell a lot of drugs, procedures and housing to old folks- especially if their kids are filled with grief about their inability to care for them at home and we don't do the hard psycho-spiritual labor of preparing for death.   Just like for-profit jails, there is money to be made  by finding out how little you can spend.  And like jails, we don't see much of what goes on behind those walls.

So blame the WHO, blame the governors, blame the Democrats, blame Biden, blame Obama, blame the free press most of all. Without testing we are headed for a major, deep recession or depression. Trump knows it, he caused a lot of it through his inaction, lies and magical thinking. There will be inadequate testing for the rest of 2020 because we are so far behind the curve.

While I respect the anguish and anger that the article discusses, this inflammatory expression does little to educate the reader. I have provided medical care to residents of two nursing homes for 30 years and can attest to the extreme frailty and vulnerability of the residents, as well as the inadequate reimbursement model that supports these facilities. But people need to also be realistic about the likelihood of their frail, elderly loved ones. Without modern medicine, expensive hospitalizations and surgeries, as well as 24-hour care; many would have died years before they do. When I hear of someone grieving the death of their 90  year old parent, my heart certainly goes out to them, but they should not express shock or surprise. And lets face it, nursing home placement is ultimately a personal and societal choice that we make. If the worst pandemic seen in over 100 years sweeps through our society as it is doing, sadly our most frail members will be lost. If we put large numbers of them in congregate places, more will die. That is a choice we made long ago for our freedom and personal choices. We also need to face up to the fact that you can’t really plan for everything in life."

I beg people to make plans to edit this life on your own terms before leaving your care to uncaring family members or worse, a nursing home. Nothing good ever comes from going in a nursing home.  It never has and never will."

2020-04-18 13:24:40,"All the more reason to focus prevention for the most vulnerable populations  rather than this mass shutdown of the economy via social distance. Real evidence is now showing Covid-19 far less lethal than advertised. A Stanford University study just released stated, "" between 48,000 and 81,000 people in Santa Clara County alone may already have been infected by the coronavirus by early April — that’s 50 to 85 times more than the number of official cases at that date."" And... ""Not only do the numbers show how the U.S.’ severe shortage of testing led to a profound undercount of COVID-19 cases, they indicate the virus is far less deadly than believed. The research also implies that the death rate is far lower than believed. At the time of research, 39 county residents had died — a fatality rate, based on estimated infections, of only 0.12% to 0.2%. California’s assumed death rate, based only on confirmed cases, is 3%""

Let's ease this mass social distancing  and allow folks to get back to work. Wear mask, be mindful and protect those people and areas most vulnerable."
2020-04-18 13:43:50,"Skilled nursing home have rehab programs for patients d/c'd from the hospital in addition to long term care patients.  Rehab patients have private insurance and/or medicare part A which reimburses for the rehab stay.  The rehab stay stops as soon as the patient reaches maximum benefit from skilled rehab.  After 20 days medicare no longer pays for the stay.  Private insurance operates like Medicare.  Patients are then either transferred home, return to assist living facilities or remain in the facility as residents. If patients have financial assets they are private pay until their money runs out and at that point medicaid pays for the long term stay.  The more medicaid patients the facility has the quality of services and staffing decreases.  Many long term care facilities that are medicaid only are squalid and dangerous.  Corporations own these facilities with the rare exception of federal and state owned facilities  The rest are own by LLC corporations whose goal is profit.  However there is not much profit as medicaid patients increase and private pay patients have decreased"

We need options  even beyond  DNR (do not resusitate order) as specified,  in a Living Will because  ambulance crews will often not know to  follow it, as happened with my mother in one of the best  long term care facilities). If I should develop late stage Alzheimers,  a severe stroke or other conditions  that would make me unable to be aware of myself and the world around me,  or to  communicate  with others,  even by  reading,  I'd like to know now that a plan was in place, now,  to   spare me and the people love the hardest times... even before my  removal to a nursing home."

These retirement communities where they dont mix with other age groups is not good either.  There is no one to help them, for free.  You have to hire for everything."
2020-04-18 13:17:12,"“...large and shockingly lethal outbreaks have continued to ravage nursing homes across the nation...”

To those who have worked in nursing homes, there is nothing shocking about the outbreaks. The facilities are managed with the primary goal of profit, not the health and welfare of the residents or the under-staffed workers.

Aside from the occasional high-end nursing home for families who can afford extra fees above and beyond what Medicare pays, nursing homes are basically warehouses for the sick, elderly, staffed by underpaid, low morale employees."
2020-04-18 13:21:46,"The headline screams out giving a large number of dead in nursing home facilities, but what else would you expect?

These homes house the oldest, most ill and decrepit members of our society, people who cannot be cared for at home.  Perhaps the home caregivers have made a conscious decision that they do not want to even try.

In some circumstances, they are merely warehouses of the older, vulnerable people.  Frankly, even under the best of care, most of them would have passed anyway.

As the saying goes:  Life, you won't get out of it alive."

2020-04-18 13:51:45,"Nursing homes are staffed by underpaid overworked people who are tasked to provide complete care to patients who are without capacity. It is the fault of our culture that our elderly who are condemned to being warehoused awaiting death. Of course, we never articulate this so starkly. Of course, most nursing homes are lovely. But the hidden undercarriage is that “we cannot afford” to care for our indigent and refuse to permit our elderly the option of existing this “mortal coil” with dignity, because of superstitions. 
We are faced with religious repression regarding the beginning and the end of life. When does life begin? When does life end? While we surrender to religions despite the protection of the 1st Amendment “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;” no one asks why the beliefs of the religious intrude on our right to decide. Why isn’t science the guide instead of religion? Is it because religion has always been the means by which politicians manipulate and exploit us all? 
A number of responses speak to the desire never to live and die in nursing homes. Unless one is rich, or has a family willing to sacrifice itself to our care, we will rely on nursing homes, even when we have terminal illnesses or the loss of all cognitive function. 
Let’s not blame nursing homes for conditions that our society has created. Let’s consider rational alternatives. There are things worse than death."

2020-04-18 14:46:18,Being surprised or horrified that a large percentage of those dying of Covid live in nursing homes is like being surprised that large numbers of soldiers die in battle on the frontline during a war. It is sad and tragic and this whole thing  amplifies systemic problems throughout society. But blaming nursing home staff for these deaths is not helpful and in fact feeds the torrents of inaccuracies we are being subjected to in this horror.
2020-04-18 13:46:21,"Many years ago I briefly worked in an assisted living facility. Bluntly said, it was a racket led by profiteers. A skeleton staff was all they would allow, and as a result, workers who wished to do a good job were eventually worn down by the unrelenting demands. If you spoke up you were looked upon as a troublemaker, and morale was such that even the nurses succumbed to bad behavior.

I have seen other, better examples of this kind of facility, and know that my experience was only one end of the spectrum. But it  soured me on the subject for good. When I watch these videos of Covid nurses crying at the end of the day, it brings back things I would rather forget."
2020-04-18 14:31:35,"I'm not a religious person  though I do believe in some sort of a higher...something. And with that comes the belief that evil  exists too.   And if bodies piling up in elder care facilities in this land with no accounting of who they are or how many isn't some form of it..

None of this comes as any surprise at all to anyone who's been involved in elder care in any way.  Under the best of circumstances, seniors in this country are undervalued and if you reach a point where you end up in a facility, you're disposable to those running those places. No less surprising is how long this took to come out,  and the way it came out (with great thanks for those who fought to get this out). These facilities overall act as though they are sovereign states and that some of these places were denying or not proving information to the families is no surprise either. 

I've posted at times in the past couple years about having been caregiver to an elder family member. I worked day and night to keep them home. I succeeded at huge cost to myself that includes  PTS and a firm belief that it's better to die young and a hope that I do.

We're unsung heroes in this country, un or underpaid, as are the lower level employees in these places, many of whom will also die. 

And still Cuomo persisted in his cuts to Medicaid, the state 'leadership'  gave it to him and a bill that calls for minimum staffing levels (A294, S1032)  sits in committee.  And this article disappears from the main site already.."
2020-04-18 14:48:32,"Part of the problem may be that many of these facilities -- like the one run by our county -- pay their staff poorly.  And while they may provide sick leave, many of the staff treat it as a personal/vacation day which they take as soon as it is available so they do not maintain a balance of sick time.  Sick leave should accumulate indefinitely with no maximum and be paid when the employee leaves."
2020-04-18 13:52:21,"Once again New York Times' readers are coming down hard on nursing homes. I wish there was this kind of response when $ are allocated to improve living conditions for those older. But right now instead of outrage against these facilities, express your outrage that this vulnerable population was not forthrightly protected proactively as soon as the virus was discovered to affect them far more lethally. One facility in Virginia illustrates what's going on: For 2 weeks after the first person got ill, they were refused testing. 46 died. And of the remainder who tested positive, 60% were without symptoms. Trump's incompetence and refusal to lead under the most difficult of circumstances is responsible for this, not the facility.

Whether or not skilled nursing facilities need to be better monitored and regulated is a question for further discussion but right now what is needed is massive testing for these senior group residences along with assisted living facilities and the smaller board and care homes. Testing is the name of the game and always has been. The current administration fights this concept tooth and nail but it is the only answer, especially with so many not showing symptoms."
2020-04-17 20:15:11,"When, in mid-February, I decided to bring my wife home after five months in a nursing home outside of Des Moines, the novel coronavirus was merely another item on my foreign news feed, and, because of the negligence and nonchalance of our political leadership, not even on the domestic radar. When I finally brought her home on February 29, there was still little personal concern even though strange things were beginning to happen in Washington state and a feeling of low-level alarm began seeping into national media. By mid-March, that little nursing home in Granger, Iowa was in total lockdown, with no one but staff going in or out. And now, in mid-April, the 28-bed brain injury rehab facility where my wife spent ten months after her stroke in 2000 has 22 Covid-19 positive cases. We’ve been lucky—dumb luck at that. Too many other families have not."
2020-04-17 20:09:39,"Nursing homes aren’t staffed by nurses.  

They don’t have enough PPE.  Their low wage, hard working and dedicated staff don’t get paid if they stay home.  They care for People who cannot dress, bathe, toilet or feed themselves any longer.  The work is very intimate, and after they care for one patient they go on to the next.  

This is an epic tragedy that was entirely foreseeable but ignored because these are businesses not medical centers."
2020-04-18 11:43:49,"Who didn't know that American nusrsing homes, veterarns homes, homeless shelters, public housing projects, mental institutions, jails and prisons were fertile domesticated slaughterhouses for COVID-19 aka novel coronanvirus-19 aka SARS-2?

Who cared or knew or heard or saw any of their advocate lobbyists in the legislative and executive local, state and federal governing branches?

COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign in it's evolutionary fit quest to be fruitful and multiply is it's human hosts living cells. From the perspective of life as we understand and know it on Earth COVID-19 is mostly an inert chemical camoflaged chameleon with genetic information to hijack a living cell in order to reproduce itself.

The 1200+ known coronavirues and their 1200+ plus endemic natural bat hosts include the four known types of common cold, SARS-1 and MERS. Coronaviruses seem to have no deleterius effects on bats. Nor on the known intermediate mammal hosts typically associated with leaping into humans aka camels, civets and pangolins.

What do bats 'know' about COVID-19 that we humans don't?

Bats have been around for at least 52 million years. While modern humans have been here for a measly 300,000+ years. While the genus Homo appeared  a mere 3 + million years ago."
2020-04-18 13:35:57,"Just want to add that this tragic situation sadly isn't unique to the US. COVID-19 is ripping through nursing or ""care homes"" in other countries such as the UK as well.  

Although the UK has only 20% the population of the US, it has recorded nearly 50% as many COVID-19 deaths. But the actual UK number is likely considerably higher because deaths occurring in care homes in England and Wales are not being included in daily official COVID tallies - only deaths in hospitals are. (The exception is Scotland; dunno about Northern Ireland.)

According to the BBC, everyone in UK care homes with symptoms is being tested - but ""only the first five residents in a care home who show symptoms of coronavirus are tested to confirm whether there is an outbreak within a home.""

As is the case in UK hospitals and health facilities in the US, the poorly paid care home staff in the UK also do not have adequate or sufficient PPE. Many have no PPE at all.

The bungling response of UK government authorities to COVID-19 has been incredibly inept - worse it seems than the USA's. Makes me glad that in the US we have a system where a lot of decision-making re this crisis is being done by the states.

Anyone who has had a loved one  in these places understands why daily visits become medically necessary - poor staffing, inadequate pay and training for staff,  and lack of oversight.  I am a  nurse and was my mother's primary support person, so  I noticed when  basic infection control measures, like hand washing , were conspicuously absent. Staff coffee cups were parked under never used soap dispensers. This ""deficiency"" became more obvious during state inspections and flu outbreaks when there would be a sudden flurry of hand washing and the appearance of personal hand sanitizers. After the outbreak, this new  behavior would quickly fade. 
It is not just  the vulnerability of advanced age that has caused  these tragic losses.  As has already been mentioned here - greed (deregulation), ignorance, and lack of respect for our elderly  predictably creates and perpetuates this chilling scenario.

We are a great nation because of capitalism where those who are de$erving, get what they deserve, and those who don’t contribute in a $ubstantial way also get what they deserve which is nothing.  This is our strength and President Trump understands this.  As he recently said: when there is a vaccine not everyone will be able to afford it. Companies who develop the vaccine(using Government funded research provided to them for free and paid for by the undeserving)have a right to make a profit.   The benevolent companies who operate understaffed nursing homes where residents are dying in droves also have a right to make a profit.   This is why America is envied throughout the developed world. This is why, if tyrannical socialist governments like Canada listened to their citizens, they would abandon their failed healthcare systems and adopt systems modeled after our own.

2020-04-18 15:01:23,"Predictions: early opening will cause a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.; the US will achieve first place:  the most COVID-19 cases per capita in the world; and, the US will be last or nearly last among economically developed countries to control the virus.  Finally, the economic consequences of the disruptive tactics of the Trump administration and its supporters will be the highest among economically developed nations."
2020-04-18 15:03:42,"Meanwhile McConnells' Congressional Republicans refuse to provide emergency funds to state and local governments to pay for the mass testing and tracing needed to keep everyone safe as people who need to work go back to work. Otherwise in very short order there is going to be wave after wave of more sick, more dead, and more lockdowns until a vaccine is produced, distributed and given to everybody. 

The underlying problem is state and local governments by law can't borrow money, only the national government can, and the Republicans are sitting on their hands blaming everybody else as usual. Trump and his enablers in Congress are the sand in the gears blocking mass testing and blocking opening up safely----wake up people and connect the dots!"
2020-04-18 15:09:59,"@Tanya V. Trump wants violence and confrontation with police.  He’ll use this as an excuse to step in (Marshal law) with troops to stop it.  He’ll claim himself the hero of the day.  Because of the violence, he’ll suspend the Congress and cancel the election until “peace” is restored.

He’s right on schedule."

Liberate Now protesters do not wear stethoscopes, so you can cream them."
2020-04-18 15:22:09,"A strong leader in this case is one who can consistently urge the public to follow the best medical advice, even when it may be a bitter pill to swallow and yes, enforce when necessary for the good of the country. Trump can never provide this kind of leadership. He is weak, too afraid to oppose the MAGA-hatted zombies who helped put him in office."
2020-04-18 15:26:00,"Let's hear Trump and his supporters rally and protest against covid19. Yelling and telling it to just go away.

My sister told us of an extended family in her rural community that claimed covid19 was overblown. They ignored physical distancing. Then a number of their family came down with it. Older members are in serious condition. A 65 year old brother is dead.

Unfortunately, we are all put at greater risk.  Healthcare workers pay a particularly high price for this behavior."
2020-04-18 15:41:32,"Make no mistake: Trump's actions in the past few days are a rehearsal for the fall in case he loses the election. 

He'll make a statement that says he will abide by the law (in this case, let the governors decide) and then turn right around and incite his supporters to mass protests and even violence to try to overturn legal actions and get what he wants.

Using this strategy, he can pretend that he's doing nothing wrong (or at least illegal) while hoping it will bring him the result he desires. It probably won't, but what will be the cost? Especially when it's not just hundreds of protestors in a few states but tens of thousands in dozens of states, believing that the election result is wrong?"
2020-04-18 15:05:08,"In seven days, Covid-19 deaths have almost doubled, from 20,000 to 37,000 in the U.S.

Shelter in place was intended to buy time to stop the spread while we wait for expansive testing to ramp up.  But Trump has abdicated his federal responsibility to invoke the DPA to produce the much needed supplies for states to carry out these tests and has instead put the responsibility squarely on the governors.  

As states feel the pressure to relax or even lift restrictions without the ability to test on a large scale, more people will certainly die.  And masterfully, Trump has set the governors up to take the hit as he encourages his base to liberate their states even though Trump’s own guidelines aren’t even met.  Trump will once again suffer no consequences from his monstrous behavior.

We are no better off than a month ago to start relaxing shelter in place regulations.  For these people to protest and demand to go back to work at this fragile time, I can only say is Darwinism at its finest.  It’s just a shame that those on the front line will be forced to deal with this added mess."
2020-04-18 15:41:33,"Yes, you have an inalienable right to petition the government for the redress of grievances, provided you protest peacefully.   However, the Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that the government has no obligation to listen to your complaints.   

And, yes, anyone can encourage or discourage people from protesting.   Whether it is politic for the President to do so is another matter - he evidently thinks it is.   He needs to win Wisconsin and Michigan in 2020."
2020-04-18 15:46:46,"Why has it taken so long to require masks? And when will commercial manufacturing ramp up? It feels odd now, but it really would not be a bad thing if quality, effective masks became a permanent part of our lives, like seatbelts and bicycle helmets."
2020-04-18 15:56:19,"During a pandemic caused by a highly contagious virus, people collecting in mass and close together without facial protection, while protesting in the streets are correct in their fear that something is coming after them. However, the ""something"" coming after them is not state governors, but a contagious virus they are willingly carrying back  to their families and communities. The world will know in the coming weeks how successful they are."
2020-04-18 16:18:48,"No good will come from returning to normalcy too soon without proper heath and testing measures being implemented by our government and businesses. To return too soon will lead to 2nd or 3rd waves of COVID19 outbreaks. We do not want to repeat the 1918 Spanish flu pandamic that killed millions.

In this time of crisis, trump and conservative instigators are turning the people's understandable frustration into a political weapon against Democrat political opponents, without regard for people's health, or for the potential of protests turning violent. This type of action during difficult times is a calculated and devisive tactic that is historically a hallmark of aspiring dictatorships.

We need trump and all U.S. government persons to put politics completely aside, and work together to find solutions to fight COVID19 and to open up the economy in a responsible manner. We need our politicians and pundits to stop using this crisis for political means, and instead work to unite our nation. And we need the government to financially help businesses and citizens until they can return responsibly back to their livelihoods."
2020-04-18 15:52:50,In order to qualify for Phase 1 opening sufficient testing capacity must be in place. As Fauci et al testified the medical team task force expects all 50 states to be in testing compliance within 2 weeks.
2020-04-18 15:55:16,"This mini-Trumpian movement to by pass good public health measures is only going to make more folks catch the virus and maybe die from it.

This is the result of disinformation campaigns about the virus--a very high percentage of Trump supporters and FOX news viewers truly believe that the statistice on cases and mortality are lies.

I head also that Trump plans to resume his rallies.  All I can say is, we'll watch the curves in the states he travels to and I won't be surprised if there's a huge spike in cases.

To the outside world, it appears the US has  lost its mind.  I read comments from elsewhere which express disbelief that America seems to be committing suicide.

By joining in their cause the President will be directly responsible for any new cases caused by impatience over proven public health measures that more sane areas of the country have adopted."

When will equal pay for equal work be made the law?"
2020-04-18 16:04:14,What i don’t get is why those Republican governors who complain so much about the shelter-in-place and advocate for state rights just  don’t open their states if they think that’s what they want.  Most republicans and faux news will blame democrats regardless of the outcome.
2020-04-18 16:05:33,"Here's the obvious way to deal with these protests while protecting healthcare workers.  

Photograph everyone who takes part, carefully identify each person to the degree that is possible using license plates as cross-checks and distribute the list of names to healthcare facilities.  Then, if a protester presents with Covid-19 symptoms simply turn the person away."
2020-04-18 16:06:24,"Trump has claimed he is a WAR PRESIDENT.   
And many news articles proclaim we have a “global war” against this global pandemic.

I missed WWII, but I never read of anyone saying, in regard to that war, “That's enough!  This is too inconvenient.  It's too difficult for the children.”  
“We're going to protest.  We're just not doing it anymore.!”

According to the WAR PRESIDENT, this war is apparently different.

Among many people, and not just in the USA, I don't notice the congruity between the determined rhetoric for vanquishing this enemy and the lack of willingness to do what is necessary to accomplish the goal.

I wonder why that is........"
2020-04-18 16:09:39,Trump supporters are defying shelter in place rules to protest in large groups? Finally we have some good news during this difficult time.
2020-04-18 16:12:13,"Over the long and growing history of Donald Trump outrages these ""liberation"" tweets may well constitute his most disgraceful indulgence to date.  One can sympathize with the millions of Americans whose inability to report to work have taken an economic toll on them and on the rest of us.  (If not with those who simply feel cooped up at home with nowhere to go!)  And yet it's clear enough that a premature decision to reopen the nation will exact a heavy toll in casualties as the infected (including the asymptomatic who aren't even aware that they carry the illness) risk their own lives and those of the rest of us to break free of enforced quarantines and start earning their paychecks once again.  Still, in his haste to score a ""win"" by allowing American business to restart, Trump is operating out of the peanut gallery, risking the lives of others while watching his own stock options rise.  Has any commander in chief ever behaved in so unseemly a manner?"
2020-04-18 16:22:52,"This is a PR stunt to turn ""not my presidents"" failure to save American lives, they (these protesters) know that bureaucrats ( trump and his supporters hate most, because of their opposition to cruelty) are working to find ways to open the economy carefully. Now, they just want to take credits and get a moment of ""we told you so"". They also make some Americans feel better that their opinions and actions may be cruel but ""I feel you"" type of space evangelicals/religion created for them. God accepts cruelty if the cruelty fulfills ""his"" wish type of thing. 

So, yes some Americans are not moral, do not care about others except their ""white tribe"". And, alas I still do not want to vote for Biden, without an unconditional apology from him for his continuous defense of the ""CRIME BILL"", ""IRAQ WAR VOTE"". Plus, indifference about the future of planets environment ""GREEN NEW DEAL""."
2020-04-18 16:23:41,Those who don't like the preventive measures in their respective state can ask the courts to rule on the matter if they do not agree with a certain state law or a certain governor's Executive Order. That is the way to do it in a country like ours. Trump’s instigation to riot and violence is what the banana republics’ autocratic despots do when the democratic forces of their countries corner them. What Trump is doing is not different of what Maduro does in Venezuela.
2020-04-18 16:27:23,"Just when I thought America was getting smarter.

Let's not lose sight of why we are doing this: Doctors, Nurses, Police, Fire Fighters, and EMTs. We don't know how long they will hold on under this onslaught of a highly contagious virus.

There is a distinct possibility that they can't show up for duty, they may need to quarantine for multiple weeks, and may very well die. And how many of them can hold up for months or weeks without seeing their loved ones? Or have to deal with death on an hourly basis? Or, just plain break down from exhaustion?

And what happens when hospitals close because all of the staff are sick, dead, or quit? Then these protesters (and their families) will be placed in an over crowded convention hall with hundreds of other patients screaming themselves to a horrible death with no one around to treat them.

We are smarter than this. I know we are."
2020-04-18 16:06:43,If most major media sources emanated from North Dakota rather than New York would this even be a crisis?  Punishing the whole nation to live under perpetual lockdown for the errant ways of a few seems unfair to many I'm sure.  I'm sure to much of Trump's rural base where the epicenter happens to be must come as an obvious sign from above.
2020-04-18 15:58:00,"These protesters' reckless, irresponsible behavior puts community safety and wellbeing at risk. Anyone who physically or financially (Devos family) participates in these protests should forgo all medical care should they be infected with the virus. Why should the health care system and health care workers be overburdened by these individuals who fail to respect public health and safety."
2020-04-18 16:20:46,"They can protest. It's a free country. Just remember: They are exposing themselves, first and foremost, to the effects of the virus and the disease while they vie for corporate interests and the ability to go shopping or get a haircut. They are putting their lives in danger.

Worse, they are putting everyone they come in contact with in danger of contracting the disease. Rural America hasn't see the hit and death from the virus yet, but they will. It's there and it is ramping up.

Our lack of cohesion at the federal level is giving COVID everything it needs to thrive, as shown by the numbers. One state may have strict enforcement and restrictions, but another lax...and the lax will infect those that are trying to do the right thing.

Those that want the economy back up and running are afraid, and they should be. But the consequences of a failed message to work together from the top of our federal government, and a mish-mash of ideas at the State level will prolong this pandemic and make it much worse than anywhere else in the world.

As the country crumbles, and it will under the weight of this, what do you want to be remembered for? Helping your community and country be safe? Or going back to work, getting infected, and starting a whole new curve? Infecting family, friends, and your co-protesters?

Medical supplies, cohesion, masks, and money may be in very short supply in the USA, but so, apparently, is common sense."
2020-04-18 16:24:03,"While all of us wish we could go back to normal, Trump seems oblivious to the fact that his encouraging these protests will put just that much more strain on our already over taxed heath care workers, not to mention what it may do to further spread the virus. It’s as though he’s incapable of holding two competing thoughts in his head simultaneously, and realizing which is the far more important one. Or maybe he’s just so conspiracy theory driven that he is still not convinced that this isn’t all a hoax. Has there ever been a more selfish man in the Oval Office?"
2020-04-18 16:24:55,"These protests are more of an indictment of our education system than anything else. We have little knowledge of and regard for empirical data, critical thought, self-empowerment and solutions-oriented measures. We scream and yell about our rights with absolutely no understanding of responsibilities. This will not work out well."
2020-04-18 16:06:55,"Here is a problem: 
on one side we have a pandemic where each individual's choice to ignore social distancing will result in someone else infected and dying.
on the other side it is US government (on federal and local levels) that told people not to work and now when people run out of money, facing starvation as we see in Texas where there is 1000 cars waiting in line for food pantry, what is the government do? Tells them to stay home, giving them $1200, seriously?"
2020-04-18 16:07:26,"@db2 Unfortunately the federal aid is controlled by the worst enemy of our country, Trump, an irresponsible character that is instigating law-breaking and violence.

No."
2020-04-18 16:18:48,Trump should be taken to court for inciting his followers to break the law and order and for endangering the lives of thousands and thousands of health care professionals that are risking their lives day in and day out to save American lives from the demolishing effects of the pandemic. Mike Pence was a governor at one time. If Pence stays silent then Pence is an accomplice of a serious criminal act.
2020-04-18 16:23:25,"Who in their right mind would value dollars over life?  Well, apparently the Trump cult does.  It is awful that we have these folks who can not see the bigger picture marching in the streets.  And what happens if there is a second round of infections?  That will just make everyone suffer that much longer, both physically and financially.  I would rather take a slower approach to ensure we are done with this threat for once and for all.  I would also like to see more assistance from the Federal government, but apparently, that is not going to happen any time soon."
2020-04-18 15:57:12,"In the past two weeks while here in Missouri mandated efforts and compliance were effectively, albeit slowly flattening the curve of new infections, and hospitalizations. 

Non pharmaceutical mitigation was beginning to work by lawfully being applied in and around Kansas city, and St. Louis. 

Numbers went from a high of 5,300 down to 4,700 total infections

Then, mr trump again began waging his holy profiteering war on science, professional expertise, and government efforts to help all people.

Our numbers are rising again. Not in protest, but in ill heath, positive test results, and hospital admissions due to covid-19.

Numbers creeping back up to almost 5,100 this morning.

He is able to communicate complex issues clearly and succinctly.  How different would the US experience of Covid-19 be, if he were president instead of the current disaster that resides in the White House."
2020-04-18 16:17:02,"If Trump asked people to jump off a high bridge, some would do it. Some Governors would also do it. Unfortunately, Trump and the Governors are not focusing on the ball; who will get sick and how many?  Apparently, they think they understand CVID-19 better than the health care experts or the medical profession. The grand old dollar signs and another 4 years of Trump loom large.  Opening now, stage wise or not, will only backfire. There is too big a chance of crossfire contamination. But Trump loves to incite trouble and unfortunately some in our society still have not figured it out."

2020-04-18 16:18:33,"In Indonesia, politicians have been known to foment ""protest"" by paying poor idle civilians to demonstrate. Many jump at the chance to earn a few extra rupiah, not caring if they share the political ideology or not. In this sense they are paid actors, just protestors for hire. They run into the streets en mass from their ""kampungs"" or villages, yelling and holding signs, etc. Of course alcohol and violence are often close at hand. 

Do these recent State ""protests"" have a similar origin and fuel? Is this yet another sign that we're closer to Indonesia's level of economic and political development than, say, Iceland, Canada, or New Zealand?"
2020-04-18 16:18:54,"A nation at war—whether the enemy is a foreign power or a deadly virus for which there is no vaccine or effective drug treatment—can not tolerate civil disobedience against a lawful public health decree when doing so is a real imminent threat to the lives of thousands.


Trump's contemptible gambit of deferring to Governors' on one day and unleashing his extremists followers the next to threaten violence and mayhem is a singular act of a President to sanction and encourage open, violent, rebellion.

President No Responsibility claimed this was war time in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Now President No Responsibility is giving aid and comfort to the enemy and threatening the lives of us all."

2020-04-18 15:55:51,"In Colorado the sole people allowed to be tested are those that literally cannot breath.  Because of the severe test shortage all others that think they might have the virus are simply told to go home and quarantine themselves. As for any that may have the virus and be asymptomatic?  Not being tested.  This is the precise reason multiple states have shut-in orders.  There is NO WAY to tell who is sick and who is not.

If the US would get its act together regarding testing, we could be safely restarting the economy right now.  Adequate testing of the population as a whole and people safely going back to work are closely intertwined.  Trump and Pence, rather than wasting time with tweets and news conferences, should be making this happen.  The ongoing failure of this administration on this issue and its effect on the economy cannot be overstated."
2020-04-18 16:06:20,"Regarding the wearing of masks, back in the 90s, when I first started working in Japan, the reason given for wearing masks was always to protect other people from their germs. So, if the Japanese thought they might have a cold or might be coming down with something, they would slap on a mask. It blew my mind as an American. These days (before coronavirus hit), more and more people with social anxiety and/or people having a “bad face” day (acne, canker sore, etc.) often wear masks, but the majority of people are still wearing masks to protect others (either out of respect for others or not wanting to be blamed for getting others sick)."

I've been in those too.  They're like giant Petri dishes moving around the city spreading germs.  The liberals want a nationwide shutdown, because they want everyone to think that a person living in rural America has the same change of catching this disease as someone living in Manhattan.  Not a chance."
2020-04-18 15:47:14,"If Trump is urging unmasked masses to crowd the capitols and protest, risking their health in the process, maybe he should join them. He’s ok with putting others at risk but something tells me he wouldn’t risk it himself."
2020-04-18 16:00:13,"It has been documented in the press over the past three years that Donald Trump operates with chaos. He has purposefully created chaos to either distract or foment some agenda he seeks to accomplish. It is no surprise that these current protests are supported tacitly or explicitly by Trump, because this is how he operates in the world.

The question for Trump and the rest of us is: Will this SOP of Trump work for him again as tens of thousands of Americans die and hundreds of thousands of Americans contract this deadly virus?

Everyone should expect that this is just the beginning of Trump's campaign of chaos which will parallel his political campaign. It is one of his most durable strategies. It must be expected and planned for."
2020-04-18 15:51:43,“Tacit approval”? The tweets from trump were explicit in their support of the protests. He supports open rebellion against state governments that are trying to protect their citizens. He is a very large part of our current problem.
2020-04-18 15:53:38,Our country is headed for a civil war and I don't mean a cold civil war.  Many of these protesters are openly carrying assault weapons.  During his impeachment trump even said that if he's impeached there will be a civil war.  This is his goal.  The one thing that he has actually accomplished has been dividing the country.

The President's insurrectionary tweets come the day after he publicly said  ""Governors should do what they think is best.""

And the Times, ever so politely, informs us that ""the Tweets alarmed some governors.""  I don't know for whom that sounds any longer like ""objective"" or ""neutral"" journalism.  It sounds to me like refusing to deal with the situation."

   Of course many of those out front on this argument the Dr.Oz's Rush, the Trumps, ect know that none of their loved ones will be working in the jobs that are the most dangerous. The governor of South Dakota would never let anyone she loves near that meat packing plant in Sioux Falls. It's far too risky. 
     It reminds me of the Civil War and the Vietnam War where in one the rich could buy their way out of service, or in Vietnam those with money could buy a doctor to discover shin splints or those with political influence could arrange to get their sons stateside postings.

2020-04-18 15:59:03,"As a fair demonstration, I believe Trump should start this reopening process by listing the states presently ready to open in his view, starting with states governed by Republicans.  Additionally, as a further testament to the faith, I'd like to see more of these re-opening demonstrations that Trump supports being made by citizens who have exited their cars instead of honking their horns from within the safety of their vehicle."
2020-04-18 16:04:34,The protests are relative to the thought process of weighing the consequences of an act or acts against the desired outcome and the undesired side effects.  From a political perspective this is just business as usual as the Democrats attempt to blame everything on Trump and emphasize opposition to things he believes we can moderate. On the scientific side we have several tools to elevate safety and slow the progress of COVID19. On the side of common sense and reasonable thought; the Democrats are unwilling to see that we can promote safety while not ushering in a recession.
2020-04-18 16:18:39,"I cannot believe that what gets Americans in the streets is being told to stay indoors as much as possible to slow the spread of a global pandemic.

If they're protesting closures, then they should really be protesting the lack of widespread testing: the only thing that will enable the lockdowns to be lifted.

It's really telling that these ""grassroots"" demonstrations are actually funded by wealthy right-wing donors. The wealthy are funding their own armies to fight their economic war during this health crisis.

Not protesting for workers rights, for better health care, for adequate financial assistance... but against sensible lockdowns... and gun rights?

What path is that country taking?"
2020-04-18 16:16:13,"We should prioritize the workers safety and welfare over the profits of business owners. A small business may have up to 250 workers but only 1 owner. Small businesses may be more modest than big ones but the owners (usually more well off) should be still be obligated to care for their employees. Stop letting small business owners off the hook, when their employees suffer."
2020-04-18 15:12:24,"The only safe way out of this catastrophe is through quick, free, systematic testing.

The USA cannot safely reopen unless it conducts more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the next month.

Health experts said that if the U.S. had tested earlier and more, the outbreak would have been much better contained. 
 
In mid-May, however, when the researchers estimate infections will have subsided somewhat and states are looking to reopen their economies, Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute believes vastly expanded testing will be crucial.

“I want to be able to identify everybody who is even mildly symptomatic,” he said. “So when I wake up one morning and have a sore throat and a fever, I should be able to go get tested. And then I want to be able to test all of my contacts if I turn out to be positive, so that I can do the test, trace and isolate strategy that’s so critical to allowing us to open up and stay open.”

Trump and his clueless Administration have had the opportunity to fully activate the Defense Production Act to ramp up the production of testing kits to Make America Safe Again, but have failed  to do take the right steps.

Trump used the act belatedly ONLY for 3M Company to make more masks, but has not used it to ramp up test kit production.

Testing is the answer.

Trump fails the Presidential test....over and over again.

No wonder he doesn't want anyone to see his college transcripts."
2020-04-18 15:42:17,"The best word I can use to describe the people who are protesting is immature. Like toddlers who want to eat candy for breakfast or teens who want to stay out past curfew, their desire to reopen the country may not hurt them RIGHT NOW, but in the long run it is better for everyone if they just follow the rules and be patient. We have more COVID-19 cases now than we did when we were ordered to shelter in place. What makes them think this is going away now that we have slowed the rate of transmission? A mature individual understands the math, science and logic behind the data. An immature person stamps their feet and says “I want what I want when I want it!”  But then again, look at who is leading them all."
2020-04-18 16:20:32,All those who want to have all preventive measures lifted now should choose one of the states that has not imposed any preventive measures and go there and live there anyway they want. The other states should then prohibit people from those particular states to enter in the states that have had preventing measures instituted.
2020-04-18 16:01:20,"If we take a look at what has happened to Italy, noticing that the number of infections in that country have been cut in half since the country imposed a complete lockdown, we can finally understand why social distancing and the council of doctors and medical experts has it’s merits. And this shows us in no uncertain terms what an absolute disaster of a leader Donald Trump is. The fact that he is now fomenting rebellion among his base shows him to be anything but a prudent and thoughtful Commander in Chief. He has become the second greatest menace in our country next to the coronavirus itself, and he will eventually have to be removed from power in much the same way that the virus will need to be  eradicated from our lives . 
We don’t have any control of the almost unbelievable stupidity of Trump’s base, or of the people who somehow don’t seem to understand that there will be second and third waves of this virus without the appropriate social distancing. What we do have control over is our leaders, and if we are still living in a democracy, then there must be a way to remove such a person who is now placing Americans in constant peril as a result of his thoughtlessness and arrogance. 
If the 25th amendment will not be invoked we need to take some other decisive action to rid ourselves of Donald Trump. It is called voting ."
2020-04-18 16:09:59,"I remember being taught 40 years ago in a course on U.S. Government that we as citizens are free to do as we please, as long as we don’t infringe on the rights of others. The “president” himself has encouraged his followers to protest en masses to “liberate” states with Democratic governors from the “tyranny” of social distancing and stay at home orders during a dangerous epidemic. Thus, the president and his misguided, delusional minions are infringing on the right of untold numbers of American citizens to life itself. Inciting these gatherings is an unforgivable act of violence perpetrated by a power hungry, madman, not a president. Trump needs to be held accountable for this crime. For starters he needs to be removed from office to preserve American lives. 

The right to live must be paramount in every decision made by our leaders."
2020-04-18 15:24:50,"Too much press is being given to these protests. Please, at least not have this story the leading headline. There are so many other issues on the front burner.

2020-04-18 15:06:08,"Maybe the government could designate an area as the 51st state of America and Trump and all the people who he's encouraging to go out and mingle and protest could move there. 
They could have a YUGE barrier wall built around it to keep out all the sane  people and within that State they could just do things the way they want. 
Covid-19 is a scam, a secret plot,Obama's revenge, Area 51 escapee. The more loony the idea the better...your all welcome. I'm betting they'll call it Trumpville.

And once they're all in there then the rest of America can get on with the huge task of reigning in the monster that is Covid-19 and hopefully get a steady, sensible, coordinated reopening of the economy that doesn't put even more lives at risk."
2020-04-18 15:52:46,"By all means, Trump supporters should be allowed to do whatever they want. However we need to label businesses and other establishments as virus free zones. All hospitals should be virus free zones. Any of his supporters would not be admitted. You reap what you sow"
2020-04-18 15:59:03,"It has now become crystal clear, based on his own words, that this president poses a clear and present danger to the safety and security of the American people.

Based on the reaction of the GOP ""leadership"", apparently he really could shoot someone in broad daylight in the middle of 5th Avenue and get away with it.  That is, metaphorically, what he is doing in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue.  On world wide television, with broadcasters happily pandering to his lust for the limelight."
2020-04-18 16:00:05,"If you want an example of how housebroken Americans are, right now there's mass protests in several states. They aren't demanding rent freezes, or UBI, or healthcare. Their demanding the right to go out and die to keep making the ruling class richer."
2020-04-18 16:01:20,"If we Americans are known for one thing, it's our stunning ability to not only not learn from history, but to repeat it. (see, Spanish Flu, Second Wave, 1918)

2020-04-18 16:11:28,"Trump and his loyal band of thugs have done their revolting math and made the resulting decision.

They're willing to gamble tens of thousands of other people's lives to rush an economic recovery in time to positively affect his re-election chances.  Despite all public health evidence to the contrary.  Part of their strategy is to limit testing as much as possible by not funding it and deliberately manipulating supply chains.  Blame China.  Blame WHO.  Blame Democrats.

Hundreds are dying here and they couldn't care less.  Natives tend to vote Democratic anyway.  Gee, I wonder why?"
2020-04-18 16:28:15,"Are the protesters the ones who ride motorcycles without helmets while smoking and vaping?

Trump: “They seem to be very responsible people to me.”  

I was in the the grocery store a few days ago.  I counted 30 customers.all wearing masks... most with protective gloves.  All employees wearing protective gear. THESE are responsible human beings, trying to keep their families and communities safe.

The countdown for the 2020 presidential election is on.  

""There are very fine people on both sides.""
“They seem to be very responsible people to me.”

The overwhelming majority of the country is in compliance, while Trump encourages the Ammon Bundys of the nation to revolt."
2020-04-18 16:02:48,President Trump should attend as many of these rallies that he is encouraging  as possible without a mask and make sure that he  shakes everyone's  hands
2020-04-18 16:18:28,What Trump is engaging in is a pure act of sedition against selected state governments. He has declared a de facto war against these states. It amounts to a reverse civil war.
2020-04-18 16:20:45,"Remember the right-wing babble about ""death panels"" under Obamacare?  Remember how according to them, Democrats wanted to throw Grandma under the bus?  Now the right-wing thinks it's perfectly fine to let the old geezers die for the sake of the stock market and Trump's reelection.  Were they born hypocrites, or did it take years of hard work and dedication?"
2020-04-18 15:09:50,"What a great way to help turn a Purple State into a Blue State! 

Strangely enough these are the folks who cheered when their president declared himself a wartime president; who have called this our Pearl Harbor moment. Let us think about the sacrifices of civil liberties willingly relinquished by the WWII generation, the economic sacrifices they made as production was focused on war-fighting, and the personal sacrifices of years in uniform and love ones lost. These whiners have been modestly put upon to exercise some civil responsibility. They don’t have the backbone for it, the self-discipline to control themselves for the betterment of mankind, nor the intellect to understand how despicable they appear."
2020-04-18 16:17:39,"It is incorrect to say that trump is fostering division and protests in states. He is only stirring the pot in states run by Democratic governors.

For instance, the protest in Ohio was before any of these others, and by now, everyone has seen the photo of the screaming freaks with their faces pressed against the glass doors, beating and bleating to get in, a scene right out of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and yet trump didn't tweet out a peep about Ohio protests, a state led by a republican governor.

So again, it is incorrect to say he's stirring hate against stay-at-home orders. He's only stirring it in states led by Democrats."

I note that some were handing out with gloveless hands chocolate to kids.
I also heard the toddler in chief speak approvingly of these Trump supporters and say ""they like me"". One headline I saw went thus
""Trump Refuses to Condemn Coronavirus Lockdown Protesters: They ‘Like Me’"" (Daily Beast).
Yes Donald. Is that the only requirement? Foreign leaders as for example in China figured that out long ago.
You are not qualified to even be a dog catcher. You would be very incompetent at that too. I would not let you look after my own dog."
2020-04-18 15:12:35,Trump should be taken to court for inciting his followers to break the law and order and for endangering the lives of thousands and thousands of health care professionals that are risking their lives day in and day out to save American lives from the demolishing effects fo the pandemic.
2020-04-18 15:17:51,"A couple of hundred shouting white conservatives sure do get a lot of attention and respect.  I guess it’s the quarantine equivalent of the small town diner where the reporters go to find the opinions of old retired white Trump supporters and report that yep, they are still Trump supporters.

Why not turn the camera around onto the silent, mask wearing majority?"
2020-04-18 15:23:02,"This is Darwinism at its finest.  They should have to wear a badge that they voluntarily did not social distance and should not receive health care if they get sick. 

It sadden me that they do not care for others in their community.  They must have elderly parents, know people on the front lines of this fight against the COVID-19 and yet they choose to endanger their community.  Shame on them."

2020-04-18 16:22:40,"Trump took his oath of office to protect the country from all enemies - foreign and domestic.

What he has done is to foment a rebellion against Democratic governors who are struggling to save their citizens from the worst ravages of the pandemic with little help from the federal government.  So it should be clear to everyone that this is about him and his re-election.

Note to protesters:  Your freedom does not extend to jeopardizing my life.  You want to drive without a seat belt?  Have at it.  You want to drive drunk at 100 MPH?  No way!

Remember in November!"

Even if he's defeated in November, it still doesn't bode well for your society since a large swath of your nation believes in his thinking.  Trump is symptomatic of a society gone off the rails, but he is not the cause.  That should worry you the most in terms of your country's future."
2020-04-18 15:26:58,"When I came to US I thought I was leaving everything behind. Ignorance, arrogance, not believing in science. And now I watch in horror when I see and hear all these people. I was wrong. Human nature doesn’t change."

2020-04-18 16:23:28,There is a difference between yelling fire in crowded theatre and setting a crowded theatre on fire. This is what Trump is doing by sowing social unrest.
2020-04-18 15:00:42,"Protestors?  How many?  Demonstrators?  Exactly how many?  How many people has the most powerful man in the world actually been able to muster after a direct call to arms?  

I've seen the footage of the pathetic few as they toddle to and fro, with flags that take up more square footage than the crowd itself.  I'm not impressed.  

The press is making this seem like a huge movement and in doing so, helps to promote and vitalize it.  

Report this: when the President of the United States tells men with guns to ""Liberate"" their states and all he gets in response is a few entitled whiners to heed his call - posing in their bandanas and dad jeans - he's a man who has lost it.  This isn't a protest movement, it's a spasm of adolescent discontent."
2020-04-18 15:32:58,"The problem is that when the Trumpites who are protesting without masks and in close proximity get sick and are hospitalized they will be requiring the sacrifice (perhaps even lives) of doctors, nurses, medical personnel, EMTs, etc.
Do they deserve medical care in this case? Do medical personnel owe them their lives? Should these people be tagged for ""do not use ventilators""?

I think that protesters who defy state laws on social distancing should be fined a lot of money and perhaps arrested. Certainly their guns should be confiscated since they are threatening state governments.
Trump should be sued immediately for endangering lives. Perhaps Trump should be arrested and taken out of office since he is fomenting insurrection against the government. What Trump is doing is against the law."
2020-04-18 16:08:24,"So the deluded people who are demanding their “freedom”, will they expect to get help from our stressed medical system if they get sick? Will they take any responsibility if cases and deaths spike? I’m guessing the answers are “yes” and “no”.

2020-04-18 16:26:55,"I’d be very curious to know how many of these protestors are retired / never work? Also, were any of them paid to participate in the protest? 

Over the last few days, the Republican sycophants, who had been mute during most of this crisis, have again become mouthpieces for Mr. Trump. Some examples:

* Martha McSally’s weekly newsletter included bulletpoints 1) the head of the WHO should resign and 2) China is to blame for the COVID-19 virus. 
* Senator Kennedy of Louisiana saying economy activity should resume even though it will probably result in a spread of the virus. In contrast, the Louisiana Health dept is saying the state will be grappling with the virus until the end of the year. 
* Rep. Jordan of Ohio slamming state officials for using draconian tactics to limit crowd sizes, etc.  In contrast, a co-worker’s father, who lives in an assisted living home in the Columbus area, just found out that one of his nurses tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.

Many Americans will look back and recoil at the sight of themselves as Trump worshipers, but many more will not, feeding a wave of Trumpian filth that, if allowed to grow, will mark end of American Democracy and of the US as a civilized nation.

In this absurd act of political malpractice, state authorities cannot jeopardize the well-being of police, other frontline workers, and the general public to break-up these illegal assemblies. They should accommodate the protestors by allowing them the space to protest. Let the media interview them and broadcast footages. I’m sure many of these geniuses will post online and tweet their participation. As they became the next wave of Covid-19 patients, we should hold Trump accountable even if his supporters do not."

It's thoroughly disgusting to hear Trump constantly lie, contradict himself, foment disiveness, and make vicious attacks on the people and institutions that are actually doing the work needed to keep our citizens healthy (and then will rebuild our economy).

It's equally disgusting that the entire Republican Party continues to say nothing about his destruction of our country (and sometimes join in with him).

And it's sad that 1/3 of our country has been so brainwashed by the Radical Right and its Media Cabal for the past 20+ years that they can no longer comprehend truth versus lies, good versus evil, etc.

2020-04-18 16:38:45,The debate isn’t about opening the economy it is about when to open the economy. Trump should be pressing for an opening but as usual he chooses the wrong way to deliver his message and his opponents jump on the way he delivers it not the message. As to when to open the economy I respect Harvard researchers but their models are based on questionable data ( as is everyone else’s) and their assumptions which we don’t know. The question of how many tests are needed should show a range of these best guess models from other reliable sources. Many governors are moving forward on a gradual basis let them do it.

It's certainly an American right to protest. But people who believe the virus is a hoax and Fauci is a liar and the shutdown is fake news  (as the posters proclaim) should spend less time driving around with Trump hats and campaigning like the President, and more time personally helping to open the city, by fighting the pandemic."

 protests, filled  with vapid cries that promote ""me"" as 
the sole arbiter of how to act at a time of national crisis
serves no good purpose at all. 

It would be good to lower   the temperature   of this coverage since it is only playing into trump's ground game of
attacking without attacking frontally governors (and certain
ones at that) in crucial swing states. 

His political strategy has always been contingent upon
generating free publicity from compliant media who love to cover his outrages with the usual tones of serious gravitas
at how misleading it all is, as if any of that mattered to him or his devotees. This back and forth between
the liar in chief and his media coverage has been a dynamic that he has been an expert at  exploiting.

He knows that there is zero political price to pay for sticking it to his base's ""enemies"" from his bully pulpit. Covering him as MSM insists upon doing  just continues this foul, diabolical, style of governance that is bringing us to a dangerous point of no return when wide spread violence breaks out to intimidate

His domination of the Republican Party is total and Republicans are obviously terrified of  him. Even Mitt Romney, whose seat in the Senate is seemingly invulnerable, won't utter a word of dissent. (At least not in public). It's Trump versus the Democrats. The two party system is history."

2020-04-18 16:34:07,"Testing Testing Testing, It is needed ASAP. It is crucial ly essential to enabling the opening of the economy. trump stubbornly refuses to exercise the power he has  (that state governors do not have) to mobilize the where-with-all to make it happen nation-wide. While trump dithers he is deliberately being recklessly derelict, negligent, and yes, even criminal
to which he will undoubtedly be brought to account for in due course."
2020-04-18 16:35:17,"Why doesn't Trump open the economy at one of his rallies? He could even have an opening bell. He should just show up in the state of his choice, tell the rally the crisis is over, and it's time for work. He won't have to abide by any governor's stay at home order, because his authority is total. The best thing to do in this kind of situation is ignore the experts and do what you want. C'mon Trump! So WEAK."
2020-04-18 16:40:56,"The pandemic shines a spotlight on Republican macro strategy. Big money (the Devoses, the Koch Brothers) tricks working class clowns into fighting for action that benefits big money at the expense of the clowns- under the guise of supporting individual freedom.
It’s no coincidence that the conservative groups behind these protests benefit from a bustling economy, and don’t care one whit about the price working people will pay for a premature opening of the country. But they frame the issue in terms of individual rights, thereby encouraging the working class to push the country towards action that will inevitable cause working class carnage.
Why isn’t the press doing more to expose this particular hypocrisy?"
2020-04-18 16:41:07,"These are many of the same people who park in front of the History Channel and grow misty over the sacrifices made by the Greatest Generation during their time of crisis.

They need to just deal.  I'm not about to die for the Dow."
2020-04-18 16:43:05,"Once the protestors who were not practicing social distancing and proper hygiene get the virus, we will see if they feel like reopening society too soon.

2020-04-18 16:43:28,"Here is what may be happening.  The predictions in mid-March were that almost 220 million will be infected and several million will die if we did not lock down USA.  The lockdown decisions by the conscious governors helped out in controlling the spread.  Currently in US close to 40K people have died.  So, Trump, his minions, and their genocidal instincts are not satisfied with the death toll because they care nothing for lives.  The current protests to open up the lockdown measures and the ill-guided support for protests is their attempt to pave the path for mass destruction.  There is a saying in Sanskrit that ""when a leader's ideas are illogical, irrational, egotistical, self-centered, and anti-social you can see his destructive intent.""  The sad thing is US system does not have anyone who can stop this Trump.  It is a dictatorial democracy."
2020-04-18 16:30:03,"Well, the folks who love Trump and would follow him off a cliff, like lemmings, need to rally somewhere. The pandemic has only highlighted their cult-like behavior. So this is nothing new and means nothing more than what Trump's rallies meant before the shutdowns - that his followers would literally kill themselves for him. But we already knew that. It doesn't mean anyone should listen to them, and thank God, the governors are not. And the vast majority of Americans do not agree with them."
2020-04-18 16:31:35,Trump owns the reopening. No dodging from any resultant catastrophe and blaming governors.
2020-04-18 16:39:58,"Everyone who goes out and mindlessly follows Trump’s command to protest must be registered somehow.  So when they are diagnosed with the virus, our brave health care professionals who risk their lives every day should not have to waste their efforts on these people.  They should be left to die since this is their choice, and the precious resources should instead be used to save others who care more about the good of society."
2020-04-18 16:33:20,"Trump's recent incendiary remarks prove it's not about our nation's health, Trump is mainly interested in himself, whether he can use the coronavirus to get himself re-elected."
2020-04-18 16:37:37,The economy reopening is one thing.   With no costumers because of the economic measures taken against the corona virus people are left with jobs and means of paying their bills.  With Wall Street streaking to its over priced previrus levels the consumer is in much more serious condition.
2020-04-18 16:40:12,"The President of the United States is advocating a revolt against regulations imposed by duly elected governors who are exercising legal powers to protect the health of all , not a select few, of the citizens of their states.  The governors he has chosen are Democrats, not the Republican ones who are
more cautious about opening their states, so his incitement
to revolt is purely political.  Is this not sedition? 

What if I advocated ""liberating"" the White House from this
elected presidency?  How long would it take before I would be held on charges of treason or terrorism?"
2020-04-18 16:42:06,"Here’s a thought. If I own a store, can I refuse to allow people into my store if they are not wearing a mask and/or gloves? Is this a violation of their civil rights. I’m not asking this to be snarky. It’s a legitimate question. Similar to “no shoes, no shirt, no service”.  Just add “no mask, no gloves, no entry”.  Any legal experts out there know the answer to this?"
2020-04-18 16:43:37,"These people are making a statement, but amazingly it’s not at all what they think they are telling. 

They are telling that they are unable to understand why the rules are needed, when literally the whole world understands them. 

They are also telling that the American society doesn’t work : in the entire Europe, people have it rough but they are still managing because their families and the government are helping them. 

The fact that these people are protesting shows that the situation they voted themselves in doesn’t work : either they die of the virus or they die of hunger. The very fact that they are protesting shows that the politics they themselves support DO NOT WORK."
2020-04-18 16:28:17,"Seems to me there is a terrific potential for violence with these children. The tantrum they throw next, don't forget, might reflect the right owning the supermajority of guns. 

Then what would the governors do? Call out the national guard, which is under whose authority? Then what? 

Whatever the case, reasonable people should be disabused by now that the right can be reasoned with."
2020-04-18 16:35:13,"Of course, President Trump is encouraging the protests. He wants to win reelection. But this means he cares little for the possible consequences of removing the restrictions. He cares little for the consequences because he cares little for people. As long as he gets what he wants he doesn't care. He has never cared for anyone but himself."
2020-04-18 16:38:14,"Well, there certainly are glaring inconsistencies and stupidities about the lockdown. Here’s one no one is talking about: As many of us squirrel away in our homes most of the day and wear masks before going into stores, people are still using hook-up apps for casual sex. The hook-up apps were never shutdown. So, let me get this straight: I can’t get my roots covered up at the hair salon, but I can use a hook-up app to meet someone for casual sex. Does that make sense to you? The liquor stores are open but the hardware stores are not. Would someone like to explain that one? With such ridiculous inconsistencies, it’s time to reopen small businesses. You can continue prohibiting large gatherings and advising people to telecommute if they can, but it’s time—with precautions taken—to let small businesses operate."
2020-04-18 16:27:51,"I think it's reasonable to assume that the vast majority of protesters have not unexpectedly lost a loved one to Covid-19.

In a sense, our perspective as a nation has been somewhat warped by the relative success of our social distancing. After all, we went from predictions of up to 240,000 deaths down to 60,000 - and we're not even at that figure (yet).

This is stating the obvious, but there are essentially only two likely outcomes from lifting restrictions earlier than the consensus medical and scientific recommendations.

One is that the protesters will turn out to be right, and we'll find a balance between restored commerce and a ""tolerable"" infection rate that neither overwhelms our healthcare systems nor takes too many lives.

The other is that the virus will roar back in reopened regions of the country, and some of these protesters will then suffer a personal loss that may make them regret their vehement demands of the moment.

I think the protesters are being extraordinarily foolish, yet for the sake of those loved ones, and for us all, I hope they're right. Time will tell."
2020-04-18 16:32:06,"All of these protesters should wear an arm band or something to show that they are not participating in social distancing... so the rest of us can decide if we want to have any thing to do with them. Sounds reasonable to me

For now, it's probably better to avoid people wearing Maga hats."
2020-04-18 16:33:18,"The west, and east coast along with Louisiana control 90 percent of the food and goods that flow to to rest of the country, if we are not open for business, they will not be open for business."

Our government cannot be run by the seat of your pants. No plans in place, but plenty of golf, tweeting and wasted time. No experts with experience, can’t be trusted!
The Trump administration’s micromanagement style of governing along with so many vacancies had held up;
most importantly -
RELIEF checks
Unemployment checks 
Feeding the hungry
TESTING
Our country has not invested in an overhaul of systems to properly handle this situation. Lack of important key personnel who had been let go under this administration would have probably made this process better. Professionals experienced in administering these programs and programmers are not sitting by the phone waiting for a call from Trump administration to come back.
FEMA if it we’re run properly could have played a more important role in keeping people fed.
No organization in moving food that is being thrown away, no organization utilizing vacant schools and large restaurants chains to secure refrigeration ( yet these are the businesses that are receiving the PPP loans by separating their conglomerates into smaller entities to qualify), no organization purchasing food and distributing it.
No wonder people are recklessly uprising to end the shelter in place to minimize the Coronavirus .Hunger will do this .
Perhaps if FEMA would have asked each state governor for assistance to pick up,distribute and store food in states this might have been accomplished.
Trump is to blame."
2020-04-18 16:37:57,"It would be good to see responsible citizens counter protesting on a massive scale, responsibly from home using online tools (zoom etc) with sufficient media coverage."
2020-04-18 16:43:35,A new and frightening low. I had hoped never to see the day a president of this country would openly foment rebellion against democratically elected leaders who are following sound scientific protocols to keep their citizens safe. Too sad beyond measure. House and Senate leaders need to condemn this lunacy on both sides of the aisle unequivocally and immediately; failure to do so is a dereliction of duty that invites disaster.
2020-04-18 16:32:35,"Once again the focus of the protestors is wrong, but Trump and the Republicans will manipulate people just to win and to enjoy the chaos.  The governors are trying to save lives, and if people are suffering from job losses, it is the federal government which should have provided support to businesses so that people could stay on the payroll.  The job losses are not the fault of the governors but are the result of an ill thought out financial bailout.  The federal government needs to act again, while governors do their best to keep people safe from the virus."
2020-04-18 16:39:06,I agree with the comment made yesterday that Trump is promoting/fomenting insurgency against duly elected government officials -that's got to be treasonous at its core. His kind of protestors border on mobs rather than peaceful protestors.
2020-04-18 16:42:32,"Sending people back to work too early is sending the poor to work too early.

Are we supposed to imagine that the rich will be toiling at the tills and the rest - nope.

Sending the poor to work is sending Democratic Party voters to work, especially in the key states. 

How they plan to demand this I don't know, but threat of penury is inherent. 

Risk or die - the wealthy profit either way."
2020-04-18 16:30:58,"I thought the current GOP's platform was all about pushing for ""smaller govt"" but almost everything coming out of the White House since the coronavirus is about making the federal govt more authoritarian than it has ever been in the past.  So many contradictions."
2020-04-18 16:34:25,"The rabble-rousing demonstrations in Michigan reportedly funded by the family of a cabinet secretary  and a similar one planned for today in Texas by another ill-informed  Trump supporter are a disservice to a state's ability to protect its citizens--those who accept reasonable recommendations and lock themselves in thereby  protecting themselves and healthcare workers as well as  the elderly and others equally vulnerable.  Are crowded protests an intelligent way to combat the spread of  a disease that has very silently cost over 35,000 lives in the United States against which there is currently no seat-belt or other protection? 

The demonstrators' disrespect for Dr. Fauci and other researchers working day and night makes one wonder whether those who engage in  such actions have an inkling of  the damage they are doing not just to the families whose loved ones have died and been buried via teleconferencing but to the  great America they supposedly espouse.

That a President encourages such incredibly abysmal  behavior---as he did in Charlottesville in 2018--requires a free press and  all media  to point out the damage he does  in no uncertain terms so that those of us who would like to live free and healthy can continue to do so."
2020-04-18 16:40:55,"For what it's worth, I want to talk about a two important historical situations tied directly to this pandemic and the one in 1918:

1) Just today, the NYT reports that the number of COVID19 hospitalizations has finally started to drop after the national lock-down that started at the beginning of March. Living here in Italy, I can tell you that people are suffering a bit from cabin fever; however, they have been adhering to the instructions of the authorities. We aren't exactly out of the woods yet; however, the social distancing and closing things down has had an impact.

2) I was just listening to a podcast with Nancy Bristow, the author of ‘American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic’. An very timely and important thing she mentions is that those places that stuck with strict distancing, masks, etc. recovered far faster that those who did not. 

Of course, in those days, the poor and unfortunate didn't have any safety net to fall back on, so they suffered badly. I understand the impatience with the closings, but if history is any indication, there are things that work and things that don't. I fear that more people are going to suffer and die needlessly if this isn't handled more rationally and systematically."
2020-04-18 16:41:03,"Governor Cuomo, in his address today, reminded us that no one wants to see our state reopen more than he does.  How could any governor be pleased with a shutdown, for that matter?
But what counts is a plan for doing so safely.  Cuomo laid out how testing is the key to resuming life.  He spelled out all the elements that go into testing and then crucial role of the federal government in their implementation.  So what say you, Donald?  Put aside your animosity, stop encouraging protests, stop wasting time tweeting, and use your office to get the reopening you want!"
2020-04-18 16:32:15,"....all that being said. Trump is a master at dividing and (in his mind) conquering. I live in Marin County north of the San Francisco Bay Area. Certainly a liberal, Democrat voting bloc. I have witnessed over this past week a Howard Beale reaction by some residents to the continued self quarantine and increasing social distancing rules. We have to start wearing masks in public NLT Wednesday. In a County that as a result of early action has done relatively ""well."" With all respect to those that have been stricken. My fear is that as we are all tired of the isolation if we continue down a path of lockdown with no date certain in sight emotions take over and perhaps the thought of liberation doesn't sound so far fetched - playing right into Trumps plan. And some people will discount just how vile a human being our President is."
2020-04-18 16:33:20,"If we at least had widespread, ongoing testing we could have some kind of plan to reopen but until that happens I’m certainly not going to be going to a restaurant or congregating with lots of people in public. You can’t force people to put their lives in danger and until people feel safe the economy will not go back to “normal”."
2020-04-18 16:34:17,"The surprise is that these protests took so long to develop. Not everyone shares the same view of the balance of risks and local conditions are obviously highly variable. Local governments are in a tough bind since any relaxation, which of course inevitability will lead to some additional virus-related deaths, will expose them to criticism. In the several particularly hard hit areas of the country these officials are already under attack for failing to issue stay-at-home orders earlier. Even worse, local governments will feel the need to justify these draconian measures that have created spectacular levels of unemployment which will make it harder to quickly ease the restrictions. So you will see mistakes on both ends of the shutdown, more deaths and more collateral damage."
2020-04-18 16:35:55,"Let me get this straight. On the one hand, they're blaming China for not doing enough to contain the outbreak. On the other hand they're fomenting rebellion under the guise of ""liberating"" Michigan and other states who are taking those same aggressive steps to contain the outbreak. How is the cognitive dissonance with these people not completely paralyzing?"
2020-04-18 16:43:12,"At the start of March there were less than 70 cases in the U.S. Now there are over 100x that amount and almost 33,000 Americans have died.

To use this pandemic with thousands of lives lost and to increase the risk for for more of the same by encouraging states to open up when testing has been inadequate, is surely the lowest thing that Trump has done. Imagine hospitals getting overwhelmed...everywhere. Imagine the fatigue of front-line health care workers and their further exposure to the coronavirus if hospitalizations jump as a result.  All in the name of preserving power! Isn't this the lowest thing he's done? How much lower can he go?"
2020-04-18 16:34:29,"Public health experts ignore the damage to the economy, not to mention the mostly unmentioned mental health crisis.  People can die just as easily of homelessness, hunger, poverty, chaos, rioting, suicide, domestic violence and any number of other atrocities that are or might soon be accompanying this pandemic as they can die of COVID-19.

If we had a reasonable government (on either side of the aisle), and if we could count on that government to take care of citizens instead of corporations, we could ride out the economic fallout and mitigate the mental and social health effects.  But we don't have such a government, so we remain trapped in our homes, many of us unemployed and uninsured, not knowing how we're going to pay the rent or the mortgage, let alone how we're going to afford any sort of medical care (COVID-19 or otherwise) we might need.

There are multiple crises going on here and they all need to be addressed.  Simply telling us that continued social distancing is necessary for our ""safety"" and that that's more important than the economy does not address very real and vital parts of the crisis.

No one really talks about the effect that the severe downturn in the world economy will have on tens of millions of people world-wide - especially in the third world."
2020-04-18 16:41:04,"In areas where people are resisting the shelter in place orders from governors , with their hospitals not receiving PPE or financial help from federal government . Our doctors, nurses, hospital personnel, and emergency services personnel that are not being protected may decide that it is not worth their life if people are recklessly exposing themselves and strike.
Who could blame them?"
2020-04-18 16:41:47,One key thing is the accuracy of Covid-19 tests.   A 50% error rate is chance the error rate of the test if you have the disease is 30%.   Fixing this ought to be a number one priority as inaccurate tests prevent serious strategy based on testing.   If we had a accurate contact trace and quarantine strategy based on serious testing we would quash the disease.   As it stands it will linger on in the absence of accurate tests.   This needs serious discussion.
2020-04-18 16:34:08,"The ""Liberate"" comments, given their context,  are so bad, that it's now fair to say that even at age 13 most Americans would make a wiser leader of the nation than Trump, if 13-year-olds could be President.  Certainly, when I was 13, i would disagree with my parents/society on things like curfew times or chores, but never about anything science-related (which is what epidemiology is).    It's unbelievable that the nation of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln has gotten to this point."
2020-04-18 16:46:44,"With more rudderless subversion from Trump the country may effectively fracture into 5 or 6 regions as we grasp for leadership.  I’m waiting for state regional governments to throw up roadblocks to stop neighboring states access without testing.

Forcing children to ignore medical science and open schools and stores  so the economy might just bump up a point or Trump can gain a political point, or the parents can preach their gospel IS psychological addiction and criminal negligence.
Even Seal Teams get to choose.  This is not manhood, womanhood.  This is just another narcissistic lie."

-- The economy goes into recession/depression, I lose my reelection in November.
-- I reopen the economy; thousands of additional Americans die, but the economy grows again.
-- I leave the economy shut down, thousands fewer Americans die.
-- American lives are expendable.
-- Therefore, I hurry to reopen the economy."
2020-04-18 16:46:30,"Isn’t encouraging people to protest in large groups, and thereby to ignore the known risk of catching coronavirus and maybe dying from it, not to mention spreading it, reckless homicide? Do we encourage people to drive drunk?"
2020-04-18 16:46:55,"Forget about Trump for two seconds.

Where is Republican congressional leadership? Where are Republican Governors (besides Hogan)?

Their true leader, McConnell is silent. 

The man has not said a peep during this entire thing because he is busy, behind the glare of the crises, working to stock judicial openings, organize repeal of environmental regulations and laws, and craft covid-related legislation to benefit himself and other wealthy men in his base.

And all those Republicans in congress just line up behind Mitch so they can get the biggest crumbs from his awful-doings.

This is just so disheartening and scary."
2020-04-18 16:47:34,"How could he resist? Can any one be surprised? The opportunity to portray several Democratic leaders at once as dictators stripping the people (his base) of their constitutional right to think only of themselves (before their fellow countrymen) is so very Trumplike. Who cares that probable results include more Covid-19 infection and death. Never mind the possibility of mob violence at such protests is massively heightened by the crisis anxiety that underlays everything people are doing now. A leader who wanted to really govern would seek to diffuse such flashpoints in the body politic. A creature solely interested in political power would naturally seek to fan the flames. Enter Trump on Twitter. If the country is able to move on from this pandemic relatively intact it will be despite his activities rather than because of them. It will be those governors who can negotiate the tightrope of required Trump obeisance to get federal aid and the real work of marshaling the forces of state government to confront the enemy (that's the virus Mr. President, not the governors, if you haven't noticed) who will be the difference between success and failure here. The fact that they have to beg for help from Trump, and deal with unruly protests supported by him, is beyond the pale."
2020-04-18 16:48:29,"Central in your picture of protestors is a woman holding a scribbled sign saying ""We the people believe in GOD"".  

Sorry, ma'am, but (a) lots of us don't -- it is, after all the 21st century and no longer an age in which myths, faeries, etc. are of concern, and (b) what has such a belief to do with shelter-in-place?"
2020-04-18 16:49:11,"Your President and his band of enablers in government and the media, are actually encouraging Americans to protest against their (Democratic) government?  That truly is a banana republic mentality.  He knows people won’t follow the guidelines he set forth for social distancing and numbers of people allowed in gatherings.  He and they are encouraging people to PROTEST for political reasons, irregardless of his own and public health guidelines.  And this is all before the country has the testing capability the experts say is needed.  Where is the call for the use of the 25th amendment?  Is it after more people die, or after the police or national guard start having to arrest people?"
2020-04-18 16:44:44,"Time for Fauci and Brix to get off the Trump campaign. They seem to have had their heads turned by all the adulation and cannot see that they are being setup for a big fall. What will happen in the next few weeks is that Texas, Florida and Arkansas will open up, while Fauci and Brix continue to claim ineffectually that the federal govt needs to help with testing. In about 6 weeks Trump will need to pull back, when the elderly housing and prisons explode with corona. At that time Trump will point to his two ""public health"" acolytes and claim no responsibility for what they forced him to do. Cuomo, Newsom and Whitmer will look very thoughtful and the Tea Party types will be in chaos, given the number of their parents who have died. In the long run it will not change things politically, Virginia, Michigan and Minnesota are not likely to rush into opening. Trump will go down and Fauci and Brix with him."
2020-04-18 16:47:54,"We Americans want to hear what we want to hear, so the for-profit media whips up partisanship to fill their coffers with no regard for the outcome to the people.  Here are the truths that guide my worldview:

1) An enormous number of people are going to suffer terribly, no matter what we do, from illness and death, or poverty, despair, depression, substance abuse, and endless poverty;

2) We cannot copy South Korea or even Germany because Americans are so divided by identity politics that most of our neighbors have become our enemies;

3)  Diagnostic and surveillance testing are obviously important, but self-directed testing on demand is an utter waste of resources, feeds the personal health anxieties and political partisanship that drives it, and creates a false sense of security (a 'negative' test proves almost nothing);

4) I don't mind paying for the most expensive healthcare system in the world, but now they have failed at their primary task which is preventing disease and failing that, curing it.  Trillions of dollars a year to a healthcare system that had no plan;

5) The government of the PRC did this, they knew what they were doing, and half of Americans who have an opinion are giving them a free pass for partisan political reasons.

Thank you, and good day."
2020-04-18 16:48:08,"With these protests, which the president is agitating for, to create chaos for blue governors, in particular, the sacrifices of our brave nurses, doctors, first responders, and critical workers, the sacrifices of people who have stayed home to flatten the curve, will be made null and void. A wasted effort. The people fomenting these protests, such as the president, who is supposed to lead us to safety, not drive us all insane, remain in safe bubbles, while their ill-informed base endangers everybody, and most especially, the old, the disabled, and the poor. Once again the rich and powerful are willing to sacrifice Americans for profits - they even say so, while risking nothing themselves. Every one of these ""open it now"" shills, who are fomenting these protests, would expect, and get, the full complement of treatment if he or she became ill. Will you? As we've noted, the rich and powerful get ventilators, get tested, get bailouts, while the rest of us get the life or death lottery created by the our rapacious health ""insurance"" lobby, our incompetent/corrupt white house, and by the anti-american favoritism the president engages in when he apportions medical resources unevenly, by fiat, to favorites, as if he is a king dispensing largess. With these wrong-headed protests (which are effectively, forced openings), our odds of getting ill rise, and our dead die for nothing. If the most vulnerable among us is made sacrifice, anybody and everybody is fair game."

I do think that those who decide to do their own thing and that action  directly or indirectly  leads to more infection, they should 1. be held liable (100k fine for each person infected) and 2. any covid-19 health care cost is paid by that person not others (i.e. health insurance or government)."
2020-04-18 16:49:08,The person who can make the most difference in resolving the present crisis. Where are the tests and contact tracing on a massive scale that are needed to get us out the situation. Even this article fails to make that clear. The only path out is federal leadership and coordination for all 50 states. We have acted as though we are a poor nation with few resources. Completely shameful.
2020-04-18 15:31:24,The Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the U.S. Supreme Court decisions rendered unto make it clear that state governors and mayors cannot continue lockdowns in those places where the President says can reopen. Civil liberties have been violated too long and people are rising up in indignation. This indignation will grow by the day.
2020-04-18 15:13:57,"Basically what these protestors are saying is “I don’t think I’m going to die and I don’t care if you die. I don’t care if doctors or nurses die, either.” It really does not engender much sympathy towards them AND it guarantees that I will not be spending money on anything other than groceries and streaming services for a long time to come.

Just because some whackadoodle governor says “the economy is open” doesn’t mean I can or will participate in that economy. When I have the money to spare, I will spend it on the things and people I value. Note; those things have very little to do with Donald Trump or his supporters."
2020-04-18 15:21:35,"If a space aliens arrived on earth today and took stock of how humans organized their societies without any of the biases or expectations that come from a knowledge of history, I'm certain they would view the USA as a failed state.  

It's not coming.  It's already here.  And it's incredibly sad.  

The most cases of COVID-19 in the world and the most deaths.  Is there another country on earth protesting restrictions right now?  Honest question.  

It's so disheartening for the rest of us."
2020-04-18 15:26:57,"When reading about these protests I can’t help but wonder what percentage of the population is represented by these actions.  The people interviewed seem unhinged.  Are they just a loud, small minority receiving excess coverage through outrageous statements and actions?  That was the formula used by Trump to run his first campaign successfully all the way to the White House.  Now we are seeing the same tactics used again, but this time is even more alarming with public health in the balance.  Are we feeding the beast by focusing so much attention on these groups?  These are frightening times.  Reading this, it is hard not to believe the country is being taken over by fanatics and conspiracy theorists, but that is not what I see in my day to day.  I see people keeping distance, my employer working hard to keep us informed, employed, and giving back to the community, People I see are resigned but understand this is what we have to do to support each other and our health care system.  Am I living in a bubble, or is this coverage just playing Trump’s game once again?"
2020-04-18 16:59:17,"Here, in California, two studies, one by Stanford and other by the City of Los Angeles, may alter our views about the virus. 

Based on 3,000 blood samples in Santa Clara, the Stanford team found far wider infection rates than expected among the population -- forty to eighty times as much as first thought.

The Los Angeles study will be released Monday but a spokesperson for the Health Department said its sampling will produce similar results.

These studies vastly expand the pool of infected persons and that suggests a far, far larger denominator to be divided into Covid-19 deaths. The arithmetical result is that the morbidity rate may well be, as many have suggested. no worse than the seasonal flu.

I am sure there will be further studies but these are two respectable sources and we might consider whether this massive economic shut-down and suspension of civil liberties was warranted."
2020-04-18 17:09:03,"Unlike the way this article reports it Trump did not voice the opinion that the protesters were correct but said they have the right to protest (they do). I heard the President's live comment on it. He needed to walk a fine line between antagonizing his base and endorsing the view that social distancing is critical. He has repeatedly, at virtually every briefing,   praised the American people for responding the way they have. Dr. Fauci has stated very clearly that the President listens and has followed the recommendations of the medical team."
2020-04-18 17:01:00,"I am scared. I believe Trump always knew that in time of trouble , he could always call on his extremists with guns to come out. And to mention the 2nd amendment in his tweets makes clear what his intentions were. 
It's hard enough to weather this pandemic, but when you're afraid of your own president, it's terrifying."
2020-04-18 17:01:28,"I want Trump to lose in Nov. But I fear he's heading toward victory. What many don't want to see is that those rural and working class voters are not buying this pandemic fear. They're not afraid and they resent the gov and people telling them how to live their lives right now. They are loosing their jobs and see this lock down as a liberal agenda creating an economic disaster that is unnecessary. They watch the CDC proclaim outrageous numbers and then quietly revise them down and confirmed reports that officials are marking deaths as COVID even when they test negative for the virus. They despise government strong handed curfews and shut downs. Tell them it's mandatory to wear a mask and it'll be the last straw. All the while, any dissenting opinion against the quarantine and ""stay at home"" campaigns is squashed, mainly by liberals. COVID is like the Mueller investigation all over again, everyone is just so sure this will be Trump's undoing that they're not paying attention to the realities present in opposing view points."
2020-04-18 17:04:18,"Out of curiosity, if these people who want to open too soon get to go to work and do what they need to do, and they are infected in the process, do I as a health care provider still need to take care of them?  Do I get to chose?  If they don't want the government in their lives telling them how to protect society in the best way we know how, perhaps the government shouldn't be telling me what to do when someone comes to my emergency room cyanotic from respiratory failure.  Just wondering......"
2020-04-18 17:09:06,"I find this behavior absolutely terrifying.  I am truly afraid to encounter the public and risk encountering someone who violates social distancing. They are going to kill themselves and take us compilers down with them. 

Just watch the rates go up in Jacksonville with the beach openings. Maybe then it will sink in. 

No human life is worth sacrificing for “the economy” (aka the stock market gains of the wealthy)."
2020-04-18 17:01:38,"What’s going to happen when the vast majority of people stay home instead of joining the protests?  

Simply by staying home, with the exception of rare trips to the grocery story and the occasional short drive to make sure the car batteries (I have a Prius) do not run down on my highly tech-laden vehicle, I suppose I am protesting for a continuation of my life and the lives of our retirement community members and employees.

It’s an interesting thing to consider staying home safe as a protest in favor of SANE government.  (In opposition to the insane, armed minority, risking disease as they gather together in their death-cult, along with their crazed and criminal dear leader.

So what’s gonna happen, when I don’t run over to Cabelas (or I could literally walk there) to buy myself a gun or a rifle (or both!) and set out to find a group to protest (and possibly die) with?

If you’re for SANITY, please stay home.  Along with me and The Many.  Safe and calm in our separate dwellings."
2020-04-18 17:05:33,"It always seems the loudest, angriest voices are the least informed. The problem is they are the ones that attract the most media attention. I don’t need to see the relatively small number of  conspiracy driven, gun-toting, flag waving, political pawns of the far right fill my TV screen. I know they are in direct opposition to the over worked healthcare workers who are putting their lives at risk for humanity’s sake. Those loud Trump supporters who are not wearing masks, and not physically distancing are also putting their lives at risk but humanity has nothing to do with it. It has more to do with the cynicism of their political motivators."
2020-04-18 16:52:17,"To those that don't believe in science, cooperation, or government, I challenge you to put your health where your mouth is.

I propose a contest between those who believe in science and those that don't.

If you believe in science, wear your mask, self-isolate, social distance, and demand tests so that we can track what this virus is actually doing.

If you don't believe in science, but believe in 'herd immunity,' don't wear a mask, don't self-isolate, don't social distance from others not wearing masks, go to mega-church, and go protest in close proximity to each other.

The two sides will be obvious by those who wear or don't wear their masks. It can be a national 'masks versus skins' game. 'Skins' make sure you don't cheat by trying to close the distance with 'Masks' or by social distancing from each other.

Then we can find out if the scientists were right or the anti-scientists were right.

My guess is that those that believe in cooperation, science, and government will do better, but those that believe in 'survival in the fittest' (but not evolution) now have the opportunity to prove competition, belief, and 'rugged individualists' are correct. 

Don't worry, I promise the Masks will vote for Trump if you die, wink wink, nudge nudge."
2020-04-18 16:52:33,"Three days ago, April 15th, the death toll in the USA was 31,000. Today, WHO  reports confirmed deaths are 40,200. Nine thousand more deaths in three days. Let that sink in. I agree with another writer here. Let those who protest the stay at home orders sign a legally binding agreement that provides them with no ventilators, no medications and no hospital beds. The can kick, whine and fuss but let them have the life they want right up to their gasping deaths."
2020-04-18 16:56:05,Will President Trump and his family be campaigning in “liberated” parts of the country? Maybe a few big campaign rallies in some arenas? I can’t see any reason why he wouldn’t. He ain’t afraid of no bug.
2020-04-18 16:58:12,"These protests are the substitutes for Trumps’ campaign rallies. I understand the frustration about getting back to a functioning country, but , Surprise !, there is a lack of constructive, imaginative leadership coming from the top. Marching around with flags and guns isn’t going to do anything in the long run,pitchforks, maybe..."
2020-04-18 17:00:02,"Trump's Task Force is calling the shots on the nations response to this pandemic.  They advised social distancing measures, to reduce outbreaks, to keep our healthcare system from being overwhelmed and to protect the elderly and weaker citizens from certain death.  How can the POTUS then turn around and undermine his own administration's advisory and call people to storm their state houses to demand ""liberation""?  President Trump does not understand the power of his words and actions, he doesn't accept the responsibility that comes with the office he holds.  Mr. Trump is placing his own urges and desires above the needs of this nation."
2020-04-18 16:51:20,"I am interested in history, which often deals with power. This power relates to both politics and money/wealth. 

We live in unusual times.

With the current standstill in large parts of the economy because of Corvid, the wealth of many people is under serious threat (maybe even the wealth of that male in the White House). 
Now politicians get the funding they need to win elections mostly from wealthy people, which it is safe to assume obtain a return for that funding. But this source of money may dry up because of Corvid. Hence we see an existential fear emerging, in both some wealthy people and some politicians (others presently must make huge profits).

So now all pretense of working for the common good is set aside by some, and the populace is cynically encouraged to forgo social distancing and to risk getting this fatal and cruel Corvid. Just because some may lose their power and wealth. 

If such a large part of the populace is so ignorant to be easily persuaded to act against its own so obvious existential interest there is little future for democracy."
2020-04-18 16:55:26,It would be helpful in providing context if the NYT would address the status in terms of criteria for the 3 phases of lifting lockdown  of states easing restrictions. This seems like very relevant information for evaluating states’ actions.
2020-04-18 16:55:49,"We all want to open up the economy , we are all suffering but these protests urged on by Trump are selfish in the extreme and very dangerous. We all have the right to protest but in these circumstances we should do it virtually.
Frankly seeing the leadership of our Governor Newsom compared with Trump I am proud to be Californian ashamed of those Americans including Trump who seek to harm rather than heal
Will this a Country ever be truly United and as such as Lincoln said can it Stand.
California is effectively disenfranchised by the Electoral college which delivers a President with a minority of votes , a Senate which is non representative of the Nation as a whole, Congress elected in some states by extreme Gerry mandering 
Let’s get through this and when we do California with likeminded Western States should try to effect constitutional change so every American vote counts equally in all Branches of Government , alternatively let us go our own way so we can have a true Democracy"
2020-04-18 17:14:43,"It is appropriate in a democracy to have reasonable disagreement and informed discussion of the social distancing measures. Personally, I think some of the restrictions on outdoor recreation may do more harm than good. But that the folks taking part in these rallies are being instigated by the DeVos family and Infowars tells you all you need to know about how informed and serious they are. The truly incredible part of it is that they are, in fact, the core constituency of our President."
2020-04-18 16:51:32,"Trump has abandoned the American people he was sworn in to protect and serve. At this point, he has nothing to offer America. He needs to resign."
2020-04-18 16:54:32,"Instead of useless crazy talk, here is a list of  what Americans need to know in order to reopen economy and get back to business: Does the federal government and states have enough testing in place so we can quickly contain any future spreads (status report please). If not, when will that testing be adequate (dates please) Can they employ contact tracing and if so how will that be executed (status report with details please). Are American  leaders pushing forward with both medical cures (medicine for sick) and future vaccines (status report please). What precautious do we Americans need to take when we reopen (detailed list please). Please include an actual time table with above information (a real schedule not a vague one). That is what we need to be hearing from our government."
2020-04-18 17:05:00,"This is the ""real"" resistance, not the cute, trendy resistance that democrats like to think they formed in '16.  Real resistance is fighting more government control over our lives and how we can make a living.  Democratic ""resistance"" was from Trump getting elected, and dems apparently wanting more government control over everything (laws they like, of course, not ones they don't), and higher taxes on others (not themselves).  

I have to say, outside of NY, the dire warnings of the virus have not come to play, if was presented as 2.1m deaths, now we have about 30,000.  Maybe Mr. Schiff can start a new impeachment process over all the lies around this one!"
2020-04-18 17:05:03,"The president and far-right media are inciting rebellion against vital & necessary public health measures that are saving lives. Mass death for the bottom line. However, why aren't the Democrats offering anything more than calling them crazy? Why aren't we offering people $2,000 per month checks and a rent/bill freeze? People are genuinely suffering and Pelosi seems to think Congress doesn't even need to keep meeting virtually for more relief. Shutdowns are essential but far from sufficient."
2020-04-18 16:56:08,"I fear we are witnessing the end of the American experiment, unfolding in real time. The president of the United States is openly and overtly fomenting sedition.

If we do not elect a Democratic President, Senate, and House on November 3, I am going to find another country to live in. I do not say this lightly. This is not like Alec Baldwin threatening to move to Canada in 2000 if George W. Bush won. I am serious. 

I love this country. My direct ancestor, Thomas Stone of Maryland, signed the Declaration of Independence. He must be rolling over in his grave, right about now.

I do not recognize this country any more. We are sick (and not just from COVID-19). And we are lost as a nation. It is 40%+ of Americans who are the problem, not Mr. Trump. 

We have one last chance to turn this ship of state around on  November 3."
2020-04-18 16:57:38,"Trump is trying to incite rioting amongst his base regarding the approach to solve the current pandemic.

His misleading “press conferences” and tweets lack any aspects that a true leader should be providing in these difficult times.

To what end I can’t fathom. 

Trump’s actions should be condemned by responsible Republican Governors and Congressmen. 

One should not be surprised by his current speeches or actions as he campaigned in the same manner. 

His rallies had the tenor and flavor of a Bund rally."
2020-04-18 17:16:01,"Echos of the 2010 national debt protests. Turns out those people didn't care about the debt, leaving the only explanation for their protests to be they were willing to kill the global economy to spite Obama. Now they want us all to believe that their protests are about the economy. No, thanks; it's again about partisanship. Only this time they're willing to kill themselves and each other to help Republicans. 

Gotta hand it to the conservative messaging machine: so effective, they've convinced people to risk their own lives in service of the ultra rich."
2020-04-18 17:01:58,"Donald Trump's refusal to confront the nation wide health and economic crisis caused by COVID 19 is grossly negligent.  His encouragement to demonstrators to ""liberate"" their states and protect their 2nd amendment rights is tantamount to inciting an insurrection and is treason.  

The demonstrations are irresponsible and those attending are putting themselves, their families, and communities in danger of contracting COVID 19.

Is the motivation driving these refusals to comply with stay at home orders ideological or economic?  Without question it is both.  People are frightened by the virus and by the economic catastrophe they face.  The result is defiance.  The first line of response by local, state, and Federal governments must be to assure everyone who is being asked to stay home that they will have enough food, not loose their homes, and be taken care of until this crisis has passed.  This is not socialism, it is simply people caring for each other through a crisis of a magnitude not seen for 100 years.

All 50 states cooperating through the Federal government is the most effective and efficient way to defeat this virus and assure our economic well being in the process. This assures that areas with a surplus assist those areas with shortfalls.  Isn't that why we call ourselves the United States.  Let us act like it."
2020-04-18 17:11:57,"Trump's ""liberate"" tweets, especially but not exclusively the one aimed at Virginia, are dangerous, period.  Not only do they encourage disregard of public health directives put in place to protect Americans' health, but they may incite actual violence by the overzealous as well.    
Barr may not do it, but someone at DOJ should remind Trump of the federal statute providing stiff prison terms for incitement to violence, including that portion of the statute stating that it is no defense to prosecution that the person who actually commits the violent act is incompetent or irresponsible."
2020-04-18 17:12:40,"What the protesters seemingly don't understand, or don't care about, is that they are increasing risk for other people.

Never mind.  They don't care."
2020-04-18 16:54:48,"At Thursday's daily news conference, Trump was visibly nervous. He's not a gifted public speaker anyway, but this time he was even worse. Clearly, he didn't mean a word that he was saying. Somebody convinced him that he had to do the right thing, ""Mr. President, you really ought to be thinking about getting state people involved in re-energizing the economy. That way, if something goes wrong, the blame will get spread around, and you can pretty much stay clean."" OK, so he said it, but it was clear he was uncomfortable with any of it.

To no one's surprise, Fox News and Limbaugh weren't pleased with Thursday's performance. Of course on Friday, it was back to the old ""I'm in charge."" DJT. Stirring up the pot, calling people names. Ah, yes, another fine example of consistent presidential leadership."
2020-04-18 16:55:20,"I sense  a certain arrogance to the ""keep the country closed"" attitude. I feel like those people must have all their ducks in a row and are able to continue to lead their lives somewhat normally despite the quarantine.

I feel for the people who have been dramatically affected by the closures and whose lives will never fully recover from the virus.  I have heard of people losing their jobs, decimating any meager savings they had and ending up homeless. That kind of poverty is tough to recover from. Getting the flu might be the least of their worries at this point.

When will the rest of country's financial/economic concerns being taken into consideration?"
2020-04-18 17:00:08,"2 issues:
- Do Trump’s tweets qualify as incitement to riot particularly the Virginia one which implies taking up guns? This is punishable by 5 years in jail. Should the democrats demand investigations from state’s attorneys (as you can’t expect justice from Billy Barr).
- Experts and “Doctors” (like Oz and Phil) need to be challenged strongly when comparing the pandemic death toll to regular flu, car accidents, etc. as a reason to open up tomorrow (or too early).  No other cause of death has at all the potentIal to overwhelm the health care systems and sicken and kill its employees as does Covid-19. That is the primary reason for physical distancing and lockdown measures that reduce the pandemic spread. Reduction of deaths is a secondary benefit. It is reckless and dangerous to suggest the pandemic is no worse than something else and puts the doctors and nurses at greater risk of dealing with a second wave with depleted ranks and equipment. This point is critically important for everyone to keep in the forefront of their thoughts as we manage the opening."
2020-04-18 16:51:05,"I don’t care for Trump’s rhetoric, but if even the Governor of NY is saying we are “past the plateau,” can you blame people for wanting to return to normal?

2020-04-18 17:11:07,"Testing. Want to open up do broad nationally coordinated testing. Build a data set that can be analyzed. Break it out by region, demographic etc. Show real data on mortality by group and region. Develop a data based risk model to lay out high, medium and low risk. Use that to stage opening. Have in place more testing to check outcomes and plans in place to choke back if needed. Works in science and business.

This irritates me from the standpoint of the larger threat to my well being. Congress is inept as well as the President. The GOP accepts more deaths in exchange for a guess that the economy will return in spite a growing health threat. More deaths is their exchange for returning Trump to a second term. Coldblooded thinking."

2 weeks ago our neighborhood kids were not allowed to play together; now they are biking together and on the trampoline. It wasn’t a decision mutually made, but rather just a slow evolution. 
It’s only a matter of time before we’re all just together again regardless of what the governor says. 
You may not see this on the news, but it’s happening everywhere. I’d rather my kids get this, and get over it, and give it to me and my wife, in exchange for having them have proper childhood interactions."

2020-04-18 16:15:32,"Less social distancing leads to higher prevalence of Covid-19 infection. Higher prevalence increases the odds a “healthy” asymptotic carrier bring the virus into a nursing home leading to a small flare of deaths within a county. Presumably, local officials will have the sense to “close down” affected communities until the virus is eliminated.

I imagine there will be waves of these flares extending until such tune as a vaccine is developed and deployed.

I can’t predict the social reactions or political fallout as Covid smolders across red states. But I’m reminded of the efforts to eradicate polio. In the darkest, least educated corners of the earth, conspiracy theories abound. Aid workers are targeted for killing because they are “CIA”.

I just shake my head. These “liberate” people are putting their long-term health, their community welfare, and their economic opportunity aside because of “inconvenience”.

At this point, I’m feeling a bit right wing in the sense of “personal responsibility”.

That would include lies the Koch brothers told to prevent voters from voting for mass transit, Infowars declaring mass shootings were a stage hoax supported by the Obama administration, etc. This type of propaganda is on par with propaganda forced on people in communist countries that the conspiricay theorists in this country so criticize.

By encouraging angry mobs to force states to reopen when the Covid-19 virus is still not contained and his continued inability to provide them with the testing needed to do it, is beyond irresponsible. It will only ""LIBERATE"" the novel coronavirus to infect and kill more people. And, framing this as a second amendment issue, only makes it likely that real shots will be fired potentially killing innocent people is beyond reprehensible. Trump has truly doubled-down in putting Americans lives at risk. First, from his gun-toting base and second, by encouraging them to violate all precautions of social-distancing and mandated ""stay-at-home"" directives that add to the risk of contracting and spreading this deadly virus. At this point, the most dangerous thing to fear is not the virus as much as the truly repugnant callous behavior of Donald Trump."

2020-04-18 16:55:06,"We know that the virus is far more widespread than our current statistics indicate - because many are infected and have no symptoms; and because we do not adequately test to determine the extent of infection beyond those with overt symptoms.

Under these conditions, encouraging public gatherings to protest necessary ‘social distancing’ measures is not only an utterly irresponsible failure of leadership, it is tantamount to encouraging violence. These protests’ inevitably will spawn clusters of infection resulting in serious illness and death, further straining our overtaxed health care workers and facilities as well.

Trump tried for months to deny and downplay this onrushing pandemic, hoping it would ‘disappear like a miracle’ before it could undermine his re-election narrative. He made the bet; he lost the bet; the entire country is now paying the price — an economy in shambles, hospitals turned into war zones, tens of thousands of lives lost. 

Now he incites protests that may lead to still more unnecessary death and devastation, again for purely political purposes.

Trump is not merely incompetent. He is quite simply an evil man willing to say and do anything he can get away with to remain in power. The only ‘lesson’ Trump learned in the impeachment proceeding is that his Republican majority in the Senate will tolerate just about anything, bend just about any rule, to leverage the Trump cult to further its own agenda. 

This is a dark, dark moment in American history."
2020-04-18 17:26:14,"Perhaps those protesting with utter disregard to social distancing should forfeit any ventilator use once they contract the virus. Fortunately for them that is not our healthcare system works, nor should it. This vocal and alarming anti government movement is not unique to our current situation with the virus, but is ever more increasingly dangerous secondary to widespread disinformation campaigns from within and out of our country. The overarching concern from such protesters seems to be an unfounded fear of tyranny. If asked, can any one of these protesters unequivocally state that their constitutional rights have been ripped from them? I doubt not.  However, I am certain we will continue to see heavily armed protesters encircle our institutions for years to come"

Their view are apparently shared by the President  who as usual is on the wrong side of an issue,  in his case not just out of touch with Americans but with reality in general. 
Until there is an appropriate amount of testing  of the  general population , two or more solid weeks of a decrease in fatalities and hospitalizations , and adequate supplies of masks that can be  distributed  by the authorities to anyone who needs  them, there should be no talk of relaxing anything.
For Trump and those who think like him , do your own thing but  be aware if you violate Social Distancing  rules  or refuse to wear masks  you do so at your own risk , have no right to put others in danger and will be be  subject to arrest , fines  or whatever laws your State currently has in place."

From an outside perspective it seems US is at the moment living with two realities. The ones that are trying to fight corona from spreading and the ones that go to buy more handguns and demonstrate of their rights being denied, so someone else might live a few days longer.

What is worrying in this is that even defunding World Health Organization went with celebration on the other side. Right wing media seems to feed a totally another story and what is worrying is that now there are real lives as stakes.

US would need a central plan to fix the Healtcare system and the systematic changes in economy, that have made a large part of the population more like to believe in rumors and false stories than actual government information. 5G and Chinese laboratories are just few things tha have bene used to project to blame to someone else.

The people  should ask themselves if this is worth putting their life on the line for someone else's gain.  The nature of his so called ploy is to get the economy going....if he really gave a damn about the little guy the bailout would have covered many small businesses and not run out of money.

2020-04-18 17:39:05,"The lockdowns indirectly work in Trump's favor.  A messy re-opening probably won't faze him.  Fear and chaos may fortify the loyalty of his base.

Trump will blame Democratic governors for loss of jobs, business, public gatherings or school closings.  These hardships affect at least half the population rather seriously.    A demagogue will find their discontent easy to mobilize in swing states.    If the lockdowns and social distancing limit deaths to 60,000, much of the public won't grasp, or care, that the deaths might have been 600,000 without the controls.  That point will be only a hypothetical, a ""that's just what you think,"" a what-if, that won't restitute lost wages, sales, parties, or rounds of golf.  

If the re-opening goes badly, rest assured that the states that do the most testing will be mocked by Trump.   The states that do the least testing, on the other hand, will show low numbers and be praised.  If the disease festers, it will assure low voter turnout and be fodder for conspiracy theories and hate campaigns: hate the nurses who hoard masks, hate the scientists who fail to deliver a vaccine, hate the authorities who caution against quack cures, hate the immigrants who compete for food or jobs, hate China, hate the media for reporting facts, hate the school teachers who refuse to return to classrooms.   If fear and hate won Trump the Electoral College vote in 2016, a prosperous year, just think of how it will help him make a killing in 2020."

From Forbes Q+A on the extra stimulus money for Unemployed due to Covid.

Do these Trumper's realize what happens if they return to work? The LOSE these benefits. Sounds smart!!!! SAD.

Trump WANTS them to stop collecting all that dough, in some cases, more than they made in earnings, so he encourages them to demand to get back to work.

2020-04-18 17:28:17,"This is the Era of Belligerence. Belligerent and willful ignorance along with willful anger towards science and the very real and important role of institutions. Mostly government, but also private ones who do a great deal of work figuring out to apply science and its data to the general well-being of the public.

Trump is the champion of the Belligerent. He has made anger towards everything and everyone not completely aligned with him, into his super-power. A power directly fed by the more rabid Trumplodites. 

I don't think it will ever be figured out why and how, so many Americans have invested so much of their self-worth in Trump. Its bumfuzzling how deeply entrenched - emotionally and even physically - so many Trump supporters are and remain. It would be comical if it wasn't so scary. These same people would ridicule others who were so deeply invested to another politician, or a celebrity. 

Arm-chair analysis tells me, that for some its because they bought in so quickly, so emotionally, they cant figure a way out from under making such a poor evaluation and choice. So they keep the flag planted, their heels dug in. To stop would mean admitting their mistakes, and much like their hero, such an act is against their Brand.

Which I also see as part of the problem. Few politicians, if ever, in recent history, have managed to get their own Brand adopted by their supporters as their own. Trumplodites have adopted his Brand, esp. the, ""Only I..!"" part, as their own doctrine."
2020-04-18 17:35:08,"Here's a proposal.

Governors of those states that need to be ""liberated"" should allow anyone who wants to get back to normal to do so if they sign the following waiver:
1) If I become ill with COVID19, I will neither seek nor accept any medical assistance.
2) If I infect another person with COVID19 (and that person survivies), I will pay all medical and other expenses incurred as a result.
3) If I infect another person with COVID19 and that person dies, I will pay all medical, funeral, and burial/cremation expenses plus $10 million compensation for survivors.
4) If I die from COVID19, I will pay all funeral/burial/cremation expenses, and if I cannot afford that, I will rot at home.

Seems reasonable to me!"

I mean, how else can one explain such nonsense.  He is not asking people in states with republican governors to protest, only in these critical swing states.

If he really disapproved of the stay at home orders which are fairly uniform in most states - we would be hearing about it."

The Dems need to attack and go very political right now, because that's what the GOP is doing.  

The horror we are experiencing, including the shut downs, are all to be laid at the feet of DJT and his goons.

Dr. Trump's economic advisors want the economy rescued by putting these blue collar workers back to work making money for the rich corporations and the 1%ers who own stock and benefit from the profits made by these corporations.

We have been before, with another minority, the Tea Party. The media's tendency to magnify outrageous minority views is dangerous to our health and sanity. This type of reporting has consequences. Too many remember false Hillary slogans but not her heroic service. John McCain has been tainted for serving his country with honor. Will some now go out into the community and be exposed to COVID?

2020-04-18 17:44:01,"Trump's tweets that people should ""Liberate Michigan"" and ""Liberate Minnesota"" illustrate the lack of rational dialog between Democrats and Republicans.

There are presumably Republicans who think more deeply.  For example, the Wall Street ""masters of the universe"" are often quite intelligent.  NY Times readers need to ask themselves:  What is it that they actually think?

Not being a Wall Street trader myself, I surmise and hypothesize.  My guess is:

The intelligent people on the right of the spectrum have simply given up on democracy.

They tried to reason with the left but were blockaded by constant requirements of ""political correctness.""

They concluded that rational dialog in American politics is no longer possible.

If that is true, the NY Times editorials are actually the demolishment of straw men that nobody actually believes.

To determine what Republicans might actually think you might ask what they were saying before dialog between the two opposing in-groups became impossible.

People on the right were saying:  Illegal immigration will destroy the US over the long term.

Perhaps they were right.  After all, Trump is a lurch towards autocracy.

If dialog is no longer possible, why believe in democracy at all?

Of course, we can chalk it all up to the ""greed"" of the wealthy,

But before drawing that conclusion, do a you-tube search, and look at life in the slums of the third world.

The right is trying to say that population growth leads inevitably to poverty."

2020-04-18 17:33:38,"Once upon a time we had a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a true patriot and a genuine wartime leader, who federalized the Arkansas National Guard to integrate the Little Rock schools, when the governor, Orval Faubus had used the state's National Guard to surround the schools and prevent integration under Federal Court order.

The situation is now largely reversed. We have a President who is neither a leader nor one who has served his country. This time we need governors to call out the National Guard to enforce the law. 

For the most part, states which tend to be most supportive of the so-called ""right-to-life"" movement are, nonetheless, the same states which oppose saving lives by locking down. I expect the same is true for churches.

Churches and Trump-encouraged groups that fail to obey the law, are usually the very same churches and groups that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law. (Hmmm, maybe governors can get Homeland Security money to build walls around the churches and demonstrators.)

Why aren't the leaders of the churches and groups which hold in-person services and demonstrations in defiance of government rulings, services and demonstrations which, when they disperse, threaten the lives of innocent Americans, treated as the terrorists they are?"

2020-04-18 17:30:53,"Maskless protestor gatherings in Michigan and Texas who want to reopening the economy sooner than useful is a great way to make the argument for science and pandemic protection run by epidemiologists and scientists rather than Trump followers. 

Such gatherings are guaranteed to infect hundreds of people and remove them from media circulation as mercenary protestors.  They will carry the infection back to their nests of supporters.  Once they all get sick, then the rational people (Democrats) can begin the difficult yet necessary step of ramping up the four-fold sampling increase we will need to protect us from flareups of the pandemic.

Anyone with a head on his/her shoulders can see there will be continuous disruption to the economy for months.  We need to ""man-up"" here (as the right-wingers love to say)  and accept the fact that we will need to change our ways and become militant in our protective new behavioral patterns.    That is not a ""loss of freedom"" but a sign of rudimentary intelligence.  

In the military, leaders in battle who needlessly endanger the lives of their fellow soldiers are dealt with in ways even Trump would seem to approve us. Best estimates are that about 1.5 million Americans are currently infected -- that's 1 out of every 200 people.  With ""thousands"" at the Michigan rally -- say several thousands, there were probably about 15 people wandering around infecting everyone one.  

Give it a week, and lets see how these Michiganders are doing."
2020-04-18 17:32:57,"Whenever there is a chance to set Americans upon Americans, Trump leaps at the chance to divide the country.

Trump set state upon state by forcing them to compete for PPE and equipment and holding back on federal supplies.

Trump exacerbated the conflict among states by insinuating that some states....blue ones....were hogging PPE or selling it on the black market, while delivering more PPE to certain states....red states....then they even asked for.

Trump at Friday's TV drama announced there was plenty of testing capacity but that testing was now the responsibility of governors, a decision he made simply because there isn't lots of testing capacity, thanks to him, and he's setting up the base to blame their governors.

But worst of all is to give states the responsibility to decide when to lift restrictions, ostensibly because they know best, and not three days later call for people to violate those restrictions under demagogic calls for ""liberty"".  

Of course, Trump is hoping that he's doubly punishing blue states, both by creating a political upheaval of street protests and additional COVID cases.   But the thing about chaos is, like covid, it doesn't know borders, and there's protests in Austin too."
2020-04-18 17:30:18,"The outcomes in Sweden, Denmark and Norway offers some useful insights.  All were initially subjected to a fair number of new cases from citizens who had gone on ski vacations in southern Europe.  Sweden simply asked people to be careful (didn't shut down business or schools).  Denmark and Norway closed down things similarly but Norway did an aggressive testing program with twice as many tests as Denmark and four times as many as Sweden.  Interestingly the 3 countries have a similar number of cases per million people (Sweden a little higher).  In Norway and Denmark the number of new cases have peaked and is currently about half that seen at peak; Sweden has stabilized but not seen a fall in new cases (in spite of later introduced restrictions).  Fatality rates per million people in Norway is the lowest, in Denmark twice and in Sweden five times as high as Norway.  I guess restrictions and extensive testing wins this one - just as all those ""deep state, Trump hating"" experts have been saying all along.  The presumed benefits for small businesses in Sweden by allowing them to keep open appears to be an illusion.  It turns out that most Swedes decided to stay home for all but essential things.  It also turned out that most small businesses go under whether you reduce their costumer numbers by 75% or by 100% (closing them)."

If a state reopens too soon and the virus returns, Trump will blame the governor. If the state stays closed and unemployment spikes, Trump will blame the governor. So governors need to hold the line firmly but sympathetically. 

The main leverage Trump has is financial, because states can't run deficits and therefore can't provide a financial cushion.

2020-04-18 18:03:15,"Today, the NYT reported that experts estimate a daily average of 152 COVID-19 tests per 100,000 people is required in order to safely open the economy. Currently, the US is only able to provide one third of this minimum level of testing. The sooner Trump focuses the nation’s efforts on increasing its COVID-19 testing capacity, the sooner people can safely return to work. Trump is responsible for the nation’s slow response to this public health crisis.  And, Trump should be held accountable for his failed leadership. Remember to vote in November."
2020-04-18 17:59:44,Time for the 25th amendment -Trump has lost his mind.
2020-04-18 17:59:01,It’s beyond sad to see what trump has done to our country . He should be on trial
2020-04-18 17:59:19,The president is encouraging his so called base to get out and protest - if it's safe why doesn't HE join them.
2020-04-18 17:59:54,"Anyone that wants to get near Trump or Pence must be tested.  However,  he is egging on these demonstrators.  Makes total sense."
2020-04-18 18:00:09,"There are more than 2 million confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide.  More than 640,000 in the U.S. - fully 1/3rd of all the cases in the world.  The US is not in control of this situation, due to the procrastination and sheer  incompetence of our current federal administration.

So, flying blind, and with less than 1% of the population tested to see who has the virus, Trump - a man who has never worked a day in his life - says its time for Americans to go back to work.  Trump -  who has publicly lied over 18,000 times since becoming president -  says it is safe.   What madness."
2020-04-18 18:15:25,"I am not at all surprised that Trump is encouraging people to jump the gun. He thinks he and his followers are special and they shouldn't have to be patient and wait until the time is right to open back up. He is egging them on, instead of cautioning them to let the governors, guided by epidemiologists, give the go ahead based on the calculated risk, with clear guidelines. 

If it wouldn't endanger the frontline health care workers and the population at large, I'd say, go head, Trumpsters. Liberate yourselves. Have a big rally. Get right up in each other's angry faces and spew respiratory droplets with some MAGA yelling. Your guy blew the virus off for almost three months, which blew the situation up, but you're immune, right? His incompetence only hurts liberals and Democrats, right?"

2020-04-18 17:59:54,"I moved to the Detroit burbs one month ago.  I just returned from a shopping trip to what I would consider a very upscale market with a prosperous-looking clientele.  These people certainly didn't look like Donald Trump's base.  The buzz I was picking up from overheard conversations was anger and frustration at an authoritarian and oppressive government.  So to those who think it's just a bunch of extreme right wing wackos who are starting to rebel at all the controls and restrictions, the anger could be more widespread than you think."
2020-04-18 18:00:15,"It's all about Trump and always is--his reelection, his insatiable and constant need for attention, and bottomless incompetency.
His disregard for wearing a mask, siding with the protesters, mainly his base, and ongoing flip-flopping on handling this crisis is surreal. I feel like we are in a bad dream that plays over and over again."
2020-04-18 18:04:50,"So, once upon a time (well, just two months ago really) there were only a handful of coronavirus cases in the United States.  Well, within that short time, that number grew to over 700,000 cases and more than 33,000 deaths.  With full restrictions in place, the best estimates for deaths are about 80,000 Americans.  Worst case estimates are still close to a quarter million.  The virus is still out there, and it's spreading.  It's spreading in those states with restrictions; it's spreading faster in those states with loose restrictions; and its spreading like wildfire in those states with no restrictions.  Thus, the movement to precipitously open the economy (which is being pushed by Republican politicians, party donors, and their paramilitary wing) is not only misguided, but is devastatingly dumb, and indisputably infamous.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but these people are traitors to the United States."
2020-04-18 18:13:45,"""Incitement to riot is when a person encourages others to commit a breach of the peace without necessarily acting themselves. This may involve statements, signs, or conduct intended to lead others to riot. Conspiracy to riot involves planning acts that, if undertaken, would result in a breach of the peace.""  Both are Federal offenses.
What is ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" etc. if not incitement to riot?  Thankfully, we don't yet have riots, but where does this rhetoric lead?"
2020-04-18 18:15:10,"We're being liquidated.  This is is when the wealthy carve up the country so they can cash out; gather up and sell-off large chunks for themselves.  They're international, they see it's time to move on. More value, to them, in our pieces than in our continued operation.  We're an obsolete corporation."
2020-04-18 18:17:31,"Of course Republicans would put women in harms way by calling for premature removal of lockdown. They certainly don’t care when women die from back alley abortion or violence committed by abusive husbands. Apparently they also don’t value the lives of anyone over sixty or with asthma or our over-worked under-protected healthcare workers if it means a drop in stock values. Over 33,000 dead due to criminal negligence on the part of this Administration. Pro-life? Don’t make me laugh!"
2020-04-18 18:03:37,"Of course there will be protests, given an unstable narcissist as president, thousands of aggrieved cult followers who have nothing to contribute to a solution, and deep pockets of right wing extremists like the DeVos family and Infowar conspiracy theorists. But these whiners do not represent the vast majority of Americans who prefer that science and testing/tracking drive reopening the economy, and the frontline heroes who risk their lives to save us all, including the self-absorbed and selfish. Hopefully people can see the “Liberate” tweets and protests as a dangerous political game intended for Trump to claim credit for reopening the economy, even though this will gradually happen anyway without his involvement, since he literally has no heroism or skills to offer."
2020-04-18 18:11:43,"If Donald Trump called himself a Communist or an Islamist, there is no doubt that he would  be charged with ""incitement to violence,""or ""fomenting domestic rebellion.""  But since Senate Republicans believe him to be above the law, he will not even be censured.  Still, justice would be served if his followers came to the White House - with MAGA caps but not wearing masks or gloves -  to celebrate the dangerous folly of their leader.  Let them embrace him and his family - literally - and each other, while they sing, ""I believe, I do.  I believe, I do.  I believe everything that Trump tells me to.""  I call on the President and his family to welcome them - literally - with open arms."
2020-04-18 17:58:44,The next time the White House has a press briefing and President Trump is standing next to the medical experts Mr. Trump should be asked why are you inciting rebellion to rush the reopening of our country when the medical experts are advising a cautious and practical path forward.
2020-04-18 18:02:26,"I would have to agree with Incitatus at Churchill Downs that the “LIBERATE” tweets by Trump are incitements to riot.  If Trump were a man on the streets, an exhortation like that would be a criminal act in most places, and the man could end up in jail.  But what good is it to point that out when no one in power is willing to assert the 25th Amendment to remove him from office, and so many of his loyalists appear to be ignorant of the dangers of the virus?  Where does this country end up if the majority of people voting in states with the majority of electoral votes are blind to reality?"
2020-04-18 18:03:14,Those organizing the lockdown protests are taking advantage of the fact that any counter-protesters are smart enough to stay home.
2020-04-18 18:06:04,"Dr. Fauci should resign immediately.  I know his first and foremost concern is science, and he doesn't want to appear political.  But it is hypocritical to stand by while the ""president"" encourages behavior that directly conflicts with public health experts.  

Not only should the good doctor resign, he should publicly state the reason -- that he can't work at cross-purposes with such a man."
2020-04-18 18:10:15,"I hesitate to suggest that Our President couldn't do any worse by the country, since he's proven quite creative on that dimension. But his failure to take necessary steps to prevent, contain or respond to the coronavirus pandemic, together with his blatant incitement of civil disobedience and likely criminal acts in several states where governors are doing what the federal government has failed to do, is without parallel in my memory. We really must rid ourselves of this plague, and I'm not talking about COVID-19."

All there is is ego and blame for others."
2020-04-18 18:08:16,"Trump doesn't support testing, simply because the numbers of carriers and deaths would increase. If the numbers can't be counted, they can't be reported. The same reason applies to why elder care facilities are being ignored by the federal government.
It's the just the same old GOP song and dance: Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil; or, when the truth hurts, just ignore it or lie about it."
2020-04-18 18:10:56,"People who don't believe in science and facts are likely to get exposed, expose others and continue the spread of second and third waves of the virus. So much winning!"
2020-04-18 18:04:39,"Might COVID -19 itself well-express Trump's person and presidency as an infecting agent? Trump as a 'human' COVID-19 virus? Viruses are probably not alive. Is Trump ""alive"" - in what sense? In word and action, he penetrates and destroys the nation's immune system from within infecting different regions in particular ways. His propaganda confuses, divides and destroys the body politic. His Rage - his temperature - a sign of the moral dis-ease within himself? Did many Americans through their votes invite him in because of their own frustrations and despair. Serious economic, psychological and spiritual health issues left unaddressed and festering?
Trump, like the virus, will exploit every defect.

Is this analogy useful?"
2020-04-18 18:05:37,"The criminality and incompetence of the government keeps revealing itself. They kept assuring us that the tests, the very best tests, incredible tests, unlike any tests that ever came before, would be ready in  few days, a few days that never came. So now a little lip service but not much else. Who needs tests anyway. We'll get most of the information when people get sick and die.

I had a new thought that has scared me even more than I had been before. The idea that this band of criminals  could in any way be involved in the discovery of a new vaccine and what will be done with it almost guarantees something monstrous will  go wrong. Anything they touch turns to death."
2020-04-18 18:09:12,Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse.  A true hallmark of the current occupant.
2020-04-18 18:13:00,"As if the rest of us don't want to get back to work?  When the dust settles or when November comes around whichever comes first, Trump wants to make it seem that the economy didn't recover because we Democrats wouldn't let it.  Let's not play into his insanity.  When he and his sycophants say we want to go back to work, we say we want to get back to work even more but we don't want to die before we can.  Trump wants to act as if he's on worker's side, he wants them to think he'll do a lot of things like build a wall.  Where's the Wall? He's great at only doing one thing: fanning the fires   We need to get out there with our signs that say:  Where's the tests you promised so we can all can get back to work now?"

1. We are wearing bandannas, scarves, and other substandard homemade face masks (including medical professionals).

2. We have the technology and money to provide COVID-19 tests to every American, multiple times if necessary. But we are only testing at 1/3 the rate we need to be.

3. We are leading the world in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

4. We are not making any progress toward addressing the above, and other solvable problems -- in order to save lives and move our country forward, so people can return to some semblance of their normal lives.

What is wrong with us?"
2020-04-18 18:19:38,"I'm enormously confused! What's the real problem of the polemic? Is it politics? Economics?  Deadly virus of COVIT-19? While I read the article I mindlessly scratch my head to find the answer! Lastly I come back to quid pro quo! Oh! Omni-present politics! As an apolitical person I distaste one the most  albeit I can't go it without! Well! My take: money lost money can be gained; invaluable life lost never be gained! Who knows the life fell in today by our omission or commission does  not have the genius of Eisenstein, Shakespeare, Pablo Picasso, Abraham Lincoln and the like! And if you ask me of American Economy I can vouch for its unique potential, guts and grits to sizzle upward  be it in winter or summer! American economy is incredibly blessed with enormous money and material resources, spendthrift population, astute management to catapult its speed and hit-the-target, no sooner than has it been set to go! As many as 607 billionaires, 336 Nobel Laureates unless and until they fall from the crest to a clique of a nexus of greedy and self-serving!  So, I  earnestly entreat to the  politicians at the helm of power to save and protect life first then deal with the question of economic repair and revamping. In the weight-age average towards successful economic management human skill shall certain to score 100 out of 100. Indeed! The management comes not from an artificial intelligence nor  mills and factories! Here human life counts at the apex.

2020-04-18 17:57:58,"People in states where there are few cases of infection or deaths cannot understand why they have to isolate themselves and stop making a living.  Some countries in Europe are now having some kind of gradual reopening of the economy. It is a delicate balance with no good solution, as the freedom of movement in the US is extremely fluid, and will have a negative impact on other states who are reeling from the epidemic. But having an out of his mind president who uses a health crisis to rile up his supporters and push for ""liberate"" or civil unrest, is beyond the pale. This man is dangerous, and I don't understand why reasonable people who have been outraged at his daily transgressions have not been able to mobilize against him just like these far right groups who are waving the confederate flag among other things  to protest their perception of the assault on civil liberties during a pandemic."

I still remember reading and discussing this story in 5th grade. Blew my mind then and is again blowing my mind as the story is playing out in real life. To Mrs. Houseworth, thank you for giving our class this nugget of wisdom to prepare us for this moment in time - never felt more connected to this story until the protests started this week."

2020-04-18 18:08:41,"The perfect solution would be for Trump to go back into high gear. Have him go around the country. Schedule three rallies a day for the next month. Call it the ""Great American Economic Revival Tour."" Make sure he has access to the largest possible venues. Encourage everyone who wants to reopen America for business to attend. Make sure that each rally is part of a daylong festival of events. Make sure that the MAGA crowd is as packed as tightly together at each venue for as much time as possible.

Meanwhile, the rest of us will just sit back, stay safe, and let the Coronavirus do the rest."
2020-04-18 18:12:52,"The President is not calling the shots in this case. He is giving his opinion which even as President he is entitled to do. The decision regrading when, where and how to remove restrictions and open each State is up to each State. Trump heard that loud and clear last week when he said it was up to him. Constitutional lawyers were falling all over themselves telling the President that the States had control over the Health and Welfare of their residents and could do what they think best. It is amazing how quickly the States cleared that up. The States are responsible for the Health and Welfare of their residents but went ahead and immediately blame Trump, an easy target, for their own failures and in many cases serious delays in coming to correct conclusion. New York City alone has about 6,000 employees working in their Health Department and an annual budget of $1.6 billion.  The NYC Health Department is responsible for planning and preparing for a pandemic. they did not do that and blamed Trump and the Federal government for their own failure. States and counties within the States likely have multiple Health Departs which are responsible for the Health and Welfare of their residents and also to plan and prepare for a pandemic. One size does not fit all. Each State has their own issues which are best dealt with by each States Governor and various Mayors."
2020-04-18 17:52:42,"Fix the headline, please. “Opposition to closings rises as Trump signals approval.” Wrong. The opposition is a grass roots movement that began their protests in some States before, not “as” Trump tweeted his approval. Speaking up for oppressed, little people used to be something the left did. But no more. The arrogant, inexperienced young Governor in Michigan overreached, then trashed the citizens in her State without taking the trouble to actually address their specific grievances. It is government at its worse. But the left, for the same reason they immediately dismiss the recent sexual assault claim against Biden, only listens to those who have their back—no matter the truth."

NOT SUSTAINABLE. Trump knows this. 

The GOP knew it when they tried to get that taken OUT of  or lowered, in the stimulus package.

So, he banks on thier gullibility...urging them to return to thier low paying jobs and forgo the extra Federal  unemployment.

Don't they know if they are told to return to thier old jobs, they will no longer collect that unemployment, which is a gold mine for low income people out of work right now?


Sheeeesh...it's SO obvious. I fell bad for those workers in those states who DO want to follow recommended guidelines...they will lose too.

And, if they return and get sick, then what? 

And the employers know this too. They don't want to get sued.

THINK people...Trump is counting on his gullible base forcing a return to work ...they think it's cause he ""wuvs"" them...no.....it's because he sees recession writing on the wall.

If Trumpers turned off FOX and watched the financial channels or read a newspaper they could figure this out.


The GOP- not the Dems -tried to eliminate this windfall in the last package,.....remember? Look it up. They could see what's coming vis a vis the deficit.

Stay home till it's safe. Collect your extra 600/week. Do not return til there's adequate testing."

2. Trump is stuck now : he cannot accept responsibility now for his mistakes  because it will indicate weakness 
3. The economy is a downward spiral : which means in 6 months a turnaround will be impossible .
4. The stats that were initially projected :: about a million or 2 who will die :: may not happen in the next 6 months :: the key is keep the numbers down till the election : right after : it’s ok and who knows may be in 18 months u will have a vaccine .

2020-04-18 18:24:45,Would the media stop sensationalizing these demonstrations which are attended by very few individuals when the majority of US citizens across the political spectrum are sensibly staying home and  cooperating in the effort to slow the virus.  Dramatizing the fringe elements gives them an outsized amount of attention in the national media and inaccurately reflects that this is indeed a small movement of disaffected and irresponsible individuals.  Calling it a national movement is irresponsible and heightening in the press or visual media does us a great disservice.  It is reminiscent of the small protests in Iran (with paid protestors) shouting Death to Satan - they were filmed at a perspective which created the illusion of mass protests when in effect in most instances they were quite small. When filming was over the protestors collected their cash and went on their way.

There fore those people in Michigan are still welcome, thsi is their right, even they jeopardize the public health.

But when these protest , procured, provoked and encouraged by President and his minions, not the protesting people  but those who are in the government is crossing the red line. That is treason.

Public health is not easily arguable like your 9/11 response. Gulf war, Monica  scandal. those have socio-political events. 

Pandemic is pure scientific event. A virus is inflicting severe harm to people. there is not that much to discuss. 

We still do not know many things about this virus, reason in any emerging diseases  knowledge gathered in at least couple of years. This is different however how much we want  we cannot accelerate some developments. 

Trump is very eager to create a civil war condition in this country. he is not supporting those people because he loves democracy, he wants lifelong presidency ( a.k.a King ) , he loves  Putin, Xi, Kim, Erdogan, Netanyahu, Orban like characters which glued their power.

So the next best thing for Trump is to start some chaos and distract everybody. I am happy to see that New Jersey law enforcement is handing out citations to their ""protesters.""

 I was particularly struck by how incensed and outraged the unmasked demonstrators were in Michigan.  Numerous photos of the demonstrations show swastikas, confederate flags, Trump banners and the open display of firearms.  
The current officeholder in the White House tweeted his approval and encouragement for these demonstrations, no doubt due to his feeling that they were beneficial to his political future, throwing in gratuitous references to the 2nd Amendment.

As Americans, we did this in World War II. Young men, well into their 20s, volunteered for the Armed Services. Women entered the workforce, including factories: Rosie the Riveter. (Those were the societal norms of the time.) Auto companies started producing airplanes and other military equipment, instead of new cars. We even minted pennies out of steel, to preserve copper for the war effort. It was a collective national sacrifice.

Fast forward to today. Selfish Americans want to ""LIBERATE"" us from a short-term sacrifice for the common good. And our president is actively fomenting sedition, encouraging his supporters to break state laws, and endanger the public health.

From his general disregard for the truth and rule of law that has been almost universally enabled by Republicans; his blatant extortion of an ally for political purposes ignored by his Republican enablers; his outrageous declaration of absolute authority; his threats to adjourn Congress; and now his encouraging armed insurrection, point in only one direction: Trump will not hesitate to take any and all measures to stay in power regardless of the outcome of any election.

Stimulus passes- people give him credit for their checks.
Doesn’t pass- he blames dems for obstructionism (burying the reasons).

He really is very, very good at this. Cynical & diabolical, but effective. Sure this isn’t a time to let politics interfere with effective responses (as usual, Dems have to be the grown ups in this fight).

Instead of leading, he has systematically denied, deflected, delayed, ridiculed, hawked snake oil solutions, blamed, attacked and focused disproportionately on Wall St. and business instead of health, public safety, testing and serious problem-solving.

Trump is a complete failure of epic proportions.

He deserves to be thrown out of office for many reasons, but his coronavirus failures put all of disqualifications for public office on awful public display.

Completely inhumane.

These leaders are making decisions on the advice of serious and sober scientists and medical professionals.  The latter on the front lines and accounting for a significant percentage of those who become infected.

By inciting the protests, Trump too is committing reckless endangerment, magnified thousands of times from the presidential bully pulpit that he routinely exploits for his own corrupt ends.

There is NOT ONE MENTION here that Reeves was the governor who took the lead nationally in his complicity with Trump's ""fake news"" campaign, and incredibly, to order local Mississippi city governments to reverse their own closing orders.

And yet, elsewhere in the Times' coverage of the pandemic, this Fox-promoted denialism is tagged as a direct cause of COVID-19 spread and death.

""A widely followed model for projecting Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. is producing results that have been bouncing up and down like an unpredictable fever, and now epidemiologists are criticizing it as flawed and misleading for both the public and policy makers. In particular, they warn against relying on it as the basis for government decision-making, including on “re-opening America.”

“It’s not a model that most of us in the infectious disease epidemiology field think is well suited” to projecting Covid-19 deaths, epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health told reporters this week, referring to projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

“That the IHME model keeps changing is evidence of its lack of reliability as a predictive tool,” said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, who has served on a search committee for IHME. “That it is being used for policy decisions and its results interpreted wrongly is a travesty unfolding before our eyes.”

First, I want to say thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing that every state is different. Here in Montana, we’ve been able to keep our relatively cases low, because we know what is best for our state and because we care about our neighbors.

Over this past month, Montanans have demonstrated their individual independence and strong sense of community once again. Montanans have protected their family and friends by communicating virtually. They have stayed home while finding ways to support local restaurants and other businesses providing take out or delivery services. Many business owners and entrepreneurs have shifted their efforts to producing 3D masks or producing hand sanitizer to help fight this virus.

These efforts have not been for nothing. Together, we are not only saving lives, but also making it so that we will be able to reopen our state and get our economy thriving again, long before many other states will be able to.

I was aghast. Why didn’t they try emergency peritoneal dialysis?  I’ve never seen it done, but I know that it’s possible, and the materials required are quite basic.  A few days later I ran it past a nephrologist colleague of mine and he confirmed that emergency PD is easily performed and absolutely can keep a patient alive through an episode of acute renal failure. Before the invention of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis, the type of dialysis most suitable for patients in the ICU, peritoneal dialysis was the only means of renal support available in that setting.

In Michigan the protests were organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition and the Michigan Freedom Fund: ultra-conservative groups supported in part by the ridiculously wealthy DeVos family. (Betsy DeVos is a Trump cabinet member.)

The protests have NOTHING to do with health and safety, and everything to do with the groups' attempts to discredit Governor Whitmer, a Democrat. The protesters were encouraged to gridlock Lansing, the state capital, for political reasons, not because the orders by the governor were in any way extreme. We live under the same kind of orders here in New Mexico, though ours were effected earlier and may even be more stringent. 

In NM, Covid-19 cases lag behind the nation; Michigan has the third highest death rate in the country. All these ""protests"" do is necessitate lengthier shutdowns as protesters expose themselves to the virus by flouting the rules. Worse, these protesters will demand top-notch medical care when they become ill and will expect ""government"" to provide it.

Yet while organisers claim the protests are grassroots- and people-driven, a closer look reveals a movement driven by traditional rightwing groups, including one funded by the family of Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos.

The two groups behind the “operation gridlock” rally in Michigan on Wednesday have ties to the Republican party and the Trump administration.
The Michigan Freedom Fund, which said it was a co-host of the rally, has received more than $500,000 from the DeVos family, regular donors to rightwing groups.
The other host, the Michigan Conservative Coalition, was founded by Matt Maddock, now a Republican member of the state house of representatives. The MCC also operates under the name Michigan Trump Republicans, and in January held an event featuring several members of the Trump campaign.

The preliminary results being reported from studies in Santa Clara, California and Chelsea, Massachusetts (these studies have not yet been subject to peer review) is that the infection rate is much higher than has been commonly assumed. 

This means two things: one good and other bad. First, the mortality rate is probably lower than generally suspected. Second, the number of potential asymptomatic spreaders is likely to be vastly larger than has been generally assumed.

We still have little understanding about immunity following exposure. We also lack a proper understanding of the length of the presymptomatic incubation period and the time during which asymptomatic individuals (in particular those who appear to function as superspreaders) pose a risk to others.

There have been horrific casualties in nursing homes across the country among both residents and caregivers. Hospital personnel are facing almost unimiginable conditions as they try their best to relieve the suffering of victims.

""South Korea, which had one of the largest initial outbreaks outside China, also managed to slow the spread of new coronavirus cases without instituting any lockdowns. Devi Sridhar argued on March 23 that the country’s exemplary model for mass diagnostic testing was the only way to contain the outbreak—and that other countries should look to East Asia for lessons. South Korea, which has a population of 51 million, tests more than 20,000 people daily at designated testing sites and uses isolation and widespread contact tracing to break chains of transmission—as recommended by WHO. “South Korea is showing how this model ultimately pays off in reducing spread, taking pressure off health services, and keeping its death rate one of the lowest in the world,” Sridhar wrote.""

The intelligent classification for the range of human mental activity is defined by a reflexive response to new knowledge of trying to determine further consequences beyond the immediately obvious ones. 

Trump just does not even try to consider consequences beyond satisfying his immediate desires. He shares this trait with the portion of the right who hang on his words uncritically as well as all those people who listen to Limbaugh, Hannity et al right wing pundit/entertainers constantly. They just don’t use reason and soundly confirmed facts in any sort of consistency, preferring to hear to what resonates with their existing preferences.

Allies, friends that go back long time in the history of our country, have been insulted or at least have been the object of derogative characterizations, in many cases via a denigrating tweet. Autocrats, despots, life-long enemies of the democratic way of life have been elevated to the altar of “my good friends” by a President that seems to ignore the ill-meaning intentions of those individuals and the regimes that support them. Generals and admirals, career American intelligence professionals, scientists, medical experts have been regaled with the derogatory comment “I know more than… (Any and all of them)” and have been ridiculed in front of urbi et orbi.

2020-04-18 23:57:49,"Some people are asking ""If the election is canceled, what happens?""

Under the Constitution, the President's term of office ends on January 20, 2021. 

The present Congress ends on January 3, 2021. 

Only the 60 odd senators who are NOT up for re-election have terms of office that extend beyond January 3, 2021. Mitch McConnell is up for re-election, so if there is no election, he is GONE. The 60+ senators whose terms of office extend to 2023 and 2025 are majority Democrats. 

So here is what wold have to happen if there was no election in November: 

The Senate would elect a new President Pro Tempore on January 3, 2021, when it met for the first time. That person would be a Democrat. 

On January 20, 2021, when Trump's term is done, the order of succession is: 
VP - which would be VACANT because Pence is also done. 
Speaker of the House - which would be VACANT if no House members are elected in 2020. 
President Pro Tempore - That person would be the new POTUS. And a Democrat at that. How about Elizabeth Warren as POTUS? Gotta love it. 

Go ahead Donnie. TRY to cancel the elections in November. Just TRY. 

Besides, the STATES run the elections, so Trump has no say, unless he nationalizes the National Guard of every state and declares martial law on November 3, 2020, and forbids people to go out on the streets. 

But in that case, if there are no elections (by force), go back to the top of this post. 

Trump loses either way.

Then he hands the bill to the lady. Its so Trumpy.
Trump the other day was boasting about there being strong tremendous powerful testing... and a lot of it and in the same breath he said the governors will be doing the same testing he was taking credit for.

""We’re going to be helping with testing. They're going to be doing the testing,"" Trump said, referring to state and local governments. ""It's got to be a localized thing, and it really has been since I've been involved. Because I came in and the federal government supposed to do testing of parking lots in the middle of a certain state that's 2,000 miles away. It's ridiculous.""

He again punted responsibility back to the states in a tweet on Friday: ""The States have to step up their TESTING!""

It was always extremely frustrating trying to get technicians and students to appreciate the danger of contamination of PCR reactions with the products of previous reactions.  They'd do an assay for the first time, get a negative result for the negative control sample and that would bolster their confidence so they'd start getting sloppy.  (Of course it's always negative the first time, before PCR products start accumulating in the lab!) Then they'd start preparing reactions in the same room and with the same pipettes and equipment that they used to analyze the products of previous reactions.  Not infrequently, they'd even stop running the negative control because ""it always comes out negative""!  When I'd start ranting that they have to use a separate room, separate equipment etc, etc, it was like ""OK, if that makes you happy.""

To another point regarding the CDC, I saw one of their infomercials on the corona virus, which clearly gave the impression that the risk from the virus is really only to folks over 65 or to those with underlying conditions.

Fortunately, they’re also hoping no one will want (or trust) the Feds to manage any element of healthcare, public health, etc. 

So, on all accounts, as soon as Trump’s safely re-elected, he’ll put the very special Seema in charge of farming it all out to private industry.

""A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent."" 

Please compare Trump to this list. His bathing and grooming consume as much time, thought, and effort as any movie or TV star’s, no doubt, he doesn’t drink or use drugs, and in no other way would anyone describe him as clean. Or as any of the other things on the list, not genuinely, not habitually. His normal state of mind is enraged and malicious.  The two main rules that guide him are “get even” and “get a prenup.” (Look it up.) His main focus through the day, day after day, is to attack, harm, or destroy anyone who opposes him. 

He is absurdly, melodramatically unqualified for any position of public trust, bearing responsibility for the well-being of others. 

How this mountebank, in Hamilton’s terms, manages to make anyone think he’s OK is an important question, important to the future of our Constitution, if we have one. History’s full of populist tyrants; Trump is an ancient type, uneducable, uninterested, truly uncivilized. But this demagogue needs to be confronted, effectively, yesterday. I would suggest the question is half rhetorical, half psychotherapeutic (if only for the communications skills), and half snapping turtle."
2020-04-19 03:20:27,"The CDC testing fiasco  is more complicated.

Testing  was delayed because the US wanted to develop its own test.  Germany deployed a reliable test on January 17, 2020.  Institutional hubris got in the way.  Then institutional sloppiness.

“The nation had developed its own diagnostic tests for the Ebola and Zika viruses and opted to use the same playbook again, William Schaffner, a CDC adviser and infectious-disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Business Insider. 

""The notion of accepting a test developed by someone else I think was a bit alien,"" Schaffner said. ""There may have been other considerations of which I'm not aware, but I'm sure that pride was one of them: 'We know how to do this, thank you very much. We'll develop our own.'""”"

We are supposed to believe that they had their labs come up with a test and then never checked its reliability until well after they had sent it out for manufacture. Certainly something is fishy at CDC, an organization that has had the best reputation worldwide until now. Were they like this under Frieden?

To top it off, the Trump administration decreased morale and redlined important departments to this response, and put people in charge of agencies that are incompetent. Taken this, and squandering two months, means it will take longer to reopen the economy.

However, I think the more salient issue in rebooting our close in-person interaction with one another is strategic. As long as the number and availability of testing is limited, it needs to occur where it can have the most and greatest impact on our collective physical and economic well-being. And that needs to be coupled with continued social distancing and other new norms for hygiene and social interaction. This will require tough but intelligent decisions and actions, not to mention discipline and some continued sacrifice. But starting to execute—and soon—we must if we’re going to safely and quickly revive the economy and get millions back to work again."

“This can be the beginning of the pathway back to normal life”.

Mr. Mayor, I would only say that getting ""back to normal"" is not what many of 'we the American people' would probably not be satisfied with, since just 'returning to normal' would mean returning to a vastly unresponsive; political, economic, social, racial, and class structure of extreme inequality --- as Bernie Sander's himself wrote in his NY ""Times"" Opinion Column today, ""The Foundations of American Society Are Failing Us"".

Bernie seemed kind, understanding and supportive of a positive program for Democratic Party success in November.

However, his comments that, 

 ""If there is any silver lining in the horrible pandemic and economic collapse we’re experiencing, it is that many in our country are now beginning to rethink the basic assumptions underlying the American value system.

Should we really continue along the path of greed and unfettered capitalism, in which three people own more wealth than the bottom half of the nation, and tens of millions live in economic desperation — struggling to put food on the table, pay for housing and education and put a few dollars aside for retirement? Or should we go forward in a very new direction?""

IMHO Bernie was kind, my view of getting ""back to normal"" would define that 'normal' as being a Disguised Global Crony Capitalist Empire."

The reason states are now mandating all residents wear face coverings is to protect others, and what is really needed is to explain this, without encouraging any false sense that these cloth masks will provide much protection to the wearer in most circumstances.  Rather than a mask-shopping guide, what would be more valuable would be to exhort people to other-mindedness in wearing a mask."

These masks could work better to protect the wearer and filter air if there wasn't topstitching, binding, darts, pleats, and other design features that make the mask look good but function poorly by creating gaps and holes. Any side gaps or penetration of all layers of the mask with a stitch creates a conduit for viruses and should be limited.

The reason for this of course was two fold we manufacture nothing in this country and hoarders or profiteers had already bought up the masks, I’m not sure why their isn’t a government “ sting” to punish these essentially war profiteers, it really wouldn’t be hard."
2020-04-17 14:02:11,"I didn’t like this article. 
You should tell us that masks for regular people are not for preventing getting virus.
They are for preventing giving virus to others when sneezing and coughing.
Since we are told to stay home when we are sick and we are doing 6 feet distance, masks are just precaution. Almost just in case you have to sneeze in public all of a sudden. 

Of course, the purpose of masks for medical people is totally different.
They all should wear N95. You should emphasize that. Regular people don’t need to wear N95. 
When we are following other rules (6 feet and stay home when sick and cough into sleeve) our masks don’t even need extra coffee filter or anything. A bandana will do the job. 
Your article would make nervous type of people more nervous and make them want the maximum protection (=N95)."

Simple enough to follow, if we didn't have contrarians that, out of willful ignorance in times of a pandemia, still demand unrestricted 'freedom' in spite of the perils. In the current situation, it stops being 'freedom', a dangerous 'license' instead  (I know, some have raised already Ben Franklin's famous phrase: ""those willing to sacrifice freedom for a dubious security...deserve neither""; but under the current circumstances, it ought not apply; not only for the one complaining but for the rest of us, hoping to survive this viral crisis if we all do, in solidarity, what health care specialists deem prudent!)."
2020-04-17 14:05:09,"These masks cannot prevent the wearers from being infected; they just lower the probability.  The N95 and P95 masks are designed to stop 95% of particles less than 0.3 microns.  They will eassily trap bacteria.  However, coronaviruses are approximately 0.1 microns in diameter, and most viruses are smaller than that.  

What the masks do catch is droplets from your breath, sneezes, and coughs; they protect other people from whatever is in you.

2020-04-17 14:12:39,"I would like to see an article on how to wash masks to keep them safe enough to use and prolong their use.  Dishwasher, washing machine, hand wash?  What temp?  Air dry or dryer?  There's lots of confusing info out there - is there a reliable source of advice?"
2020-04-17 14:14:48,"This article misses one type of mask I see in common use in public that should not be used: masks that have exhale valves.  These are masks designed not for medical use, but for hazardous environments with dust and sometimes chemical vapors. They have one or two plastic pieces that protrude maybe 1/4 inch from the front that look like big buttons. These are a valve that opens when the user exhales, allowing their breath to exit completely unfiltered. Many construction workers use them for working in dusty job sites. These masks are being aggressively marketed on-line, I see ads for them on Facebook. 

The CDC says that the main benefit for wearing masks is that they protect other people from the person wearing it. The exit valve masks do not protect other people at all, unless the wearer is able to disable the exit valves by taping them closed. I used to wear these for hazardous material work, and have one that I am using now because I disabled the exit valve. But I have seen many of these in use, like the other day waiting in line at Home Depot. I have seen no articles addressing this problem. I wish someone would talk about it."

The KN95, like the N95, blocks 95% of all particulates. They are certified for use in Europe and Asia, but are not FDA/NIOSH approved for use by medical staff in the USA. Because of this - they are about 1/3 or 1/4 the price of N95's and will likely be much more readily available. Since medical staff can't use them (mostly because the adminstrators don't want to be sued), they are perfectly fine for civilian use. Providing great protection and comfortable fit."
2020-04-17 14:33:56,"Good information but we also need to know the best way to re-use the non-homemade masks.

2020-04-17 13:17:01,"This is a much better article about masks than the previous one that showed home-made masks with big gaping holes around the nose.  I have only one quibble with this article:  shouldn't the N95 masks be reserved for health care workers, since they have been in short supply for these people?  Maybe if you're caring for a sick person at home, you need one too.  But probably the average person does not need an N95 mask, and if you have them, you should donate them to the hospital."

2020-04-17 14:10:01,"Mask testing even when controlling for facial fit has found masks surprisingly effective against this aerosol virus which measures 0.1 microns.

Cotton bandannas and scarves only filter out 28% of the viral particles, so better than nothing.

A simple surgical mask filters out 80%.

The N95 masks filter out more than 95%.

These filtration percentages are based on particle sizes 10 times smaller than the virus.

But note that 95% may not be good enough since it's been estimated that one only needs about 300 viral particles deep in your lungs to become infected."
2020-04-17 14:57:02,"There also exists, but likely impossible to find, ""N100"" and ""P100"" respirator masks which is a step even further up than the N95, blocking more than 99% of particles....
These normally also include a foam seal all the way around the edge of the mask.
I believe these all do however exclusively use an exhaust valve (as exhaled breath can hardly escape through the filter material), so indeed they are not protecting anyone beyond the user."

I'm a retired physician, I have a half-dozen or so masks left over from my practice, none were sealed, so they're not safe for donating to a hospital setting.  

If you're lucky enough to have a N95 mask, it's not a once-and-done thing, spray them down with a 50% solution of water and alcohol, please avoid the rubber straps.  If the straps break, simply staple on new elastic. I'm sure that the 6 masks I have will last my husband and I for 2 years, where at which time, I hope we will all have them for ultimate protection, as we'll need them until a vaccine is created."
2020-04-17 13:37:34,Struggling with stupid but very real issues in trying to wear a face mask while completing necessary chores like grocery shopping for myself and neighbors: Glasses fog up; How do you open plastic bags for fruits and veg while wearing gloves; How do you take your glasses on and off so you can read the neighbor’s grocery list without dislodging the mask; How do you keep the ear straps in place when you’ve got both glasses frames and hearing aids behind your ears? Maybe medical professionals have workarounds they could share.

2020-04-17 15:08:25,"Some of us have N95 masks in storage or were able to snag a few in January and February before they were sold out. 

Included in the article should have been the effectiveness of certain disinfecting methods. I've read that putting a N95 or medical mask in the oven for 30 minutes at around 160F or steaming the mask over boiling water for 10 minutes are effective cleaning methods. 

The vast majority of people do not have 300+ masks in storage to wear for a single use. We will need to reuse our N95 or other type of masks in what appears to be a 2-year pandemic before a vaccine is developed."
2020-04-17 14:05:15,"There are great people coordinating mask and face shield  production on Twitter and elsewhere. But this should have been a government Plan B. If supplies fail in a crisis (as they inevitably would given the managerial domination of 'just in time' and bias against stockpiling), then localised production has to make up the shortfall. How hard would it be to set up a national website with downloadable face mask designs, rated and tested by experts for porosity etc? How beneficial would this be to Developing World countries who aren't going to get their hands on N95's for some time yet?
If anyone's interested, we've a design on our website that is mainly made of recycled drinks carton (moisture proof coating), but has a separate frame so you can replace the filter, material easily and regularly.

     A Stanford study shows one decontamination method applicable to home use on N95 masks preserved filtration efficiency (but not for how many cycles): hot water vapor from boiling water for 10 min retained efficiency nearly equal to the original. (And disinfected >99%, testing on the bacteria E. coli.) Although UV light for 30 min preserved almost to the level of the original efficiency, how that translates to putting a mask in the sun is not indicated. It makes sense that a certain amt of rest time in the sun would disinfect and that the virus would degrade through time. A hot oven (they say NOT a home oven) at 158 F / 30 min preserved filtration nearly perfectly, and disinfected at the same high level. 
     One thing is clear, the study showed that 75% alcohol or chlorine bleach SHOULD NOT BE USED to disinfect N95 masks. Alcohol degraded the filtration ability of the mask. Masks disinfected with chlorine emitted fumes from retained gas. 
     The study also has many caveats about wearing, cross-contamination and etc.

Similarly they prevent stray particles from entering your eyes, nose and throat, unless you are in a fully enclosed area where re-breathing other' respiratory excreta is inevitable.  In that case it does not matter if you are wearing a mask or a face shield - however, because of the physical obstruction of the mask on your breathing - you are typically inhaling and exhaling with greater force."
2020-04-17 15:23:42,"I have resorted to a choice not discussed here:

the KN 95 mask

This is a simpler and far cheaper version of the N95.  Until last week it was not authorized by the FDA for hospital use, but it is now FDA approved in the absence of N 95s

KN 95s are very cheap (75 cents to $1), made in China, of course, and widely available (Walmart, CVS et al).

I don't know how good they are, but I have a box and my wife and I use them in preference to bandanas.

What are other reader's views of the KN 95?"
2020-04-17 15:29:28,"This article correctly discusses the fourth option, a washable mask using a replaceable filter insert, but fails to mention that there is an industry standard filter for this type of mask called the PM 2.5 filter.

Next to the N95 and the surgical mask which should be reserved for health workers and first responders, this type of mask would appear to make the most sense because it is washable as well as using a replaceable filter.

While not designed to protect one from viruses, it offers some protection while also protecting others.

But for the greatest economy in the world to be lacking N95 and surgical masks for health workers this late into the pandemic is a colossal failure of the government and its leaders. 

Especially the president who disbanded the pandemic planning team that Obama left in place."
2020-04-17 15:32:11,"When the value of masks is discussed, please distinguish between which are intended to protect the wearer (e.g., N95s only? which therefore should be reserved for medical personnel who cannot physically distance themselves and have prolonged contact with infected people) and which are intended to protect others from the wearer, especially wearers who may have the virus but be asymptomatic. I think there is a great deal of misunderstanding that masks are protecting the wearer, when it's really physical distancing and hand washing that are the primary methods of protection."
2020-04-17 15:50:37,"It's another indication of the lack of leadership from our public health institutions, from the CDC down to local county levels. that all sorts of advise on face masks are in the lay press, the internet and commentators here. I wouldn't be so disappointed in public health if it weren't that I grew up when public health was widely respected for their protection of community health and a source of information. 

Thanks to the commentator here who provided the CDC face mask link. This link is a more definitive statement than their previous, vague statements in March. 

Still, it is incomplete. How about a statement regarding protection from others. The lack of PPE is blamed for so many cases and deaths among medical personnel; does this imply N95 masks protect the wearer from cases? If so, why shouldn't everyone have such protection (other than they are in short supply). Is the only protection against infection from others physical distance? What is the advantage of standard hospital face masks over home made ones and if they are more protective, among the types of fabric, filters discussed best approximates hospital masks.

If you go to brick & mortar stores, you can expect not to find any. The most most common masks being worn in other countries appear to be the ""medical"" mask. They are getting them from somewhere. I ordered 50 ""medical"" masks through Amazon at about 50 cents each. The lead time was about 3 weeks and they arrived in that time frame. I have also more recently another 50 cents directly from an online retailer & am waiting to see when & if they arrive. Part of the problem there isn't any profit in making masks. Much more difficult for me to find has been hand sanitizer. With all of the distilleries starting to produce it, you would think you could find it. Not yet at least."
2020-04-17 15:56:39,"I bought some masks online from a local shop (masks similar to the Homemade ones described in this article).  Unfortunately, after wearing this mask for a while, the elastic band pops off my right ear.  Yesterday, while shopping at the grocery store, I wore a bandana over this kind of mask.  By the time I was checking out, the bandana was sliding down my face, and the Homemade mask had completely popped off my ears.  I will have to experiment with bobby pins and/or safety pins and/or hair bands to keep my masks secured to my face and head.  Lesson learned:  not all masks fit properly.  If I owned a sewing machine, I would try making my own masks."
2020-04-17 16:01:17,"The article says, ""Masks should be worn the entire time you are outside."" So if I am standing on a mountain top where the air is so thin that I am already having trouble breathing, and the nearest person is 30 miles away, I should keep wearing my mask, even though doing so, with the restricted air-flow may cause me to collapse? 

I never wear my mask outdoors. I might if I knew I was going to be in a crowd, but in my little town, it is usually pretty easy to keep a reasonable distance from other people. Outdoors, with lots of fresh air, wind, and virus-killing ultra-violet rays is where masks are least needed. 

It is indoors, near sick people or among other people who you don't live with that masks are most likely to be beneficial. And of course, if you yourself are not feeling well, and must go anywhere near other people, a mask is definitely a requirement."

2020-04-17 16:21:47,"I have found that wearing a fabric mask over the pleated medical mask can help to secure the fit of the latter. The medical masks I use can last through several machine washings. Since I wear the masks only briefly — for weekly trips to the grocery store (by car), or to the hardware store — I have reused them after spraying them with an alcohol sanitizer and letting them sit for several days.  

Here in California, everyone who has a stash of N95 masks says that they purchased them “during the fires.” It’s baloney, but that is  the universal excuse for having these hoarded masks that should be in the hands of medical personnel. It makes me angry. Most people aren’t wearing them properly anyway, so they might as well be wearing the ubiquitous, pleated medical masks or a fabric version. 

I have seen men walking around in the elaborate masks that you wear when you use toxic chemicals (chemical respirators). There is a lot of panic and irrational behavior out there."

2020-04-17 16:27:58,"What are rare outside the medical profession, but more common for construction and home project use, are the N95's with the elastic straps that go around the top and lower head, not merely around the ears. Those provide a better ""seal"", but can start to hurt (minor of course) after an hour or two of wearing. And forget your hair...totally messed up. 

Meant for single use, they can also be reused depending on the pollutants the wearer is exposed to. Medical contamination is not easily cleaned. Apparently there are some acceptable protocols for this, look them up. 

For regular use, walking outside, non-intimate contact, cleaning the house, etc, they can be ""blown-out"" - by directing a hard flow of air from the inside out. Do it outside and away from you, wearing another mask! (Think canned compressed air, reversed vacuum flow, construction compressor, etc) And then sprayed with some alcohol. BUT - allow it to dry before re-wearing. 

Whats not listed is what I guess is still called ""spandex""? Which you find used in all these warmer weather cooling neck and head gaiters, they can be used as hair bands, sweat bands, or to cover the neck and lower face. Its basically a tube of highly stretchy material what I will always call ""spandex.""

How well do they work? Obviously they would require another layer to make them better, but whats their overall effectiveness?"
2020-04-17 16:28:16,"The  tiny droplets that carry Covid19 can spread 6 feet indoors but it is not clear to me how far they can spread outdoors especially if no one is standing nearby.. in closed environments masks need to be worn and that is where they  make the biggest difference. For example, wear masks when going into any grocery , drug or hardware store. Also , when walking outside where you are likely to encounter others it is probably a good idea. But, I have seen folks wearing n-95's and other similar masks when exercising and that to me is dangerous since you are really re-breathing the carbon Dioxide that your lungs just released and not taking is the the necessary amount of fresh air and that could be hard on ones heart and lungs especially if you have an underlying health  condition. And even though I am a health care professional , I do not agree with the requirement that everyone wear masks outdoors or face fines. If you are putting others at risk yes wear them but each person has to make a personal choice - it is a personal risk - benefit analysis. What about personal freedoms which our country is suppose to be famous for? I take daily walks on almost isolated trails a half mile from my home and yes I carry my double layer cotton mask with a double layer of coffee filtering inside but i only put it on if I see others coming in my direction."
2020-04-17 16:29:39,"9X18 piece of cotton makes 2 layers that fit most faces with three pleats. Add another layer of 9X8 in between, and leave a small space open for a filter. I use tea bags (I have empty ones meant for loose tea leaves), but go with anything you have (as suggested). Pipe cleaners and twist ties sewn at the top of the cotton masks can help pinch the homemade masks to your nose better. I suggest adding the elastic or ties AFTER you make the entire thing for the tightest fit. And if you can, put a dart on either side of your chin for an extra level of snug fit. 
I took a few patterns and came up with this, so I have no tutorial. But the best ones I've found were on Youtube where the videos were at least 6 minutes long. When they whiz by, it becomes unhelpful.

Not everyone has bandanas and hair ties lying around. If you wear glasses masks are problematic and make you touch your face more as you constantly have to adjust the mask with your glasses. Glasses steam up, fall off, etc. And then there's so much conflicting evidence - masks help. masks don't help. I doubt homemade masks work. To me, this is a scramble because the WH and his disable Fed Govt weren't prepared, continue not to prepare and are not providing all US citizens with proper and helpful masks. All that said - I want to do the right thing. I want to protect myself and others. I wish we could get a clear, consistent message about the efficacy of masks and which ones really work."

The N95 masks without a valve can be hard to wear especially in humid and hot environments. The N95 masks with a valve are more comfortable and are “cooler” in humid and hot environments."
2020-04-17 16:52:12,"One of the ideas that I didn't see here is the use of HVAC filtering material as a shaped insert for a home made mask.
It is important to buy high end filters and be careful in disassembling them to cut the fabric into a pattern.
Using a Merv 20 25x25 filter we created 60 3X3 filter inserts. At a cost of $30 for the filter, we were able to produce a very high quality filtered face mask for a cost of $.50 each.
Merv 20 should filter out about 99.9% of the virus."
2020-04-17 17:02:17,"My attempts to construct some sort of homemade mask were all disasters.  I am not particularly artsy-craftsy and I don't have much in the way of materials/equipment for this sort of thing.  This is something that people who are more adept at this sort of thing often can't understand.  You know, the ones who think that if they can do it there's no reason why everyone else can't as well.

Don't tell me to wrap a scarf around my face because I don't own one.  I've tried wrapping t-shirts, tea towels, etc, but I couldn't manage anything that was worth the trouble.  There's not much point to a face mask that won't stay in place or simply doesn't do the intended job.

Finally someone gave me a medical mask which I am wearing whenever I go out and trying very hard to keep in good, reasonably clean condition.  The problem is I have a difficult time wearing it.  I have both chronic sinus issues and seasonal allergies.  When I have the mask on for even a few minutes I start to feel like I can't breathe and it causes an anxiety reaction exacerbated by the fact that my glasses keep fogging up.  It's a challenge, but I'm wearing it. Perhaps there are other styles of mask that would be easier for me to wear and if I ever find one on sale anywhere maybe I'll give them a try.  
I just wanted to point out that masks, for a variety of reasons, are not as simple for some people as for others."
2020-04-17 17:06:10,"Wow, what a lousy story! 
Every single one of these masks has ear loops. But we know from browsing online and from seeing people on the street that there are at least three other types of masks: 
a) the type with ties that go all the way around the head, 
b) the type that attach with velcro at different points on the head (either at the neck or high up on the back of the head) and (c) the type that are essentially ski masks.

2020-04-17 17:15:35,"Regardless of type of mask, ethical and safety considerations about donating N95's, etc., maybe it would be good to avoid being judgmental about those we encounter wearing any kind of face covering. At least wearing a mask or other covering means that wearer is trying to protect him/herself. And that translates to protecting others, invariably, because of the route of contagion. So in the final analysis seeing somebody wearing any face covering is a positive thing."
2020-04-17 17:17:30,"Masks should be worn the entire time you are outside...

Well, there's the first debatable point.

I went for a glorious walk with my dog, this fresh morning in the local park. There were a handful of  people around but all were sufficiently socially distanced...and then some. Common sense is required. There is no need to wear a mask whatsoever in this case."
2020-04-17 17:20:40,"Two thoughts on N95 masks. 

First: there are a million or so of us out here who already had one or two N95s in our home or garage.  We kept our used masks because... well, they seemed fine. I forget why I originally bought a package, but this last one still has the stains from use during the NorCal fires two years ago. My point: hospitals don't want my slightly stained N95.

Second: I don't have any extra masks, but folks that do might be more willing to donate them if they could get replacement masks ""on demand.""  In other words,  if Bob donated an unopened package of N95s today to his local collection place, he would have the right to call in next week and say that he wanted to ""cash-in"" three of his ten credits. The idea is to eliminate the risk to Bob of giving away something he's tempted to hoard, and get every mask being hoarded into the system today."
2020-04-17 15:18:49,Please - homemade masks do little more than make the wearer feel better about him/her self.

If you actually read thru the entire article, there are links at the bottom, including their own more detailed coverage. Read up people. None of this is new. Lose the attitude of the government this, the government that. We are way past criticizing how this has been handled. One of the most important factors of this pandemic, STAY HOME! How many different ways do people need to tell you that. We go out 1 time per week for groceries. That's it. We don't need high grade masks. Social distancing should still be a huge factor as well."

2020-04-17 17:39:18,"Not a very useful article. For example, if you do have an N95 mask with an exhalation valve; tape it up with duct or electrical tape. If you are fortunate enough to have a couple of N95 masks, as I do for my construction work, you are not going to use them just once. Though they can not be washed, they have been shown to work reasonably well over multiple uses if properly taken care of. Don't store them in a plastic bag; paper or cloth is better so they can dry out. Taking them on and off carefully is important and, after handling them, wash one's hands. They can be decontaminated after use with by spraying them with the hydrogen peroxide you would gargle with. Full sunlight will hasten the death of COVID-19 viruses. Heating them to the the correct temperature has been shown to work. Plan ones time out to minimize the need to take the mask on and off. Be focused and pay attention when out in public."
2020-04-17 16:44:15,"This week I finally ventured out to run errands at the local feed store and to get some groceries. Mask wearing- and for that matter all forms of social distancing- hasn't really caught on in the rural upper Midwest. But it's worth noting that of the people I did see wearing masks, most were being worn in ways that render them useless. 

For any type of mask to have the desired effect, it has to cover both your mouth and nose! You can't mush it up below your nose and think it's going to do any good. The majority of masked persons I observed did not have the mask over their noses. Likewise, when you slide it down across your chin, it's not helping anyone.

Yes, I know it's uncomfortable and can be hard to breathe with a mask on. (I'm an RN). But to be effective, masks have to be worn properly. That they are not is one of the reasons the CDC was hesitant to recommend their use in the first place. Also, don't think that a mask is a substitute for keeping your distance- it's not. 

So, everybody, learn to wear your masks properly, and keep your distance, and we will all make it through  this crazy, challenging time."
2020-04-17 16:47:38,"I am a senior, I begrudgingly admit, and my 44-YO daughter and her husband have bought all of this ""shelter in place"" nonsense, hook, line, and sinker.  This includes not seeing her own mother on her recent birthday.  Nor were we allowed to celebrate our granddaughter's birthday yesterday.  And yet, both of us are healthy, active, and informed.  I've NEVER had a flu shot as an adult and I am rarely sick; perhaps 1-2 days a year.  My daughter was raised to question things and ""trust, but verify"", but she has become one of the ""sheeple"".  The funny thing is, it's the LEFT emulating these Totalitarian policies, not the RIGHT.  And now they've done it once, and seen how easily the great un-washed comply, they can do it again.  Be afraid, America, be VERY afraid."
2020-04-17 17:32:26,"Federal mask guidance has been a fiasco from day one. Telling people not to wear N95s is like telling them to drive without seatbelts. Many have N95s around from home improvement and yard projects, friends in construction, etc.

The epic failure of the federal government and health care employers to provide adequate PPE to our front-line healthcare workers is an ongoing disgrace."
2020-04-17 16:21:35,"I found this article to be pretty unhelpful. In terms of preventing me from catching the disease, no mask except N95 will help much and they are unavailable. Even if I could get them I am supposed to only use them once and dispose of them.  Not putting it on exactly right or touching it reduces its effectiveness. 

This sounds like TSA security. It makes us feel better but really does not stop determined bad guys."
2020-04-17 17:24:10,"Earlier this week I finally ventured out to the local feed store and to stock up on some fresh groceries. It seems that mask wearing- as well as most forms of social distancing- has not really caught on in the rural upper Midwest. But of the people who were wearing masks, the majority were wearing them in ways that rendered them useless.

For any type of mask to be at all effective, it must cover BOTH your nose and mouth! You can't mush it down below your nose and think it's going to work. Likewise it's not helpful to strap them across your chin and leave both your nose and mouth uncovered. 

Yes, I know that masks are uncomfortable and can make it feel hard to breathe- I'm an RN and have spent a goodly amount of time in an N95. But masks don't work unless they are worn properly. That people would not be able to use them correctly was one of the reasons the CDC was initially hesitant to recommend mask usage at all. And they are definitely not a substitute for keeping your physical distance from others.

So whatever type of mask you choose, remember to cover both your nose and mouth, and keep your social distance, and we will all get through this crazy time!"
2020-04-17 16:24:17,"As you note both the N95 and medical masks are designed for single use; we keep hearing horror stories about medical professionals having to use both multiple times (and our pathetic excuse for president countering that scientific advice and weighing in urging the front line pros to disinfect and reuse: yes, we have come to this). 
But for ordinary e.g. supermarket non medical use if you happen to have a couple of these masks (which I do, in my tool box, and seriously, I have no idea where long ago I got them), can you leave them in the car or outside the house for a couple of days and then safely reuse?"
2020-04-17 18:24:54,"Just think. If everyone wore a mask, then the virus will not be liberated into the air and destined to break up into smaller aerosol particles that could hover around more easily. THIS is the reason why EVERYONE should wear a face covering, and do it properly. Then we all don't have to worry about the possibility of breathing it in as readily because much of it will be contained. Is it really so hard to work as a collective here? If one person is asymptomatic and goes around without a face covering, then the issue of not having an N95 becomes more of a concern. Even with a face covering we will have to continue to social distance for a while, it's a given. My county requires masks for grocery stores, etc---customers and employees alike. It should have started weeks ago however. It's really not rocket science---I have noticed that more men than women took longer to wear something, like they are afraid of being branded as being crafty or non-manly. Ugh."
2020-04-17 18:36:59,"The N95 Dust Mask you show is a universal fit. There is no legitimate ""fit test"" done for it except to visually check that it is touching the skin all the way around. 
""Fit Tests"" are done with reusable masks that have replaceable filters. These are usually made of rubber or similar textured product. The employees who would wear them do get tested to see that they seal when worn and must be the right size and all areas of contact with the skin must be clean shaven.
 Some places (construction employers usually) do a lung function test before allowing an employee to wear the mask to be sure they have enough lung function they won't be injured by wearing one. They make a wearable CPAP mask for workers who fail the lung function test for a regular mask. It has the motor and filter on a belt with shoulder strap and hose up to the mask. I expect they also make for hospital employees too."

2020-04-17 17:08:54,"I spent $15 each on some homemade masks, crafted by some well-meaning but pretty clueless makers in my community. It was a waste of money. Even with customizing them to try to fit my face, there are still enormous gaps in the masks, rendering them useless. I find that a bandana with 2 rubber bands is better protection, but have serious doubts that it protects against even large droplets, even at 12 layers. The weave is simply too big. It's also very hot to wear.

I don't care what anyone says, I'm immunocompromised and am forced to do my own shopping so I'm going to get any N95 or even KN95 masks anywhere I can, for myself. I will not be shamed. I will be one less person in the ER if I can secure more masks. 

America is supposed to be the greatest country in the world, but Donald Trump and Republicans in power are doing everything they can to deny us the protective masks, (by selling millions of ours to foreign countries), and to get sick, contagious people back out on the streets working with no masks, (cuz, y'know, masks restrict their freeeee-dumb), which then threatens the rest of us. I'm disgusted with all of them. They quite literally, make me sick."

This article is terrible.   

It cites no studies to support any assertions.   Where is the evidence?   All the credible evidence I can find shows cloth mask do nothing.  Surgical masks do next to nothing and according to a recent study out of South Korea, suggests they may do a absolutley nothing.  

N95 is the only mask that has been scientifically proven to effectivly prevent spread.  

Please stop suggesting otherwise without credible science to back you up."
2020-04-17 17:55:46,"Folks, could we please please clarify what we are trying to do by wearing a mask. We are trying to filter out some of the viral particles coming out of OUR nose and mouth to try and prevent infecting other people. It is my understanding that a cloth mask, even surgical mask, does very little to filter out incoming viral particles.  Unless you have a very good seal around your face, even an N95 is not perfect.  Surgeons wear masks to prevent THEIR breath from contaminating sterile conditions, not to protect themselves from contamination.  Healthcare workers in close contact with infected patients wear N95 masks because these provide at least some protection from incoming virus.  Assume you are carrying this virus, wear a mask when you must be less than six feet apart to try and keep others from getting virus from you.  You will get a small protective effect but mostly this is about protecting other people."
2020-04-17 18:38:08,"We haven't seen anything in the media about the relaxation of NY State laws that prohibit the wearing of masks in public except for the purpose of a masquerade party.

As it stands now in New York State, wearing a mask in public is both required and illegal at the same time. If the state can not quickly and nimbly revise its laws and regulations so as not to be in conflict with one another we may have another big problem and that is the legitimacy of government authority.

Perhaps we can see an article about the relative merits, values and philosophies of the crips vs the bloods, since we may be donning either red or blue bandanas, and may have to make that personal choice. What gang wears yellow? I have no idea but I'd like to know before I choose.

All this bickering back and forth between New York's own Cuomos, DeBlasios and Trumps just makes them all look weak and only semi-legitimate because nobody seems to know who is in charge of what. Legitimacy and authority are victims in the eyes of citizens.

Elastic bands and straps can be found from old clothes and shoe laces, and metal wire for the nose piece can be taken from a standard Starbucks 340g coffee bag (or other brand).

2020-04-17 22:06:41,It is unfortunate that no articles on  the subject of masks ever notes that some people have N95 masks because they where paying attention to what was happening and purchased them before ANYONE was talking about a shortage.  People like myself have a couple dozen masks.  I only wear one once a week when I go to the grocery store .  I am shopping for my wife and me as well as my 88 year old parents.  I deliver the groceries with a mask on.  I have a reason to be careful.  It is unfortunate that articles such as this make well prepared people out to be guilty for having a few N95 masks.  My masks where ordered on Jan. 20.  I sterilize them with special germicidal UVC lamps so they can be reused (same as some hospitals are doing).   And to just push the point a bit further - I also have a few dozen P100 mask which I purchased back in 2009 during the H1N1 flu epidemic.  N100 and P100 mask filters are like HEPA filters which are nearly 100% effective with particles down to 0.3 microns.  I don't feel guilty for having these either.

There are no functionally defensive masks available to the public anywhere and many fakes and ripoffs. If you did manage to find one you would be encouraged/quilted to not purchase it so that it could go to first responders. The goal of having everyone cover their face is to reduce transmission from those who may have the virus and be asymptomatic. Those who have the virus and have significant symptoms have probably seen a DR and should be self isolating. Those who do not have the virus will get little to negative protection from a homemade mask. They do not block aerosols, they encourage you to constantly fuss with them touching your face after touching potentially contaminated surfaces. They get hot and damp perfect growth environment for bacterial. People do not wear them correctly or keep them clean let alone sanitary."

2020-04-17 20:44:06,"Viruses were discovered after bacteria were filtered out with a special Porcelain filter.  Virus means Poison. They are remarkably small. The masks and gowns normally given 1st responders are designed for Bacteria blockage--not Virus blockage! That is why unfortunately there have been many responders who have been infected and die from their infections. They likely wore their equipment properly--unfortunately this PPE equipment was not designed for viruses!! It is like going into a gunfight using a knife; ordering more knives for a gun fight is not the solution.
 Viruses can only live ( if live is the term: they are special molecular particles that use the cell's DNA to reproduce. ) inside a cell...perhaps momentarily in a vapor particle...the sight of people misusing masks is unfortunate and ultimately useless ( not covering the nose does nothing. )
Further Viruses do not live on surfaces, unlike bacteria. Wearing gloves for most people is useless. Wearing the wrong masks is equally useless. The thought that ""THE SCIENCE"" is being followed as expressed by the politicians requires both knowing and understanding the science. Its not about what someone might think is simply common sense. 
The only true protection is having a rubberized gown and a separate air system. Which explains why in some  ICUs in Italy; the infection rate for the healthcare workers is ZERO.
Having N-95 masks at best permits a 5 % chance of getting infected. For anyone falling into the 5% it means 100%."

Each resident will receive one mask, which are being personally delivered by Misericordia volunteers and members of the Public Safety Agency (Protezione Civile) door to door — with lists of recipients provided by the Office of Vital Statistics (anagrafe) and the Electoral Office where voting cards can be obtained — in hand.  If no one is found at home, the masks will be left in the mail box."""
2020-04-18 01:06:17,"It would be more helpful to have guidance on how to sterilize and re-use whatever masks we have, since anyone I know who has an N-95 or a medical-type mask has only one or two or three -- certainly not enough to use them only once.  A doctor friend sent me a video (in Spanish) showing how medical-type masks could be sterilized with steam by stretching them over a pot of boiling water for five minutes, with the lid over it. I am also using this method for my N-95 mask. I was misting it with isopropyl alcohol, but then I read this reduced the effectiveness of  N-95 masks -- I don't know about the medical-type masks."

But they are essentially impossible to purchase except for online in which case they won't be delivered for at least a month. The people who ignored the governments' requests to not buy masks will now be free to do things that people who obeyed the request can't. I guess that no good deed goes unpunished.

From what I've read, there is an extremely low probability of getting infected by spending a few seconds near an infected person unless they cough or sneeze at you (otherwise, just about every grocery store clerk would be sick). Requiring them on buses and trains, where people will be close to each other for an extended period of time, makes much more sense than requiring them in grocery stores."

In addition, Vimeo has no phone number, unlike Go Daddy or other internet service providers - even in the midst of pandemic, Go Daddy answers their phones - and messages to customer service go unanswered. 

I would say that in all of her workday discussion she is forgetting the most important factor in a situation such as the one we are facing now - to keep Vimeo working as a reliable platform, and to maintain customer service."
2020-04-20 14:31:28,Another person trying to capitalize on the coronavirus epidemic. Sickening even to see their faces.
2020-04-20 15:44:41,Very interesting. Vimeo is a great platform for creatives in video. She is doing a great job.
2020-04-20 15:46:47,"A crisis often creates new things, and consequently, the innovative results and creations produce their own winners and losers. They may be beneficiary or self-serving.
Any attempt to bring remote people interface with each other at this time is praiseworthy. 
Experimentation in the early phases will gradually be improved upon and should become more affordable and user-friendly.
Good luck to a young entrepreneur!"
2020-04-20 16:10:45,"I loved this. I'm a GC of a start-up and have worked with lots of CEOs. Having a person who's down to earth, dealing with real life issues (children, spouse, family), while also effectively juggling a unicorn company is impressive. This is the type of role model we want for CEOs. Keep up the great work at Vimeo."
2020-04-20 20:59:39,"Company has been around a long time (for tech companies), growing quickly ... but not profitable. Maybe fewer meetings rather than more is the answer. Though that might imperil someone who says their main job is to ‘be visible.’  Must have a great publicist."
2020-04-20 20:30:17,"I think Diller made a good move putting her in charge but she should not be given credit for something that already happenned.

Vimeo was already a paid tool's based video company long before Anjali Sud came to be the head.   Vimeo had moved off competing with youtube long before her."
2020-04-16 17:28:44,"This is what happens when you put faith and ideology ahead of science. For a comparison, see the article today about Chancellor Merkel's leadership in Germany."
2020-04-16 17:16:34,Another example of an emperor who has no clothes and can’t tolerate being criticized.
2020-04-16 17:16:37,"Given Falwell's unfailing sycophancy to Trump the past few years, I'm not at all surprised by his feckless behavior towards Liberty students and staff, as well as the larger community.  ""Pro-life"" indeed."
2020-04-16 17:21:36,"This is all about money. Falwell doesn't want to refund students' fees, and would rather put their lives and the lives of anyone who works on or near the campus at risk than give back the money. His desire to sue any critics also points to pure and simple greed as his main motivator, and arresting journalists points at the disdain for truth that pervades conservative media and thought presently. Let's see Mr. Falwell personally expose himself to the virus first to show how safe it is."
2020-04-16 17:24:27,Falwell claims that other Universities stayed open yet I'd be willing to bet that they were offering students a refund in housing and other costs if they decided to stay home.  The article states that Liberty is being sued by a student to get a refund so the assumption is Liberty is not giving money back for students deciding to stay home and not risk infection.  Just another example of hypocrisy in full view.  When the lawsuits start streaming in against Falwell he will cry that he's being persecuted....nailed to his cross just like Jesus.  Unbelievable.
2020-04-16 17:25:35,Since when does a private citizen - albeit a university president - have any authority to threaten criminal arrest and prosecution. Falwell is a classic bully who threatens and bloviates when he doesn’t get his way. Mother Nature will undoubtedly have the last word.
2020-04-16 17:27:45,"I’ll be brief. I have a special, specific loathing for the Falwells and their “ Liberty University “. It’s very reasonable and specific. I have an elderly Aunt, my Mothers Sister.  She is a wonderful person, as compassionate and caring as they come. She has very little financial resources, like many, many elderly Women. She rarely “ worked “ she was too busy taking care of her Children, Disabled Husband, Neighbors, etc..  This “ Church “ and so-called University got their claws in Her, thru “ outreach “ at her own Church.  They call her Daily, begging for Donations. It’s always a new, special plead, or “ need “.  My Aunt is 70 plus years old, and survives on 600 dollars a month Social Security, gifts from Me, and occasional Jobs cleaning neighbors
 Houses.
  She is being sorely abused by these Scammers.  And:  they don’t Care. As long as they get Money, they will gleefully ruin lives and make others suffer.  It’s what they DO.  And what they don’t do: Pay any Taxes.
  They are Parasites, preying, not praying."
2020-04-16 17:28:21,"I have always been surprised that, given the complexity of the human brain, it doesn’t go haywire more often. When it does, though, the results can be devastating. The swirling delusion and paranoia of Falwell’s consciousness will most likely get people killed. Perhaps this caldron is where he also converses with the Almighty?"
2020-04-16 17:32:10,"Jerry Farwell Jr is another power mad narcissist like his idol, Donald Trump. It is all about him, not about anyone else, including his students or the Lynchburg community at-large that has been so supportive to Liberty U in the past.

The Liberty University web site says it all—in the leadership section, Farwell’s bio is lengthy and laudatory. The rest of the leadership bios are simply generic job descriptions without any background or insight into the actual person filling the role."
2020-04-16 17:35:06,"Falwell and his right wing allies are the reason America is so much worse off than almost any other country in the world.  Reactionary denial-ism and conspiracy mongering have resulted in a cratering of our economy and the deaths of hundreds of thousands.

Don't believe it?  Take a look at South Korea and recall that they reported their first case on the same day that America did.  But they took it seriously and acted responsibly.  The right wing government in Washington and its supporters like Falwell did the opposite.  And look at the difference that made."
2020-04-16 17:41:51,"I guess it's true; the Lord really does work in subtle ways. 

Like most Trump devotees, and Trump himself, Falwell wants the world to hew to the parameters of his manufactured reality, and the virus is simply not being cooperative in this regard.

It's tragic that others are being put in danger by his studied ignorance of facts and science."
2020-04-16 17:42:19,"It appears that the jury is out on whether Mr. Falwell is teaching LIBERTY, or taking liberties."
2020-04-16 18:08:51,It would be interesting to know if the universities with students on campus have made accommodations available for those who were unable to return home for student/family financial or other reasons.
2020-04-16 18:11:11,"The same guy and the same movement that insists and teaches that Evolution is a hoax and that any public school teacher who thinks or teaches otherwise should be fired.
Falwell, like the Tennessee town folks who rallied around the prosecution of John Scopes in the 1920’s, is going to Inherit the Wind.
Too bad he’s going to take so many others with him.

The good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe it."
2020-04-16 17:49:35,it would be poetic justice if this school has to close
2020-04-16 17:50:21,Unsure what to make of the political grandstanding as Liberty University long ago possessed a mediocre online program.
2020-04-16 17:56:43,"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

I don't trust any of these ""Men of God"". 
More like ""Men of Money""."
2020-04-16 17:58:29,I would be ashamed of any affiliation with Liberty University.
2020-04-16 18:00:59,Who in their right mind would pay/trust Jerry Falwell to provide a college education?
2020-04-16 18:08:14,Complete inability to tell the truth. Grossly bloated sense of entitlement. Excessive threats against critics. Perpetual whines about alleged persecution. Never any words of empathy or compassion for others. Absolute refusal to take even the minimal responsibility for his actions that one expects of  a mature adult. Did Falwell learn these behaviors from Trump or did Trump learn them from Falwell? Or maybe they both lack some vital DNA strand that stimulates development of basic human decency. This would explain why they're both OK with being professional con-men.
2020-04-16 18:16:16,"""The furor in Lynchburg centers on Mr. Falwell’s decision to open the campus to all students and staff at a time when most American universities were closing for fear of spreading the disease. For weeks before that decision, Mr. Falwell had derided other universities’ coronavirus responses as overreactions driven by a desire to harm President Trump.""

The idea that someone's response is driven by a desire to harm President Trump in my opinion is just downright crazy. These are major institutions that are losing much money by keeping their student safe by closing.  To say that they just want to harm Trump is the silliest thing I can imagine."
2020-04-16 18:20:56,Falwell is clearly off the rails. Poor judgement abounds. Lives are needlessly endangered and/or lost. The question is: What is Liberty going to do about it?
2020-04-16 17:57:41,"To bring back a phrase from the era of Mr Falwell’s father.  “The moral majority is neither.”
Coronavirus has revealed the craven nature of many of the institutions we believed acted in our best interest.  Governments and private industry will have a lot to answer for when this pandemic dies out.  Americans of all political persuasions should not accept the talking points or excuses from government and business after the pandemic dies out.  Governments have spent years gutting public health programs and promoting for profit alternatives.  Governments have for decades promoted transpacific treaties which gutted American manufacturing capabilities. 
Americans need to demand our industrial base be protected so we never again find ourselves wondering if the very packages delivered to our doorsteps from the country of origin are carrying a pathogen which could sicken or kill us."
2020-04-16 17:23:17,"Prior to this, in January 2020, upset that the Democrats pounded the Republicans and swept power in all branches of state government, crybaby Falwell held a news conference with the Governor of West Virginian, urging Virginian counties (including his) to secede from Virginia and join West Virginia.

How’s that effort going, Mr. Falwell?  Instead of trying to persuade others to join your cause, I’d suggest that you be the first and move your own university to West Virginia where you can have all the “freedom” you like to behave recklessly and put other lives in danger.  Go for it!!  Walk the walk!  (Or, could it be that you’re all talk and no action?)"
2020-04-16 17:27:50,"That’s right, go after the journalists exposing the truth. Sounds familiar."
2020-04-16 18:30:44,I do not understand why Liberty University wants the students back when we do not know how to treat patients with COVID-19? This shows a Disregard for Human Life and Safety and Wellness. Liberty University has lost its moral compass and is lost.  Liberty University has lost its Compassion to understand World Events and does not Listen.
2020-04-16 18:20:11,"There are lock-downs in Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Japan, South Korea, ....
.
Is Mr. Falwell suggesting that all those lock-downs were imposed just to discredit the White House?
.
Did all of those countries all participate in some huge international conspiracy just to make the White House look incompetent?
.
Jesus was a healer.
He didn't generally go around making people sick.
.
Perhaps Mr. Falwell might reflect on that."
2020-04-16 17:22:15,"As DL Hughley describes Jerry Jr., “the Fredo of the Falwell Family.”"
2020-04-16 17:51:51,Caring for his flock in the worst of ways. No surprise.
2020-04-16 18:00:18,"What would Jesus Do?

Not any of this !! as an alumni of Va Tech..i'm embarassed that Liberty even associated VT w/ them.

Maybe its time for a clarion call about Liberty's leadership. What christian values are they espousing?? Certainly not 'Love Thy Neighbor' or 'Turn the other cheek'.

What I have seen in these evangelical environments is that if you 'love Jesus', then you're a member of that group..but god forbid you love your neighbor as yourself (as God asks us to do).then you can't give all your money to the evangelical leadership.

I wonder if Jesus would throw out these money grabbers as he threw out the money lenders from the temple.

But..it all boils down to the golden rule..which is ..whoever has the gold..makes the rules."
2020-04-16 18:04:07,It looks like Liberty University is following in the footsteps of Trump University.
2020-04-16 18:16:01,God bless...the student who's suing Liberty University.
2020-04-16 18:22:58,Life isn't so valuable when it stands between you and your revenue source. Can I get an a man.
2020-04-16 18:25:29,"mr falwell would not test his employees for fevers with infrared thermometers. He purposely ignored even the most basic standards of safety, all in the name of profit."
2020-04-16 18:32:45,"Falwell lies and use data point that he know is false, how can parents send their kids to this place?"
2020-04-16 18:36:45,"Why would anyone send their child to a university run by such a monstrous example of pride, greed and immorality?"
2020-04-16 18:30:12,The wisdom of attending Liberty University in the first place is probably the best lesson these students and their families will have learned.
2020-04-16 18:38:57,"How about following the money?  Liberty may be unable to repay fees (although it seems to be able to pay lawyers).  Maybe it's one of the colleges that may go over the cliff soon.

Bye?"
2020-04-16 18:49:19,"May Falwell find the true power of prayer in the face of science, may he realize the true economic rewards of greed at the expense of his customers, may his pride foretell his fall, and may he know the humility that comes with being wrong."
2020-04-16 18:49:41,"Do not be deceived.  This is not about faith vs. science.  What Falwell is practicing by letting students into a pandemic viral environment has NOTHING to do with Christian faith.

It has everything to do with a stubborn fanaticism expressing a sheer cruelty to fellow human beings."
2020-04-16 18:59:27,I would never knowingly hire anyone who attended Liberty University. Ever. An acute display of really bad judgment.
2020-04-16 19:13:29,Recently the press (not the CDC) has been reporting aside from death the virus also can leave debilitating health problems in Covid-19 survivors. So the board of directors and Falwell are willing to risk life long health issues with these students to protect their profits? It is interesting how blatant the Trump allies have become about everything to lining their pockets. And these charlatans appear to fluctuate between being a bully and being a victim to take everyone off topic - they are risking people's lives for profit.
2020-04-16 19:14:32,This man should be in jail for violating health codes and common decency.
2020-04-16 18:54:10,"One case 16 days ago, an R0 value of 2 and incubation period of 3 days predicts expected 64 cases today and they experienced 78 cases.    I think we can safely assume virus is going to teach them a valuable lesson in exponential growth."
2020-04-16 18:57:28,Mr. Falwell cannot be loyal to trump and also loyal to God since these two illustrate completely opposite moral and ethical paths. Seems like he's chosen his: money before everything.
2020-04-16 19:07:33,"Evidently ""Liberty"" includes liberty from factual reality. Something tells me that a degree from Liberty University will not carry much credibility in the job market."
2020-04-16 19:18:30,"The strong belief that Mr. Trump was put in office by the hand of God controls what the religious right thinks and does. They believe they are ""special"" and that what God wants is for Trump to be supported no matter what. Their version of the bible is extreme and limited but they hold that their version is correct and that it is their duty to see that their ideas are forced upon everyone else. They control the education of the children who follow these religious beliefs from pre-K right through college and maybe graduate school. They get millions of dollars of donations which are tax free and they can do with them pretty much what they want.

Mr. Falwell believed that God would protect his campus but more than that they deeply believe, like Trump, in some kind of deep state conspiracy within our own government and certainly in our pluralistic democracy. They simply cannot understand why they have trouble and are ""persecuted"" by people who do not readily and completely accept their beliefs and their philosophy. This thinking, as we can see now, is extremely dangerous but they really don't care. Attacking Trump (who masquerades as a believer to make them happy) is tantamount to attacking them. Many people think like Falwell. Coronavirus, however, isn't religious. They would love to pray away the virus and its effects. I guess ""god"" has other ideas."
2020-04-16 19:04:21,"For more on this ""enlightened leader"" you might find this article enjoyable. Wonder if he set his attorneys loose on these reporters too.

2020-04-16 19:57:03,Jerry Falwell Jr. and Donald Trump has one major thing in common.  They get rich by conning and lying to people.
2020-04-16 19:39:50,Another question is why anyone would chose to go to this university that's led by such an obvious fraudster.
2020-04-16 19:46:53,"Mr. Falwell understands that students who attend Liberty are motivated by the supernatural and the glories of martyrdom.  He does not compel his students to pay tuition.  They compel him to accept it.  He does not kidnap his students, all of whom are over 18 years old.  They thrust themselves upon him and force him to take their money.  In other words, who cares."
2020-04-16 19:54:12,"Once had a priest who used to say that St. Christopher protects travelers until they go over the speed limit, then he gets out.

2020-04-16 19:55:28,Falwell is untrustworthy. He makes decisions based on revenue generation not based on fact or science or what is good for his students or patients or congregation.
2020-04-16 19:41:18,"Falwell is head of Samaritan’s Purse that set up a field hospital in New York’ Central Park to treat Covid 19 patients.   Thus, he knew or should have known the direct consequences of re-opening Liberty University and the danger to the Lynchburg area.   The failure of not providing cooperation and closely working with local authorities means he knowingly increased the risk of transmission of the disease in the Lynchburg area."
2020-04-16 19:54:24,"I remember his dad from back in the '80s. Every once in a while my medical school buddies and I would have a beer and watch Jerry the Elder.

I guess it runs in the family."
2020-04-16 20:11:49,"For contrast, my son is at Penn State.  His classes have continued without any stoppage, his fees for room and board refunded two weeks ago based on a prorated portion.  Very fair."

Falwell is also NOT a pastor. What these two do is complain, put people at risk, and whine about being held accountable.

Voters and buyers beware of these phonies."
2020-04-16 18:54:30,"In the world of religious predilections that Mr. Falwell inhabits pandemics have their upside, a chance to cash in on people's fears.

2020-04-16 20:27:50,"If I were Falwell, I’d worry less about lawyers and more about personal injury lawyers"
2020-04-16 20:22:08,"Shame on Fallwell and Liberty Univerity.  This university simply does not want to refund student fees for residence halls, meal plans, and facilities or give tuition discounts.  This university also has a history of authoritarianism, that discourages freedom of thought and critical thinking as liberal ideologies.  Under such conditions, what were the real or imagined consequences for students who refused the ""invitation"" to return?  Falwell and his crew also know that many universities have allowed some students from unstable or unsafe home environments to remain in campus residence.  Ethically, they cannot be turned out onto the streets!  As residents, these students require services from staff (such as food, health, etc) so the campus is at least partially ""open"" for those students.  Thus, factors such as campus residence are unstable measures of university function.  The comparisons are a ploy to mislead and misinform at the expense of the well-being of students, staff, and faculty--which this university has shown to care less about than the personal reputation of their leader who, like Trump, can never be wrong.  Falwell is the ""higher"" in higher education at Liberty U."

2020-04-16 19:53:49,"Wow, JFJ's operations must have enormous cash flow issues. The money from the university was probably funding acquisitions and ventures outside the scope of the institution. Not really a not for profit is it?  Not much like the Christ; JFJ wants people arrested, engages in name calling, wants the truth hidden, and dangers his student population. What fake. No wonder he's buddy buddy with donny. This person isn't doing much to polish the image of a good christian. Maybe, he's just a con man."
2020-04-16 19:58:33,"This is unhinged:

""The media, [Falwell] said in a radio interview with John Fredericks, who identified himself as a Trump campaign operative, 'just want power, they’re authoritarian, they’re like nothing I’ve seen since, if you go back in history, to Nazi Germany. That’s what they remind me of.'”

How does this statement make any sense at all? Governments can be authoritarian; by no definition can media be (it's like saying a banana is a bad singer), though they may choose to serve or be a mouthpiece for an authoritarian government (a bad singer can eat a banana; that is, media can have an instrumental relationship to the authoritarianism practiced by a government). I'm just so exhausted from the illogic and lying of the right."

As with other UC campuses, UCLA kept its dorms open for students who had nowhere else to move at short notice, or who would have had no access from home to the internet, on which classes continued.

How do employers ( other than Hobby Lobby or Chik- Filet) value a degree from Liberty when considering  a job applicant for a management track position? Don't expect any Nobels from the science profs or Pulitzers for the editors of the school newspaper.  For the near future, assuming they fill the dorms next fall, Liberty will be turning out football players and propagandists, the former offered a career that has risk of brain damage, the latter already suffering from a syndrome that makes them maladapted to being productive  participants in an advanced technological society.

The audience for the GOP dunces who could not pass a science quiz for a second grader was precisely evangelical hucksters like Jerry Falwell Jr.  When you can get all the candidate of a major political party in America to not just grovel at your feet but spout a ridiculous lie, why wouldn't you think you're a Demi-god? If you can establish a Department of Biology at a huge accredited university and fill it with faculty members whose main qualification include membership to the Creation Biology Society you too may think that the novel coronavirus would conform to your will.

South Korea and Singapore acted quickly and saved lives.

Predictably, many students came back, and not just to move out.  This article does a good job of testing Falwell’s claim that Liberty only did what UCLA, Virginia Tech, and Arizona State did (specifically, comparing the numbers of students who came back), but I’d like to see a comparison of these universities’ policies on dorm fees.  Is Liberty uniquely greedy?  Could be.  Were Liberty students uniquely eager to get back to their dorms?  Also possible.

Now, I could see calling it ""Mercy"", ""Covenant"",  ""Testament"", ""Love"", ""Deliverance"" and ""Grace"" just to name a few.  I do recall, ""While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption"" from Peter.   Maybe it's some kind of weird Christian, post-modern irony thing, but I don't get it."

 Liberty U is a key element because having it on your resume guarantees you being hired as a pastor. It also serves as a bastion of orthodoxy i.e. ""right faith"".
The organizational savvy (I'd label it as ""corrupt-ness"") of many evangelicals and their gospel of prosperity (Bible-wise, that's Mammon) is essential to their appeal.
Key to the Falwell phenomenon is the gullibility of good people who are taught not to think."

So instead Falwell brings his students back to a community with a large population of older citizens who are extremely vulnerable to this virus. Who knows how many of these students were among those seen partying at the various spring break functions in Florida and elsewhere. And some Liberty students HAVE tested positive for the virus. Because of this Falwell certainly bears no small amount of responsibility for introducing the virus to the area and its population. Now, like his hero trump, Falwell is trying to place the blame on someone else. But the truth proves otherwise. Real events show that Falwell does indeed share another apparent characteristic with trump - the ability to lie. This was proven evident when he told the mayor and the city manager of Lynchburg that there were only going to be a few students remaining on campus. Then without any notice, he allowed any and all students to return to campus. In his blatant arrogance Falwell has done nothing more than put an entire community at risk, yet he has the unmitigated gall to act like a victim. Let’s get one thing straight.

How many students are there?  Self distancing?  Occupied rooms far a part?   Facility use regulated?  

I am hoping that dinners are served to the room doors, and that all rooms are single occupant.   If students don't have the computer/technological ability at home, is the library and computer labs open and adjusted for distance?  

Students from out of country need a place to stay, Universities and Colleges staying open for that purpose makes sense.   

People who live in a no internet area will also need a refuge to continue on line courses.    

I am also curious as to how many total students a University or college have when fully functional compared to the current conditions.  If you only have room for a 1000 students, and you fill all 1000 beds, that is close contact.  If you have room for 10,000 students and have 2000 students on campus, contact can easily be avoided.  

As for the media coverage, I didn't hear anything about a big public announcement for students to return from any of the other Universities or Colleges.  If you don't want to be singled out, don't send out a press release?"

However, if the law is being broken by Liberty (or other groups) and endangering the citizens of Virginia, Governor Northam  could utilize National Guard units to enforce the lockdown. When it comes to churches that fail to obey the law, these are usually  the very same churches that want to throw out immigrants who have come here without obeying the law.

While I had no symptoms, their C19 protocols include screening every patient.  They got my test results back within 45 minutes. 

But then this was a real university, firmly commited to evidenced based medicine and scientific enquiry.   We also have state and county governments that responeded early and appropriately to C19 as a public health emergency.   

While I was there, I was pleased to see that my local ER was operating below capacity.  Rather than lowering the quality of care, if anything the C19 crisis has upped their game and improved the care I got. 

The american right is learning the hard way that you can't defeat a virus with spin control or shouting it down.  It requires common sense, planning, determination, attention to detail and a willingness to actually govern for the public benefit.

Speaks volumes of a university’s ethics to offer doctoral degrees that are purely online and require no actual class meetings, either online or face-to-face. All she did was write tons of papers and press “submit.” It was nothing but busy work, same as she gave to her students, and the price tag for this degree was exorbitant. Her reasoning for this degree was that Georgia pays a step raise for doctoral degrees. I’m actually glad that Alabama doesn’t.

Is this actually false? 

The article doesn’t make it clear

The fact that Liberty was kept open when others were shutting down doesn’t per se fundamentally distinguish them from Liberty. 

Why? 

Most schools that were shutting down while Liberty was still up & running may have done so on orders of their own respective state authorities. 

The governor of VA allegedly permitted universities to remain open until AFTER Falwell had invited all students & staff back after spring break to continue classes as usual (obviously, only to the extent that students, etc. actually did return to campus) 

Although no date is provided, this article states that the governor only closed VA universities, including Liberty, after learning that a Liberty student had tested positive for CV19 following the start of (some) classes following spring break

So it may be true that Falwell didn’t fundamentally behave much differently than most other universities around the nation- 

most others may have simply been shut down by the states before spring break. 

Article should have made this crystal clear - 

It would have been helpful to explain why  students remain on campus at UCLA, Virginia tech, Texas A&M, ASU, as well as the status of schools overall across the nation.

All you need to ask yourself is “What would Jesus have done?”  Falwell used God, his church and Liberty University as vehicles to amass power and obscene amounts of money. Sending kids back to Liberty University was just using them as pawns to protect his own lifestyle. They were sacrificial lambs for Falwell’s personal finances. He is a true blue “prosperity preacher” hijacking God’s will to feed his own wealth and then telling his followers that it is God’s will that he be rich off their backs. This man of God has a net worth over ten million dollars and Liberty University monies are funneled into his massive private real estate dealings according to former Liberty University Board members. Jesus spread the word of God with humility and compassion and as a pauper who did not seek great rewards on earth. He knew his reward awaited him in heaven.

We had a business selling broadcast equipment in the 1990's.  We once sold equipment to the Liberty radio station.  An hour after we had closed the deal, we got a panicked call from a very decent communications department professor telling us that Liberty would not be paying us if we accepted their purchase order.  If we accepted their purchase order, we would only be given the option of turning our invoice into a ""love offering"".  I knew another business who was stiffed for a good deal of money later.  This was endemic,  I even heard Jerry Falwell, Sr. essentially bragging on his ""Old Time Gospel Hour"" radio show about having settled with the contractor for pennies on the dollar for one of Liberty's major buildings.

My local hospital would turn me away instantly if I showed up at the entry offering to give them my stash of 3 or 4 N95masks. Not only might I be a carrier of coronavirus, but it turns out I am a person in his 70's and thus much more likely than those under 60 to experience a severe reaction or even death if I contract the disease. I really have no business going out of my house for such a quixotic effort that could endanger hospital staff and patients as well as myself.

I also have several of the blue surgical masks, which I know are much less effective than N95 masks in helping me avoid contracting the disease, but I understand that these blue masks can help me avoid spreading the disease to others.

I therefore think it is appropriate to let individuals know how to sterilize and reuse both N95 and blue surgical masks.

I have also seen in the medical literature that microwaving N95 and blue surgical masks can sanitize them for reuse; does anyone out there have more information or links on how to do this?"
2020-04-16 17:41:34,"Since some studies have suggested that the virus is no longer viable on porous materials after 24 hours, does it work to just let an N95 mask (or any other mask) sit for a few days?

2020-04-16 17:46:39,"What am I missing? I thought that the virus died after about 24 hours on cardboard surfaces or about 2-3 days on plastics/steel. Extrapolating that, couldn’t you simply set aside used masks for a day or three in order to allow any present virus to die out naturally?  It’s not the fastest way to decontaminate a mask, but if it worked you would only need a system to store used masks; track how long ago they were used; and who wore it (for concerns about the proper fit). Plus, this way might not degrade the masks’ effectiveness with harsher cleaning methods."

My guess is that the majority of N95 masks may not contain such polymers, but it's something to consider.  I personally consider the UV-C decontamination route to be a good one, providing one follows some safety guidelines (don't look at UV-C, don't put it near your skin for any period of time, exhaust the area - preferably an enclosed box - when finished, as it creates ozone from the breakdown of oxygen, etc.)."

Once I have used a mask for the ~40 hours it is good for, I soak it in alcohol and leave it to dry.  Thus far I have seen no degradation of the material, though I would probably not decontaminate each mask more than once, since it just doesn't ""feel"" safe.  A friend uses hydrogen peroxide the same way, and says that there is slightly more degradation of the material from that than there is from alcohol."
2020-04-16 18:10:30,"As other commentators have pointed out, if the virus only lives a certain number of hours on a porous surface, then wearing a mask after letting it sit (preferably in sunlight) is better than no mask at all.

Since, other than distanced exercise walks, I've only gone out once every few weeks for groceries, that has seemed a workable solution, and better than a homemade one created with fabric from Joann's."

It’s my understanding they have those UV lights at the hospital so Why don’t they those before taking the ppe off?

In fact why don’t they  create rooms like that so they can go in and out of those rooms all day long and kill the virus?"

This could have demonstrated the percent efficacy for a treatment that about 100,000 percent more facilities have than those requiring large expensive equipment.  And of coarse sticking your mask in an oven is a better idea than spraying it down with alcohol to these academics, due to the complete lack of common sense or real life experience."

I saw a two pack in a gas station for $20. They both had Chinese writing. It is my understanding that these are not certified and probably counterfeit and most likely would be rejected for use in a hospital. 
Also, it is my understanding that a lot of ""equipment"" being donated is not usable. The hospitals are strict about what enters and get used in their facilities. Discouraging people from buying the knockoffs has the unintended consequences of folks simply not wearing a mask. My friend ordered a basic bandana on Amazon. It is backordered until May and yet we are required to wear face masks. What happens to the presumably millions of unfit masks rejected from the hospitals?  Even a poorly performing mask works better if everyone is wearing one. We need masks, people!"

 Someone can know a lot about a virus without being qualified to make arguments about who is most deserving of life-saving equipment that can fit into your pocket, and that on any interpretation of a just healthcare system, would have already been allocated appropriately. 

The argument that healthcare workers should get mask-priority will likely wear even thinner as millions of people get hungry. No doubt healthcare workers are putting their lives on the line, and they deserve more than slogans of support on cardboard signs. But in times of crisis selfishness is the norm, unfortunately, and for many people, it will become harder to forget two things. First, before the pandemic, the healthcare system was not terribly generous. Second, that system is housed within a market-based society that is also not known for its charity. At that point, it might seem reasonable to conclude that the mask that you deprive the nurse of is the mask that enables you to leave the house to seek work, food, and without irony, medical care."
2020-04-16 20:36:56,"As it says in the article, ""The public has been advised not to use or try to buy N95 masks because they would be depriving health care workers of lifesaving equipment."" I already have a few N95 masks left over from a kitchen redo project from 2010. I fail to see how possessing these old masks is ""depriving health care workers... "" We are in our 60s, live in NYC, and are required to wear masks when leaving the house. My husband and I each wear one of these masks when we have to run an errand, which happens maybe every 7-10 days or so. The duration of each errand is never more than 30 minutes. We have been rotating them and letting them sit in the sun in between wearings. Is this ideal? Maybe not, but given the poor advice about not needing to wear any masks at all until last week, they are much better than nothing."

It means that the safest way to re-use the masks is to rotate between several masks: holding a potentially contaminated mask (one that did its job, actually filtering some virus) by the elastics, put it in a large paper envelope, and use another one while you let the first one rest 48 hours. The “official"" time being 24 hours, you should be able to use it again for another round, any potential virus having become inactive since 24h…"

For instance, yesterday's article discussed maintaining proper ""spacing"" outdoors -- with nary a mention of what effect ""windage"" might have on the matter. A mild (two or three mph) breeze will double the recommended 6 foot spacing. And, today, for the general reader -- who obviously only has a single option for home decontamination of a mask, the oven -- the article states the recommend effective temperature (158 F), but entirely neglects to give a ""recommended baking time"".  Heating the mask for just a bit more than the minimum time required will obviously prolong the useful life of the mask. Cooking it for too long, will certainly destroy it, too!"

There are possible issues with it regarding the use of the appropraite UV meter. The service posting this article is also posting a number of articles that are all prepublication/pre peer review. This not science  - it is marketing. You also meant to write the lab used SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as the novel coronavirus?  There are several UVC systems that allow masks to be placed closer to the light source. 

The VHP system in use by Battelle is a nightmare in my opinion - the amount of material handling and staff is unacceptable. Devices should be at the point of use, portable, plug and play, short processing time, no chemicals, and allows staff to process their own FFR ( Face Fitting Respirator). These other attempts are poorly thought through from an material management perspective. The basis on reprocessing a device 20 times wiht VHP ( orginally 50 times with the Battelle study) was not conducted on masks that had been worn for 8 to 12 hours. Those recommendations are not supported by science."

I've used mines twice so far (I got it from my grandmother who is a licensed home health aide so no one shoot me) and decontaminated it with hydrogen peroxide. The key is to NOT dilute it with water- I just pour it straight into a spray bottle and spray away. It's preferable to alcohol, it's a lot less harsh on your skin and objects. Everytime someone enters or leaves the house, door knobs get tackled. Same for other high traffic surfaces: sink handles, utensils etc."

However, It seems to me health care professionals and public health officials continue to play a dangerous shell game about masks.  Essentially what they’re saying is believe in the magic-voodoo con I’m promoting.  The con is this.  

I wear a mask and it protects me, but if you wear the exact same protective mask the exact same way it doesn’t really work.  I get it, they need masks, let’s get them masks, but do they really they think we believe that?  Simple logic and critical thinking allow us to easily dispense with this obvious lie.

As the crawling man draws close to a second man lounging in a deck chair beside his swimming pool, the man in the deck chair says to the crawling man, ""I wouldn't drink that water, it's chlorinated.""

Or to echo Buck Turgidson who declared when he learned about the Russian doomsday machine, ""I wish we had one of them doomsday machines,"" I wish the author had suggested a plentiful and public source for them N95s so we can constantly replace them.

As a strong oxidant, I'd think it would be very effective.  

And, since powerful ozone generators are available for less that $100, it could be very cost effective.  These are often used by hotels to remove odors from entire rooms.  You could imagine a hospital using a shipping container with racks full of used PPE and two or three ozone generators.  

A literature search shows that ozone-based therapies have been considered for treating patients, but I can't find anything on decontamination of PPE."

About three weeks ago, I ordered a UV-C LED bulb (and some welding goggles) off Amazon, and it finally came in on Tuesday.  I was planning on using it to disinfect rooms and groceries, but honestly, I may be more afraid of the UV than I am of the virus.  

I order a lot of electronics parts from overseas, and they always seem to arrive in a box devoid of any tech specifications, user manuals, or part numbers (these parts have always been functional, though).

The same thing has happened with this germicidal bulb - I don’t have any data on its spectral output, and it may be a total scam.  I am passing my days in isolation trying to MacGyver some method to test that it actually outputs UV-C ... but, I can tell that it does produce ozone, so there’s at least some UV being emitted.  The toxic ozone, combined with skin cancer and blindness fears, have dampened my enthusiasm of using UV to disinfect things."

In short, he recommends boiling water, placing the mask in a container and submerging it in the hot water for 10 minutes. Then you use soap and water with a toothbrush to clean the inside and outside of the mask.  I've been using a cpap swab cloth for that step.

His demeanor and presentation, along with microscopic examination of the mask after the procedure,  were completely convincing and we've been following his instructions for weeks now.  Seems to work fine.   Who really knows?   

Stay safe."
2020-04-16 21:32:42,"Only Dr. Kumar mentioned testing the filter performance post cleaning. I wish we would hear more about these tests from the others. A mask needs to filter out virus and other pathogens to a high degree. So any decontaminating process that compromises the filtering performance is dangerous. The filter is a physical sieve for large particles and an electrostatic ""catcher"" for the small particles. Muck with the surface properties of the fibers that compose the mask filter and you risk compromising the filtering capability. 
There are certifying labs that have standard protocols to test filters and they will also test decontaminated masks (eg Nelson Labs in Salt Lake City - I have nothing to do with them). Any published protocol needs to have been checked by a certifying body before mass adoption of the procedure. The risks are too high if a frontline worker thinks a mask is equivalent to N95 but is really not."

We can’t look to Washington for leadership or for a singular voice of direction. Most of us feel we’re on our own. Where we live, what hospital we end up in, indeed what physician(s) who treats us...the combination of these factors may determine who lives or dies. Isn’t there a better way?"

A and B have longer wavelengths contained in sunlight that are not screened out by our atmosphere. That's why we use sunscreens to protect ourselves from sunburn when we're outside.

C has a shorter wavelength that is mostly screened out by our atmosphere. C is extremely harmful and is the only type of UV used as a disinfectant. It is produced by special lighting apparatus, not a common ""blacklight"".

Sunlight is not that effective because it only contains A and B by the time is reaches the earth's surface, not C that is effective. Hanging a mask outside won't do the job that people think."

For N95’s, which were also designed for one day use and are no longer good if folded or crumpled, we have to first guarantee their effectiveness for hospital workers, and I do not think we can.

The machines heat up to about 121 C for 15 minutes, killing bacteria and viruses. ""It'll sterilize anything."" The assumption has been that if you tried this on an N95 mask they would degrade rapidly. We thought we'd give it a try anyway,"" Kumar said. ""And actually what we found is while it does degrade some [types of] masks, there's a certain group of masks that are made of kind of a fabric-type material, rather than being moulded closely to the face they're called pleated [masks],"" he said.

In spite of the need to provide for the protection of the Public, there are no guidelines issued for ""keeping yourself safe while living your life"" - which in the coming weeks and months will grow in importance as the need to re-integrate public spaces grows. We have been told: first- no need for masks, then- use masks but only substandard ones so that health care professionals are provided for, and don't try sterilizing them yourself. 
 Where's the leadership? How about some commonsense guidelines that can tell people how to sterilize the masks they are currently using for the good of all? Instead we get this situation, as evidenced in the commentary here, in which everyone gets to speculate as to how they're going to DIY their own sterilization. 
There are certainly some effective methods (some likely listed in these commentaries) that could at least provide some help and guidelines to the hundreds of millions of people who have to try to live their lives without infecting others.

I have been using my homemade decontamination box, which consists of a heavy plastic storage bin with  a tight fitting lid, with a shower-type wire bottle rack, laid flat inside it.  

In the space where the bottles would have gone, I put a small bowl (glass, ceramic) to hold whatever poured or sprayed agent I am using. These could be: ethyl alcohol (pref 91%); a spray shot of lysol; some formulation of chlorine bleach; most solvents--any product that warns you not to inhale the vapors. 

The important issue here is that objects are never in direct contact with the substance of the cleaning agent, only the fumes, which don't appear to  degraded the integrity of the things I have put inside the chamber in the amount of time I use for a treatment.

But. I have no way of testing the clinical effectiveness of masks after sustained exposure to these vapors so I would like to see this practical method properly tested."

That said government cannot be expected to take the place of all the rich, varied and private industry out there. Competition creates new ideas and great wealth. We have killed an incredible economy and ruined careers for a generation. 

Uber is amazing as it also works in rural areas and smaller towns where there are no taxis. Last year I attended an event at the University of Iowa and was ubered by a retired woman who was looking to pick up extra cash and conversation.

The wealth inequality in NYC is stark. But that's not America. There are plenty of places where you can buy a home for a reasonable price.

What is missing is the test kits and the technology to facilitate tracing.  In the meantime our health care workers remain at risk due to a continuing shortage of protective equipment.  It is here that the Trump Administration has nearly criminally failed America.  Trump, the CDC and the FDA refused imports of test kits from abroad at the very outset of the pandemic; Trump refused to exercise powers to mobilize our corporations to produce protective equipment and test kits.  This has resulted in needless spread of infection, deaths and a deeper and longer lasting economic crash that will cause unnecessary suffering for American workers.  In the meantime, bailouts for major corporations and relatively few dollars going to the unemployed and small business owners.

2020-04-17 11:26:54,"At this point, I can careless about the Chinese government and their lies. I am sure there will be a reckoning sometime in the future. I am starting to feel less sympathetic to areas affected outside of the Northeast. I am furious at how this virus has ravaged Metropolitan NY. Although some people believe that measures to prevent the virus was slow, the severity of the virus was not full realized until it was too late. 

I am no economist, politician, or epidemiologist, however I do understand data and science. I also see how the virus has disproportionately affected the population. 

As a person of color who teaches children from low income families in Queens hardest hit areas, it infuriates me how state governments such as Florida, Texas, and Georgia continue to downplay the pandemic. Also, how people in Michigan are selfishly gathering in large protests because they feel that their “rights” are being “tread upon”. 

I believe more Americans are now less concerned about the virus because it is highly concentrated in the Metropolitan NY and it’s affecting Americans who are poor, people of color, the unhealthy. My assumption is not based on science and data, more emotion. 

I am not sure how this is going to play out, but I feel that the Coronavirus has pulled together communities across Western Europe, but has furthered divided communities here in the Continental United States. People say that this virus does not discriminate; but it’s clear that eventually, it will."
2020-04-17 13:53:35,"Some important thing to remember about reopening schools:

1. Urban schools in the U.S. are overcrowded. Often 30 or more students in a room, whereas the classroom in Denmark appears to have around 15. You can’t do social distancing in overcrowded classrooms.

2. Cafeterias, hallways, and playgrounds present the same issue. Lots of overcrowding. Most urban schools do not have a beautiful grassy area for children to run and play, so playtime often involves congregating in groups.

3. Many urban schools do not have hot water in restrooms or sinks in classrooms for washing hands. They are older buildings that have never been updated. 

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if our schools had been funded all along so that they were spacious, clean, and hygienic, with appropriate class sizes of 15, so that we could enact social distancing measures when it comes time to reopen?"

They have stayed open, even while official advice has been to “keep your kids home if you can”. Most public schools are trying to support home schooling while also serving those who continue to attend. With only 47 new cases today, and more ‘recovereds’ than ‘new’ for the past week, Australia may be on track to full classrooms in next few weeks."
2020-04-17 12:52:27,"In natural disasters like catastrophic heat waves and hurricanes, trying to tally deaths by enumerating each one to a single cause can’t work.  The daily counts of deaths, compared to expected numbers modeled from prior years provide a crude, but complete estimate of the disasters toll, without  influence by political pressures, well-known differences in cause of death coding, and the uncertainty that is inevitable when large numbers of people are found dead at home.  Estimating excess mortality counts people who died from the direct causes of disasters, like heat stroke or drowning, from physical stress that causes fatal decompensation preexisting medical conditions, from power outages and other interruptions of access to essential services, and even from the unintended consequences of responses to the disaster.  A variation of this approach is used to estimate the true death toll from seasonal flu.  This method is possible in places where death registration is complete, including essentially all high-income countries and large parts of other countries, too.  The COVID-19 crisis presents all of the challenges to tallying deaths in the context of a massive natural disaster.  Eventually, epidemiologists will study deaths from this and subsequent waves of COVID-19.  It will be an important way to gauge the effectiveness of government responses across cities, states and countries and doing better in future pandemics."
2020-04-17 13:41:02,"China's numbers and how the West needs to think about them:

First, let's get some stuff out of the way. Are they underreporting? Of course. It's a given that everyone is, because you simply can't test every person and you cannot account for every death. But are they nefariously trying to cook the books? Yes, the officials in Wuhan in the beginning, for sure. And probably some more later by the central government. But I believe the trends since the lockdown which brings me to the point of this.

The West has been literally stuck on this idea that China has been completely ravaged by COVID despite the country having engaged in the greatest experiment in social distancing ever undertaken. We cite our own devastation as ""proof"" that they are lying . But we did not do what they did. Again, we didn't take the steps they took. We can't seem to hold on to that fact. We just become less committed to maintaining restrictions and the resultant increases in infection just makes us doubt the Chinese more. It's like not believing antibiotics work for the other guy because you are still sick after refusing them. What we needed to do, was to follow their steps and see if we too could have similar numbers and trends. Then we could call them out if it doesn't work for us. Distance is our only weapon right now and our focus on China's ""lies"" undermines our resolve to use it."
2020-04-17 11:17:49,"We need to answer our own failing first, how in God’s name did we end up with so many many sick and dying in NYC? We lost control, and we lost lives, and we lost far far far more per capita than Wuhan even if you tripled their numbers.

We were slack in stopping flights in and out of NYC. We never stopped subways. We were so late with social distancing. We were horribly late with PPE. We still fail here. We were too late with masks on all who venture out. We Americans learned nothing from the Chinese until far too late. 

Yet we will be too early with reentry in the absence of effective testing and tracking.
Mind boggling."

They do not even seem to be accepted as fully human by other members of society, ignored and rejected when they seek basic human needs. They are at greater risk from the Coronavirus and I am not convinced many localities have a concrete plan for this. But when Philip Alston, UN official, lays all the blame for this on a conservative federal government he despises, he completely ignores the decades of federal, state and local depictions that have led to this situation and further degrades the outcasts into nothing more than weapons in his political war.

If the goal is to stamp out this virus, I have a bridge to sell you.  It's here; it's not going away any more than the flu, Ebola, or the common cold. 

We'll need herd immunity either by having most people catch the virus or develop a vaccine to speed the process.

in the absence of a vaccine, the same number of people will catch the disease and die of the disease, it's just a matter of a what rate and at what economic/social/physical cost.

Of course the Trump Administration would be against such a policy because it would delay ""opening the economy"".  Trump has little regard for saving lives or preventing sickness.  His major concern is to have a booming stock market in order to get reelected.  His main focus should be on  preventing  suffering and the loss of human lives during this pandemic."

The conspicuous gap is at the top. Trump failed to heed warnings provided in Nov, again in Jan, Feb and March until the media held his feet to the fire. At this time, every gov effort should be directed towards saving lives and preventing an economic depression but Trump is focused elsewhere, primarily on his reelection.

Given the Trump leadership void, companies are acting on their own to survive the crisis and provide a safe workplace. Amazon took the lead and is creating their own test kit and procedures for workers. I expect the restaurant industry to follow along with airlines who would be happy with any passenger load above zero. Whereas former presidents Bush, Obama and Reagan would encourage such innovation, Trump would perceive it as corporate leaders stealing his limelight.

To a successful capitalist like me, Trump represents the worst aspect of this crisis because of his abysmal failure to thwart it in the beginning and lead us out of it."

Of course they are mostly young males in active-military health condition. This is not typical of an entire nation. It is however a data point of a sort we don't really have in any reliable way.

 When I read the Times coverage last month of the inexcusable number of  virus deaths in Spain's nursing homes, my first reaction was that such events would never happen in this country.  And then I read about the nursing home deaths in New Jersey and Queens.

2020-04-17 16:20:25,"Germany's R0 of 0.7 is not ""0.7 percent"" as is stated in this article, it's 70 percent. 

In other words, each new infected person is expected to infect on average 70percent over the entire course of their illness before becoming non-infectious.

That's why an R0 of under 1 means the disease dies out. If 1,000 people are infected and only infect 700 people before they recover, and then those 700 only infect 700*70% = 490, and then those 490 only infect about 340, who infect about 240, etc you're getting exponential decay rather than exponential growth. 

If that R0 number were greater than 1, each iteration would be infecting _more_ people rather than less, and you'd get exponential growth.

This is a rough illustration, that's not how it works in real life, but it shows why being above or below 1 is the critical point. And again, R0 of 1 is not 1%; if you must put it in percentage terms it's 100%."

I studied China’s official and business data for 25 years. Its businesses and government (often no distinction) are responsible for 25 years of mendacity.  I advised professional clients that no quantitative or qualitative data was ever reliable.  Ninety-five percent confidence that the data, stats and financial data are bogus.  Some clients were blinded by a promise of great riches, just like Spanish explorers looking for cities of gold deep in the jungles of Central America.  They too lost.

This sounds like they a roll out of a new economic system. Like, not business as usual, but new guidelines on who does what. If that starts happening elsewhere I can imagine we will have a new economic framework by the time we are all allowed back outside. 

This tied up with the incredibly gross practice (welcomed with open arms by people from Massachusetts), in which people are flagged as undesirables, their neighbors telling on them, and they are labeled as undesirables. See the article yesterday, neighbors are going to be calling neighbors to tell you to avoid this one and that one as they have cooties, so that such people are segregated from society, and lots of Boston people were cheering the measure.

You put this all together and we have a new world order, where undesirables are ostracized and governments tell you what business are allowed to exist and which ones are not..

2020-04-17 23:42:50,"""While children have been largely spared the worst of  Covid... the UN has warned that the social and economic fallout of the pandemic “risk being catastrophic and amongst the most lasting consequences” for the young.

In a new report, researchers found that as schools remain closed, families lose income, food resources scarce... health needs of children go unmet, hundreds of thousands of children could die and millions could be plunged into poverty.""

The above is a classic example of how the same information can be interpreted and responded to very differently, depending on how the reader/listener considers the messenger.  

Most Dems/Libs consider the UN a 'good' org which puts people first.  And yet, here is the UN, not talking about the deaths from COVID, but the fallout from the Response to COVID.  The economic shutdown.  Citizens being put under house arrest.  The emotional toll.  Domestic abuse problems (which the NYT has specifically written stories on) exacerbated by the quarantine.  Etc.

So, one could actually interpret the UN's message as suggesting that maybe...just maybe...we need to reconsider the degree to which we've shut down the economy...reconsider the degree to which we are committing people (shaming them, really) to house arrest.  

But because such questions have (up to this point) only been put forth by Trump/his supporters, the Left/Dem kneejerk response is 'No, No, No' (since, naturally, anything/everything suggested by Trump must be Bad, Bad, Bad)"

R0 or R-naught
That is not what that means.  It means that the number of infected is falling with each generation of transmission.  Start with 100 infected people.  They generate 70 new infections.  That group generations 49 new infections.  That group generated 35 new infections, then 24 new infections, and so on.  The infection is dying out.  How many people get over it is not a part of that calculation.

Looks like he didn't manage to notice that China's contraction is only a small fragment of a worldwide economic contraction. And China's relative share of the world economy has grown dramatically thanks to the fact that they have weathered this virus far better under superior infrastructure and leadership than the United States. China's industries are now restarting at full speed while the US is grinding to a screeching and indefinite halt.

Certainly though, it is fueled by the extremely shortsighted actions of the Western govts which allowed the 'businessmen' from their countries to gut jobs domestically for decades, foolishly export the know-how etc etc., we all know all this, why are we wasting time on explaining and discussing what was the very first step, the absolutely necessary step behind the tremendous achievements in China in last 4 decades.  It is greed of the business in USA and elsewhere, and complicit action of the money-serving (not the people) govts.

That would most certainly mean that large swaths of Florida (and other Sun Belt states) would become bone-chilling ghost towns. And it should not be expected that when the boomers are not longer there other people would replace them in Florida. Florida doesn’t have anything to attract people with Third Millennium mentality and aspirations. Even if the Florida state government offered all kinds of incentives for technology heavy businesses to relocate to Florida there will be no significant takers because any business that moved to Florida will have very serious problems attracting the professionals that such business would need to operate efficiently. The death of the “seniors only” industry, the industry that characterizes Florida, would mean that all the younger people that work in connection with serving the old population would not longer have a job and no new, different jobs will be available either. Young and middle-age persons working in Florida now should better start to send their resume to companies in other states with a more age-diverse population."

Credit is how goods and services can flow faster than the dollars paying for them. But, credit must be repaid. After the flow of goods and services are stopped, the repayment of credit also stops. The consumer base dries up as workers have no work. The businesses falter, as they cannot make their payments. The banks who now have non-performing loans soon have negative balances. The new businesses that replace the failed ones take time, and capital, to become profitable. People without jobs cannot purchase what they need to survive. Banks are not able to provide credit.

Third, place harsh limits on any travel to and from China.

Fourth, repatriate Chinese nationals here in the US on business or pleasure and don't let any back in tunil the virus episode is declared over by the CDC, and then, only after blood tests prior to boarding any means of conveyance that will enter US territories.

Fifth, work with African and South American nations to reverse the stranglehold that China has on them, a ploy to secure vital mineral resources by forced indebtedness.

Sixth, sanction all travel and finances of Chinese Communist Party members.

China also has the world's largest total banking sector assets of $39.93 trillion with $27.39 trillion in total deposits. It has the world's largest foreign-exchange reserves worth $3.1 trillion. And China is now the world's largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods. In contrast, ours is a consumer economy and a service economy.

2020-04-17 15:31:49,"Some time ago when asked about China’s human rights violations and also about China’s opposition to Taiwan’s independence a politician replied: ""It would be unwise to upset your banker” and that is precisely where the real problem lies. In our prolonged and unabated quest for cheap merchandise we (the American consumers and the American businesses that satisfy the American consumers’ demand) made China our – by far – largest creditor. So we should not berate the W.H.O. for not accepting Taiwan, we should not even blame China for anything because what we, Americans, have now with China is a situation created for our own doing."
2020-04-17 15:41:04,"Such prognostications are useless. The pandemic is an event with no roadmap and the recovery process is still early even in a place like China where the worst of it hit first.

The timeline for the U.S. is about a month behind. And, that assumes the chaotic response in the U.S. did not delay the timeline further.

The pandemic exposed how interconnected economies are within and between countries. It also exposed the weaknesses of the political system (including the U.S.) and the flaws of the global economic model.

Going forward, it is obvious that there needs to be simplification of supply chains and a need for more redundancies and slack so that spikes in demand and sudden changes in the supply chain do not cause so much havoc. Yes, this is less efficient according the traditional MBA micro-economic schools of thought but the system will be more resilient, people's lives will be less disrupted and (this is obviously something that NO ONE has thought about before) there will be MORE JOBS because of it. What is unknown is what this will do to prices in the short- to medium-term as this transition happens."

Not only have the response to this pandemic hamstrung by people that cannot follow simple quarantine order nor believe in the scientific process, the recovery will be affected as well.

Secondly, though the virus showed its ugly head last November, i.e., November 2019 itself, it covered the truth from the rest of the world. Thirdly, even now, even today they did not tell the correct figures of how many have been affected and how many died because of the killer virus. Today, they revealed some figures.

2020-04-17 16:31:21,"Yes, China emerged from poverty, starting from a very low economic level - so there was a lot of room for a spectacular economic growth rate which continued until it didn’t.

Now here, and in much of the rest of the world, economic activity has slowed to a crawl due to the pandemic and underlying, preexisting conditions.  Eventually, the crisis will end (or, we’ll all be dead and it won’t matter).  Then, we, too, will be starting from a low level of economic activity, but with a huge pent up demand and many idled facilities already in place.

What’s next will resemble what was going on before, but it will not be the same, just as China’s recent affluence was very different from its prior poverty.

Today in China, the noxious air is cleaner than it has been in decades.  Will that last as things return to “normal”?  Today in the USA, structural weaknesses and gaping inequalities that were never very secret are blindingly obvious.  Will we keep these weaknesses in place as things return to “normal”?

Consider the amount of transactions are for weapons, consider the profit margin for medical supplies, consider the assumption that we women need to fill a huge closet with multiple clothing items for every occasion, or that every family needs an expensive television, or top tier cable, or top speed internet, or an iPhone.  Consider the ways in which business has shifted in this country away from a producer economy to a consumer economy, and ask yourself if that is even mathematically rational.

In my opinion, the title is misleading and perpetuating the confusion.
No, the USA are not No. 1 anymore; since 2014 China is, based on the GDP (PPP).

GDP comparisons using PPP (purchasing power parity) are more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing a nation's domestic market because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates which may distort the real differences in per capita income.

Facts and statistics are often a charade to save face in China. Similar in many ways to the virus itself. At first the CCP obfuscated on the impact and characteristics of the virus until the scope and strength of the virus could not be denied. This virus and its crisis will bring out the best and worst in people and reveal the core strengths and weakness of economies, political systems and societies. Hopefully it will lead to the death knell of the CCP."

And further extend deliveries of its growing nuclear missile and attack submarine fleet. 

Hopefully major economies will use the increasingly depressed global economy to further reduce their key dependence on China’s export of strategic manufactured and raw materials. Military analysts throughout the NATO alliance and beyond have been arguing for years and years to take such steps. We have a much better understanding of how China would react to a major biological global crisis. Or a military flare up.

Given what China did to control the epidemic in the past three months or so, the economic hit should have been expected for anyone with common sense. I think the Chinese government knew what the economic consequence would be. China has a very high saving rate, which help its people to mitigate the hardship.

On the other hand, the economic data just shows what it would take to bring the epidemic under control in any country and to save more lives.

I think some countries hard hit by the epidemic in Europe, which took initially  half-hearted measures to control the epidemic, have learned their lessons in a hard way. 

Unfortunately, I do not think our governments at the federal level in particular and in many states,  have learned the lesson or be honest with us. Instead, each day they put out a lot false hopes. For example, how many times have we been told that we were at the peak? Unfortunately, I do not think I have a peak, but a plateau."

Rising like a phoenix from the horrors of a social engineering experiment (the cultural revolution) gone wrong, the communist party made the crucial decision of trading the dogma of Marxism for laissez faire, with a Chinese twist; one could eat all the Big Macs in the world as long as the state reigns supreme. That has worked well for most Chinese (except the minorities) and the rest of the world. The latter did not need to know where the cattle was butchered as long as got their beef.

The single minded focus of the Chinese to produce the most at the cheapest was a clever strategy. Copyright and quality remained bugbears but there was a lot of money to be made at the bottom of the pyramid. That should ensure that most local manufacturers would get back up. Demand for luxury goods are not coming back anytime soon. Many people in India are seeing the virus as a gratuitious 'Chinese' export, followed by the actual money making ones i.e. masks and testing kits. Conspiracy theorists can have a field day with the former, the latter demonstrates their manufacturing chops and why if there is one country which needn't worry about a rebound, its the Chinese.

Since its not a 'true' free market, smaller outfits will find it difficult to get capital, nudged out by state backed ones. The diversity of their manufacturing prowess should however see them through. After all, when you have an Alibaba, why bother with Amazon?"

(Essential manufacturing, understandably, should be done locally, which is the norm for most parts of the world) You can't bring back the jobs by increasing tariffs, some jobs may return but majority of the jobs (that depends on import) will disappear and they will have a rippling effect to the other industry that doesn't rely on import.

We see that central planning in China and near-total control over all events far outweigh the policies of John Maynard Keynes after the 1930s and exceed those of the Neoclassic. Any reader of Chinese history knows that it is easy for them to sacrifice these small sectors in addition to people for the sake of national interests. We see that central planning in China and near-total control of all activities far outweigh the effectiveness of government intervention in the free economy as we found in John Maynard Keynes’s policies after the 1930s. It surpasses those in the neoclassic rescue and recovery policies of the 1970s after the collapse of the Breton Woods system. We may not agree with the opinion here, that things from its inception until the moment in China appear within the complete red government control, and that what happens is fully consistent with the template of a comprehensive economic attack on the free world, and we find for the above that changing economic frameworks is necessary before preparing any evaluation of what is happening in China ."

You cannot vote without very specific forms of id, enroll a child in school, enter certain buildings, for example, and many of us remember when, to check into a hotel, you had to leave your passport or cni overnight at the reception for it to be inspected by police. Who, incidentally, have enormous surveillance powers.

Anecdote: In the early 80s I moved to Paris and applied for a French driving license on the basis of holding one in a neighboring country. Immediately, the clerk told me I was not eligible, since I had been living in France for over a decade. When I protested that this was impossible, they informed me that I had failed to turn in my residence permit when I left after spending my junior year abroad, 11 years earlier! This was of course long before records were digitalized, and shows the long and careful paper records kept by the police."
2020-04-17 18:12:11,"There is no doubt that properly anonymized location data from a large subset of a population has the potential to provide useful assistance to epidemiologists and public health officials charged with tracking an infectious disease. 

But I find no basis for the assumption of competence which is implicitly assigned to the those responsible for putting such a surveillance regime into action. 

Consider the mangled response to the virus starting with the Diamond Princess in Japan and more recently in Italy, Spain and now here in the United States. There are solid reasons for serious doubt that governments will use such technologies either effectively or responsibly.

It is only a small leap in an authoritarian world to imagine that the day will come when citizens will be required to carry a smartphone in order to participate in public activities. Citizenship at the price of an ankle braclet.

What is to become of those of us who refuse to carry a smartphone?  

The smartphone was designed to monetize the details of a person's private life (his location, his purchases, his social connections, his communications, etc.) for the benefit of surveillance capitalists seeking to modify and control his behavior in the service their own economic interests.

Participation in a free society should never be predicated upon an individual being forced to use such technology against his will."
2020-04-17 18:30:28,Can someone give me evidence that France has shown extraordinary devotion to individual rights? I certainly don't see it in their heavy use of police powers.
2020-04-17 16:02:05,"France like several western countries has several restrictions on civil liberties that we might take for granted say in the US but they are selective. For example, Muslim women cannot wear a hijab in many places or a burkini to a beach ( I doubt if a French nun went to a beach she would have to take off her habit). France and several other European countries have restrictions on names people can give their children. And there is the ubiquitous passport check in European hotels."
2020-04-17 21:44:01,"“It has to do with French history and a sensitivity to freedom that is inherent to French culture""

And people in South Korea aren't sensitive to freedom? Clue: they are. They're also doing better than pretty much everywhere else right, because they sensibly understand that having e-tracking of people who have the virus isn't an attack on their freedom. It's a necessary and exceptional and extraordinary response to an exceptional and extraordinary threat. If you think e-tracking is bad, think what prolonged joblessness, poverty, and homelessness does to individual liberty. Because that's what will come if people in western countries continue to fret and agonize about having to sit on a couch for 4 weeks or have their phone tracked for the sake of curving a deadly global pandemic.  It is, liberté, égalité, ET fraternité, non?"
2020-04-17 21:02:54,"Being French, having lived in many different countries  I  feel  that many people outside France do not understand our  attitude. We hate the Sate for restricting our liberties (ID cards, police controls and so on) but we love it for safeguarding it against other threats such as religious extremism (Islamist or Christian). People in France are willing to give up some of their freedom for the sake of the community but they want to make sure that they get it back as soon as this sacrifice is no longer needed. This makes sense in my view."
2020-04-17 17:15:03,"Are there places on this planet where someone would not hold on to his freedom? Freedom can be weighed against health and basic necessities, but only when there is no other solution. French culture? I don't believe, just we are sensitive to it, maybe more than others sometimes. But what is not tolerated is that these tracking tools will be operated from Android, IOS, etc. and we all know that our rules are being trampled on by American companies. Confidentiality only applies in the USA to Trump's taxes! We know that your companies are capable of monetizing the misfortune of others, without any regret. Amazon was convicted for endangering the health of its employees a few days ago. The answer? job blackmail, as usual. So to be clear: it is not tracking that we refuse, it is the absence of a guarantee that American imperialism will be defeated. And make no mistake: I loved the USA, they made me dream ... long ago! before I feel betrayed."
2020-04-17 16:41:53,"As far as I am concerned, this is all an immense smokescreen to try to conceal a far more serious aspect in the fight against Covid-19 in France.  President Macron's apparent lack of enthusiasm for mandatory widespread testing BEFORE the end of the lackdown is a major mistake with potentially lethal consequences and backsliding in the months ahead.  Unfortunately it all probably boils down to a dearth of reliable tests which are reserved for those who display symptoms.  Fear and loathing and the gnashing of teeth for the rest of us condemned to taking public transport in France as well as getting exposed to the general public in the retail trade."

2020-04-17 17:17:00,"It  is encouraging that the French at least are recognizing that public hearth defined in terms of how many get sick or die from the virus is  not the only value that deserves to be honored in the pandemic response. We have failed utterly to consider trade offs among and between significant national values . We have let one voice prevail when we should have multiple voices at the table. in our tunnel vision approach to the virus based almost entirely on the perspectives of the public health community and the political leaders who have to face a public that seems to have forgotten that saving jobs is a high moral objective. We have paid a terrible price in our economy and the values like education and equal opportunity that it supports by letting the single value of the  public health community dominate both the national discourse and national policy. I predict that some time in the future we will realize our mistake and be forced to ask the question ""What were we thinking?"""
2020-04-17 23:45:16,"For some reason, many people do not appreciate the seriousness of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Personal freedoms are central to liberal democracies and the benefits of open societies. But, personal freedoms are difficult to exercise, if the citizen who is afforded those rights, can’t benefit from them because they are DEAD!

When existential circumstances are present, people must recognize that social interactions in the presence of a dangerous, and in the case of people at special risk because of age-related and other sources of comorbidity, and sometimes lethal virus, must change.

Even long-standing traditions must be diminished if they further the transmission dynamics of the disease. When such traditions don’t change, catastrophic consequences follow. For example, Ebola epidemics continues to rage through the larger population because the tradition of washing the corpse before burial maintained one of the primary routes of transmission between the deceased, who were still very infectious, and the family and friends. The result was that whole villages were wiped out, and Ebola often spread to neighboring villages and towns."
2020-04-17 18:31:32,"The world is moving toward the fascism with the fear as the main activator. The global lockdown is not better than the tracking technology in terms of limiting the personal freedom to move, to assemble and to do business. Whether the lockdown or the tracking tech, the new corona-fascism is above us. Don't forget how Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party used the fear of the communism and the conspiracy theories to get their absolute power at 1933. The history is repeating now but with different kinds of fear. Those who advocate the lockdown or those who advocate the tracking technology are the enemy of democracy and liable for the destrcution of the free world."

Those who oppose contact tracing technology naively believe we still have personal privacy. I will gladly hand over any personal data the government may want if it gets me out of the house.

2020-04-18 00:13:28,"Maybe I'm missing something, but an app that notifies ""virtual"" contacts seems useless. ""Contact tracing"" is NOT possible in crowded cities like NYC. Even if there was some technological solution to notify people who may have come in contact with a positive case, anyone who rides the subway would be getting notified constantly, especially taking into account that the viral particles can potentially hang in the air such that persons getting into a given subway car after a person has exited could be exposed. Let's stop pretending ""contract tracing"" is possible at the point we are at, where this virus is endemic in the city. We need other solutoins."

The hate speech laws overstep civil liberties because who decides what is hate speech?  Just like the pampered students on campuses who deny others the right to speak because their ideas differ.  The way to counter ideas that are disagreeable are with stronger arguments.  The pen (or tongue) is mightier than the sword, no?
Just look at the French bureaucracy! The amount of information required to do anything is Big Brother.

In HK, digital tracking doesn’t impose on healthy ordinary people. Those wearing tracking bands were returned from overseas. I did not download any app for the purpose of tracking infected people.

Hey the point here is to save lives and fix a broken system.

For the Singapore-style tracing technology to work, users must VOLUNTARILY 

1) install the tracing app on their phones, 

AND

2) report being sick with COVID-19

AND THEN

3) release - anoymous - tracking data stored on their phones.

Some individuals will do all of the above, others may do none. It's up to every person, without any compulsion. 

The reason it seems to work in South Korea and Singapore is that people are more community-oriented than we are here in the US. Asians in general place less emphasis on the individual than on the community. So, they don't mind giving up a little information about themselves - really just locations, which, as someone else mentioned, are already tracked by Google and cohorts anyway  - in order to save the country from the pandemic. And it works.

All the while the West is debating whether asking people to - voluntarily! - use the same, effective tracing technology to gain the upper hand on this pandemic might offend the constitutional sensitivities of some. And we prefer sinking into an economic depression rather than give up just a tiny bit of anonymous information about ourselves.

The other side of the coin is contact tracing. A large army of tracers would be needed in urban areas in the midst of a large outbreak. However, big states like NY  are already in debt. Then the French and Asian approach of digital contact tracing is necessary.  Israel has found this also effective is isolating infected contacts . Google already has an app for a map location of where the phone has been. Police already have this access with a court order.  People say this invades privacy issues. However, it could be optional on the cell phone or mandatory like an amber alert or weather alert. It should be removable for the 2-3 months it may be necessary. People dont have to wear masks in NYC but a business doesnt have to admit them either if they post a sign.

For that matter, it’s high time the USA made illegal the current widespread misuse of Social Security’s numbering system as some sort of de facto national ID number. The SSN was never meant to be a “national ID” — its only intended purpose is for tracking deposits into, and eligibility for, Social Security funds.

No one but your US employer should be asking for your SSN: not the cops, not your doctor, not the credit card company, no one but your employer. And you shouldn’t hand out your SSN to just anyone. Hospitals, which in the last few decades have absurdly begun insisting on issuing social security numbers to infants at birth, should cease this coercive act — an SSN should be issued only to people who’ve reached employment age, as was the practice up through the 1970s and 1980s. If a hospital tries issuing your newborn an SSN, refuse, as is your — and your newborn’s — right.

National ID numbers are the beginning of the end. The USA has long stood against universal branding schemes, yet businesses and other organizations have been gradually normalizing the use of the SSN as a sort of identifying brand for decades.

This would require the establishment of a second government type system and be under the total control of those who directly pay for this service - those who use the roads and need a better system which costs less as the good road would result in far lower maintenance costs for vehicles. Similarly, this new virus protection database would have to be under a separate group to which no group or person in the regular government systems could have direct access.

2020-04-17 21:10:43,"Is this shaming?  While some of these examples are ridiculous.  It is very appropriate to point out when people are putting others at risk.

Quite frankly, Facebook and Twitter and their groupie fans alike spread more damaging language, misinformation, and outright lies.  Social media should be a safe place for sharing, not a birthplace of lies.  

All of us should be careful when venturing out to get the necessities of life as the CDC informs us. 

We should not use social media platforms as a weapon of demeanor toward others."
2020-04-18 16:21:59,"I have a question for Carrie Doyle:
Would she have posted the same rant if the person wasn't famous - if it was just someone she knew in town in the same situation? I suspect this story only exists because George is famous. 

I saw George that same day, walking his dogs on the beach by the golf course. I was aware of his wife's status and instantly thought to myself, ""Oh, I hope he's okay.""
I don't know the circumstances that drove George to the pharmacy that day, but I do know that no one wants to be a person waiting to pick up medications to treat this virus. Perhaps the wait time for delivery was too long? Perhaps as a famous person, he avoids delivery because of his notoriety. I'm sure we've all been around people who have been exposed, but of course, we don't know that. We only know George's status because he's famous and recognizable. But famous or not, it's all of our responsibility to take care of ourselves.

The energy Carrie spent ranting about George could have accomplished something more positive rather just getting attention for herself with her celebrity shaming. 

I hope for more compassion in a world dominated by angry divisiveness. I fear there is a growing appetite to demolish the boundaries of civility."
2020-04-18 17:19:22,Why was she in the pharmacy?  Is there a different rule for her than for George Stephanopolus? Does she work there?
2020-04-18 17:53:16,"Coronavirus shaming on social media justified as “venting” is just spreading animosity. Find something better to do with your time. Maybe watch SGN with John Krasinski. 
As for the people sharing a villa in Mexico, posting pictures of themselves embracing in a pool and captioned making the best out of the worst. They seem to have no idea how obnoxious this is. People are losing their jobs. They are waiting in lines for food distribution. People in health care and hospitals are working their tails off and many have not been able to see their families for weeks. So, IMO, it is this type of social media post, the self indulgent and insensitive, that is the worst of the worst."

There is no law that says you can't walk across a golf course without a mask. If you are in a store, doctor's office or a crowd, officially yes.

I don't know what is worse, the sycophants who have nothing better to do with their time then try to catch people without a mask or the people that write about and print it."
2020-04-18 15:23:57,I am very familiar with those famous last words “ oh but my pet would never bite you “ so I guess that’s why I have moved beyond anger at the people who don’t think the rules apply to them and simply change my behavior to distance myself and those I am responsible for from them.

2020-04-18 18:12:30,"I live in a city where we have a beautiful ravine system. I walk my dog in it every day (as I've always done). I try to go extra early or extra late in the day to avoid the number of people filling it because of the pandemic. Approx 80% behave, like me, accordingly: physical distance of at least 6', face covering etc. The other 20% (mostly young couples, bikers & joggers) act like it's just another April in Toronto. I've taken to holding out my hiking pole to create *space* when I see people approaching who haven't altered their trajectory - which makes me look like a crazy person, but whatever. Here's what I want to shout out to this 20%: ""Consider that I might have the virus and can get YOU infected!!! Distance protects BOTH OF US!"". And yet I mostly stay silent and shake my head."
2020-04-18 17:23:30,So now anyone who walks in the park has to wear a scarlet letter.  Sounds like a bit of overkill.
2020-04-18 16:24:46,"I thought social distancing guidelines were put into place to protect us from those who might be positive- if you're six feet away, wash your hands and surfaces and refrain from touching your face you're likely to not contract the virus from an asymptomatic or symptomatic carrier.  In that case, what George Stephanopolous did was appropriate; he wore a mask and gloves in a pharmacy, and took a walk on a lone golf course. We're deluding ourselves into believing we can completely isolate from this virus; that being said, those who act with poor social distancing behaviors and/or take advantage of their status and wealth to flaunt the rules are irresponsible..as for the public shamers, that to me is worse then the crime- who do you think you are?"
2020-04-18 15:31:26,"This is sanctimonious, smug behavior. I'm no fan of George Stephanopoulos but the man was at a pharmacy (an essential service) for his wife, wearing gloves and a mask. And you shamed him because he didn't choose delivery? It sounds like Carrie Wentworth is running out of things to occupy her time."
2020-04-18 15:11:21,"As a lifelong student of psychology, this makes me think that in reality, these two opposite extremes: the people who defy stay at home orders and will picket with guns at the state capitals and snub others while at the beach and in congregations of people are really no different than the others who hoarde, publicly shame and then react aggressively to those they see breaking the rules. All of these people have the same problem. They dwell in the fringes, the edges of extreme. It's the same poison, each side, far right/far left just calls it a different name. Same dysfunction."
2020-04-19 11:07:52,I think the issue here is not shaming. The individuals mentioned have notoriety and some people will look to them for guidance on their behavior. With notoriety comes responsibility. They should know that and monitor their actions and words.
2020-04-19 12:28:11,"Shamers need a perspective shift. First, your risk is completely within your control. Your protective actions-washing hands, masking, staying home, etc are the ONLY definers of your risk profile. That is it. Period. The stay at home and social isolation guidelines are to make 90% of people do the protective thing 90% of the time, thereby decreasing the movement of the virus. It really is ok for George to go for a walk on an empty golf course, because he is not hurting anyone, regardless of his CoVid status. It is ok for George to go to the pharmacy, if he views it as essential, just as it is everyone’s decision to act as they view they need to. Because 90% of the time, he is acting to mitigate the spread of CoVid. The point of this is to slow CoVid down, not get rid of it. We will NOT accomplish that. The point is to follow the rules as much as possible, learn to live within the confines of a more isolated world for the foreseeable future and to keep the virus moving slowly. Not to drive ourselves crazy, not to shame and ridicule the behavior of those whose risk thresholds do not match our own. Remember that your risk is still within your hands, not the other person’s. We can advise and make guidelines, but until we go into a military state with authoritarian enforcement, our choices are still our own, thank goodness. Sadly, the reality is that higher risk populations have to act more cautiously. We all need to accept this in order for our economy to resume."
2020-04-19 12:37:28,"When I encounter people who will not use social distancing , during the rare times I do go out , I start coughing. That usually does the trick."
2020-04-19 13:22:19,"...""The eagerness with which some Americans have embraced authoritarianism""  (so well put Jeton Ademaj) has shaken me to the core. And I can't figure out why every single one of us isn't seeing the fragility of our freedom as each day passes. Completely supporting social distancing makes sense and is the responsible action. However, not everyone is going to comply; this happens in America.  We are beginning to live in a culture where reporting your neighbor's actions is acceptable.  We are turning against one another. This is America, not a totalitarian country (yet). Stop reporting people. We will figure this out without 100% compliance. Giving up freedom and civil liberties will be even more injurious to our health and well-being once the virus is controlled."
2020-04-19 16:35:30,"I live in a Senior Rental building (no services, medical or food.)  The management is fantastic, early on we adopted the guidelines and no one has been ill.  We have several outdoor areas and are only a block from the grocery store.
Several of the men have gotten into the habit of hanging out in the lobby which everyone needs to cross to enter/exit.  It is not large enough for 6 feet of separation and they do not wear masks.  The other day when I walked through their group they were all laughing and one was saying, ""you won't find me with a mask on.""(Thanks Dumbo Trumpo.)  They are defensive and unresponsive if you comment.  I wish the media would emphasize the mask is not to protect yourself (it's not a ""macho - I'm not afraid"" sign); it is to protect the other people near you. Not wearing one is showing utter disregard for your neighbors.  Wishing everyone health.  Thanks."
2020-04-19 17:38:39,"Thank you, it's helpful to hear these stories. But what about
one-way aisles?

More than five weeks ago now it seemed to me that if supermarkets made their aisles one-way only this could
help with social-distancing by minimizing the times one
had to pass by other shoppers.

I left messages and voicemails with local supermarkets and
media outlets with this suggestion, but nary a response.

Coupled with writing down a shopping list to expedite time
in the store and aisle back-ups, I think this makes sense.

Be interested to know if one-way aisles are in effect elsewhere."

Those uneducated people think they know more than they actually do. There arent giant clouds of virus laden droplets just waiting to pounce on you outside... In fact going outside without a mask is a great way to get away from the itchy and scratchy masks. 

One more thing... If you are ""social distancing"" properly then anyone who sneezes or coughs who is nearby and infected will inded spew lots of virus laden droplets into the air. But you should ALSO know that because of how air works around moving objects, the virus laden air will NOT attach to your hair, skin, clothing or otherwise and then infect you .... You move air ahead of you as you walk and this ""bow wave"" pushes other air out of your region as you walk through. Yes, its from a study. Its also called aerodynamics. 

If you want to worry about ANYTHING, worry about your shoes! They track in bacteria to beat the band and as far as Corona? Health care workers who treat corona cases have had their shoes tested and gee guess what? Corona is alive and well on their shoes... Well, for about 30 hours... So have a three pairs of shoes for your work week and you are safe... Change every 30 hours. Same pairs can be swapped out  unwashed all week...

The only individuals who should preempt all others are any individuals directly involved with the medical care of coronavirus patients from janitors, EMT workers, nursing home personal, in home care providers, all hospital personnel, etc.  In addition any worker who is considered essential including transit, police and fire, grocery store, delivery personal, any individual involved in food production whether it be in a factory or in the field, building management, sanation, any and all individuals involved in maintaining the minimum level of civilized society.

 As the news reveals many of these individuals are infected due to the heartless conditions they are forced to work in.

A few commenters mentioned foreign countries, and there is a stark comparison. A lot fewer fat people. Universal healthcare. And, most importantly, a feeling of unity. 

Since Reagan, (and really Nixon), all Republican Presidents have tried, quite successfully, to divide the country. Republicans want no change to healthcare, never have.

Then GWB, and dad GHWB, Republicans. 

Then Obama, same as Clinton, liberal SC picks, conservative in most other efforts. (The ACA, was really, “Romneycare.”)

Here’s the kicker, this country has not had a real Democratic President since Jimmy Carter, a one termer. And, before him, LBJ, another one termer.

It saddens me when the Kim's of this new world order can't see the forest for the trees regarding philanthropy and the richest, of which Gates is just one of many.  
Laura Ingram and the rest of the hysterical pundits should be banned from the airwaves -- they -- and I mean those spreading viral paranoia from both right and left -- are our own worst enemies, an intellectual contagion come forth ( see ""1984""), that will bring American exceptionalism to it's bloody knees, as they pander for ratings, increasing their own greedy fortunes, as they poison the atmosphere for those unfortunates susceptible to such   suggestion.  And, I consider myself a conservative.  Long live Bill and Melinda and those too rich to fail who are truly focused on the long view of world pandemics."
2020-04-17 12:05:18,"So markets are up based on an unproven report and Trump's fake ""permission"" on states opening May 1st which isn't happening anywhere? My God they're a heartbeat away from predicting the future based on tossed chicken bones and entrails."
2020-04-17 12:35:46,"Silly article on Amazon.  I am a big Amazon customer and I think they have been doing an outstanding job filling orders as quickly as possible.  Do they come as fast as before the pandemic, no.  Should they come as fast as before, no.  The only people who are confused are the ones who don’t realize were in the middle of a pandemic. Big business is not the enemy here.￼"
2020-04-17 12:59:32,"Even if coronavirus just disappeared tomorrow, the economy isn't going right back to where it was. 22 million people now have to try to play catchup (save and pay down debt) before they can spend like drunken sailors again. The market is higher today than it was just a year and a half ago when Trump closed the government for a couple months. This is way worse than that. I guess that realization comes when a treatment or vaccine comes and people realize nobody is spending like they used to; at least not immediately. It is going to take years."
2020-04-17 13:05:51,Wide spread testing of the virus is clearly the key to a return to some form normal commerce. It is alarming that Trump and his team have no ready answer to this critical piece in the recovery programme. Trump has attempted to shift the recovery process into the hands of the Governors to give him political cover. This is a complete abdication of leadership and most Americans will recognize this tawdry exercise by Trump. And will not forget in November.
2020-04-17 13:29:50,"@Bill Gates If you are that good at devising vaccines, please target Coronavirus next in line after a vaccine against idiocracy; this one is more dangerous on the long term."
2020-04-17 15:27:31,"Let us be reminded that when retail sales numbers for April come out, the market will drop again."
2020-04-17 14:37:02,it's obvious: don't give the virus vaccine to trumpers.
2020-04-17 15:57:39,"Wall Street is as childish as Trump.  It doesn't care a wit about people.  I could understand if it positively responded to a real commitment to testing as a precursor to restarting the economic life of the US.  But no, Wall Street's most recent response is aligned to the false fantasy thinking of Trump and his covey of vampire advisors: Munchin, Wilbur Ross, Larry Kudlow, Mitch McConnell, and the rest of his grotesque crew whose countenance is as hideous as their moral barometer not to mention the wholesale corporate mismanagement and the Feds' loss of independence under Trump.

The financial system is broken.  Wall Street is nothing more than Casino Capitalism.  The lessons of 2008 has been squandered.  Instead of the Fed increasing the interest rates it pandered to ""to calls from the President. Now the Fed is left with no ammunition to fight the crisis. Instead of slowly plugging the deficit and reducing debt, the administration's choice was to increase the debt and juice up the markets squeezing the last drops of energy left.  We need  people at the helm who can run this country responsibly.""

Positive increases in the Dow at this time under this administration is just the howling of the Merchants of Misery.  

There is no good news in the abysmal incompetence of the entire federal mismanagement of this pandemic.  The same chaotic incompetence has derailed the SBA Loans & $1,200.  LOOK at the food bank lines.  We are DOOMED!"
2020-04-17 15:16:37,"The airwaves are owned by the public.   I’ve never understood why the FCC allows Fox to abuse the trust. Ingram,Hannity, Varney et al. are not journalists. They consider themselves entertainers but their type of entertainment is neither amusing nor informative. Why so many people waste their time listening to the garbage these troglodytes spew is one of life’s mysteries."
