2021-02-25 17:27:04,I haven't been to the gym since March of last year. This morning I visited my local LA Fitness to see for myself what precautions were in place. (I'm 70 yo and have been vaccinated already) Firstly your temperature is taken at the front desk and secondly given your own spray bottle of sanitizing spray. Walking thru the gym I saw maybe 40% of users masked and the rest not masked. The 'older' members were the most masked. I'm torn between returning to the gym since I do miss the machines and remaining home using my Resistance Bands and riding my stationary bike for cardio.
2021-02-25 17:28:32,"These outbreaks were due to group classes, not due to working out at a gym. Clearly, a group class, held indoor and that includes people outside of your close associates is high risk. 

Working out at a gym - lifting weights, running in place, or engaged in activity with known associates (e.g., racquetball) is not risky. 

These folks chose to engage in an activity that was high risk. It's not the gym...it's participating in a group class. Folks that do a cycling class with 10 new people every week are asking for trouble."
2021-02-25 17:32:06,"A lot of these smaller gyms and dojos are in small commercial spaces with relatively low ceilings. But the parking lot of one of the big Chicago gyms near where I live is sometimes almost full, so that doesn’t bode well either. I’m not surprised at all they turn out to be Corona hubs, though I feel for the small business owners."
2021-02-25 17:36:17,"Taking temperatures and wiping down equipment is more or less beside the point.   Most people don't have a fever when they're first infectious.  And the disease is mainly airborne. 

People need to wear masks -- surgical masks with mask fitters.  Period. 

And masks need to cover noses.  

If I had a nickel for every time I saw someone with a mask covering only his or her mouth, I'd have a very big pile."
2021-02-25 17:38:29,"I am a type 1 diabetic with heart disease (6X stents and CABG), but I work out 5 days a week.  Pre-pandemic I was an avid tennis player indoors and outdoors playing 15+ hours a week.  Since February 2020, this stopped cold.  I have worn double-masks (including N95) during outdoor exercise - hiking and walking - and I have a virtual trainer with weights and bands and ride a stationary bike.  Nothing is as good as a tennis match or a workout with the trainer at a gym - but I would not even consider visiting either facility without vaccination and the pandemic fully under control."
2021-02-25 17:39:18,"How many church congregations were informed that they could not worship on Sundays or Saturdays because of the potential spread of COVID from singing and being so close together in a closed setting?

It is neither surprising nor shocking that COVID outbreaks in gyms were caused largely because of ""carelessness about masks and symptoms"", not to mention ""heavy breathing during intense physical activity in confined indoor spaces increases chances of transmission, and fitness teachers who shouted exercise instructions to members may also have contributed to the spread.""

Also, why would anyone go to a gym if they experienced any kind of flu-like symptoms, much less if they tested positive in the first place?

Somewhere along the line common sense ceased to exist while the entire country was experiencing heavy volume of positive cases.  It's almost as folks ignored safety precautions or simply assumed they were immune from this virus.

My husband will need a medical procedure because of a life threatening issue but I will not be allowed to be with him or near him when this procedure takes place.  And yet folks are allowed to do whatever in gyms any day of the week."
2021-02-25 17:40:07,"The 43 people had tested positive for COVID, but decided to go to the gym to exercise, and as a result, infected others, should be criminally charged with felonies (not misdemeanors).   This occurred in August - September 2020, well into the pandemic.
One has to wonder how many other people, in other settings, have they infected - co-workers, family, store workers, etc. 
 These people are a menace to the rest of us."
2021-02-25 17:54:38,"I don't have the right words for people-either trainers or gym members who think or know that they might be ill with Covid and yet show up and breathe on people. 
I was exposed just prior to Thanksgiving, tested and told to stay home and not go anywhere for 10 days. I had been happily going to the gym. I stayed home. I did not have it. I returned to my activities. I had , until reading this, guessed that people fudged their quarantining days but not that people who were actively sick would show up and trot around without a mask. 
My gym enforces the masks in common areas. Temperatures are taken. People do not have to wear a mask in the pool which has huge high ceilings and clients are distanced by a variety of rules and procedures. Some people don't wear a mask in the cycling room or the weight rooms. I think this is a mistake and don't go in there. Group classes such as Zumba have been suspended and the gym offers on line classes every day. 
We all want this to be over. Thank you for highlighting this set of circumstances. People who can be proved to have clocked in while they knew they were sick should be suspended, fired and fined."
2021-02-25 18:16:22,"Shocking. I can't think of a place where I don't want to be more than a gym. The enclosed surroundings, the breath patterns of people working out, the attitudes of the muscle heads and ladies who think their looking good trumps the health of other people, the gym owners who have fought with police in order to keep their places open. It all points to a total disregard for public health and safety, and a lack of perspective."
2021-02-25 18:17:09,"It blows my mind that someone with symptoms or a positive test result would feel free to go a gym at all, and then not wear a mask to boot.

They should be prosecuted.

“Among them were 22 people who had gone to the classes on the day they developed their first symptoms of illness, or the day after. Three went to an exercise class on the day they received a positive test result indicating they had been infected, or the day after. In all, 43 gym members who tested positive participated in classes when they were possibly infectious, researchers said.”"
2021-02-25 18:19:41,"I've been going to my local Y since last June with no issues. No group classes, just working out on my own. I haven't heard of any cases being traced back to the Y in my area. It helps that we're pretty rural and isolated. If I ever felt sick I would not go though, that seems selfish. But people could say going to the gym at all is selfish. It's the one thing I do besides go to the work and grocery store, and it's helped my mental and physical health tremendously. When they were shut down I noticed a notable dip in my mental health. 

And no, as a powerlifter who is regularly lifting 100#+ weights, working out at home is no substitution."
2021-02-25 18:21:55,"I used to feel no sympathy for people who did not abide by the guidelines for masking and social distancing, and I even said it wouldn't bother me if they died. It would serve them right.

But, today I watched the video in the Times that shows what goes on in an ICU and what the nurses are living with as they try to help covid patients, and I am sorry I ever felt the way I did. The video was heartbreaking. I could hardly finish it. Dying from covid is a terrible, terrible death, and I do not wish it on anyone. 

I do hope that some of the people who have refused to comply with restrictions would watch the video. It shows an ICU filled, not with the elderly, but with patients in their 40s and 50s. Maybe it should be played for people entering gyms. It could change a few minds."
2021-02-25 18:28:39,"I work out at EQUINOX in NYC had was very happy when they re-opened a few months back, in particular because they put a stringent hygiene plan in place and implemented temperature-checks on all members, upon entrance. However, I've become increasingly annoyed and dismayed at lax masking enforcement. And, while the vast majority of members are respectful, the staff and trainers are some of the worst offenders - barking commands, talking and whooping loudly, allowing their masks to slip while involved in very vigorous aerobic activity..all while we were learning that airborne transmission is the key determinant of infection...I got sick and third of complaining so stopped going. What use are rules if they aren't enforced, particularly by those who should be setting an example?"
2021-02-25 18:34:16,"There are ways to safely go to a gym. These gyms did not take the necessary precautions. I have been going to a climbing gym since the fall, and I have never felt unsafe. Without being able to go to the gym, though, I can say my mental health would not be as okay as it is now. 

Everyone at my gym is required to wear a mask at all times, there are two fans going at all times, and there is a door to outside that's propped open to provide greater ventilation. Additionally, I'm lucky enough to be free around lunch, so there are rarely more than 3 other people there when I go. With those precautions in place, the risk is still there but it's low enough I'm willing to take it. There are ways to go to the gym and be reasonably safe, and gyms should ensure all of those precautions are taken in order for them to avoid outbreaks and stay open."
2021-02-25 18:34:34,"After being a member of the same gym for 30 years, sadly I stopped going and cancelled my membership.  Why?  Because there is no screening and no requirement for wearing masks while working out.  Masks are required in common areas, but it is not enforced at all.  Roughly 5% of members were masking, and anti-mask discussions were not uncommon.  Fox News blared from all the TVs.  I'm happy to have found a new gym where temps are taken, masks are required, and one stays in their own 6-foot square pod.  The positive environment is refreshing."
2021-02-25 18:55:15,"The updated CDC guidance sounds like wishful thinking. 
""Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised fitness centers to take a variety of measures to prevent outbreaks, including enforcing proper mask use and reminding gym and staff members to stay home if they have symptoms of illness or have tested positive for the virus.""

I don't work for the CDC, yet I've known for months that anyone can have and transmit this novel virus, even without symptoms. This article confirms that fact.

I thought that the new administration would stop the magical thinking. Staying at home is really depressing. And yet, it would have been unnecessary, if a proper public health policy and procedures had been implemented in April, 2020."
2021-02-25 18:56:23,"I workout at a gym in Chicago which has gotten lazy about COVID.  I never go at peak hours and only go when the place is empty.  I was there this week - everyone wears masks, but the trainers would bring their clients to lift on machine's right next to me - when the place is empty.  Nobody thinks anymore.  At least everyone there wears a mask all the time. But young people are oblivious and the trainers at the gyms need to be more aware of the six feet rule."
2021-02-25 19:06:51,"My athletic club has a very detailed, very specific set of protocols, very few of which are followed or enforced. The facility seems to be spending their payroll dollars on the dubious practice of constantly wiping down surfaces, but I never see any staff or  managers out of their offices enforcing distancing or mask wearing. Members are allowed to flaunt the rules with no consequences and when i brought these issues up, I am told that staff has grown weary of being cussed out by the offenders. These stories in Honolulu and Chicago don't surprise me in the least and I'm certain they are just the tip of the iceberg. If contact tracing protocols were strictly adhered to, I am certain that fitness facilities would be linked to a huge number of cases. BTW I suspended my membership last fall and won't be going back until I get my second vaccine next week."
2021-02-25 19:10:27,"This is so frustrating to read.  I can't imagine why it would be ok to remove a mask indoors.  I do go to pilates once a week, and I wear a mask.  I don't take it off.  It's uncomfortable, but it's worth it to me to fix my back and shoulders after all the zoom calls.  

We need gyms to be open for mental health: masks are essential for this to work!"
2021-02-25 19:17:12,"Gotta love how Americans rationalize all their favorite activities, none of which drive the spread of Covid yet all of which must have contributed in some way to get us to 30 million cases. And the masks. Originally a backstop for when social distancing isn’t possible, they’ve become fig leaves to cover indiscretions where the distance comes easy if we don’t go there in the first place.

I understand the lockdowns are over now. I’m not pushing for that. But people returning to salons, gyms, parties, nightclubs and restaurants should plan on a bout with the virus as it’s a matter of time in conditions of normal social activity. This means having a caretaker lined up in event of temporary disability, and supplies for an isolation period. And they owe it to mention those sources of exposure risk to the vulnerable people in their lives, and to stay away if asked until the latter are vaccinated."
2021-02-25 19:30:49,"""Among them were 22 people who had gone to the classes on the day they developed their first symptoms of illness, or the day after. Three went to an exercise class on the day they received a positive test result indicating they had been infected, or the day after.""

Those individuals should be charged  and prosecuted. If contract tracing reveals that deaths resulted as a resulting of their depraved indifference to human life,  those responsible should be charge with criminally negligent homicide.

What those individuals did was worse than driving DUI.
as the number  of individuals  who can be killed or injured   by a single individual who drives DUI   is finite, as driving DUI is not contagious. 

How is it that  those who  are caught driving  DUI are charged,
and that those charges include manslaughter if deaths result,
while those who endanger lives  by behaving recklessly in terms of Coronavirus  face no consequences ?

That would not be the case in a number of other countries.
One of the reasons that over 500,000 Americans  have died of COVID-19 is that Americans face no consequences , and Americans KNOW that they will not face consequences.

The decent amongst us would never consider endangering the lives of others. Those who are not  guided by a moral compass must  know that they will face serious consequence, including steep fines and prison  sentences  if they  endanger the lives of others,  just as do  individuals in a number of countries."
2021-02-25 19:39:10,"The comments say it all.  The political divide in our country and the large number of citizens living in a conspiratorial fantasy world is enough to ward you can’t trust the person next to you.

I just visited a new facility after my old gym went out of business. When the enrollment manager introduced me to their personal trainer, I had to tell them that at this point joining was totally aspirational.  In truth, it’s unlikely I’ll start using a gym again before I am fully vaccinated."
2021-02-25 19:41:17,"Gyms in my experience, usually consist of very large rooms, without access to free flowing air. How on earth can these gyms be safe to use in this current crisis with the rapid expansion of mutated forms of the virus, which are highly infectious?

COVID19 is aerosolised and spread throughout these indoor environments. These gyms represent  a stagnant breeding ground for this virus."
2021-02-25 20:09:15,"In fact thousands of people go to gyms all the time (I know because I am one) with so few cases traced back that the real analysis is the opposite of what in inferred by this story. Clearly, gyms are NOT creating a noteworthy risk. Alas that would not provide for a typically useful/clickable story.

In this case some people who were feeling poorly went to the gym anyway, a failure of personal responsibility. Then when some time later a sample too small to generalize with reports illness, a conclusion that is not warranted is drawn. These same people go to supermarkets and other public venues, there is no causal connection worth repeating. The conclusions here are inflammatory presumption, not clear thinking.

What is clear is that for the number of people breathing intently and visiting a place, gyms seem to be the source of very few, and proportionally less cases, than other places. We really do not have an clear idea of where people pick up the virus, or how. It could be more via the hand, or via breathing. Of all places it is gyms where you see people being most scrupulous about washing and cleaning surfaces."
2021-02-25 17:37:10,"I'm very surprised that these gyms are allowing people to take their masks off, especially during a group class. That seems really stupid. At my local gym here in Brooklyn, it's mandatory that everyone wear a mask and everyone complies."
2021-02-25 18:14:48,"Exercise is Vital - but INDOOR exercise is foolish.
Huffing and puffing ... 6 feet isn't nearly enough.
Close the gyms. Take a walk or jog,"
2021-02-25 21:22:47,This occurred last year in the summer. Why is this being disseminated now?
2021-02-25 19:13:26,"People can exercise without gyms, just like they can watch movies without theaters, and eat food without restaurants. The ""I wants"" are killing people. Stick to the ""I needs."" There's a big, big difference."
2021-02-25 20:00:57,"The worst offenders in my experience are the chin maskers. When you point it out, they momentarily pull up the mask to cover the nose, and then it slips again. Owners are reluctant to be too stringent because they don't want to lose clients in an already strained financial environment. Come on people, take some personal responsibility and make exercising a safe outlet for everyone and not just your selfish self."
2021-02-25 17:21:01,"""But clubs are not the primary driver of Covid spread.”
What are the primary drivers of Covid spread? Family visits? Restaurants? Grocery stores? Nail salons? Dentists?
I feel like I never see in the news what is really spreading covid. It seems to me that no-mask-wearing-in-a-closed-space checks all the boxes of covid spreading, CDC guidelines or not."
2021-02-25 17:35:12,"Precautions?  Ha!  Outrageously, the major gym chain in Las Vegas, EOS Fitness, like everywhere else was closed for two months but since it reopened to one & all it is now not only grossly overcrowded but it is running mass-market advertising campaigns trumpeting cheap introductory specials so it can stuff even more members into its questionably-maintained facilities.  The corporate greed of this fitness company right now is absolutely unconscionable."
2021-02-25 18:59:14,"Well go at your own risk but anyone who knows this information which has been out there for months and goes has a devil may care attitude which prolongs the virus, there are gyms outdoors here, wait Chicago spring is on the way, just wait."
2021-02-25 20:32:31,"The main thing I take out of this article is to please, please wear your mask AT ALL TIMES IN THE GYM OR ANYWHERE ELSE.

I get tested at least every 2 weeks (sometimes more frequently) since the pandemic has started and wear a K95 and a fabric mask on top of my K95 every time I go to the gym. I never take it off to drink water or do anything else and never take group classes. I've not once tested positive via PCR. This may seem anecdotal but the difference, at least to me, is that almost everyone (95% of gym goers) at my gym follows the rules and wears a mask and I am never at the gym without two masks on.

If you're not going to agree to the rules of the gym (or any other place), don't bother showing up in the first place. 11 people went when they felt sick? 3 people knew they were positive and still went? What is wrong with people?!?

The lesson from this article isn't that gyms spread the virus more than other places, it's that people who don't care will spread the virus anywhere and everywhere they go. A gym just happens to be one place where you are near people for a long amount of time. It's the same thing with restaurants. Of course the virus will spread in restaurants (inside) where no one wears a mask while they eat. Of course the virus will spread inside the gym if no one is wearing a mask, especially  if people are going out knowing they are sick, or worse, COVID positive!

Use common sense. Wear a mask and stay home if you're sick. It's not hard."
2021-02-25 22:43:40,Gyms need to be better ventilated and keeping the number of occupancy better managed.
2021-02-25 17:46:42,"A Crunch Fitness in our area has been operating indoors all these months... I see lots of cars when I visit that plaza... Nothing outdoors... I stopped going to our local Community Center for classes even now that they are outdoors as you don't have to wear a mask... I run/walk w/a mask everyday, it can be done...  And by the way, the CA businesses who are suing say Newsom in CA, wonder why they are still closed... Maybe it's because of the completely irresponsible businesses like these fitness centers and others and customers who frequent them who are to blame..."
2021-02-25 18:56:37,"I can't believe we're still arguing about this after a year of it.  People are no different now then, still making up reasons why they must go to the gym, the stylist, the church, the bar, the mall, the restaurant, the BBQ, the wedding reception, et al, because their ""needs"" are somehow different than that of others'.   Always explaining why the measures they're taking are good enough (they aren't).  There's no point in arguing with them, or trying to reason with them.  

Half a million people dead so far in our country, with another 100 thousand predicted by June.  Party on."
2021-02-25 19:06:44,"After reading this article last night I shared the findings with the manager at my local planet fitness.
And while they no longer do classes I do see enough people cheating by wearing the mask below their nose.
Every once in a while the staff actually goes around and remind people to pull up their mask.
Interestingly, she said to me it’s mainly the older folks that are giving her a hard time about the mask and their breathing.
I too struggle at times and allow myself the quick breath that I’m able to get when I take a sip of water.
It would be a shame for The selfish small percent of people that do not obey the rules to get the gyms shut down again.
People need to be compliant and those members that do not comply need to have their membership revoked.￼￼￼"
2021-02-25 20:25:55,"Keeping places closed where irresponsible, or unknowing, people can easily spread the virus is essential. Sure you can blame it on an individual being ""bad"" afterwards, but some individuals will do that, and the virus is still spread."
2021-02-25 20:49:49,"I am lucky enough to be able to manage 2 gym memberships (one near home, one near office).  I am mid-thirties, and work-out 5-6 times per week. The biggest offenders of mask compliance are people aged 20-40 who work out a lot (all races, all sexes). 

I have complained to Lifetime Fitness extensively about the overwhelming number of people for who fabric engineering is a science too extreme. Grown fools playing little rascals games with masks below noses and such.

It is just so disheartening that our society has so few standards for public behavior. Lifetime proclaims itself the ""healthy way of life company"", but that is too grandiose a self-titling. They will enforce no standards if it means they may loose a membership. Seems like most other gyms feel the same."

Each time the culprit is quickly confronted by a courteous staff member, who reminds them to comply.  Most do.  Those who do not are politely shown the exit, and only a tiny number to date have required a local (but quiet) police escort."
2021-02-25 18:53:55,Yet gyms were open and schools were closed. America needs to get its priorities right.
2021-02-26 02:26:09,So this says that people who were positive attended classes then spread it. Couldn’t that happen with any occupation?  I don’t see that this says anything specifically about gyms—only that infected people knowingly participated when they shouldn’t have and then spread it.  Any occupation that includes face to face interaction could have the same effect. Lay off gyms—the fit and healthy have the best chance of fighting COVID without medical intervention.
2021-02-26 05:48:49,"In gyms or anywhere else, treat your PPE as if your life depends on it. As articles like this show, you can't count on others. 

I wear a KN95 over a true NIOSH N95 at my gym and in hot room yoga classes. I assume those areas are contaminated and rely on excellent PPE to keep me safe, just as medical personnel in Covid wards rely on PPE to keep them safe. If you're going to go to places where people may be infected (just about anywhere), you need to protect yourself. If more people had this attitude, I think mask compliance and (just as important) mask quality/fit would go way up.

And by the way, medical quality N95s can now be easily purchased for about 3 dollars per mask. These can be reused if you are careful. I rotate through a set of 25 N95s. I put cheaper KN95s ($1/each) or medical-grade surgical masks (59 cents/each) over them and throw those out after each use. It's a small investment for safety."
2021-02-26 12:48:50,"As a runner I thoroughly enjoyed spinning classes at my gym; not only for the aerobic benefit but also for the camaraderie among the members. When the pandemic hit I suspended my membership and began working out regularly on my Schwinn Air Dyne bicycle; which is a much tougher workout than spinning and I bought a set of bowflex dumbbells. I am actually in better shape now than before the pandemic.  I would love to go back to the gym but even after my second vaccination I am leery. Of course you can catch covid in the grocery store, a restaurant, etc. But being in a room, even with social distancing, with people breathing heavily and some not wearing their masks properly still gives me pause."
2021-02-26 04:54:20,"When people attend gym classes who currently have symptoms, have been tested for Covid and are waiting for their results, or have even tested positive, no wonder infections spread, when everyone is breathing deeply while exercising.  Such irresponsible behaviour!"
2021-02-26 15:50:30,"I'm confident that anyone who was wearing a properly fitting N95 mask in the exercise classes mentioned in this article would not have gotten the virus. Transmission occurs when people don't wear good masks, don't wear good masks properly, and/or cheat by moving their masks below their noses or taking sips of water. If you're going to put yourself in these high risk situations, wear professional grade PPE, wear it properly (just like medical personnel), and commit to not removing your mask for any reason (e.g. to drink) until you are out of harm's way."
2021-02-26 15:23:41,"I hate to agree with an industry shill, but going to gyms has not been shown to be particulary risky.  Going to exercise classes, on the other hand, has been shown to contribute to Covid transmission.  
Please, NYT, tell your headline writers to distinguish between the two.
I have not seen any evidence that working out alone in a well-ventilated, well-cleaned gym with mask requirements (enforced) and capacity limitations is any more risky than going to the grocery store."
2021-02-26 15:29:15,"Maybe they got covid from breathing in their germs in their mask and touching their masks (after touching weights, machines, etc.) to constantly adjust while exercising. 

I, along with many I know, will not be returning to gyms until the mask requirements are GONE. I firmly believe they are dangerous during exercise and running, as they reduce your cardiopulmonary capacity, increase breathing resistance, and increase the already present negative effect of inhaling microplastics. No thank you. 

Exercising in masks is ludicrous, and the WHO recommends to not wear masks during exercise. I will never give up my freedom to run freely."

2021-02-16 12:07:35,This is a deeply moving story about the devastation caused by COVID and the mysterious complication of MIS-C in seemingly healthy children. How unfair life can seem to parents when their children suddenly get ill and despite extensive treatments in tertiary care hospital ICUs still die! It shows how much is still unknown about this virus and the complex reactions of our immune systems to it. Hopefully science will continue to learn more about this and in the future have even better treatments. But nothing will take away the pain of parents over their loss and their realization of how precious and fragile life truly is.
2021-02-16 12:14:44,"Hmm. Thank you for this article. I know of strange cases.

First is the 8-year old son of a friend of mine. That kid had some serious flu a few months ago. Soon after, he became so scared that he washes his face and hands 20 times a day today. As you can imagine, he doesn't look healthy. Other than that, he's a fine boy, funny, calm, yet Corona somehow got to him, and it is currently impossible to change that. Nice parents too. A biologist, and a teacher.

Second is a 27-year old co-worker, a sound designer, who went to the hospital for 1 month because of Corona. Soon after, he developed that weird Corona-syndrome, as they call it: He was unable to walk, to read books or even chat messages; he had serious trouble to even pay attention to TV or any film. But 3-4 months later, he feels better. Yet it remains unclear what it is, or was, and his doctors generally believe that is was ""just"" a depression.

When my daughter, 9, got sick recently, my son, 6, started to cry when he saw her sleeping during the day, being unable to talk or play with him as usual. When I talked to him, he said that he is afraid that she might die because of Corona. He knows that Corona is curable but he also knows, he said, that Corona can cause death, so he does not want his sister to die, right? And I thought: Who knows how those Corona years (s) will fell to our children in 10 years."
2021-02-16 12:21:32,"""The latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 2,060 cases in 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, including 30 deaths.""

Meanwhile, from the CDC: 
""Unintentional injuries—such as those caused by burns, drowning, falls, poisoning and road traffic—are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children in the United States. Each year, among those 0 to 19 years of age, more than 12,000 people die from unintentional injuries.""

I'd like to see more articles on the 400 times as many kids who die from injuries every single year."
2021-02-16 12:26:59,"This awful virus.  I step back from this article knowing that some commenters are going to focus on the losses of kids, but many more will kick into gear about the danger angle— and how this syndrome is a sign that kids shouldn’t be in school.  And then other commenters will come back with statistics on how this syndrome is rare while bad remote-school outcomes are common.  

Meanwhile the clinicians at children’s hospitals will go on having to see these cases—and add each one to the pile to send to scientists. Who, somewhere, are furiously trying to make sense of these inputs, searching for better treatments, searching for prevention clues. Could a kids’ Covid vaccine be tweaked to get ahead of whatever this is? We are still testing just the base Covid vaccine for pediatric populations.... And meanwhile, the virus just keeps on rolling. It’s a feature of nature. Programmed to spread, without consciousness of individual lives lost or families wrecked, much less all our “rock and a hard place” education system debates, and all the political, economic, social fallout. 

Go science go"
2021-02-16 12:33:41,"A moving article with both anecdotes (devastating ones) and some data about how rare this syndrome is, especially over the course of what amounts to two seasons.  
Some context would help with the fear this article causes, I believe. In the 2028-2019 flu season, there were over 46,000 hospitalizations in the 0-17 age range, and 477 tragic deaths."
2021-02-16 12:37:30,"A bit more context that helps me measure my anxiety about this as it concerns my own kids: this syndrome has killed 20 kids in a year.  Car accidents kill about 600 kids per year in the US.  So, a child is 30 times more likely to die in a car accident than of this syndrome.  Or, your child could live through 30 years of ongoing Covid pandemic before his/her risk of dying would equal that of using a car for one year."
2021-02-16 12:39:02,"I am horrified and terrified by the potential for serious adverse events from a pediatric Covid infection. 

My 18-year old son's friends ask him, ""is your mom still freaked out by Covid?"" They don't seem to believe they are at risk. Their families allow the kids to socialize in pods, believing that there is some form of relative safety. I feel it's only a matter of time before one of these kids introduces an infection to their pod and then it spreads like wildfire to all of the families. But none of them see it.

We don't go anywhere and we're staying healthy. But the mental toll is astounding. My son, a ""virtual"" freshman at an incredibly expensive private college, is becoming more and more depressed. His grades are declining, but there's no accounting for the toll of his mental health. How much longer can the kids function this way?"

They operate still in a factory setting with multiple patients in the same room simultaneously.

My orthodontist sees 3 patients at a time in one room currently staggering when they enter and leave but they're in the chairs 6 feet apart masks off for 30 min to an hour indoors together. My next appointment was supposed to be an hour long so I haven't been in over a year."
2021-02-16 13:23:42,"My heart sank when I saw young Braden Wilson's picture; his loss and the other children's in this article is devastating to the entire community. I am a little confused by the article, however; in the beginning, we read that he rarely left the house. Then, we read that he had yoga and swimming classes. I am astonished that swimming pools are open during this pandemic. (They were largely closed during the polio years.) If we must have our children in schools, we still have a duty to limit their exposure in non-essential venues like gymnasia and pools. My heart grieves for his family and the others. If our elected officials don't have the guts to create a stay-safe policy of closing infection-generating public spaces, we will lose more children. It really is that simple."
2021-02-16 13:30:55,"I am in tears for these children. 
As a mom of four, I cannot imagine, or maybe all too well can imagine the grief. 
What really burns me is the fact that people keep saying children won’t get it, when the real facts are that we pulled our kids out of school for nearly a year now. Can any parent honestly tell me that they haven’t had a child get sick at school and spread that to the whole family?
 The one good thing about 2020 is that I was not sick a single day after the schools closed. My kids brought home every single virus that was going around and shared it with us all. Our schools are still closed and I haven’t even had the usual winter sniffles. 
 I read the article about schools reopening, but I think maybe those experts don’t understand that little children don’t know how to socially separate. This sad article has a story of a boy who wasn’t back in school and still caught the virus, and then died from complications. 
  The reason more kids haven’t died or contracted Covid19 is simple. We have protected them by closing the schools. Please, please world, can we please just wait? I am not looking forward to seeing any more children die, because that’s exactly what I believe will happen if we open schools again now."
2021-02-16 13:54:45,"Dear Ms.Wilson,

2021-02-16 13:59:28,There was a theory suggested at one time that exposure to the common cold was protecting children from COVID 19.  But common cold immunity is not long lasting.  A worrisome possibility is that closing schools and other protection for children could be reducing exposure to common cold and thereby increasing their risk for COVID and increasing its severity for them.

Key point - quote from an expert ""We really don’t know”.   I work in STEM, how do Scientist go to the press with this?  

Key point - Impact on Latin and Black people are socio-economic.   So why don't we use economic stats instead of race?  The Child in the picture is WASP, and the stats on COVID in most countries skew to the low end of the economic scale.  

The last point I find disturbing, Why does the Democratic Establishment fear  any analysis that points to Economic Disparity of all Americans?

Example - Wouldn't a Real Health Care, instead of a health mandate be a better answer for many of these problems?"

He had severe headaches and body aches.  My son is skinny and a track runner btw.   After he recovered he still had aching in the chest area for weeks...

I think people are not expecting kids to get so sick, because as usual they are downplaying the internal unknowns of this disease.  When I took my son to the hospital for lingering chest pain, the pediatrician acted like I was wasting her time.  That may be part of the issue..."

Perhaps comparing the statistics of death from this virus to youth sports would be useful... or reporting on the number of children who are killed while playing in their yards."

This is an article meant to call attention specifically to the growing number of children experiencing the more drastic effects of Covid-19 up to and including tragic death. It's devastating and scary. We can look up context on our own if that is comforting. We can also take in this specific information and feel for these people.

President Biden should also work with international agencies (such as WHO) and our allies to ensure that vaccines are distributed to poor countries around the world.  We must eliminate COVID across the globe.  Otherwise, COVID will just come back next year.

There is a microscopic chance students or teachers will die from COVID-19. What about the long term effects of not educating kids properly?

We do not know what we do not know yet so we should err on the side of extreme caution and give these kids the protection they need and deserve.

The truth is that covid is not a death or nothing situation. Multiple studies have found that well over half of people with covid have ongoing evidence of damage to the heart and lungs months after infection. Perhaps most alarmingly, the incidence of harm doesn't seem to correlate to severity of disease."

Please wear a high filtration mask like an FDA approved KN-95 or a KF-94 or a surgical mask under a cloth mask or a well constructed cloth mask with a viral filter. Don’t share air. Ask your school to check steady state carbon dioxide levels in classrooms and open windows accordingly. Keep CO2 less than 700 ppm.

It was the sickest I’ve ever seen him and if you’re a parent, you have seen some sickness by age 14.  The dry cough persisted for over one month  (I demanded antibiotics due to possible pneumonia) and he has never been the same since.  He cannot even walk up stairs without slumping over. He began to show vascular changes in his legs. In September I took him to children’s in Boston. It’s been too long to show traceable antibodies. He has been seen by Dana Farber (neutropenia), a rheumatologist, an immunologist and now they think it’s interstitial lung disease (which CAN occur after a bad viral illness but is rare).  So, now my child who had mild asthma, is losing weight (only 99 lbs at 5’9”).  We are living in a bubble over here with his younger brother hoping we don’t get covid again or for the first time because we have no idea what that was in March.  Please wish me luck.  This whole thing is no joke. We really don’t know the long term affects of Covid. The only provider who brought up the possibility of covid was the cardiologist, it hasn’t really been on anyone’s radar.  And just yesterday the car mechanic we saw was not wearing a mask. I don’t get it."
2021-02-16 14:59:12,"I’m a new father and this article broke my heart. It also made me question whether we are rushing to bring children back to school, when there seems to be evidence of serious risk."
2021-02-16 15:00:13,"While this syndrome is definitely scary, I don't think this is a reason for schools to remain closed.  I still feel like the benefits of attending in-person school outweigh the risks.  It seems like the precautions they are taking in the schools are working in many places.  My children attend pre-k and kindergarten at the same school and they have become ill FAR less than in years past with the mask wearing, teaching of hygiene etc.  Further, there have been no instances of transmission of COVID in the school and they have been able to stay open, which is remarkable!  My child has special needs and recently was given an IEP.  His testing was delayed nearly a year because of COVID and if he had to wait another year due to remote school I strongly suspect he would have fallen behind and the chances of a poor outcome would have increased exponentially.  While he is far ahead of his peers academically, he has emotional and behavior issues and really needs the in-person interactions with neuro-typical children and teachers.   Even if the schools can give therapy and individual attention, it's just not the same via Zoom.  I think that the social and emotional needs of children have often been overlooked during this pandemic, and going to school is important for that and many other reasons."
2021-02-16 15:04:33,"This is heartbreaking, but it’s disconcerting to see commenters using it to argue that schools should be closed.

To do that, one would have to show that a child’s risk of catching the virus is greater in school than out of school. We have a great deal of research now that shows that when schools take basic precautions, that is not the case. Children are most likely to catch it out of school and from close contacts.

This so why so many infectious disease experts are saying kids are safer when in school. School environments can be controlled and support kids’ health in other critical ways."
2021-02-16 15:08:16,"Heartbreaking.  Thank you for just telling the stories of these young people who have been made invisible.  

I have mainly read or heard about the young people who are depressed and dealing with anxiety because they can't go to school to get out of the house in order to hang out with their friends at school and play sports.  Then there is the concern about arbitrary ""learning loss"" that is usually measured by some standardized test.  Not to dismiss the suffering of young people who are suffering being stuck in the house with their parents.

The young people in this article remind us that we are in a pandemic.  We don't want anyone to suffer from mental illness, but we don't want any young person to suffer from mental illness due to life-debilitating illness.  And, we certainly don't want our young people to but put in a position where they could end up dead because pandemic precautions are inconvenient.

I, for one, am appalled."
2021-02-16 15:58:39,"For decades those of us who cared for the sickest children were aware of Mucocutaneous Lymph node Syndrome or Kawasaki Syndrome.
MIS following a Covid 19 infection mimics many signs, symptoms and laboratory abnormalities as MCLN and the treatments for both are similar.
The most rational explanation for both is that following some infections a ""Super Antigen"" is formed that stimulates a life threatening uncontrolled immune response.
The Swedes recently published in the NEJM their experience with morbidity in school children who attended grade schools when the epidemic was uncontrolled in Sweden.
MIS was very rare with fifteen children affected out of almost two million children who attended school but it accounted for almost all of the ICU admissions of children post Covid 19 infection.
Incidentally, nineteen per 100,000 school teachers were admitted for severe Covid 19 disease.
It seems schools can be opened and relatively safe if masking and other public health measures are enforced."
2021-02-16 15:59:44,"This story is heart-breaking. Aside from getting this pandemic under control, I hope we fund research labs to learn more about how the virus works.

Our health care workers have been pushed to the brink with little federal support."

COVID-19's long asymptomatic spread is sheer genius.  Being more lethal than influenza but much less deadly than Ebola and HIV/ AIDS which are also much less contagious.

COVID-19 could follow the symptomatic spread of the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold.  Becoming less lethal and preventable but treatable by safe and effective therapeutic treatments. Becoming an epidemic then an endemic."

2021-02-16 13:30:32,"I see people have already started piling up rebuttals with stats from other diseases children die from, like it's some kind of infanticidal Olympics. That's not what this article is about, and, for the record, it doesn't posit that Covid-19 is an exceptionally deadly childhood disease. What it attempts to do is to advance a more nuanced view of this pandemic, and nuance is always met with resistance on the part of population that detests fine print. For a long time the simplistic messaging about Covid-19 has been that children are the least affected age group, with low infection and high recovery rates. Many people took that to mean that children were impervious to this disease altogether. And behave accordingly. Enter a case from New York, where a 3-year old was sent to an unlicensed group babysitter after an older sibling tested positive for Covid-19 (qRT-PCR). The 3-year was in fact an asymptomatic carrier, who then infected the babysitter and 3 children in that group. One of those, a 2-year old, ended up in ICU, but not before infecting a parent and an older sibling (both mildly symptomatic). Similar scenarios played out with other clients of this babysitter, with total number of infected people reaching 12, 4 needed hospitalization (including 2 adults). The reconstructed infection chain confirmed by NGS (Illumina) sequencing of viral samples (all belonging to the same ""UK"" B.1.1.7 strain). Now the idea of using a group babysitter doesn't look so safe, is it?"

“Since mid-May 2020, CDC has been tracking reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19. MIS-C is a new syndrome, and many questions remain about why some children and adolescents develop it after a COVID-19 illness or contact with someone with COVID-19, while others do not.” - from CDC website."
2021-02-16 15:01:28,"""How did this happen to someone very healthy?""  

Because it is Covid, and while too many think that because 99%+ survive, that is an A+ grade for humanity, rather than a half million deaths in a year.

But it isn't just the deaths: read the numerous articles about long haul survivors, and see if that isn't scary.  Or the athletes who had minimal symptoms but an MRI showed cardiac involvement (perhaps in 1 of 6). Or recent research that shows evidence of stiffer limb arteries than normal suggesting perhaps in the future, the increased cardiac work will produce heart failure sooner.  

The virus can affect just about any organ, it can do so across a huge continuum from asymptomatic damage to death, and we have no idea what the long term consequences will be, not because we are stupid, but because the long term has to occur...well, for many, many years.

For the 99%+ no big deal folks: 99.999996% of all commercial flights in the US in 2001 were not hijacked.  Great job, right?"
2021-02-16 12:59:52,"We are so close to eradicating this virus. We could be done with it within six months if we did things right. Yet all we hear is how awful it is for kids having to be home and learning remotely. Oh, the horrors of isolation (despite FaceTime, Skype, texting, etc.)!! And he’s falling behind in algebra (behind whom, exactly?)!! 

No, nothing is ideal for anybody, of any age, right now. But we can prolong it, or we can act smart and deal with it as it needs to be dealt with. I’m sorry if the pandemic is tough for kids and parents (just as I’m sorry for the elderly cooped up in their rooms). But now is not the time to be opening schools. Now is the time for kids to be getting a different kind of education, one that has the potential to provide them with inner resources that will last them a lifetime. 

Mask up, wash your hands, get the vaccine when available, and stay home as much as humanely possible. Any job or educational experience whatsoever that can be done remotely—even if not ideally—needs to be done so. It’s for a few months out of what could and hopefully will be a very long life. The pain these children and their parents went and are going through, well, weigh that up against staying on track on the educational conveyor belt. Kind of a no-brainer, don’t you think. 

Drop the notion that education is something that can happen exclusively in a classroom. Stay home. Acquire new hobbies. Watch birds. Read. Kick a ball around outside. Zoom. FaceTime. Repeat. And stay well."

2021-02-16 16:23:01,"Schools in red zones should not open.  Kids can infect the staff; but staff is the major source of infection, infecting one another and, in some instances, the kids.

Also, other than Johns Hopkins, which in a preliminary study found no genetic link, there has not been as far as I know a genetic study to determine whether African-Americans are genetically more susceptible to severe COVID.  Many Latinx Americans are bi-racial.  We avoid these issues due to the evils of eugenics - but higher death rates among African-Americans appear to cut across class and health conditions.

Socio-economic inequities are real, racism is real - no argument. So, however, are DNA-related illnesses (breast cancer, e.g.).  If we bypass what is staring us in the face - that African-Americans with COVID get sicker, and die in greater numbers, regardless of socioeconomic class - because we don't want to be labeled racists, or want to opportunistically exploit COVID to advocate for policy change - if we do that, we do a disservice to the very people  who need us the most and whose interests we aim to serve.

Yes, the disease is spreading among non BIPOC kids.  But the impact has indisputably been on African-Americans, and not just those who are blue-collar or poor.  There has to be a genetic factor operating here.  We need to identify that factor and prioritize those who are vulnerable."
2021-02-16 16:41:41,"The inability of the media (particularly influential outlets like the NY Times), to properly communicate relative risk during this pandemic has led to a collective fear based hysteria that has gotten away from us like a runaway train. Data from countries across the world makes it clear that we are underestimating the harms of keeping kids out of school & overplaying the risk to children and their role in transmission. Every childhood death is a tragedy...there is nothing more heart breaking. However, public health policy is based on large population studies, not extremely rare outliers.  More children have die every year from the flu than covid-19. Meningitis used to kill hundreds of young people in the U.S.  every year. Schools were never closed to limit these infectious diseases. Let's make teacher vaccination a priority, but our public health strategy for children cannot be based on the one in a million (or even one in a hundred thousand) tragic outcomes."

I just couldn't wrap my mind around it, Why the Trump administration treated this as a kind of small problem.

Entirely unknown, new disease entered to medicine, the danger until you know all aspects of this infection cannot be played down. 

at this moment we are all discovering a short and acute form of the disease, we do not have any idea yet what are the long-term complications. 

The burden which Covid inflicts on society and medicine is not imaginable yet.

(I have lost a son to heart disease before anyone asks how I'd feel etc) It's important not to be terrified of emotive articles which have thin stats. 40 deaths in the USA is minute. Cars kill about 600 a year. So: I would still let your kids do what's healthy for them, knowing that yes, there is a tiny risk that they will die. But as with putting them in a car, it's a worthwhile risk, on balance. Let them enjoy life - sensibly."

The long-term risk of missed education (especially early K-6) is far, far higher than what COVID19 presents.  I feel bad for parents who will realize in the not-too-distant future that they significantly harmed their children's development through the support of remote learning.  In the pursuit of trying to prevent the tiny risk of COVID19 to their children, they may have jeopardized their ability to keep up with peers that went in-person or had the resources to created in-person private learning groups."

The possibility of long term damage was brought up early in the pandemic.  I imagine that there are scientists working on it, and I hope this will be reported on by you and others.
One reason that this is important is that it might change priorities for vaccination to give greater weight to getting vaccines approved for children and teenagers."
2021-02-16 13:24:35,"With this syndrome on the rise and variant strains of the virus highlighting the many unknowns, I am not sure that the rush to open schools is being sold responsibly.

2021-02-16 18:03:51,"You know what would really help open up schools? Vaccinating our kids along with all the teachers. It feels obscene to me that I can be vaccinated and my 16-year old can't be. I would throw myself in front of the proverbial speeding car to save her, but I can't get her a vaccine that would allow her resume a somewhat normal life. As a parent, I feel helpless."
2021-02-16 13:14:53,"My heart hurts for the Wilson family and all families whose been impacted by this virus and it’s aftermath.  As a parent, I’ve already chosen not to send my child back to school because the risk is just far too great.  We’ve all heard stories at the PTA meetings about that one parent who sends their sick, runny-nose child to school because they couldn’t get a babysitter and had to go to work!  Not giving a care in the world that their sick child is going to infect the rest of his/her class.  Even in this article, an 11-year-old boy wasn’t feeling well, yet his mother still took him to soccer practice; not thinking about how her son could’ve infected or exposed the other children on his soccer team to his illness.  In my opinion, THAT is the type of parental irresponsibility that could cause COVID to rapidly spread throughout schools. 
I think schools should give parents the option of either in-person or remote learning, once schools reopen in the fall.  If they don’t, then I’ll be left with the option of homeschooling.  This pandemic has somewhat prepared me for it, so I know it won’t be easy.  However, when I think about the pain of Ms. Wilson having to bury her son, I know it won’t be harder than that."
2021-02-16 18:07:34,"Thank you for your reporting. What research is being done to determine risk factors for developing symptoms in children with Covid19? Obesity, socioeconomic people seem overrepresented. Are any other epidemiologic factors being evaluated?

I'm sure with time, research will explain more, but are there other risk factors being explored?"

How tragic indeed to have such young patients - many of whom probably do not know how to spell Wuhan.

Obviously, there is much to learn.

I know current vaccines are not yet recommended for young folks.

But may be under Trump's ""Right to use"" law - the authorities ought to bypass some bureaucracy and get trials going.

Otherwise, just like we lost too many seniors needlessly -  we may have some big issues with young ones."

The horrifically poor response to the pandemic has proven how wrong I was.  I hold him and his enablers responsible for every death due to Covid.  Every single one."
2021-02-16 17:56:40,"Some folks here are demanding (largely, I'm afraid, motivated by politics) that we reopen all schools now, based on the small number of deaths cited here, and based on unsupported claims including the Trump Republican chestnut (lie) that there are more flu than Covid-19 deaths among young people. 

This syndrome is just one cause of Covid-19 deaths among 17 or younger. The total number so far is around 400. Flu deaths between 1976 and 2007 averaged 97 (plus another 100 or so due to other underlying conditions). 

A large number (on the order of hundreds of thousands) of children and young people who did not die have had serious, long lasting, possibly lifelong repercussions that did not result in death. Recovery has taken weeks or months. A fair number (tens of thousands?) have not seen any reduction in their symptoms even one year after contracting the virus (difficulty breathing, unable to exercise at all). 

We should reopen schools smartly and safely. The CDC recommendations, which are nuanced, certainly don't support doing otherwise. States haven't made vaccinating teachers a priority, and the CDC says it isn't strictly necessary, contingent on the smartly and safely bit. At the moment, most of the states don't have the funds to make many schools safe, or to operate them safely. E.g., close hair salons and bars, and open schools.

We all know that Covid is impossible to control.  It is airborne - and continually mutating.  Due to its propensity for mutation, vaccination can only be a stop gap measure at best.  And there are numerous antivaxxers as well as partying anti-maskers everywhere, compounding the situation.  Biden should never  dare to go where Trump has gone before.  He must heed rather than disparage Fauci's ever changing advice or face the music.  And the latest pronouncement from that quarter is, ""Two masks are better than one."""

2021-02-16 18:27:22,"There are many comments on this board complaining about schools being closed. That is a myth! Schools are anything but closed. 

Teachers abd students are either teaching/attending remotely, in person, or using a hybrid of these depending on the choices made by the school district and the community the district serves. Parents chose the model they preferred for their child. Isn’t it great that they were given a CHOICE? Why would anyone be angry at that? 

Regardless of the 3 models by which education is being delivered, teachers have learned to sustain the attention, engage, and teach their students at home and in the classroom simultaneously. We don’t give them enough credit! Learning is still happening. Tests are being administered. Clubs, extracurriculars, plays, concerts are still happening. Counseling, academic intervention, and related services are being provided, etc. Schools have also supported the community in many ways such as providing free meals to any community members and made Covid-19 testing available. In short, schools are anything but closed. 

If schools in your community couldn’t offer in-person instruction, it’s probably because they couldn’t  comply with safety guidelines. An issue that may have forced communities to only offer remote instruction was the poor condition of  buildings and the lack of funding to make necessary changes to safely comply w/ the guidelines. 

If you’re not happy with your district’s approach, ask it questions and get involved!"

I say this as a senior that it is one thing to protect our vulnerable elderly from COVID-19, but it is also just as crucial to keep our kids healthy and free from a debilitating and killing coronavirus.  There are two thoughts I want to put out there.  The first is that at the first indication of the rapid and lethal spread of COVID, this government should have handed over the reins of control to our experts in epidemiology.  No questions to be asked, rejected, or disputed. The second is that our children's needs for not only physical health but also social and educational development are crucial to their personal welfare and our nation's progress.  Let there be an all out effort for every single teacher in this country to get the vaccine necessary to reopen our schools safely. Now."
2021-02-16 18:29:13,"I am somewhere smack in the middle in my reactions.  
These are tragedies.

We do not have data pulled together yet on the sequelae of Covid infections: how many suffer the ""longhaul,"" and how severe are the after effects?

We have plenty to support exercising extreme caution: the preventive measures, vaccinating those most vulnerable and those who serve us,  and on to all of the others.

But it is true - thank g*d - that these reactions in the young are extremely rare.  The title implies otherwise; it is something I wouldn't really want a nervous 9 year old to be focused on.

 Should schools be reopened: yes - after the teachers are vaccinated.  

If reopening schools was a priority, than they should have come in line just behind the healthcare professionals, along with other first responders who have frequent person to person contact.  Thus they are in danger and are also agents who can spread the disease.  

Failure to include this group was a failure of planning, federally and in states. Teachers are not enemies for having a logical concern about their health.   And we won't even go into the problem of school funding which allows wealthy districts to put protections in place that poor districts cannot afford.
 SO Yes schools should be reopened asap. After teachers are as well prepared as possible to return safely."

If your child gets COVID, there is a <~1/100,000 chance that they will die of this inflammatory syndrome, very similar to the flu. 
 Overall child mortality per year in the 5-14 age bracket is ~14/100,000.  These statistics mask great tragedy, but children cannot lead full, happy lives unless their parents are mature enough to accept a degree of risk.

For the <~1/100,000 estimate, I am conservatively estimating that at least 2% of children (<18yo) have had COVID.  The official tally of positive COVID diagnoses in the US currently corresponds to 8.5% of the overall population."

I’d hope we could give these people our compassion and not criticize their choices.  They did the best they knew to do.  This is a cruel disease.  When it strikes, it can strike hard.  

Let’s keep our side of the fence clean by masking up and protecting others.  If everyone did their part, we’d be in much better shape as a country.

We were fortunate that we only had temporary and relatively mild symptoms.  But when I read a story like this and think of so many people, politicians who have huge platforms and reach, parroting Trump and other misinformation downplaying the virus, I get so sad and angry.  The virus’ ravaging of this country (deaths, closed schools and damage to livelihoods) didn’t have to be this way.  

My heart goes out to all the parents whose children are suffering."

As mentioned by many other readers, people are angry that children are not in school in an attempt to ""return to normal."" I think everyone needs to pause and realize that for the foreseeable future this will be our ""normal."" That being said our society must reorganize it's priorities. If getting children into school safely is your priority then you shouldn't be dining in restaurants, having indoor gatherings, and not wearing a mask.
From the beginning it has been repeatedly spouted that COVID ""only seriously effects the elderly and those with comorbid conditions"" so children have been looked at more as a vector than a group that is in danger. In light of the apparent rise in the number of serious cases in children and MIS-C, perhaps it's time to change our approach.
Had this virus afflicted everyone the same from the onset it would have been treated with more respect and seriousness by everyone. In the meantime if we continue to rush things more will needlessly become ill and/or die than have already needlessly done so."

Are such cases due exclusively to COVID or other underlying genetic or lifestyle conditions may make things worse. Very sad to read that 15-year old Braden Wilson of Simi Valley, California is gone.

Until every US resident of all ages willing to receive the vaccine gets it there could be more reasons to worry about all those currently not on the CDC priority list but having undetected or diagnosed underlying conditions. Hopefully J&J one dose vaccine against COVID is approved soon by the FDA so that the supply can meet the demand before it is too late for some."
2021-02-16 20:39:29,"A loss of a child is a pain like no other, and my heart goes out to these families. 

I would be interested to know in those afflicted with MIS-C if there are any common threads... Previous health conditions, previous vaccine history and schedule of such, common environmental factors, ethnicity, economic factors, etc... The more we know, the better it may help protect any future family from experiencing such heartbreak."
2021-02-16 20:42:32,"Braden's case is tragic and the loss of a life so young is heartbreaking.

From a public health perspective, we have to focus on the overall data and not individual cases. There are about 73 million Americans aged 0-18. Per this article, 30 young people have died from this. Less than 1 per million. Studies continue to show that in person schools, with appropriate precautions, are low risk for COVID spread.

I am not in favor of recklessly ""getting things back to normal"". I am in favor of looking at the data and weighing risk/benefit. I believe the benefit to children from in person school currently outweighs the risk."
2021-02-16 21:22:53,"this is definitely a serious syndrome, and begs to be figured into return to school. But 100 children die from influenza every year, many with no clear predisposing condition.  I would also be interested to know, how common is Kawasakis disease in the US- or similar inflammatory syndromes from other viruses? That context could help people understand how to weigh this risk as compared to the risk of influenza for children.  The math modeling that the NYT has used for some other articles could give valuable perspective on the relative risk of Covid compared to, say , influenza (or an uptick in youth suicide?)  We need science and collaboration to drive return to school, not fear.  Anxiety should be warranted, but not overblown."
2021-02-16 21:25:29,"In science you cannot say a thing happens unless you have data to say ""this thing happened"".  That is why it has taken so long for us to start issuing warnings about this post-viral syndrome.

There is another aspect that falls in the same category and which we can't have data to prove for another decade or two.  This virus infects cells that line the blood vessels.  In other situations when these cells have been damaged sufficiently to scar, over subsequent decades the damaged area starts accumulating cholesterol resulting in a cholesterol plaque.

We don't yet know if covid infection (even asymptomatic) will leave scars behind that are vulnerable to accumulating cholesterol.  If it does, then in a decade or two we could have an 'epidemic' of activity-limiting cardiovascular problems in relatively young people (20s-40s).

The risk of this is suggested by the vascular damage this virus can cause, but nobody can say for sure if it actually happens until a decade or two from now, which isn't much help now, which is why you don't hear of it from authorities like Fauci--until a decade or more has passed, the risk remains hypothetical--we need data.

However, yes, I am scare-mongering in the sense I hope young people will consider this possible danger and become less cavalier about ignoring covid precautions.  The virus might not kill you today but it might kill you in a decade, or ruin your quality of life."

No previous or existing health conditions.  Perfectly healthy Caucasian infant.  Middle class.    I mention this only to make aware that this does not just affect low socioeconomic families or minority children.   All are at risk.  She had Covid , a very mild case of it, but fell victim to this ￼3 weeks later.   She was hospitalized at Cleveland Clinic.   They saved her life.  However, she still has extremities that are colder,  is on various medications with lots of follow up to come from physicians.

I hope the huge number of pediatricians polled by the NYtimes are reading such articles. Do they still feel that opening schools is justified? Until the CDC can actually tell us what traits might actually predispose our children to either a mild covid or a serious one, let’s all simply improve the online experience. It’s a lot better than heartbreak and regrets after ones child suffers because of our adult decisions. Also children have never been asked how they feel about returning to school. I know my high schooler devours articles on covid and appears so stressed when school sends out flyers polling parents for a return to school. We have assured him that should school be opened and we as a family are uncomfortable, we will simply choose for him to be home till all of us are ready to get out into the world. The decision must include the psychological comfort of children, old and young."

2021-02-16 22:55:46,"This is rare and awful.  But hopefully this will not hamper the opening of schools - which can done safely if done in the right way.  In our school system, there have been a few cases of covid among children, and none of them caught it at school. Many got it over the Christmas break or at a social event where multiple people got it.  Our school is only a 1/2 day (with a snack that is eaten outside).  You are not allowed to share any materials  or touch doorknobs(except using the bathroom).  Masks are mandatory and enforced the entire time. Temperatures are taken and if you leave the state, you are required to stay home for 2 weeks.  They also use cohorts in case there is a breakout, but we haven't had any.  It's not great, but it's better than being remote, in my opinion for my kids."
2021-02-16 22:56:23,"It amazes me that parents spare their little kids from wearing masks, as if the little kids can't spew more coronavirus than adults. They can and they do, and you can teach them to wear masks to protect others and themselves. Masks are not a bad thing.

Wearing a mask protects you and protects others.
It is kind of like, driving the speed limit protects you and protects others. So we can all live together within a society. Are speed limits an unacceptable limit to our freedoms?  Didn't think so."
2021-02-16 23:16:39,"Children are our perfect product, our most precious commodity.  Teachers should be treasurer as well since they take over for parents in children's education multiple hours per day in normal times..  Just because children don't get as sick as often as other age groups does not mean they should be gathered together in school ""for their betterment"" or for the convenience - or desperate need - of their parents to resume working.  This will put more lives in danger, adults and our precious children.  We need to keep everyone socially distant until this virus becomes a much more distant memory than simply ""cases are getting lower every day"".  This article should be mandatory reading by anyone trying to force the issue of a rapid return to the classroom for whatever reason."

She's been screened for mono, strep, influenza, peptic ulcer, appendicitis, childhood cancers. She's been to the Infectious Disease Specialists,  the Oncologist, 2 Emergency rooms. She is a thin child and has lost 13 lbs.  There's so much unknown about the long term effects of this disease on children.  On anyone....."

They are to blame for the extent of death in this country, and families like Braden's had to pay the price.   It's unforgiveable.   

I honestly don't know that I have ever been as angry as I am now, at Trump and the GOP stooges who downplayed the epidemic and refused to wear a mask, then tried to overturn the will of the people, and the GOP base which did its part to spread Covid across America.  

My condolences to Braden's family and other families who have suffered losses during the pandemic."
2021-02-16 20:49:06,This is so sad. And it just goes to show that we still don't know much about COVID. I still don't really understand how the vaccine works when we don't understand COVID. I don't understand how states and cities are re-opening schools and businesses and sports facilities. I guess it's a total crap shoot- some are lucky and some are not and we don't have any idea as to why. We're all just in this scary experiment together.
2021-02-16 23:21:44,"The big picture I see in my community is that on the subject of school, most people have strong feelings and moralistic opinions about whether school should happen in person, or not.  There is fiery animosity between some parents and some teachers on opposing sides of the issue.  We need to be much more understanding that there is NOT a clearly absolutely correct path.  There are huge prices to pay either way you go, and to make the choice more nebulous, there are still anti-maskers everywhere.  In the kindest, gentlest, most respectful way possible, I've asked people I encounter with their mask under their chin or nose to please move their mask over their mouth and nose, and the response has almost always been 'no', accompanied by everything from blatantly ignoring me to some of the longest strings of 'f'-this and 'f'-you's that I've ever heard.  For school classrooms to be completely Covid safe, every single student and staff member needs to consistently play by a few non-negotiable rules, even out of the building.... I just don't think it's possible.  Bottom line, people on both sides of this issue need to pause; either way, there are terrible consequences.  I'm so sorry for these families who have lost their precious children to Covid."

2021-02-16 20:24:25,"Most kids are already learning in-person in US - whether full time (about 40% of the schools) or in hybrid mode (another 30%). Coronavirus, at its current effect and history, has affected kids less than the seasonal flu epidemics. That includes mortality percent-wise. Kids have been dying from all sorts of ailments all through our history, it's just life, and the numbers are not alarming especially with Covid which is why the Association of Pediatric Doctors supports kids being in school based on all ***scientific evidence***. 

If you want to wait for 0 mortality in kids, you will be waiting forever. But by all means keep your kids home for as long as you want. So long as you don't block everyone else from sending their kids to school. My child has been in school full time since August, and it's tremendous. More than 60% of parents in our deep blue county in Florida send their kids to school full time, and the numbers are only increasing as there are no major problems.

This alarmism over tiny numbers of serious complications in kids, well comparable to the problems with other diseases, is only playing in the hands of those who only use science when it benefits them. Like the teachers unions who couldn't care less about the kids."

2021-02-16 14:04:57,"Heartbreaking and frightening. The push to open schools is intense. Here in my town in CT we get daily emails informing us how many cases we have in the school district each day. It’s usually between 3-15 cases a day. After the holidays it was 49 cases. We’ve had a case of the UK variant in our schools. Parents sent their kid in to take the PSATs while sick and awaiting a test result resulting in a number of cases.  Parties and sleepovers happen. School is hybrid. In school transmission was confirmed. 

My student is remote.  We have to be. We are high risk to the virus.  We are so nervous the remote option will be taken away.  No one listens to us. We are treated like pests by the district and many other parents. We are told to “homeschool so everyone else can get on with their lives” by parents in town.  They seem to think the roughly 1,000 students out of 10,000 who stayed home, somehow ruined it for everyone else. When the truth is we helped create social distancing space by staying home so their kids could attend school in the hybrid model. 

High risk families aren’t being considered in this push to reopen the schools. There needs to be a federal mandate that insures high risk children get an equal education and don’t have to risk their lives and the lives of their family just to go to school."

Second, and only adjacent to this tragedy, I am quite annoyed at the fear mongering that this article peddles. The chances of a young person 0-17 yrs old being hospitalized as a result of contracting COVID are under 0.1 percent. Don't believe me? Here are the CDC numbers. <a href=""https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_5.html"" target=""_blank"">https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_5.html</a>

I am reminded of the breathless pearl-clutching NYT coverage i the spring of 'Kawasaki-like"" side effects (same set of complications now called MIS-C) that loomed over any child with a sore throat. 

What I also remember from THAT coverage (buried in the 5th paragraph of that article) was that pre-existing comorbidities played a huge role in both developing such complications and in whether those complications became severe. No such nuance in this article.

The devastating effects of this complication for Braden and his family are truly awful. And yet this article hardly puts this tragedy in context: such results, though awful, are also _extremely_ rare. 

Ya gotta pump the brakes with these intentionally scary headlines, NYT. You're sounding a little too much like FOX. People read this newspaper to help them calibrate threat levels out there in the world. Do us all a favor and get your thumb off the scale."
2021-02-16 18:45:20,"This syndrome may have occurred before COVID-19. In 2005 there was some controversy regarding Kawasaki Disease and MIS-C and the “New Haven coronavirus” (HCoV-NH) that has been shown by sequence analysis to be very similar to HCoV-NL63. Since this vasculitis syndrome sometimes now appears a few weeks after the coronavirus is no longer detectable, that may explain the different conclusions in Japan vs the Yale Hospital doctors.

2021-02-16 19:16:57,"My prayers to the Wilson family and all families affected by Covid.

Please understand the numbers. In 2018, there were approximately 35.5 million elementary school children and a total of about 56.6 million K-12 children in the US.  As of Feb. 11 there have been 3.03 million children who have tested positive for COVID.  This article reports 2,060 cases of MIS-C and 30 deaths.  That is 1 death per 100,000 documented cases and 1 death per 1.886 million K-12 child.    While any death in a child is tragic and we should do our best to prevent each death possible, the effect of keeping all children out of school will have lifetime consequences in many more children. School closures are leading to many more psychological problems, depression, isolation, anxiety, school failures in younger children and suicides.  

The Times needs to be more careful when publishing these type of articles.  An article centered around a child dying will provoke fear in parents but the lack of context provided by the author and editors is irresponsible and counterproductive.  According to the CDC and AAP, we can send children back to school with common sense safety precautions.  As a pediatrician, I am dealing with the consequences of closed schools much, much more than MIS-C."

Oster lamented that the CDC's ""guidance makes it difficult to do what’s best for the country’s children: to get all students, in all grades, into classrooms five days a week, in person.""

Oster has had several op-eds urging re-openings with full in-person attendance.  She opines that teachers and their unions seem to be the only impediment.

In this article, however, it is parents who are weighing in as well as doctors.  The novel coronavirus has surprised us at every turn, yet less than a year into it, humble assessments regarding its short and long term causes are in the minority when it comes to people advocating for in-school classes.

In Massachusetts,the 0-19 age cohort had 8223 cases in the past two weeks, by far the age group with the greatest number of infections -- a fact so many blindly wish away.

But unlike a car accident affecting your riders and those in the other cars...the virus' impact can touch others not in your immediate proximity, and spread exponentially to even more people.  And with regards to the risk, the better analogy for car accidents and going to school or playing team sports, would be like getting in the car to drive under the influence. You know increased risk you have introduced to your loved ones/others, yet you accept them and selfishly do it anyway.

2021-02-17 00:52:09,"I don't think it's fair to compare COVID-19 consequences and deaths in children with those of influenza and other infectious disease in kids. That's because the number of deaths and complications counted each year are based on the many millions of children and adults more or less attending school regularly. The numbers of COVID-19 death and complications might be even higher now if schools had not closed, gone hybrid, mandated social distancing, mask-wearing, etc.

Also, if the mental health of children are a concern, why not address that instead of assuming going back to school will resolve those issue instantly? It's possible some of those children are predisposed to psychological issues already and the pandemic tipped them over the edge. 

I'm writing a paper on suicide in chronically ill adults and there are many steps to improve mental health. Even socialization can be done now without going back to school, e.g. not just online but walking outside, masked up, and slightly distanced, for example. Perhaps the NY Times can help by writing a column for parents on how to improve teen's mental health: for example an article about building resilience in children."

If I had school age children and could manage to keep them home until the pandemic is over, that would be my choice.  I completely understand that many families do not have the option, and I am not criticizing any parents who make a different decision."

But somehow, the virus found Braden.""

The tragedy could have been avoided, had all dental offices been required to have all staff in N95s or N100s worn properly at all times, walls that go up to the ceiling instead of 3/4 walls like most have, doors (most don't have doors, which I didn't realize until this pandemic), and proper prevention of air contamination.

 We all know it's not safe to be hanging out without a mask, in the same air that other people are hanging out without a mask. 

 The only safe offices are those that have not just HEPA filtration systems in each room, but more important, high-speed extraoral evacuation system close to the source of contaminants (patient’s mouth) to prevent contaminated air from going into the HVAC air streams. 

If we had tracing in the US we'd find more cases related to dental (and medical) offices where precautions are just policies on paper."

The new head of the CDC says schools can reopen safely if everybody wears a mask -- when confronted with fact that only 60% of the kids wear one, she deflected with the same squirrilliness as any Trump health official.

The scientists need to leave no stone unturned in trying to figure out what might be causing this in some children.
It clearly is an autoimmune issue -- these kids are not dying from the virus itself, which in most cases is already defeated, but from the body's reaction (or rather, over-reaction) to the virus, and the resulting inflammation. There must be a reason why it happens in some cases and not in others."

Yes, there are medical journals but they don't have reporters all over the country and by the time they review and reprint, someone in tiny town wherever might be dead because someone didn't know that a drop in O2 levels shows up before symptoms.

I sang along with hundreds of other people from around the world to Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas with Couch Choir. It was a lot of fun.

Quick short bursts of exhaling air with pursed lips (like whistling) has helped me.  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  After several repetitions, a clean breath of air usually happens. 
The doctors are so focused on drugs as a solution that they overmedicate many people.  Once on a prescription it is hard to get off of it.  Without insurance a monthly dose of just one medicine would have cost me $425!  American drug prices may not apply everywhere (thank God), but lung disease is obviously at the center of Covid-19.

2021-02-17 15:48:13,"I've done diaphragm breathing since I was a teenager, due to my love of opera and to test myself to see how much I could sing on one breath.  Once you get used to doing it, it's the way you breathe all the time, unconsciously, whether for singing or just for getting through the day. Very often, it's the reason why opera singers who are not overweight appear somewhat so (think Richard Tucker, Leonie Rysanek and Cornell MacNeil, to name only three), due to the permanent expansion of their diaphragms since most of each breath goes into the stomach area rather than into the lungs. I like to think that in NYC and other 'dirty air"" areas, it keeps your lungs healthier than average since you don't take all that much air directly into them (and especially if you don't smoke!). As for its use with Covid patients, that is an absolutely wonderful idea, but it is really an excellent idea for just about everybody all the time, and more people should engage in it."

2021-02-17 23:15:02,"There's a very simple breathing exercise which may be useful.  If you inhale through your nose and exhale through either your mouth or nose twice as long as the inhale, you will automatically relax the vagus nerve, the largest nerve in the body, and the autonomic nervous system.  Inhale - one, two; exhale - one, two, three, four.  Try ten breaths that way and see what happens.

I took a free breathing course from Stig Severinsen at breatheology.com a few months ago and have found his work useful.  After all, all we have is one breath at a time and I like to pay attention to it."

2021-02-18 14:29:01,"As a singer, my years of training on how to use my breath have come in handy all across life. The yoga breathing for singers I learned at age 20 helped when I had my first natural childbirth and has always helped me meditate and focus. Every evening, before going to sleep, I breathe in deeply, expanding my upper chest/intercostal muscles, feeling the air fill the upper lobes of my lungs, then holding my chest open, allow the air to gently exhale through my nose as slowly as possible, while my stomach and diaphragm work to support the exhalation. This triggers the vagus nerve and lowers blood pressure and calms me. Then I drift off to sleep."
2021-02-18 16:18:41,"My practice, Sound Passage, does just this: I help people with breath and gentle vocalization to help calm the nervous system. As a lifelong singer and educator, I weave together simple vocal exercises, gentle movement, and dialogue to create an opportunity to tap into the body's natural healing. We always start with breathing exercises. But the vocalizing and lullabies are like a soothing internal massage."
2021-02-18 18:01:16,"Fascinating--and so many of the comments are great.  I'm a longtime tai chi and bagua player, who also plays blues harp, but I've learned a lot from a great recent book by James Nestor on Breath: the New Science of a Lost Art.  It dovetails with so many of the points made in the Times article.  But it's somewhat shocking to hear how proper breathing can cure so many ills--and yet it is largely ignored by mainstream medicine."
2021-02-18 22:46:51,"I this is a great idea. Breath is the source of most of our energy. Many years ago I had the insight after reading about someone starving to death which took 57 days before point of no return. Someone survived ten days without water, but that is usually the limit.

Now hold your breath for 5 minutes.

When I worked with ballet dancers at NYC Ballet, changing their ability to control breath was life changing.

The emotions linked to fear cause muscles to be tightened and not release normally, but cause smaller movements and when within the diaphragm, your breath is smaller, and with that your energy.

I think this is an amazing idea. Singing would take your mind away form your fear and allow you to feel joy within the song.

Great idea."
2021-02-19 09:58:01,"This is a wonderful idea. When I came down with a serious chronic lung illness in 2015 I took up choir singing. It has helped so much. 
This is a tremendous service that the opera community can share in these difficult times. A win-win situation."
2021-02-20 06:52:31,"In the USA there are speech/language pathologists that specialize in voice disorders.  This even includes issues with muscle atrophy due to extended time on a ventilator.

They can be found in many medical clinics and hospitals.  Their services should be covered by US health insurance companies under rehabilitation benefits.  Which, like the UK NHS program being described, are often six weeks long.

I do not know if US health insurance companies cover voice lessons from opera singers.  You should call your health insurance company first.  Perhaps take what you can by working with a certified SLP first, and then do private pay for an opera voice coach after insurance benefits end.

Note on our experience:  having oldest kid who spent years in speech therapy to learn how to speak, and youngest who just got an MS in SLP with a voice therapy specialty... who is trying to get a fellowship during a pandemic.

2021-02-25 12:24:59,"Thanks for this. Contrary to what my Trump family and friends are saying to me and posting on social media, kids can get COVID and it can create serious health issues. And I'd not be surprised if some of the mutant variations make kids more susceptible."
2021-02-25 12:48:30,"Some cable news pundits and their bosses are pushing too hard about sending kids back to schools.  If we want to do that, let's slow down the reopening of non-essential venues and do everything possible to make schools safe.  Why should we take risks with our children when so much is still not known?"
2021-02-25 13:12:47,"An important article. However, like the proportion of adults with COVID, we do not really know the true number of children infected with COVID. Many children could have had mild or no symptoms and recovered completely without medical intervention. Still, this research can add to the literature for future years as COVID will continue to be with us, just like the flu."
2021-02-25 13:44:13,"Covid is predominantly a disease of the elderly. So we need to ask why when kids are being affected they are overwhelmingly minority. Have they been getting proper healthcare all along? Do they have subclinical asthma or other conditions?  Are their diets and living situations substandard? In other words, is this a poverty issue? I suspect the answer is a resounding yes."
2021-02-25 13:51:35,Why does this article omit the absolute incidence of both of these conditions in the general population? The newsworthiness of these disparities depends on these facts. The fact that this study suggests that kids without underlying health conditions are more likely to develop MIS-C than acute COVID doesn’t seem terribly significant given that there have been about 2000 MIS-C cases among the 60 million or so US residents 20 years and younger.
2021-02-25 13:53:12,"The age distribution for MIS-C compared to the patents with primary pulmonary disease is interesting.
Since MIS-C follows a Covid-19 infection the age distribution might shed some light on why only a very, very few children among all those infected develop this condition which does mimic in many ways Kawasaki Syndrome (KS).
When I was taking care of KS patients I had one young women with a bone infection from Staph that developed KS.
So any preceding or current infection viral or bacterial may cause KS or MIS-C.
One probable mechanism is that the offending organism forms a ""Super Antigen"" that elicits the violent immune reaction or the immune system in those patients has a quirk that has not yet been discovered.
In any event these events are very, very rare and not a reason to shut down in place schooling."
2021-02-25 14:00:28,"Interesting that the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome affects the GI tract, mucous membranes and skin. This is a lot like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis). Nobody knows the cause of IBD but a virus is suspected. Hopefully, someone will learn something from COVID about the relationship between viruses and the onset of inflammatory diseases in children."
2021-02-25 14:14:45,"Thanks for another small view into how this virus affects us. The age differences in which type of symptoms occur are interesting; what do children under 6 and over 12 have in common? Hormonal levels? Other vaccination levels...measles, mumps, polio...etc. Perhaps weaker due to time (or young age) than the 6-12 group?

What none of these studies ever mention, from the early cruise ship populations to now, is prior vaccination histories. Even here, did the siblings of these children, parents, get COVID? If not, what differences? And with adults, one gets the virus, and a spouse doesn’t. What medical interventions, prior vaccinations, differentiate? 

Given more and more medical histories are now on electronic charts, surely some comparisons are possible. Start including them."
2021-02-25 15:06:46,"Based on what this article describes, there is little understanding of the issues discussed. Probably the same problem as finding a needle in a haystack, given the extremely small (percentage) number of cases."
2021-02-25 15:43:06,"According to “The Deepest Well” by Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, toxic stress leads to all kinds of autoimmune illnesses that can start in infancy but definitely affects children.  It would be worth factoring in this variable as well. Meanwhile parents are pushing so hard here I’m California for their children to go back to school.  I get that it will generally be able to be safe in theory but some will inevitably get sick and spread illness as well and I just find it sad in particular that disadvantaged people will yet again be disproportionately affected."
2021-02-25 15:54:32,"Our son was a bit of an outlier compared to this study. He was hospitalized for MIS-C (more commonly referred to as PIMS at that time) in May in New York City. He was only 20 months old. It was a terrifying experience (and we had a newborn at home!). Little was known at that time. He spent nearly 2 weeks in the hospital, but never required the ICU. The IVIG was not effective, but ultimately the steroids worked. He fully recovered and his echocardiograms came back perfect within 60 days of being released from the hospital. He is now as healthy and happy as a 2 year old toddler can be! But, we have stayed extra cautious, and quarantined more than most anyone we know as we don't know how exposure to COVID-19 would affect him being that he had MIS-C. I truly wish we could find any insight in whether he is at a heightened risk. We've been too fearful to even go for walks outdoors in open spaces."
2021-02-25 16:06:37,Is there any chance that the difference in covid symptoms has to do with the mode of infection? (Inhaled vs. ingested)
2021-02-25 16:24:10,They should look at Vitamin D levels. Evidence has shown that people with less than 20 nanograms/ml are more likely to get infected.
2021-02-25 14:36:46,"Be aware that a German cardiology group led by Valentina Puntmann found heart lesions in 78 of 100 patients studied by MRI at least two weeks after Covid diagnosis, 60 patients still with inflammation of the heart at that time. As the majority had recovered at home, we can ask whether these would have suspected that the virus had affected their hearts, but this seems to be the rule with Covid, not the exception. Which makes me curious that little follow-up has appeared on Elsevier Science Direct, Science magazine or Nature since the publication July 27 in JAMA Cardiology. Confidence in the German results is enhanced by the presence of 50 healthy controls undergoing the same imaging.

The patients all being adults, Puntmann did not discuss MIS-C, nor did he go into the socioeconomic implications. I wouldn’t be surprised, however, if the virus also attacks the heart in childhood, so that routine cardiac evaluation of youngsters after recovery might be wise even if it’s expensive. We shouldn’t think of Covid as a disease only of the lungs. See

2021-02-25 16:33:10,"Are these children being contact traced? In regards re-opening schools, we need data on how these children got infected with SARS CoV2 and whether they transmitted it to their families and other contacts.

This NYT report and many of the comments below, suggests there is social, racial discrimination in the two forms of SARS CoV2 infection in children. I don't find this interpretation supported by the JAMA publication, on which this NYT report is based. Here is the paragraph in the JAMA report that addresses racial or socioeconomic factors. 

""Previous studies have reported that a large proportion of pediatric patients with COVID-19–related disease were of Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, but these studies were limited in their ability to establish an association between race/ethnicity as a potential risk factor for MIS-C.8,14,27 This case series found that non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents were more likely than non-Hispanic White patients to have MIS-C than COVID-19, after adjusting for age, sex, geographic region, and underlying conditions, whereas Hispanic patients did not appear to be at a higher risk for MIS-C than COVID-19.14 In Kawasaki disease, Black race is a risk factor for nonresponse to IVIG treatment and increased frequency of coronary abnormalities.28,29""

Racial, genetic differences do exist in response to infections e.g. Blacks and Asians are more susceptible to TB, a respiratory infection influenced by host inflammatory reactions."
2021-02-25 16:56:09,"“It’s still shocking that the overwhelming majority of the patients are nonwhite and that is true for MIS-C and for acute Covid,” I would assume this has not only to do with socioeconomic factors but with Vitamin D deficiency as well. People with darker skin tend to metabolize even less Vitamin D from sunshine than people with lighter skin. Vitamin D props up the immune system, and in particular with regard to this virus. In sunny climes, usually, the rate of new incidents has declined compared to regions with less sunshine. Of course, sunshine alone is not enough - it needs to be of a certain intensity, and large parts of the body need to be exposed to it for a sufficient amount of time. This explains also why Iran, for example, didn't fare well at all, in spite of its warm weather."
2021-02-25 16:57:16,"As a mother of four kids under 10, I’m glad that more research is being performed on COVID in kids. I find it very reassuring that the vast majority of kids with even the worst cases of COVID nationwide have recovered. A year into the pandemic, COVID remains a much smaller risk for my kids than so many other causes of child death. I’m also very thankful my kids have been in school in person since September, and our very transparent district hasn’t had a single case of in school transmission."
2021-02-25 17:15:20,"Thank you for this excellent reporting. Please keep working this beat. MIS-C remains a worry in our household as we grapple with safely returning our child to in person learning.

I hope the feds open the funding spigots wide for this research and all related epidemiology studies."
2021-02-25 17:51:06,This is still frightening in a country where receiving timely and high quality medical care is not assured.
2021-02-25 17:55:23,"Whenever racial disparity data are shared, publications must do a better job on controlling for other factors--especially family income. Without this crucial context it's impossible to tell if the differential outcomes are due to genetic/biological factors having to do with race, or a manifestation of socio-economic inequality. This could be done simply with regression analysis. 

We know that many illnesses do have genetic/biological basis--including the Moyamoya disease, lupus, diseases related to lipid metabolism, and others beyond more obvious ones like sickle cell or Tay-Sacks disease. Just providing a bit more context could not only shed more light but point to possibilities for effective intervention."
2021-02-25 17:57:04,This was a very well written and helpful article.  One thing I would have liked to have seen is a discussion of prevalence of these conditions in the overall population of children (not just the proportion within the study group).
2021-02-25 18:23:35,"Seems to me, the original fallacy about kids NOT getting Covid was due to parents of young kids keeping them within the family bubble so they had little opportunity for exposure to the virus.  Teens, on the other hand, are not constantly under observation by their parents and more likely to have interactions with people outside their family bubble."
2021-02-25 18:41:57,"Knowing that the risks from COVID to children are less than from the common FLU - death rate, and severity of illness wise that is, the agitation by the Left against sending kids to school full time is definitively anti-Science. 

I am lucky to live in Florida where my child has been going to elementary school full time since August, with no serious problems. We live in a deep blue Orange County (60%+ Dem vote) and at first barely 30-35% sent their kids to school back in August, but now it is up to well over 60% as people realized that there are not major transmission problems in schools so long as simple rules are followed.

Kids wear masks (yes our 5 year old can do it, and so do all the kids in his kindergarten class), eat in socially distant cafeteria, and if anyone gets sick all the kids in the class (and anyone else a potential contact) get quarantined for 2 weeks. Once in a while that happens, and everyone in school gets informed. School doesn't close. Life goes on. Parents and kids and actually teachers are pretty happy with how it has been. The teachers who are more at risk have been teaching virtual classes for the kids who are not going in person yet.

When I read the lunacy of teachers unions still obstructing in-person instruction to this day, I feel awful for the families living in those states/cities. We've been too lucky. And I am pretty sure our Republican governor will be easily reelected, as many Democrats are pretty happy sending their kids to school."
2021-02-25 18:47:49,"can you give us the stats of how common or rare it is for kids to get either MIS or have complications from Covid, compared to kids who got Covid and had neither? Last I checked children, unlike adults, are actually less at risk of complications from Covid than they are from the flu, and they are less likely to spread it than adults. I have observed that NYT routinely leaves out key information. This article leaves the impression behind that something is more common than it actually is."
2021-02-25 19:51:44,"I've been concerned that the inflammatory type of Covid, usually associated with gastric symptoms, could be a greater cause of spread than we realize because the symptoms are often mild and differ so greatly from respiratory symptoms of Covid.

It wasn't until my toes turned purple that I realized the fatigue & upset stomach I'd had a few weeks earlier wasn't food poisoning at all, but Covid. What seemed to be a very mild case is now turning into a longer set of recurring symptoms--bouts of overwhelming fatigue, nerve damage, loss of smell, cognitive issues."
2021-02-25 20:21:23,"Children are difficult to discuss, and were in fact similarly difficult to plan around during the 1918 flu pandemic. Royal Copeland of NYC, the health commissioner in 1918, fought tooth and nail to keep schools open (and did) whereas Boston and Philadelphia closed schools. NYC had fewer children's deaths. Or so it is said. 
However: CDC does show stats by age group that are worth knowing. People in the age group 0-17 had 11.4% of all diagnosed covid cases, 0.09% of total deaths, so about 3.3% of their total 71 million number caught the disease. Their mortality rate (deaths for the age group overall) were probably around one in 170,000 or 0.0006%. 
That's a tiny number but if it's your child, it's immense; my son had leukemia/stem cell transplant and a covid like bug caused him to have a double lung transplant. What are the odds? Small but terrifying. 
On the other hand, that's actually not a high risk set of statistics, and by and large people below the age of 18 rarely get serious illness. 
The article and from what I've read of the study, does not provide actual stats for serious covid and MIS-C among total cases for children's age groups. 
For what it is worth, we are not seeing recovery rates/survival rates. But, that's a core issue. With an estimate of 4.8 undiagnosed cases per diagnosed case, we may very well have more people resistant now than we know."
2021-02-25 22:11:02,This was interesting.  What is lacking in all articles about Covid illnesses in people is transmission.  How did the children get the disease?  Did they give it to their parents?  More about children without severe cases.  Are there long term effects for them as well?  So many more in-depth studies need to be done.  Part of the confusion for a lot of people would be ameliorated if there were just more studies and in-depth information and on a larger population.
2021-02-25 22:40:32,"""The study evaluated obesity separately from other underlying health conditions and only in patients who were age 2 or older, finding that a somewhat higher percentage of the young people with acute Covid had obesity.""

That was a really interesting study.  But the statement above from the article is misleading in not providing any numbers/context.  It seems to suggest that obesity is a minor issue.

According to Table 1, for both categories (Multi-inflammatory Syndrome and Severe COVID) obesity was a significant issue (36.2% were obese with MIS and 41.8% with Severe COVID.)

As nearly as I can, the obesity rate for 10-year-olds is around 10-15%, so we're talking about roughly three times the normal rate for these kids.

Obesity has also been a risk factor with adults.  It would be interesting to know if there is a difference in the severity of how obesity affects kids and adults in COVID (presumably, adults have more co-morbidities, are experiencing more loss of muscle as they age which impacts their resistance to disease, their immune systems may be less effective, etc.)"

2021-02-25 22:43:40,"I keep reading comments of people comparing Covid to the flu, and saying for kids it's similar. It is NOT. This season, only one child has died of the flu (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm</a>), but over 200 have died of Covid (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex</a>). 
So under similar conditions (e.g., school closures or hybrid settings, people with high-risk kids keeping them home, people wearing masks and social distancing, etc.), Covid seems to be 200 times deadlier than the flu to kids. 
If we ease restrictions, more kids will of course die of the flu, but the rate of kids dying of Covid will also sky-rocket, and based on this years' numbers, they will be hundreds of times higher than the number of kids dying of the flu. Covid is nothing like the flu, not even for kids."

Rather  than suggest there is a disparity understand how complex all this really is. Look up "" immune variation"", a new nano science capacity to show very small but intensely important differences between individuals. 

This penchant for seeing race as a socio-economic issue only is simply reflexive. Biology , much less evolutionary biology  is really a deep drive. But so much easier to remain in the dark. It supports the narrative so why go any further?"

Even Trump acknowledged that if the virus gets the ""right"" person, it is a horrible disease.  Who is the ""right"" person?

To that end, one area of scientific inquiry I would like see research on is if there is some particular family trait (not racial genetics) that make a person more susceptible to COVID disease and worse outcomes? The inquiry would look at infections and outcomes in biologically related individuals who do not live near or socialize with each other.

The other consideration is deliberate ""increased exposure"" in certain communities. (Have you watched the later episodes of Designated Survivor, which, by the way, ended in June 2019?) 

Also, one reason I think we hear several ""experts"" say that this will happen again (a future outbreak) is because of all the medical science being done to develop cures and therapies for cancer using viruses (herpes, HIV, etc.)

But now all you in the media don’t say anything about they history of lying and cover-ups and just praise them for a vaccine that nobody knows how well it works if it even works at all.

I have problems with the cited efficacy rates in the article. The article claims:

“The documents published by the F.D.A. on Wednesday showed that the new vaccine had an overall efficacy rate of 72 percent in the United States and 64 percent in South Africa, where a concerning variant emerged in the fall that is now driving most cases. […]

“The vaccine also showed 86 percent efficacy against severe forms of Covid-19 in the United States, and 82 percent against severe disease in South Africa.”

How can the coronavirus vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson provide higher efficacy rates “against severe forms of [variant] Covid-19” [the second para] than against the known Covid-19 [the first para] in both the U.S. and South Africa ??? My understanding is that the variant forms of Covid-19 are both more transmissible and dangerous to the public. 

There is something wrong here !?!?

Early indicators are this may be the single best vaccine developed out there. Most Americans would never know it but Cuban medicine is exemplary and very advanced in spite of the primitive conditions on the island. If the trial goes well they'll start producing about a million vaccinations a month and they'll be opening up to vaccinate tourists!

It’s a job that requires physical presence, so that is probably part of it, but I think there’s pretty clearly a time coming that all of these folks lose the supplement or their unemployment altogether.

So if the government borrows a few trillion more USD and hands it out to people, those people will have money in their pockets?  A truly radical insight.

Unfortunately, current Democrat policy continues a political ""Munchausen by proxy"" approach that keeps minorities and the poor in a perpetual state of crisis, with just enough ""walking around money"" to buy allegiance.  Generational poverty, bad schools, dangerous streets, lack of opportunity -- all can be blamed on the greedy and heartless GOP, allowing continued exploitation for partisan gain.  (Yes, of course Republicans are also to blame; it is the stupidity of partisan finger-pointing that is the problem here, because it blocks real solutions.)

Economic theory is a boggy wasteland, but one thing we know:  Injecting a lot of ""hot money"" into an economy eventually causes inflationary bubbles that preferentially benefit the well-to-do, leaving workers further behind.  (This happened with Obama's 2009 Economic Recovery Act, a trickle-down windfall for Wall Street.)

More expensive stocks, homes, college tuition, coupled with easy credit -- anybody see a problem with this approach?

Sure, folks may have a few more (borrowed) dollars to spend, but the big ticket items -- homes, college for the kids, 401-Ks, etc. -- will only stretch further out of reach, disproportionately harming the working poor, single family households, and people of color.

And now with a potential $15 per hour rate in a couple of years not being included in the next 'next round of stimulus', we will vote on either no increase, or a much less increase, again favoring those income levels above $75,000, or soon to be a $90,000 base line for income in the not to distant future, further setting back those under your desired income levels."

I wonder, though, about what most readers seem to believe will be the remedy --- spending and, more pointedly, printing more money (very few are buying government debt other than the Fed).  When the money supply expanded by about 25% last year and, with a $1.9 trillion stimulus, will almost certainly do so again, will there ever be enough rich people to tax or tradeoffs is spending to make or future growth to  to pay for what almost every economist acknowledges is an unprecedented amount of spending and printing."

Dr. Bergstrom’s claim that models are not good at prediction are because most of epidemiology has historically spent their days with post-Morten investigations and curve fitting to past epidemics. The key to prediction is focusing on predictable quantities - exact trajectories are difficult because they’re impacted by human behavior, but yours truly successfully predicted the mean & median deaths per-capita at peaks of 3,000 US counties from Montana and South Dakota to Cook, LA, Miami-Dade and Maricopa. This is because the endpoints of epidemics are predictable, and the lack of knowledge about these forecasts (which I don’t share because the epi community is anything but) underlies the uncertainty people like Dr Anderson have about new strains’ trajectories. This is also amplified by the fact that most epidemiology historically has been post-mortem curve fitting and so most epidemiologists have zero training in how to properly work with rolling time series like stock prices where you can’t peak at the future.

Bounds imposed by immunity and seasonality change forecasts immensely, and Bergstrom would find better predictive models if listening to someone who does predictive models (in my case, working in both epidemiology and quantitative finance for 5 years)."

My guess, the answer is: not much longer.  If history has taught us anything, it’s that we don’t learn well from history... we just keep bumping our heads against the wall, telling ourselves it will be different the next time.

Friends of mine, who were careful at beginning of the pandemic but relaxed in Fall because... well CA had defeated the beast, are now talking about socializing again on a large scale because outdoor dining is allowed - so all much be okay. Heck, there is even talk that San Francisco will be allowing indoor dining in the coming weeks.  Moreover, more and more businesses, including my employer, are making plans for a return to office scenario possibly as early as the end of March.  But last time I checked COVID-19 is an airborne virus, and in general people do not like wearing properly fitted masks and keeping social distancing.  In the end this will likely end of being a race between the logistics of getting populations vaccinated and the virus’s ability to thwart our best efforts through its mutations.

Sure both countries are helped by geography, but both have national governments that took leadership positions early on in the crisis, and populations that haven’t largely disputed the science or safety of masks, or cry about the loss of civil liberties because they could no longer crowd into their favorite bar on Friday nights or are required to wear a mask when going inside the grocery store.

Hate to say it as I know if doesn’t accomplish anything, but in America, where we have the world’s highest number of infections and deaths, we have definitely reaped what we sowed.

I have read this fact numerous times now but have never seen an explanation as to why wealthy nations are doing this. Sure, it's great to have some extra vaccine, but a billion extra doses are extreme, to say the least.

Is there any way for these countries to make money by stockpiling a huge supply that won't be needed by their own citizens? 

And if --for example--the excess vaccine is sold off to the highest bidder, who precisely in the United States would benefit from such windfall profits?

And when you have a case like that of Hasan Gokal, MD, who has been charged with a crime for vaccinating 10 people (all of whom are in what are considered compromised populations) rather than throw the expiring doses in the trash, our level of ignorance and intentional cruelty is blatantly on display. 

Think of what we have had to deal with this past year. Most of it avoidable had we not just competent and caring leadership, which thankfully we now have, but also not had sabotage from the  likes of Kushner et, et al.  (Isn’t depraved indifference to human life a crime?)

To stop the virus we must:
1. Continue social distancing.
2. Wear masks
3. Wash hands
4. Avoid crowds
5. Get Vaccinated ASAP
6. Minimize contact with relatives and friends.

As for our Public Health Experts, they need to continue the all hands on deck vaccination programs to get shots in arms.

But Florida which followed Trump and opposite of what NY did, has no such worries and did much better than NY in every respect. 

Why and what is going on? Why NYT is fear mongering everyday? Probably, it is because now they realize that  Trump was right and his management of of coronavirus pandemic was better than any governors and Biden. His push to produce a vaccine in record probably was the best that happened to kill the virus. If NY and CA had followed Trump, they would have been like FL, in a much better shape with lower deaths, lower economic decline, children in school, etc."
2021-02-26 14:33:51,"Dear Apoorva Mandavilli,

I appreciate your lengthy article showing the implications of the variants particularly those with E484K mutation. However, you include a factually incorrect statement ""But it will be many weeks before vaccinations make a dent in the pandemic."" that is likely to color the understanding of most readers. 

As of this morning, 50% of USA population over 65 has been vaccinated according to CNN this morning. As of this morning, the death rate in old age homes has dropped dramatically.

These are FACTS that are much more than ""a dent"" in the pandemic in the USA.

Furthermore, it is more than likely that something approaching 90% of the USA population over 50 will be vaccinated within a month or so.

These facts will have a very large effect on what happens and on the predictions of the models of the epidemic.

Please correct your errors.

COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign in it's evolutionary fit quest to be fruitful and multiply by invading and occupying the DNA host cells of African primate apes aka people. 

COVID-19 is merely acting according to it's still baffling and mysterious nature. While people are also acting according to their nature aka denial, greed and hubris.

 COVID-19 currently 'knows' far more about us than we know about it. Our best medical doctors and scientists have to frequently admit their ignorance.  While pompous politicians and pundits prance, preen, parade and pretend to ' know'  COVID-19.

With 500,000+ dead Americans some people need to be held personally accountable by civil and criminal justice."
2021-02-26 14:23:41,"A classic case of anthropomorphism in this headline. The coronavirus, of course, is not plotting anything. It is not conscious because viruses are not sentient beings.

Headline writing is regularly problematic at the Times. I wish the editors would just focus on writing accurate headers instead of grabbing for attention."
2021-02-26 14:07:19,"The virus is a particle. A little RNA enclosed in a layer of protein and fat. It doesn’t think, plan or scheme. It reproduces in your body’s cells, gets released into your air passages, expelled by breathing, talking, coughing, or sneezing. Then it drifts around in the air randomly, carried by air currents. It is not very accurate when it copies itself inside your cells and some of the copies have random errors in the RNA. HENCE, VARIANTS. The variant occurs because the virus is being copied in your cells and copies with mistakes occur.  The more cases of COVID, the more copying of this virus, the more chances for mistakes in RNA copying, the more variants..


Some variants may have changes in the spike protein that make them attach to your cells better, hence increased infectiousness. The variants may produces spikes that aren’t recognized by antibodies produced by vaccines, hence potential infections in vaccinated people.

The way to deal with this IS THE SAME. 1. Get vaccinated 2. Social distance to reduces spread 3.  Wear masks. It’s not rocket science. It’s not politics.  It’s caring for your neighbor, your community, your economy, your church, your school. That’s pretty brain dead. Doesn’t take a lot of intelligence, just viewing others as if they were human beings."
2021-02-26 15:53:21,"Unfortunately the number of people who continue to flout mask wearing and social distancing guidelines and vaccine hesitancy on the part of too many people will make it hard, if not impossible, to suppress coronavirus to the point where we can all resume a normal life. Our former president undoubtedly drove the reaction against mask wearing, distrust in science, and politicalization of common sense practices such as social distancing. But there seems to be something in the American character that emphasizes ""individualism"" - even when those individual decisions have an enormous negative impact on others. The fact that a significant percentage (estimated at up to 30%) of health care workers have refused to be vaccinated is even more worrisome, as these are people who, whatever their role, have seen the devastation of this pandemic. The Biden administration is doing as well as can be expected in terms of increasing the supply of the vaccines, but still needs to put more emphasis on getting everyone vaccinated - particularly in minority communities."
2021-02-26 12:07:28,"The very rapid development and regulatory approval of the vaccines is one of the great achievements in human history.   One year ago, we were all told by the ""experts"" that no vaccine had reached widespread deployment in less than 6 years, and that doing so in only 3 years would be a massive win.  Optimistic skeptics of these experts predictions were berated and called science deniers.   Yet here we are!!  We need to examine how this great accomplishment was executed, all the steps involved, so we know for the inevitable next disaster."

It is way too soon! We're still under 10% for full immunization, and we have multiple variants on the rise. I guess all I can hope is that enough people finally come around to wearing their mask (correctly, I might add), and keeping their distance. We literally could've been done with this in under a month if we have just imposed an actual quarantine, yet here we are a year later, still wracking up needless deaths."

I hate wearing masks but it beats the alternative, and I seem to have a great immune system. 

But inoculations are still unlikely to let us visit our daughter in New Zealand whom we haven’t seen in 2 years, or go to our second home in Canada, where we haven’t gone in a year and a half.

They had been in lock-down for  111 days - less than 4 months - and in October had infection rates in the single digits.   It wasn't easy and it wasn't fun.   It was necessary.   

The question is, can American's behave?    I think the answer has been made clear:  no.   People are tired of masks and quarantining and they have their rights!   I hope the prediction of a summer time frame for sorta-starting back to normal will turn out to be true, but I am a skeptic.  I think it  will be a long long time before the coronavirus is contained.   Meanwhile, I'll just keep putting those blue masks in the washer, that way they're not a line item in the budget."

Preparations that were in place to combat a pandemic virus, if one should emerge, were dismantled by the Trump administration. Trump labeled the virus first a hoax and then that it would just disappear by April of last year—half a million deaths ago. Trump made fun of masks and seldom wore one. Efforts to roll out vaccines were disorganized and ineffective. As a country, we have led the world in deaths from the virus. 

Trump's lack of leadership when it was most needed has had a tragic effect on so many families. Our economy has suffered a a devastating blow. How sad that he was ever put in a position where his failures could cause so much damage to our entire population."

Masks and distancing have been complied with since the beginning - - if anything they are getting less compliance over time.

Can I hug my dad who is 95 and lives 2 miles away and have only seen 2x in a year (both times outside and 12 feet apart for 15min)? This week, his truly wonderful care facility announced a return to “in person inside socially distanced scheduled short visits in some designated spot” some time in March. It’s something and progress but he was underwhelmed, saying that until I can pop in for a visit every day again with the dog, who collects pets from every room along the hallway, it still won’t be over. 

So no, the end may be out there but definitely around at least one big corner or two. 

And that’s before factoring in the anti-mask, anti-vaccine, anti-social distancing, anti-anything that comes from the Biden administration. Mark my words, they’re going xxxx this up for the rest of us."
2021-02-26 17:25:53,"After spending the better part of last year telling us that any vaccine produced under the Trump Administration should be questioned, now Biden and Harris are struggling to convince people that the vaccine is safe.  They shouldn't be surprised since they did so much to promote vaccine skepticism.

Between April and Dec 2020 the share of Americans who told pollsters they were likely to consent to vaccination declined from 74% to 56%, even though Pfizer and Moderna released strong vaccine safety and effectiveness results prior to the second survey.  Biden, Harris, and many other Democrats are to blame for that."

Hopefully, the vaccines will reduce severe illness and drastically lower mortality but new variants will emerge. In the near future, we will likely need to vaccinate against these like the many influenza strains. Regarding behavior change, the epidemic shows how selfish and wimpy many American are that they can't wear a mask in public and limit social interactions. Imagine these people going through the 1918 pandemic, the depression and two world wars.  It's shameful what some of us have become."

2021-02-26 17:48:56,"It's always ""a few more weeks."" I think there's a growing addiction here to bad news and behavior control. 

This latest admonishment, like many others, downplays two key facts:

1. The most vulnerable populations are being vaccinated relatively quickly, which explains the rapid decline in deaths and serious illnesses. Getting everyone vaccinated would be great, but it's not clear we need that, or anything close to it, to effectively end the worst suffering of the pandemic. 

2. Many experts believe the actual number of people infected so far is four to ten times higher than the number of official cases (those that have tested positive). Even at the low end of that range, we're a lot closer to national immunity than the official numbers suggest. And given that we are NOT seeing big numbers of people infected a second or third time, some form of durable immunity is clearly happening. 

I'm not suggesting we eschew masks where appropriate. But we can eschew the pessimism... and cheerfully root for openings, not lockdowns."
2021-02-26 17:49:17,"This war against the Covid 19 virus and all its strange mutations is complex.

First, it seems we are fighting a moving target with the new mutations which are all more contagious and deadlier than its parent virus. It now appears young people are just as susceptible to the mutations as older folks; so being young is no longer a benefit.

Second, we are fighting a war against the deniers: republicans and people that want to use common sense approaches like wearing a mask and socially distancing as a political weapon.

Third, we are fighting against parents, students, and everyone else that think it is safe to open schools to in-school classes; they could not be more wrong.

Fourth, we are fighting the lack of a unified approach to fighting the pandemic and allowing governors to make their own decisions like opening up restaurants, bars, sporting venues and other social gathering places.

We will reap what we sow, and I guarantee it will not be good. 

I suspect we will be 'fighting' this pandemic for the next few years at least, until the population and government take it seriously and band together to treat it as a real war."

No one is perfect. They were slow to appreciate the peril. China bears a huge amount of responsibility as well. The value of masking was misstated, we had limited stockpiles of PPE. Vaccine production was however outstanding but production and distribution has been disappointing and the bureaucracy is standing in the way. Time is of the essence. People are still dying but the FDA is taking too much time to review the data on the J and J vaccine. It should have been approved 4-5 days ago. Days count. The Pfizer vaccine provides immunity after one dose. Free it up to get to herd immunity, then administer the second dose if needed. The Ad Council is coming out with PSAs. Finally! but without the A team. John Leguizamo; we need ARod, LeBron and Michael Jordan and Oprah Winfrey..Biden is giving it his all but he can't do it alone."

We are at the epicenter of COVID and may yet generate a number of more deadly home grown COVID mutations. The longevity of immunity generated by the current vaccines is unknown. Furthermore, they seem unlikely to produce sterilizing immunity which means that immunized asymptomatic individuals may well infect others. The current vaccines do not lend themselves to producing antibodies to two or more strains of COVID with a single course of vaccination. The J&J vaccine is one shot and done because of the virus used to harbor COVID RNA inserts. 
From what we have seen so far, COVID will likely resemble Influenza and require annual immunization against circulating strains. There are about seven billion active COVID laboratories in the world, any one of which may produce a more deadly COVID mutant that may emigrate to America, even with a border wall.  It is disingenuous and misleading to proclaim that we have a ""chance to stop it for good""."

It is really astounding to read repeated descriptions of the coronavirus by reporters, science writers and scientists who should know better, as ""lurking"", ""hiding"",""attacking"". ""retreating"", ""stalking"", etc.

These popular descriptions of viruses, and particularly the coronavirus, only distort and confuse the public as to what this infectious organism is and how it's characteristics have to be accurately understood in order to deal with its infections.

To read most descriptions of viruses, they do not confirm that any virus does not walk, swim, or fly, nor does it have a brain to conjurer up all the bad metaphors media editors have been negligent to correct.

I have to read way too much between the lines here to understand the experts' opinions.

My interpretation?  Scientists expect infections to rise among young people as restrictions ease, yet increasing vaccine rates will cause hospitalizations and deaths to continue to decline among the elderly and vulnerable.

A significant number of us still do not want to wear a mask, social distance, get the vaccination, or stop gathering in large audiences.

I have not seen a single case of influenza since October in my primary care practice and neither have my colleagues in our over 100 doctor practice.

""But young people drive the spread of the virus, and most of them have not yet been inoculated."" 

I believe what's *actually* driving the spread of the virus is people having contact with other people -- especially indoors and without masks.

Instead of circling the drain, we need to just vaccinate everyone in order of risk. This simple chart from the CDC says it all:

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html</a>

Some highlights:

Compared to kids ages 5 to 17 (the group with the lowest death risk, around 1 in 100,000 cases), here's the increased rate of death for other age groups when infected with Covid:

People in their 20s: 15 TIMES more likely to die
People in their 30s: 45 TIMES more likely to die
People in their 40s: 130 TIMES more likely to die
People in their 50s: 400 TIMES more likely to die

From their, the increased risk is in the THOUSANDS. The difference is simply unthinkably large.

Vaccinate by age. Save lives. Maintain capacity in the hospital/healthcare system."

2021-02-26 18:16:10,"""Widespread caution""???

What a joke!  

The virus has starkly shown that our collective belief that we're the most intelligent species on Earth is a bitter joke. The number of people who refuse to wear masks and strictly adhere to social distancing belies that myth, once and for all. 

The decisions to reopen schools is just the latest evidence: young people may only be affected to the degree of a common cold, yet there's nothing to prevent them from being active, unknown carriers, thus transmitting COVID to those who are far more at risk, e.g., anyone over the age of sixty. 

If we *were* at the apex of Big Brain utilization, every one of us would have a long term cache of canned food, and would have simply hunkered down -- *never* leaving home for sixty days.  By then the possibility of virus transmission would be nil.

Of course most would recoil at the notion of truly isolating -- ""how to make money???""  Hint: money won't do you any good if you're six feet under. 

It's no wonder that if any extraterrestrials have ever visited our neighborhood they took a wide pass past our not-so-bright species."

Its mentally incongruent in this particular context: A confusing contradiction in terms. 

Thankfully, normal doesn’t exist anymore. Normal was dysfunctional and upside down to begin with. Why anyone would want to replicate dysfunction is beyond me. Yet, it is a financial and epicurean comfort zone for many people. A comfort zone that does need disruption and the virus provides that wake up call. Yet, many are still not listening. 

People still underestimate this virus’s ability to mutate and thrive. The big questions that will need to be addressed are still one, two, three years in the future with a mutating virus that has learned to sidestep vaccine treatments and the times delays associated with inoculations worldwide.

Greek Row never changed its behavior since this all started.  We have had two COVID deaths in my building since Nov. 1 and still, my neighbors run around the hallways back and forth to each other's apartments and the elevator with nary a mask. I can only think of 4 of us who wear a mask in the entire building.

Add to that how many people on planet earth will not be vaccinated either by choice or living in a poorer country which means the virus can keep attempting to create another variant that doesn't work with whatever vaccine you may have gotten and I fully expect that we will be told every year that we need a new COVID shot to go with the new flu shot.   

So far, just over 8% of my county (over age 16) has been fully vaccinated and even if we double the figure (doubtful) I still don't think I will even be eligible for my first shot before the 4th of July.

Every time I see Fauci or Biden or others like this author declare we will soon have enough vaccines for everyone they are ignoring the obvious truth that  large share of the general population will never get the vaccine.
The other obvious truth that is more subtle is that an even larger share of the population including many who are vaccinated will not be willing to ever go back to life as normal dining at restaurants or bars or working out at gyms or traveling or even working from the office.  Like me they plan to get vaccinated but are not willing to be a sitting duck when the other shoe falls from a new mutant variant that defies the vaccine or the next big thing that comes along.

I was stationed in Indonesia for 10 years during SARS and H1N1 － it did not stop me from traveling.  And I was hardly such a big wig.

Sure, some of these photo ops might have to be curtailed but there is no substitute for in person interaction, period.

For all the talk about how antagonistic Trump was towards Mexico he worked very well with their government and current president.

WW2 ended over 70 years and the US taxpayer is still bankrolling a lot of the military posture in Europe and since we admonished them about a few things, now the US is a bull in a China shop who hurt Europeans feelings and have to apologize.

The FDA has been suffering from TDS (thalidomide derangement syndrome) for 60 years, delaying the availability of important, sometimes life-saving, treatments and vaccines.  
Including vaccines against the pandemic.

The several months spent on Phase III trials of the pandemic vaccines could have been skipped entirely.  We knew from the Phase II trials that severe side-effects were rare or nonexistent, and immunoassays gave good evidence that useful immunity was produced.  The worst that could have gone wrong is that immunity might have been less than the 90--100% it turned out to be.

2021-02-23 17:46:13,"This is excellent news for 2022, but for this year we need to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible with the existing vaccines.

It is looking increasingly like COVID will be a multi-year fixture of worldwide diseases, with a new variant each year like influenza.

In that situation, most of the public would have partial immunity from exposure or immunization to previous vaccines, but an annual COVID booster would be needed to prevent the revival of a full-blown pandemic from a new variant.

It may still be possible to defeat COVID worldwide, but only if everyone worldwide gets vaccinated.  President Biden should work with allies and international agencies to promote this, but I’m not sure if it will be feasible."
2021-02-23 19:37:01,"This is rather misleading. Coronaviruses and COVID-19 are unfortunately able to mutate like many other viruses do. Regardless of the fast vaccine development and ability to quickly adapt to new variants, it will still always be too slow.

For example, by the time the next variants become epidemiologically relevant (their numbers will soon be climbing), not even close to the majority of the US will have been vaccinated with the first available vaccines. That means everybody will have to get the newly developed vaccines. So a new round of vaccination will start. But before everyone is even vaccinated, they'll have to adapt again and start over again.

The authorities unfortunately aren't telling people this. The pharmaceutical companies are rubbing their proverbial hands together."

Could we be creating super viruses by the over use of vaccines just like we we created super bugs by the over use of antibiotics.  Possibly there is a natural equilibrium in the world of viruses and  man's actions have upset the natural balance..    The way we raise our livestock and poultry, in confinement and concentrated conditions, lead to increased possibilities of zoonotic transmission.  Maybe it's time to look  beyond bats or wild pangolins as the originators of viruses and look at our domestic animals as a vector to transmit infectious viruses.

I see tremendous potential for harm, and I see a basic erosion of people's free will. This smells more like China than the US.

The combination seems poised to enhance, perhaps markedly and dangerously, income inequality.

It seems now clearer and clearer that a universal basic income is a crying need. The pandemic induced our political leadership to experiment with a quasi-UBI, and it worked brilliantly, despite failures in administration and inadequate levels of money. Time now for an intentional, well-thought-out version, to make sure the coming boom does not strand millions of Americans on an island of unemployment, despair, and hopelessness."

In a place like Manhattan, it can be transformational...converted offices into (more) affordable housing.  What happens to cities in the north when folks realize they can work from a warmer climate down south...permanently.

It takes a nosedive. Where is it losing momentum? In the hyperinflated assets of the top 5%. Real estate, market equities, bitcoin...everything’s run up because the money printing machine at the Fed has allowed the rich to thrive while the poor have gotten hammered.

Heck, I just heard on a radio news report that NYC subway ridership has begun to ""recover"".  The deeper data though shows that ""recovery"" means that ridership has risen to 30% of the pre-pandemic levels.

Should be start now to boast about a ""boom"" in NYC because subway ridership has risen but to still less than a third of past levels?

Without a doubt, as we emerge from the pandemic disruption economic activity will increase -- and likely do so in a dramatic fashion given how low we've sunk.

People who lost jobs will now begin to find new employment.  And when they do so, they will begin to spend again increasing business activity.

But to characterize that as a ""boom"" rather than a modest and slow ""recovery"" seems to be a triumph of journalistic hyperbole over common sense."

My informal survey suggests that most people will resume travel and interaction after the second dose of vaccine has produced the projected immunity. The theory is, if they get sick anyway, it will be no worse than the common cold. Of course, without actual data we can only speculate but it's apparent had the prior administration not encouraged reckless behavior, we would have attained this level of recovery much sooner. According to an NBC survey, almost half of all republicans interviewed still perceive Trump as the head of their party which means the reeducation process has more to go. It's impossible for the nation to resume full productivity when so many people reject the notion that Trump was the cause of their misery, not their salvation."
2021-02-22 13:27:36,"The Fed just issued a warning concerning Post-COVID meltdown (stock prices too high, real estate prices may collapse, a mountain of corporate debt, etc.).  This article provides a strong contrast.

Yes, CORONA shut down cities and slowed the economy. But Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy did too.  New Orleans took years to recover from Katrina. But New York was largely up and running within a year of Sandy. 

Why the difference?

With Katrina, population displacement crippled New Orleans. 

Sandy did not depopulate a region. Officials set aside political differences to present unified leadership. With greater optimism, business leaders got back into the game quickly.

CORONA has not depopulated urban centers or created physical devastation (note that NYC - Manhattan in particular - may have suffered some loss). We don’t need to rebuild infrastructure to house the economic engine. The machine is intact. 

We remain in our communities and we are anxiously awaiting the “all clear.” We want a return to normalcy, the ability to go out for a veggie burger, get a haircut, see a movie, travel, and get back to our careers. These simple individual desires aggregate to a massive economic force. 

Businesspersons should forge ahead as the country reopens. Those who invested early in rebuilding after Katrina and Sandy were well rewarded.

Six months relying on just the two vaccines already on the market, not including the J&J product that should be available imminently.  Broad stimulus now is an economic transfer but not a rescue for the economy, and unnecessarily ballooning our already frightening long term public debt. Democrats ought to pull back from their broader based stimulus plans and push a more targeted stimulus supporting the state and local governments and the industries like restaurants, hospitality, live entertainment, and brick and mortar retail that are in crisis. The most we should be doing for direct payments to individuals is extending unemployment insurance and increasing it closer to full replacement of wages—not bonus payments to individuals that largely get saved and do, at least for some, discourage going back to work. Republicans should drop their political objections to state and local government support—state and local governments have been hit very hard by lost tax revenue, and their revenue is more tightly tied to their ability to support local jobs than the federal government."

But the fact is that no one is entitled to anything.  That is a poignant reality that I grew up with in the 1960s.  My family was very, very  close to being on the poverty line and I could take NOTHING for granted.

High grade cards that once sold for a few hundred dollars are now fetching several thousand dollars, like a Gem Mint 10 Michael Jordan rookie card that gaveled down well over $200,000 this past weekend.

Yes there will me some splurges, some vacations, but I don't see people going back to normal activities and routines. 

Employment will rebound into other markets, but spending will remain a bit less than before Covid.

People will continue movie streaming vs. going to movies which is one example of lost employment and expenditure at the movies. Some will return to the movies, but not in numbers prepandemic. Numbers were declining before pandemic; this just accelerated its decline.

I also have not believed the claims by restaurants and businesses that have closed due to the economic downturn that those closures are permanent (at least, not all of them that claim this): commercial rents are down, and they will remain so for at least some period after the pandemic is over (since landlords will be eagerly seeking tenants), so restaurants and stores are going to be re-opening as quickly as they can.

In these regards, once the pandemic is over, the economy is most likely to have a huge initial surge, particularly the hospitality industry (restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels, Broadway, etc.).

The only thing that may adversely affect this is how adversely the situation has affected individuals' ABILITY to partake in the resurgent economy.

And yet, the media, marketing, advertising and technology inundating our daily lives…portrays a standard of living far, far above the reality. We need to get real about the truths and realities of our society and our economy. 

Having observed the post-Great Recession period, I'm not confident we will handle this challenge any better, even with the support of the Biden rescue package. 

Put more bluntly…I don’t think we can trust American employers to do their part. Full stop.

Millions of Americans were left behind after the Great Recession and yet, they kept hearing in the media how “great” the economy was; it never got “great” for them.

Now that Covid is receding, sales are improving further.  No doubt, there is a tremendous amount of pent up demand.  Consumers have been under a pall of doom and gloom for four years.  Then Covid hit and everyone pulled in.  Now with the double boost of calm, competence and stability in the White House coupled with the breath and freedom of getting rid of the virus, things are really opening up.

Because I'm making money, I'm spending  more.  This is how stimulation works.  This is why the Republicans are so terrified of the Biden stimulus package.  It will further jump start the economy and it could finally take off.  The Trump economy was great for the biggest of business, but lousy for the little ones.  The Biden plans will help the small operations, i.e. middle class people, and that will cost the Republicans votes.  Big business will prosper even more, more votes.

Bobbing one's hair and raising skirts were just the physical manifestations of a bone deep desire to throw off a decade of crippling suffering. 

So yes. We will see both an economic boom and a social one, one that may rival the excesses of the Roaring Twenties.

When we speak of booms, though, it's a sobering reminder of the divides that continue to bedevil us. Please, let's remember and work to redress the harrowing economic fissures that continue to maroon so many in misery. 

While the usual suspects will make money hand over fist, millions of people will be losing homes, jobs, and, as a direct result, lives. Some will be driven to the kind of despair that have them stepping off rooftops, others will sink deeper into the trench of endless labor that, no matter how many jobs they work, never lets them see daylight.

I hope with all my might we become a society that allows the pandemic to teach us to be more humane, just, and fair. For once, could we please have a boom in human capital?

Some affluent households have pent up demand but workers who lost their jobs have debt.  

Students of all ages lost parts of their education and what might have been their first work experience, and at least two to three years of graduates will have their careers stunted.

That many people survived the financial crisis is because of dramatically increased unemployment benefits and direct federal payments.  People finally understood that an individual's lost job was not his or her fault but a system's failure. If the economy rebounds strongly, it will because of a  stronger safety net."

A trillion   in savings, probably another half trillion still unspent from the last stimulus bill, 1.9 trillion in the new stimulus bill, the airlines, hotels, movie theaters, live attendance at sporting events, social gatherings, restaurants and bars are largely closed, rents and mortgages can be suspended etc. There is huge pent up demand. We don’t expect inflation?"
2021-02-22 16:30:21,"Where is this economic ‘growth’ going to come from? US economic decline began in the mid-1970s and accelerated by the COVID 19 pandemic. None of the structural problems giving rise to Great Financial Crisis (GFC) 2007-2008 have been resolved. These include- multiple tax cuts for the wealthy, attacks on labor and job out-sourcing, financial deregulation and spending astronomical amounts of taxpayer money on the Pentagon and looming strategic debacles in Afghanistan (longest running war in US history), Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen (Iran next?). The Pentagon is incapable of extricating itself from these conflicts, as doing so is an admission of failure and by extension military weakness. US economic decline has progressed to the point where the very survival of the American Empire requires continuous debt monetization [government borrowing money from the central bank, which, in the process of buying the debt, creates new money- aka printing money] to prop up Wall St. and insolvent banks and subsidize the Pentagon and war. Since 2009, Wall St. has  been buoyed by the injection of circa $40 trillion of ultra-cheap money from the FED. Unfortunately, the next financial crisis will far more serious than 2008 as debt levels are far higher. Bottom line- the average American family is facing a very bleak economic future."
2021-02-22 16:30:25,"Mr. Casselman compares the prospective ""boom"" to the post-World War II period. Americans back then were indeed sitting on piles of cash they were eager to spend. But there are significant differences. First, labor unions came out of the war in a strong position to bargain for workers. Second, the defense industry provided high paying jobs as we entered the Cold War. And the construction industry boomed with the demand for houses, schools, parks, etc., to accommodate the massive baby boom generation. Today, unions are weak, the improving business environment won't necessarily mean high-paying jobs, and there is no baby boom to ensure continuing demand. Thus, as many others have noted, the spoils will mostly go to those at the top."
2021-02-22 16:33:56,"Lots of cash. It's either a boom, inflation, or another stock market bubble. The cash has to go somewhere. 

If we can organize and produce to spend the money sustainably we'll see prosperity. 

If we gobble up all the goods/services without finding a way to make more (which includes sustainability) we'll get upward price pressure. 

If we let the rich hoover it all up and dump it into financial instruments we'll just see more overvaluation and nothing substantive will change."

I suspect traditional outlets will see a bit of a bump, at least for the short while.  My greater concern, however, is the increasing number of robberies and break-ins occurring in my neighborhood, since the pandemic, as well as an increase in the number of families asking for assistance at our church; literally holding signs for assistance, with their children, as the congregants depart from service. On second thought, maybe I'll skip the shopping."
2021-02-22 17:00:00,"There are two sides to this picture.  These is a huge pile of pent up savings and there will be a boom in areas such as travel, dining, etc., when things open up.  At the same time, there is a proportionately small portion of the population that has been severely impacted by the pandemic.  A small portion is a large number of people.  If you look at unemployment changes, perhaps ten million people were significantly impacted.  Let's take the proposed relief bill, $1.9 trillion, and give this to the impacted parties.  Whoops!  Doing this would give each of the ten million $190,000!  We can't do that, lets limit each one to $1,400.  Where does the rest of the money go....?"

Yes, millions who cannot get hired, are very desperate and will even steal to eat, and feed family these days of rage. Reality hurts those with little money."
2021-02-22 17:08:51,It's a mixed bag for everyone and it seems partly dolled out randomly. I have friends who lost their jobs but have received all the stimulus and maxed out unemployment who are wealthier after not working for almost a year and other friends who have lost their jobs but were unable to get any unemployment and now are barely hanging on. The only thing that is certain is that those white collar workers who had their jobs moved online were the ones most positively impacted by the virus' economic effects.
2021-02-22 17:37:11,"The pandemic will permanently change the market and how our society spends its money.

In particular, markets that rely on mass attendance and participation for the same amount of time may suffer. Thus, I anticipate theaters, sports events, and conferences will hurt.  Also mass worship. 

Because of the lingering, lethal virus, with rapid recurring mutations that may resist current vaccines, attendees will naturally be cautious. Unguarded attendance will cause a repeat surge in cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and long-term disability.

At the same time, virtual meetings will surge. In my medical care department, all of our meetings are done by Zoom, and I do not see that changing anytime soon. In part, the convenience. For national medical conferences, virtual rather than on-site meetings will keep costs markedly low, which will hurt the travel and hospitality fields.

The latter changes will continue due to reduced tourism. Why go to NYC when the museums, theaters, and restaurants will either be closed or require much reduced attendance? 

Direct release of films to streaming video services will permanently curb movie theater attendance, due to the cost savings and convenience (think of bathroom breaks, captions, pause, replay functions).

In contrast, groceries, pharmacies, and department stores will be robust, because the public will adopt safe distancing, avoiding congregating, masks, and hurry though purchases in-person. Mail-ordering will continue to surge."
2021-02-22 17:41:53,"Or, maybe something else will happen in the unpredictable future. Economists are particularly bad at this kind of prognostication. I would allude to the characterization of economics as ""the dismal science"" but that gives real science a bad name."
2021-02-22 17:48:04,"While the likelihood of a post-pandemic boom is well reasoned in the article, there is no discussion of commercial real estate and the effect of a growth in vacancies’ drag on recovery.  Many employers have moved to remote work arrangements, and many are reportedly permanently closing their offices and are not planning to reopen them.  If this is the case, then there will be a further reduction in demand for commercial property, creating a major sink-hole in the recovery, including depressed property values, loan defaults and threats to banks’ solvency."
2021-02-22 19:27:58,"A major player likely to be left behind by the boom: Uncle Sam.   While belaboring ""liberals"" for wanting to defund the police, self-styled 'conservatives' have worked ceaselessly for four decades to defund the only policing they have to fear: the Internal Revenue Service.  Witness today's Supreme Court decision for an example of how reluctant the economically advantaged are to have light shown on the role the IRS could again play - if adequately funded - in building a resilient society while maintaining some level of the equity they seem to fear so greatly."

Some people don't really need more money, but many need more than $1400 just to get even with rent, especially those unemployed or underemployed due to Covid.  More targeting might make sense, but how would that be done?   Tax returns, readily available to the government, don't tell the whole story.  Retirees may have sheltered most of their income in IRAs or other vehicles, showing little or no taxable income even though they have good-sized estates. Bottom line: we need to help individuals as we help the economy--that's the whole point."

2021-02-19 11:40:56,"The shortage of second shots is real, and really frustrating.

I got appointments for first shots for me and my wife after spending literally dozens of hours on the phone because our local hospital, a  branch of the famous Cleveland Clinic, did not have or was not using the means to book shots on-line.

After a couple of weeks Cleveland Clinic on-line booking was finally activated and we got our first shots. We were told our second shots would be booked at the clinic as we were leaving, but they refused to  book us, and told us we were on our own to find second shots.

After several days and a few dozen more hours on the phone and on-line I found us second shots at another Cleveland Clinic branch 2 1/2 hours’ drive each way from where we lived, a taxing trip for someone about to turn 80.

When I explained our problem to the Cleveland Clinic doctor who gave us our first shot, he refused to reply to my email and merely had the distant CC branch send me a reminder to show up for the second shot as scheduled.

The entire vaccine roll-out has been a genuine mess that does not seem to be getting better, and the fault lies not only with local, state and federal agencies. When a supposedly top-tier hospital like Cleveland Clinic takes weeks and months to get its act together, I think we must consider adding hospitals to the list of those that are part of the problem."

This whole pandemic has been so politicized and the response so corrupted I don't believe a single thing out of their lying mouths. I have seen vaccine rollouts over the decades and never anything like this before. An absolute disgrace and there is no way this is all attributable to Trump which is why I have zero faith in Biden, congress or local officials. We are all on our own."
2021-02-19 11:48:52,"I know that people complain that everything gets blamed on trump but I've worked in places with a crazy, mean boss and in that situation innovation and common sense vanish.

Remember when he threaten to stop ventilators from going to NY?  Remember he was going to help only the states that were 'nice' to him?   Just the fact that there is an adult who is good at this job and is not vindictive in the White House is a game changer.  You no longer think everything will change with a tweet."

Every clinician knows that expensive and hard to get medicines are hoarded and stored  in basements specified nursing floors, offices and key people know where they are.  This is especially true because of the tight purse strings of for profit nursing homes or should I say those that treat humans like commodities to be traded. When I discovered that (and many other things in nursing homes) I was astounded. 
Controlled substances are always locked on the nurses carts,
But vaccines in a pandemic is another issue."

2021-02-19 12:15:38,"The early vaccine distribution efforts were too chaotic with no transparency, and the federal government did not want to take any responsibility for providing vaccines in a predictable and consistent manner that would allow local distributors to efficiently plan and execute their distributions. Under such circumstances, it was understandable that some stocks would be squirreled away at various levels as buffer inventories against supply shocks. 

With the supply chains now more established, hopefully the federal government will now step up and maintain a centralized buffer inventory and guarantees local authorities and distributors predictable and consistent weekly supplies, which would make local buffer stocks unnecessary and cut down the waitlists."
2021-02-19 12:16:08,"This reminds me of a story my statistics professor told about the US blood supply.  It used to be that hospitals wouldn't schedule a surgery unless and until they could allocate the blood that might be needed. However many surgeries were regularly postponed or cancelled. This resulted in a nationwide ""blood shortage"" when in fact there was a huge excess of blood which would never be used. Perhaps someone with direct knowledge of this can comment, I think the solution was to be smarter about scheduling when the blood was required, like 24 hours before the surgery. All of a sudden there was a huge excess of blood supply."
2021-02-19 11:41:55,"The lack of management information systems to track the manufacturer-to-arm supply chain coupled with  systemic management failures are not surprising given the pandemic’s magnitude. Hoarding is a natural instinct, witness the shortages of toilet paper during the onset of Covid-19. The initiative of the young doctor cited in this article, is proof positive that health officials with leadership skills make a difference. One takeaway is evident. As a society, we must invest in public health and ongoing crisis training on a par with national defense. We already know the cost in lives and damage to our economy stemming from a global pandemic. Or are we going to roll the dice in the hope that COVID-19 was an aberration."
2021-02-19 11:54:16,As a native NYer I am asking NYState leadership to get vaccines upstate. I am frustrated that my senior parents are still on a waiting list when the state rollout site just opened up the list to those younger. My parents cannot find anywhere with a vaccine appointment within an hour’s drive of their northern home for the next six months. Unacceptable.
2021-02-19 11:50:22,"I’ve been trying to get a slot for my wife for awhile now. Since the wait list is about 6 weeks that would coincide with the end of her chemo treatments, her preferred timeline. After Cuomo opened up the eligibility requirements a second time it’s almost impossible to get an appointment through NYS’s website. Unless you are willing to travel 456 miles to SUNY Potsdam from the city. There are always slots open there so why not ship some of their doses to more populated parts of the state?"
2021-02-19 12:05:55,"To whatever extent this article shows Virginia catching up to the situation, these dynamics will soon change. I'm imagining 8 weeks from now when the Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) one shot vaccine will be available. States will praticlly want to phase out the 2 shot vaccines. Continuing them, will be a poor allocations of human assets. A second shot, a month later means you need to double the number of shot-givers every month, otherwise the effort is slowing exponentially. They will need to allow PCPs, and Doc-in-the-box clinics give take up some of the efforts too, perhaps giving the 2 shot doses to them, to manage private appointments. They should also consider going 24/7 with innoculations, especially with the JnJ shots. Right now, this whole thing operates like ""concierge medicine"", the streamlining is yet to come."
2021-02-19 12:08:25,"This looks like a common inventory control problem. Why didn’t we tap into the expertise of supply chain experts at Walmart or Amazon? Why didn’t we mandate their knowhow to set up and run the distribution process?

Oh, yeah, Trump was in charge then."
2021-02-19 12:20:25,"I believe the second doses should be reserved once a person receives the first dose. As Mr. Cuomo said, a reserved dose should be considered as used.
NJ  has had a really really bad rollout with over 50 websites. Tech savvy people are making multiple appointments at different websites as backups.
I am over 75 and four weeks ago got my first Moderna shot in a north Jersey hospital with an appointment 4 weeks later for the second shot. The evening before my appointment, the hospital called that they need to reschedule because they don't have vaccine supply. The hospital chain website says it ""manages its supply to ensure the second booster shot is available"", so much for its management. Earliest reschedule was a week later than the 4-week recommended period. So, I am waiting for another week worrying there isn't a snow storm and I don't get sick or I don't get a call to reschedule again. 
Some will say the CDC says up to 42 days period between second and first shot is okay. I don't trust the CDC at all. No one is showing data telling me effect of increased time on efficacy because no one knows. CDC adjusts its recommendations to suit which way the wind is blowing. An example is when a year ago, knowing there is shortage of masks for hospital workers, they recommended general public doesn't need to wear masks. How many died because of this ""recommendation""?
Very disappointed in New Jersey government. A simple centralized appointment system would have avoided this misery."
2021-02-19 12:02:47,These vaccines are federally funded. It’s time for the federal government to step in and be responsible for the distribution and administration of the vaccines.
2021-02-19 12:18:35,"All media channels should be quantifying the costs of storing vaccines and reporting on this continuing absurdity. First there is the cost of acquiring, placing and powering the storage location. Second, and more significantly, the cost to the average estimated recipient of not getting the vaccine. Considering the vaccines are being produced at scale everyday, storing vaccines is absurd and immoral. Bottom line: storing or hoarding vaccines is killing people and wasting millions of dollars."
2021-02-19 12:25:06,"Here in MI our suburban friends are traveling to the city Rite Aid stores to get vaccines--kind of defeats the purpose of trying to get the vaccines to those in Detroit.  We've tried to schedule online with the drugstores and their IT systems are not set up for this.  Instead of indicating which stores have the vaccine available, you have to entering different locations to see if availability pops up.  It's a big mess!"

We ceased to be a serious country years ago."
2021-02-19 12:28:54,"I have thought all along that as vaccinations increased and all the ""guinea pigs"" proved them to be safe and effective, resistance to getting a shot would significantly diminish.  But I just heard a talking head suggest that as vaccination rates go up and infections go down, many current anti-vaxxers will erroneously conclude that getting vaccinated is no longer necessary.  This could make getting to ""herd immunity"" virtually impossible.

Gov't officials must be sensitive to this flawed mindset and produce a public service message to combat it.  NOW."
2021-02-19 12:29:45,"The problem is a lack of trust based on experience of past wide-spread system and government failures to deliver.   The lack of trust causes behavior that causes more failure to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible and stop the epidemic.  

This why honesty and delivery on promises by institutional leaders is so critical to a well functioning society.  Once trust is lost, the descent into chronic society failure snowballs feeding on itself."
2021-02-19 12:38:14,"Let's not forget the history of the troubled vaccine roll-out. The CDC, which has institutional experience overseeing such programs, got 25% of Americans vaccinated against the swine flu virus in 1976, in just a few months. 

But when Trump decided the CDC was more interested in vaccinating Americans against the novel coronavirus than in making sure Trump got re-elected, he reassigned the leadership of the vaccination program to HHS, which had little experience managing such a colossal undertaking.

I'm as sick of hearing about Trump as most of us are, but we shouldn't forget that we are still picking up the pieces from the severe damage his repeated narcissistic rage attacks have done to our country."

I am a strong proponent of COVID vaccination and so spend time on almost every farm call pointing out the importance of COVID vaccination. Most people I work with, being agricultural producers and employees, are rated 1b - essential workers, are eligible for vaccination. The problem that I’ve encountered is the lack of communication as to how and where one is to get vaccinated. Too much access is governed by word of mouth, texting and knowing the right people. No one in the health world in my area seems to have a clear idea of “what is the plan today, tomorrow and next week”.  I think there is too much push on fancy web sites and not enough push on “feet on ground”. Fancy web sites aren’t much use if many older residents lack broad band or WiFi service. Also not much use if older residents don’t know how to utilize the site. And definitely not much use if after interacting with the web site, the question of “what is the plan today, tomorrow and next week” isn’t answered in an intelligible way."
2021-02-19 12:49:11,"The latest data from the UK is that one dose of Pfizer or AZ dramatically cuts infection rates and gives a higher level of protection than was realised.
In the UK you can go to a regional centre if asked by the NHS, or go to your local centre if asked by your doctor. In either case, you are given a time slot and a few days notice. You turn up ten minutes earlier, get your jab and a label telling what time you can leave (to check for after effects) and leave after 20 minutes. Your second jab is scheduled at the same time and you get a reminder the day before and on the day via txt or email. It runs like clockwork with doctors, nurses, volunteers and the army all pitching in. Though we love to queue, there aren't any, even at the drop in test centres, we have so many of them. That is the fruits of a year in the planning from manufacture to inoculation.
  Basically, the suppliers/ manufacturers of all parts of the vaccine chain were called in in March 2020 and asked by Boris what they needed - from vials, to transport and were handed the money there and then. - This is where EU went badly wrong, even more so than the USA.
If we had 400000 doses sat in a freezer there would be a public outcry and questions asked in Parliament!"
2021-02-19 12:53:44,"Did any of you actually absorb the article? The problems are happening because Trump’s hollowed-out CDC sent too many doses to nursing homes and other institutions have been holding back second doses out of fear of shortages. The states do know exactly where these shots are and are working to claw them back. Even with every one of those 6 million doses clawed back, however, it would provide additional first shots for only 2 percent of the population, or an average of 120k more people per state. NY has 250k outstanding, that would only be enough for five extra days at current vaccination rates.

Regarding the overall rollout, it has accelerated substantially since Biden took office, increasing from 1 mil vaccinations per day to over 1.5 mil, and the Biden administration just secured 200 mil more doses to be delivered in early summer. So, please get off your ideological high horses and try to accept that real effort to get everyone vaccinated is is finally being made.

I know not being able to get an appointment is frustrating, but this is an absolutely massive endeavor. It’s not distributing pens and pencils at the office. It’s limited by supply, not any malfeasance on the part of the new administration, which is doing a great job given what they came into. Please be patient. Keep searching for appointments every morning. Ask for help through Facebook Covid vaccine support groups if you need it. You will find appointments."
2021-02-19 12:57:48,"It seems unsurprising that immunization rates have been as slow and inefficient as they are.

Initially, primary care providers received a limited but constant supply of doses, and prepared to offer them to their patients in an orderly fashion by priority.  Now that supply has been cut off as Avula seeks to tighten his control.  He similarly tried to control the distribution through CVS, resulting in an unannounced free-for-all opening at his request, where anyone could jump the line and sign up for a dose.

My wife, who was eligible the moment the vaccines were available is STILL looking for an appointment (though we might be able to get one if we drive to the NY State Fairgrounds) I was eligible for the shots starting Feb. 15, but so far my efforts to find an appointment have been for naught.

I blame The Last Guy for so many things...including the mess that President Biden inherited in trying to find the doses already available, order enough for our populace, and the jerrry-rigged system that deprives so many people who need the vaccine from getting it until...who knows when?"
2021-02-19 12:44:58,When you replace Ideologues with competent people you can achieve dramatically different results.
2021-02-19 12:51:03,"You really need to do your math on the second dose question. This article does not adequately examine the second dose conundrum. In order to understand I urge you to model a situation in which I give you 500 doses a week for the next two months with the only proviso that you must maintain smooth flow and you must give second doses after exactly 4 weeks. The only way to do this is to administer 250 first doses a week. This will create a situation where you must always have 4 weeks of second doses in reserve, or 1000 doses on the shelf. There is no way around it in this situation. As supplies rise of course you get to flex a bit but you really need to be careful, and do the math. Be careful!"
2021-02-19 13:02:23,"To date we have been prioritizing the vaccine for those most vulnerable, but maybe that’s not the best option. Rather than giving those stockpiled doses to people sequestered in nursing homes, who see the same 1-3 nurses and 1-2 family members every week, let’s try to target the humans with high vector potential and give these vaccines quickly to those who contact the greatest number of different people per day. Clerks in giant stores, and mass transit workers,  might come in close contact with 100’s to 1000’s of different people every day of work. One super spreader in one of these jobs could explode cases in a whole city, town or state."
2021-02-19 13:30:32,"From northern VA - get the doses out! Despite Dr. Avula’s best efforts, which are commendable: the state has seen improvements in the past 2-3 weeks, we are still behind other states and only vaccinating 65 .

Many essential workers and 75  residents are having trouble getting appointments. The system is inefficient and requires internet savvy (and internet access).

The state also seems to still be reckoning with vaccinating a large percentage of federal workers living in northern VA as well as stuck on the debate in Richmond about disproportionate dose distribution across the state centered on northern VA despite the population and demographics in this area."
2021-02-19 13:40:44,"A little over a month ago while scanning the local news on-line a story appeared that stated the local medical center had vaccine that was excess to its needs and offered that vaccine to those over 70, health care workers and first responders and others who met the current criteria for vaccinations.
And many of us took advantage of that offer.

Now, that should be an example to others rather than hoarding the vaccine for dubious reasons."
2021-02-19 13:26:56,"There is reason to be at least somewhat positive here. There are problems, but they are no longer being decried as ""fake news"" or ""biased media""; they are being fixed.

2021-02-19 13:30:46,"If only the government could run more of the economy! Our obesity problems could be solved if these folks took over food distribution, for example. It would take a few weeks to get a reservation at McDonald’s and then maybe the fries would still be in a government warehouse."
2021-02-19 13:24:36,"Right now, the only stockpile that has been effectively released is best described as, ""Lack of Trust"".

Even with good people on the job to solve the logistics and supply problems, it will take months for any of us to believe that vaccines are really, truly on the way, until we actually have had both shots.

At this point, nobody, least of all our state government, knows when that will be.   Confusing and often conflicting information paired with inept registration process, whether online or by phone, build neither trust or faith in the process."
2021-02-19 13:50:45,"""More than three-fourths of the doses delivered are now being used, compared with less than half in late January."" What happens to the ""unused"" doses? Do they spoil, or are they simply administered at some later date?  

Let's look at some numbers. Here, the Illinois Department of Public health reports a current inventory of 396,788 doses.  It also reports a seven day rolling average of administering 60,551 doses per day and that it has administered a total of 1,903,942 doses so far.

The inventory of as-yet-unused doses represents less than one week's worth of doses. One week's worth of doses is still about 1/6 of the total doses...and was a much larger fraction a few weeks ago.  But the best that anyone could possibly do would be to give the shots a few days earlier.  A few days short of optimal this early in the process is hardly a disaster."
2021-02-19 13:48:01,"It is easy to comment and complain but far more difficult to efficiently plan and execute a project of this magnitude. So far just two vaccines have been approved and can be distributed and both require two doses. Others may soon be coming but they are not here yet. Now that the two that are out there have been shown to be safe and effective, everyone wants their shots yesterday. That simply cannot happen; It takes time to manufacture the products and then to distribute and administer it. And because the current available vaccines require two shots, it is entirely appropriate to withhold and reserve a supply for the second doses. The current supply chain while not perfect is working but currently is being hampered by very serious weather issues. Nothing would be worse than learning that a UPS or FedEx truck or airplane loaded with a vaccine shipment had crashed and its shipment was destroyed. The best hope may be the Johnson and Johnson vaccine that requires just one shot and has less stringent storage requirements. That is coming but is not here yet."

Some days, even with walk-ins, they have vaccine remaining in those bottles.  They get you on the list, these little Schindlers.

My contact has given a lifetime to children’s services so her hook up knows she puts the vulnerable first.  It is no crime to help those who help others avoid the waste of the agent of relief, even if you don’t yet qualify for appointments.  I will offer up my arm to stop such waste and feel no guilt for jumping the line because I am willing to come when called and not picky about which stick I get."

Governor Cuomo by all intents and purpose of the press conference expected me to accept this as a matter of fact.  And then he said he'd go after corruption.  
And here we are.
Was a law passed?  Have we found the perps he reported committing fraud?  If so, to what degree?  What extent?
Reported here he is clawing back on reserves.

Meanwhile, state officials held a public Zoom meeting yesterday at which they patted themselves on the back for identifying rural communities to send vaccines to, while urban communities with a much higher risk of spreading infection are shorted. People from Oregon are coming to Washington to get vaccines that Washington residents are trying in vain to get. I live in SW Washington. I was offered an appointment 330 miles away in Eastern Washington. I live one mile from a ""mass vaccination site"" where Governor Jay Inslee had a photo op two weeks ago."

2021-02-19 14:29:30,"What’s apparent in the era we live in, but not recognized or even scrutinized by society, is that Republican politicians invest their time and focus only on winning elections (or preparing to run to win), partisan political attacks (related to winning elections) or flooding the judiciary (again, to win disputed elections). 

No effort has been made to legislate to provide this country support against current or future threats to health and infrastructure by the party that, until this year, controlled either the White House and Senate or the both executive and legislative branches. 

My country is devastated as a result, with Texas currently providing a glimpse of what our future looks like based on long term GOP leadership."
2021-02-19 14:20:32,"The pharmacies never should have been involved. They don’t even make second appointments at the time of the first ones, so the seniors they are serving have to go thru the appointment making process twice. They are canceling at he last minute now and not rescheduling.
The pharmacist goes between all his other duties and giving the Covid vaccine, which is terribly inefficient. There is nowhere to wait safely for 15-30 minutes after the shot and no onsite EMS. 
An experienced nurse can draw as many as 7 shots from a vial because they are literally doing it all day long at the dedicated vaccine centers. There is no waste or extra shots at the end of the day that don’t go into arms. Because it’s all they do, day after day 7 days a week, they are really good at it. There is little to no wait at our NYS vaccine site in Westchester. Yes, making an appointment is hard, but that is a separate problem.

2021-02-19 14:25:33,"In Nassau and Suffolk counties, other than whatever Cuomo decides to do with state doses, Northwell Health has had complete control over our vaccines for almost 10 weeks. They have vaccinated their administrators, administrator’s wives, billers, work-from-home employees, board members, and VIPs. They’ve had over two months to do this without any reporting of how many vaccines they received, and who they gave them to. 

I am sure they received way more than enough doses to vaccinate their employees because they are the regional hub and were supposed to vaccinate all of Long Island. But why would they spend money and pay staff to vaccinate the public? 

How many thousands of vaccines are sitting in Northwell’s freezers? How much money have  Northwell and Michael Dowling given to Cuomo’s campaigns? 

These hospital administrators didn’t want to lose money caring for Covid positive nursing home patients, so they pushed Cuomo to force the homes to take them back. This policy lead to the deaths of thousands. Yet the administrators were rewarded by being the first to be vaccinated and by being a regional vaccine hub."

 Twice a week one has to have the ability to connect online , regardless of age ( only over 65 ) and clinical status for a few vaccine slots.
The elderly in nursing homes have been vaccinated by CVS, but the elderly living at home have been left out .
This system is cruel, unjust, deplorable.
In over two months since inoculations started there are millions of elderly Floridians unable to get an appointment.
Federal Medicare database should have been used to identify the elderly most at risk for Covid.

There is already much online speculations about what happened to those 20 million vaccines.  They range from a story invented by Biden administration just to make Trump and his people look bad, to the outrageous accusation that Jarred Kushner has shipped them to another country (guess which!).

One thing is for sure. The more this type of question is left unanswered, the more stories will be created around them.  And these stories slowly eat away the credibility of those who are supposed to investigate them.  Remember that remaining quiet can always be twisted into indications of guilt."

The state recently moved from having localities be in charge of registration and notification to just one statewide website managing that, and they are still getting the kinks worked out there, but the progress is steady and encouraging.

2021-02-19 15:31:53,"Finding vaccine and vaccination appointments is like panning for gold. Finding one or the other is pure chance. Whether the vaccine supply is inadequate, whether the demand is too great, or whether vaccine supplies are being hoarded, the simple act of making an appointment for and actually receiving a vaccination is frustrating, inefficient, and likely to exclude the people most in need of the shot. In New York State, there seems to be only one vaccination site open, and that site is so far removed from civilization that most New Yorkers have no access to it. While it’s possible that the rest of America is having an easier time of it, my impression is that there is something missing in the vaccination equation .... and that is a well thought out plan for delivery and distribution. Speed is not the issue but, rather, efficiency and common sense are. In the United States, nobody should have to wait weeks or, in some instances, months for a vaccination. The process is too politicized to succeed as it stands, and the process of making an appointment shouldn’t resemble a feeding frenzy. In the end, this vaccination program is not just problematic, but in many cases it can be hazardous to your health. Ask your doctor if waiting for months in quarantine is right for you."
2021-02-19 15:32:50,"The original strategy was to reserve the second dose.  People questioned this and not all were following the strategy, but it was the national strategy.  If the national strategy has changed it has not been well announced (this article does not mention an official CDC strategy change at the national level).  Changes in strategy are to be expected, but they have to be clearly and widely announced repeatedly so they become widely known.  If production rates have become more certain (who knows, there has been no news and increased rates of production are not the same thing as increased certainty of production since this is a supply chain issue related to predicting future supply  [something we now realize is affected by severe weather, what other risks are there?]) then a change in strategy is a good idea since partial protection has benefit in light of the new strains spreading.  So what is the current official position?  This article says the white house is recommending using doses immediately, but the governor of NY and others apparently have not gotten an official message and neither has the public.  Was there an official message?  What is the status of the vaccine supply chains?  It takes a while for a new administration to get up to speed so hopefully more transparency on these questions is coming."
2021-02-19 15:43:45,"Many of those being vaccinated appear to fall within one of these categories: the intrepid, the lucky, the tech savvy, or the connected. It shouldn't be that way, this is a public health challenge that affects all of us, but in our damnable, competitive, free market way of doing things, the ""every state for itself"" pandemic planning initiated by the former guy's administration has led to this. My own state's governor decided to place teachers ahead of seniors, which is defensible, except this offer was uncoupled from any agreement to return to the classroom, leaving bitter recriminations in its wake. I hope the Biden administration can not only work with vaccine manufacturers to increase supply but provide some leadership on logistics that has been absent."

The metric here is percent of supply used which is derived from the CDC data. It is the ratio of cumulative doses administered to cumulative doses delivered to the state. Assume for the moment the supply to any state is constant, the same amount week after week. If a state was only able to use a constant fraction of each weekly allocation the percent used metric would also be constant but with an increasing backlog of doses.
Alternatively, assume the state is able to completely use its weekly allocation but the reporting of that data took slightly longer than a week and they are keeping a 2nd dose reserve. In this case, the percent used metric would be at its minimum at the 3 to 4 week  point where 2nd doses began to be used. Both the reporting delay and the 2nd dose reserved would have that metric somewhere below 50%. However, week after week that value would creep up to approach 100% asymptotically. There would also not be an increasing backlog of doses being stored. 
I think this latter scenario is what we are seeing because each state is clamoring for more vaccine showing they have the capacity to deliver more doses than what they are supplied with."
2021-02-19 16:06:57,"It was obvious, from the persistent discrepancy between production and use rates, that something like this was going on.

Tank-Ka, Tank-Ka, Tank-Ka - when the Army rolls over De Blasio and Cuomo, the job will get done."
2021-02-19 16:28:29,"America wasted more than a year in its response to the pandemic so it doesn't surprise me that there are still vestiges of ignorance around the country.

But the good news is Trump is gone, we no longer suffer inane comments that litter the front page, and states and cities are gradually implementing procedures and policies they should have implemented last year. Even in backward Arizona, the ability to make an appointment for the vaccine finally appeared last week. It took AZ more than a year to replicate a reservation system present in every hotel chain.

Elections matter and the removal of the malevolent cheerleader has lead to vast improvement in our ability to survive and a return to prosperity.  It's imperative that we never forget which party left America adrift despite overwhelming evidence of a crisis. Our neighbors in Texas are having a similar awakening."
2021-02-19 15:40:14,The feds said last week they would ship vaccine to pharmacies. A week later the pharmacies here have yet to get a single dose and they have no word as to when to expect any. Biden is no better at keeping his promises than Trump was.
2021-02-19 15:42:36,I am going to point out the obvious: not all the effects of poor decisions of the past can be unwound quickly/easily. Examples? Afghanistan. Don’t shoot the messenger or those who are cleaning up a pandemic response with big ideas and no logistical appreciation.
2021-02-19 15:58:51,"In Arizona it is everyman for himself. The computer lottery appointment system is challenging even for very tech savvy old folks like my wife and I. We scored after hours of both of us on different computers trying to secure appointments. 
The ideal of women and children into the life boats first is history.
Now it is claw, bite, stomp on and shoot the wounded culture America has devolved into."
2021-02-19 14:45:32,"In New Jersey getting an appointment is an exercise in futility, with no accountability whatsoever on Governor Murphy or the health Commissioner's part, none.

Each day, chasing around virtually no available supply has been exacerbated by the Governor's continual trickling out of new locations to contact as appointment prospects, none of which have come across for appointments.

And to date not a word from the Governor or the Health Department as to specifically which locations have doses allocated.

We now are starting to hear reports of favored allocation, a notoriously noteworthy one attributed to DeSantis  in Florida targeting the two wealthiest areas in Florida and specific individuals to receive the inoculations.

This is a shared national disgrace from the President and Fauci down to the governors and health departments to the local entities authorized to administer the inoculations in all aspects large and small.

While national commission to examine the Capitol riot is essential, the continuing and comprehensive  mishandling of the pandemic  outstrips it in urgency now for a hands-on national level task force, perhaps lead by the Defense Department actually mobilizing a coordinated effort to address this emergency granularly.

What are we doing here fellow Americans?"
2021-02-19 15:26:26,if this had happened in another country the hoarders would be suspected of black market activities.

2021-02-19 15:56:12,"If a state or other agency has used less than 80% of their doses, don't send them any more until they improve."
2021-02-19 16:23:25,"Vaccine manufacturers totally failed to ramp up production to fill the need.  They had from April until today but are still unable to produce the needed product.  Why?  What is the bottleneck which makes this so hard to produce.  Is there some magic ingredient which can not be synthesized?  Is there some magic vessel which can not be manufactured?   I don't think so.  Are they making more profit this way?  Maybe?  I'd like to have this explained.  And as far as distribution, what a joke.  They are spending tens of billions of dollars to put a vaccine shot in people's arms.  I could have gotten volunteers to do it for free.  This is the worst rip off I've seen possibly ever.  Trillions of dollars wasted.  A few getting very rich."

Sitting here close to 1 year now. Friends and family in NY and CA all vaccinated. We're registered in Richmond. Nothing happening. Agree this should be federally administrated."
2021-02-19 15:43:07,There is no rhyme or reason to the vaccination process. National emergencies require federal oversight and control.This idea of handing it off to states that hand it off to counties was born in the previous administration that could not host a 1 car parade. Nationalize the vaccination process! Incentivize with a call to action. Advertise! Make it available to anyone that wants a shot. Quit putting the load on underfunded counties. Do some different because this is not working.
2021-02-19 15:57:06,I am wondering what is happening to vaccines in Texas and other places where there are supply chain disruptions for the vaccine and no way for medical personnel to administer the vaccines due to emergency situations.
2021-02-19 15:32:09,"I loved the hammer Hank Aaron. Very focused man. He was a healthy 86 year old then he had the vaccine, 17 days later he was dead. Was it the vaccine that took him? One does not know, however that is the only thing that makes sense to me."
2021-02-19 16:25:51,"That is a crime if some states are hoarding vaccines instead of immediately distributing them as thousands are dying. ""If these states want more people to get back to work, it is imperative they take care of the health of their residents despite being against their conservative values."
2021-02-19 15:08:36,"For those of us 65  in New York State, policy and logistics issues may mask regional supply chain favoritism. 
Case in point - Tops Pharmacies, with more than 50 vaccination locations, many in Western NY, is the goto place for me and my neighbors. I check every location link, every day. Never any appointments. CDC’s Federal Partners site shows NY state participants: CVS, Walgreens, and RBS (Acme, Lion, et al). No Tops. 
How do we know that Tops supply will have parity with the Federal Partners, given that their supply comes only through NY State? 
Gov. Cuomo and team, more data, please."
2021-02-19 14:42:41,I've been watching the national numbers reported on the NYT with it showing that only about half the vaccine doses distributed were used.  This has been going on for several months .  Now it becomes obvious there has been excessive hoarding of vaccine which explains it.  The federal government needs to set procedures regarding management of distributed vaccine to assure the most efficient use of it.  All health providers receiving the vaccine must follow it and those caught violating the procedures should not be provided any more vaccine.  It is now way past obvious that this lack of  national coordination  in response to this pandemic doesn't work and this is just another example of it.
2021-02-19 15:05:06,"Hoarding vaccines is the wrong thing to do; this is akin to hiding things and expect its value to rise...and eventually profiteer from it, speculate in times of dire need. Obviously, not the case here, right? It seems more a case of neglect, of not knowing how to use it wisely...and timely. If not now, when?"
2021-02-19 16:19:44,"As someone who has had their first shot, and scheduled second next week, I fully expect to receive it.  The entire roll-out has been a mess everywhere so assurances from the people that messed it up in the first place do nothing for me.

No doubt the system needs a lot of improvement but not at the expense of those of us currently waiting for our second shots.  Shots we were told we need and that we would get on time."
2021-02-19 16:19:33,"Never again. When this subsides, as it eventually will, there needs to be a comprehensive analysis of everything that occurred, good and bad.  Then there needs to be an airtight and comprehensive plan to insure it will not happen again.

If it means setting up a massive healthcare database for every American so the government can allocate and track vaccines from manufacture to the stick in the arm, so be it. This will be far from the last pandemic, but it needs to be the last incompetently handled one."
2021-02-19 15:45:13,"Joe Biden's transition team reached out to the Trump Administration shortly after the election when it was apparent that one or more vaccines would soon be available. Trump was too focused on his Big Lie that the election was stolen. He was not interested in working with Joe Biden or his team to create vaccine distribution logistics that would potentially save countless lives. The current Administration must now create, probably from scratch, a working system that will deliver needles into arms as quickly as possible. A daunting task. I am fortunate in that I am a healthcare worker. I received my second dose of Moderna this week. However, I worry about my wife, son, friends, and the rest of the country that are currently unable to receive the either vaccine."
2021-02-19 15:06:58,"Olly olly oxen free! All vaccine doses that are hiding can return now and go into the arms of those that need it.

Goodness, why do I feel like children have been running the show the last four years and are driving the vaccination program and distribution?

I’ve worked in beverage industries most of my adult life and managed warehousing, logistics, planning and distribution; I can say without a doubt that the federal, state and local governments and health agencies have failed the American public once again, with their lack of vaccine planning, distribution, warehousing and identification of supplies that are out there.

I almost think it may be simpler, and more effective, to just send each American the two doses of the vaccine they need, and allow them to self-inject the vaccine themselves. Oh, but wait a second, trump destroyed the USPS infrastructure too, so belay that thought....

Anyone else have any good ideas? Anyone?"
2021-02-19 15:38:36,"Perhaps this is one more wake up call that a for-profit health care system is a terrible way to administer public health. It is good that Biden is  on the job - just imagine if he had lost. Six months ago I would have started a program for licenced barbers, hair stylists and nail salon workers to be trained to administer vaccines. They would be paid, would surely do a great job and it would bring communities together."
2021-02-19 15:43:13,"This is just one foreseeable bad outcome which is the result of the previous administration’s lack of any plan.  Leaving the distribution up to the states and even in some cases the acquisition of vaccine is just wrong.  We needed a national strategy and transparency from the beginning.  What we got was the show from a con man who only sees the optics of television.  There was no intent to make this effort a true national emergency and now after about 500k deaths, many more ruined lives and a crashing economy we are beginning to really address this disaster.  We are also just starting to participate in the essential international efforts to vaccinate in every country, not just the rich ones.  This is a pandemic not an epidemic, it is worldwide and must be eradicated everywhere before anyone is really safe."
2021-02-19 15:19:04,"This too shall pass.  In six weeks time the vaccine pipeline and stocks will be in a better place, and overall vaccinations will be much higher than today.  A fallout of the Trump reign was that all of us (blue and red) have become very cynical and distrustful of government generally, but especially the federal government to the point that now state governments do not have adequate trust in the federal government to send them their pledged allotments on time, and vaccine providers do not trust that their own state governments will follow through with their allotment promises as well.

I do not know where this leaves us.  To have good government we need trust, and to have trust we need good government.  At this point, the federal government needs to outperform, and hopefully this will start a cascade of trust."
2021-02-19 15:15:46,"I live in Massachusetts. I am 75 years old, and I was able to get the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on February 10. I need to get the second dose on March 3. In the meantime, everyday, I've been checking Massachusett's vaccine website (www.maimmunizations.org) twice a day, checking vaccine availability for every date between now and March 3.

This morning, according to the website, dates farther out than a week have no sites for vaccination listed. Dates in the week between today and one week from today show many vaccination sites, but no doses available at any site. In other words, there appear to be no vaccine doses available in all of Massachusetts.

This seems very unlikely. I'm perplexed. I worry whether more vaccination appointments will appear by the time I need my second dose, and I remain anxious about what is happening."
2021-02-19 16:15:29,"Think about it, the RNC had no Platform for the 2020 elections.  They simply planned to cross off 2016 from the old Platform because they had accomplished zero.

And these are the folks 74 Million wanted to continue with the vaccine roll out.  Thank you to everyone who voted in 2020, I can't imagine the colossal disaster we would be in if Trump was still running things."
2021-02-19 16:00:46,"This hits me right in the guilty feels. My partner just got his second vaccine, in Canada, even though he is a healthy middle aged man. His mom's nursing home had extra and they were apparently going to go to waste, so they contacted the residents' families and offered one to a family member per resident. My partner's family chose him.

I would have done the same thing if I were my partner and the vaccine was offered to me in this scenario. But we both still feel bad about it. In fact, I have some health issues and he has to go back to work in public schools, and take the bus, so the vaccine will protect me from catching COVID from him. 

But still. It is one of those things, I would have done it too without hesitation but I still would not feel totally good about it, and this is how he feels."
2021-02-19 16:50:20,"Reading this chilled me. The US move toward profit over mission integrity since the ‘90’s has allowed nursing homes and assisted living centers to add to the underclass thousands of caregivers and an over abundance of wealthy owners.  Why weren’t the caregivers vaccinated immediately? Did the owners bring in a professional to discuss the pros and cons of vaccine if caregivers feared taking it? There is plenty of observational evidence that as a group these owners care more about themselves than they do the persons who make their business a reality, by providing care. One wonders if they are selling hoarded vaccine or looking for a highest bidder."
2021-02-19 16:12:46,"As a logistics expert, it’s heartbreaking to hear of anyone holding back vaccine. “I am holding second doses that are for people who are scheduled for second doses,” Mr. Cuomo said in a recent interview. He added: If “I have your mother’s second dose earmarked and sitting on a shelf, I don’t consider that unused.” 

False!!! Someone could be saved by getting that shot now! Your mother’s dose will get made and delivered later, it’s in the pipeline.

2021-02-19 16:00:37,"Finally the NYT is getting at the truth. The problem with distribution has been at the local level all along. Here in NJ, I can’t get an appointment even though I am 76 and have other conditions. There’s no rhyme or reason to how appointments are given out. Murphy had 9 months to get this set up. He could have had seniors vaccinated at local hospitals or in unused Schools. What about Urgi Centers? 
How about the YMCA?  My local town officials have no input at all. And yet Booker and Menendez spent precious time on a sham impeachment and on illegal immigrants. Where are the priorities. 
If you want to get people vaccinated and back to a normal life, start opening up more places. Stop appointments and set it up by age. 
It’s outrageous and the NYT should be investigating further and headlning this outrageous inability to take care of our citizens. It should be front page in every newspaper and on every news outlet. 
Shame these governors and their mismanagement. Certainly Trump would have been doing that. 
Make them work for their citizens."
2021-02-19 15:15:24,With the proven efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine with one shot it is becoming clear that the path Fauci set was wrong and need to be corrected.  Give everyone one shot and open up everything. The people should be told the truth that this mess is soon to end.
2021-02-19 15:34:44,"Please do not blame the incoming administration for the lack of a coherent federal vaccination distribution rollout program.￼COVID-19 has been in in the United States since January2020 which is during the reign of President Trump. With their Operation Warpspeed, the Trump administration was responsible for both helping to secure an effective vaccination for COVID-19 and for the rollout of a federal distribution plan. Republicans had an entire year to plan for a rollout of the vaccination. Trump would not allow Biden to receive the government services/information  required for him to be up and running on January 20; he refused to allow Biden to do the work he needed as an incoming president. Many Republicans refused to believe that there was a COVID-19 and called it a hoax etc.They refused to wear masks or socially distance and attended super spreader COVID-19 events￼.Republicans had one year to plan for the distribution of the vaccination.Biden ￼has been President for ￼less than one month. Trump had one year to plan for this; what happened? Trump did not allow Biden to receive the government services in November. Perhaps instead of spreading bogus rumors about a “stolen election” Americans would’ve been better served if Trump had simply done his job￼.He did not care about Americans or about our health and safety. I am thankful the current administration does take COVID-19 seriously and has done their utmost to help facilitate Covid-19 vaccination."

At 71 y.o., many like myself are still waiting.

Many people are skeptical of getting the vaccine, including my sister, age 78 years old who lives in Florida. 
I have been busy advocating for the vaccine by telling them to recall how grateful we were to get the vaccine for poliomyelitis; most have responded to reason.
What I have found in “the other Virginia” that there is very little access to vaccine there; hopefully, those good people will not be forgotten when distribution of the vaccine is more accessible; that area has the most generous and loving people one could ever wish to know, both black and white."
2021-02-19 17:27:20,"From the beginning of the pandemic, there have been those who kept up with the news and those who didn't. Those who are better educated, better informed, better positioned with computer skills, have been quite knowledgeable about the virus from early last year. This same group is figuring out how to get the vaccine. And, yes, they are wealthier. In a country like ours, it is hard to compel behavior. It is hard to backfill educational deficiencies.

There really isn't a good way to prevent the population from dividing into those who ""got the memo"" and those who are competing for a Darwin Award."
2021-02-19 17:07:05,"So this must be where those 20 million doses have gone  missing!

Yet another example of the   disorganized and poorly coordinated distribution program put together
by those crudely inept, political hacks  in the prior administration, for whom data was the basis for 
political power and influence not sound policy. 

Somehow states were not kept in the loop on a permanent basis about vaccine supplies in their states. Perhaps some states were   in that loop,  but their own coordination of data was just as awful. Other states, such as Florida, had real problems keeping their data free of overriding political manipulations, in which event it was not possible to 
implement a sound  distribution policy since no one had any clear idea what  data was or was not genuine.

The logic of stockpiling somehow might have made some sense early on when one was not sure how reliable production+distribution would be, but at some point too many in authority seemed to have either  lost track of them, or remained far too reluctant  to  getting them out of storehouses. 

Such decision makers need to be forced to explain their reasoning in public and under oath. 

In the meantime far too many people are still waiting for their Godot to show up."
2021-02-19 17:30:04,"Good reporting. Back at the end of January the new people Joe Biden had brought in were bleating about how 20 million doses of the vaccines had been lost. Looks like they weren't lost after all. 

People in the various states had been, intentionally in some cases and unintentionally in others, stockpiling doses. Those doses were never lost, and will be used. Injections march on, with supply being the limiting factor. 

Too bad those people bleating about the 20 million lost doses never gave us an update that they were never really lost and everything is fine. I guess that kind of news doesn't get political rewards. 

To get political rewards, you need to report that the Trump administration had no plans to distribute the vaccines and the rollout was a disaster. Fake news sells."

Yesterday , over 400 elderly individuals waited over 6 hours at a State distribution center at an old Kmart in Charlottesville, VA before being turned away due to technical registration difficulties. Governor Northam has only offered excuses and accepted no responsibility. According to the CDC, Virginia now ranks 49th of 50 states in its distribution of Covid vaccine."
2021-02-19 17:29:30,"I love the urgency that President Biden has to have people vaccinated. That is the way to end the death and destruction of Covid. One of the problems is that Doctors, Hospital Administrators and Politicians have all been vaccinated. They don't have a real vested interest in getting the general population vaccinated. Part of the government in Peru just fell because some politicians got vaccinated first. I think Governor Cuomo should have been the last person in New York to be vaccinated. Then he would have a true sense of urgency for the process to go quickly."
2021-02-19 17:39:38,"I fully support the claw backs. Anecdotally, despite the anguished letters from seniors I read in the Times seeking vaccination appointments, most of the seniors I know in my Midwestern home state have the attitude toward the shot that they will “get around to it.” Usually they wait for their grown children to make the appointment and drag them into the doctor’s office or pharmacy for the shot. It’s been two months and we STILL don’t have even 50% of the over 75’s vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is real. It’s time to open up vaccinations to those under 65. We need to get shots into as many arms as fast as possible, and we can’t wait for those now eligible to “get around to it.”"
2021-02-19 16:50:40,"This has been my guess from the beginning. We micro segmented populations to get the vaccine, allocated supply accordingly, encountered reluctance, ended up with pockets of vaccine and had no inventory management system in place to know where they are.

It shouldn’t be much longer before we hear about expired vaccine that had to be thrown out."
2021-02-19 17:36:32,I just got my first dose moments ago. It took advocacy of doctors like mine to secure doses for younger people like myself with serious medical conditions that put us at high mortality risk of Covid-19 to get that first shot in the arm. There should be a system prioritizing those with serious illnesses to get the soonest available appointments. Keeping doses in freezers when lives could be saved is inhumane.
2021-02-19 17:56:07,"Primary care physicians, and more local pharmacies, should have been allowed to administer these vaccines!   The federal bureaucracy can't hold a candle to county and state bureaucracies, which are every bit as opaque and non responsive as any federal one.  

You sign up when you're eligible and weeks, then more weeks and weeks, go by and nothing happens, while those with time on their hands snag vaccines in counties, sometimes in states, where they don't live.  

This is a disaster and the state either can't or won't provide credible information about how many doses have been shipped, where they've gone, what percentage were used, where the unused ones are.  Then we find out there are millions of doses being held back that should be used as first doses.   Meanwhile, variants multiply.   When do we get to qualify as a failed state in need of outside help?"

 Biden's Covid Task Force made the announcement this morning about FEMA at ONE location via FEMA in ""Pennsylvania"" and FIVE in Florida.

LET me be clear. That is deceptive. IT only benefits Philadelphia residents. It is not going to help or give a vaccine to just any potential Pennsylvanian.
That location in PHILADELPHIA does not permit any resident, citizen, taxpayer of PENNSYLVANIA to fight for a spot for a vaccine and get a vaccine.  So, if you live in TOO bad an adjacent suburb of PENNSYLVANIA you are not allowed to get a vaccine there!

So Biden's task force is NOT helping Pennsylvania.
It is only helping  Philadelphia which  carved itself out of the federal allotment to Pennsylvania and is functioning as is IF it were a state.

I know many Pennsylvania residents/taxpayers who live outside Philadelphia in adjacent suburbs but whose physicians are ALL at the Univ of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) in Philadelphia. 

 YET, here's dilemma, the Catch-22,  those UPHS ""patients"" paying for health insurance and whose insurance pays thousands of dollars  for office visits, surgeries, cat scans, blood work, procedures at UPHS conducted in Philadelphia as well as ""tele-health"" visits whereever, CANNOT GET A VACCINE AT UPHS IF THEY DON'T LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA.

Public health has always been the responsibility of the states, for good reasons. The infrastructure is there in the states for vaccinations and so far it has worked well. Problems have occurred -- they always do. But they have been solved more easily because we were not starting from scratch. 

If you want to see what a fiasco the federal government can make of vaccines, look back to the swine flu epidemic of 1976. That is an epidemic that never happened, for which 35 million Americans received needless immunizations. 

States are just finishing a record number of flu shots this year -- nearly 200 million. At the peak more than 2 million doses were injected a day. No need for the federal government to step in."

It will take literally years for some countries to be fully vaccinated, while the US is going to do so by late summer.

2021-02-19 18:20:27,"The article acknowledges what HHS Sec Azar asserted repeatedly for the benefit of deaf NYT editors, reporters, readers back in January, but which they did not begin to hear until it was Biden Administration talking. Sec Azar insisted that supply chain had reached a point where second doses held in reserve could be released upon a promise of more forthcoming in time. Pres-elect Biden and Dem Govs and Sens and Reps obtusely twisted Azar's urging of the states to act into a seeming promise he never actually made (i.e. of a windfall of supplies held in reserve by the feds) in a massive disinformation campaign which the NYT and other liberal media outlets ingenuously credited. Everyone wonders why the whole debacle seems so mysterious and incomprehensible--it is because the Democrats made a controversy out of thin air, that falls apart upon the least examination. Now that this failure to administer the full vaccine supply available is coming to light, NYT is waking from its sleep and squinting through its eyes for who is to blame. The last possibility they suspect is that Democratic Govs wanted the Trump rollout to flop. This article timidly suggests that it's hospitals--not governors--holding back reserves. But it can't avoid mention of NY, where Gov Cuomo claims to hold the reins. Who is (or should be) in charge? A proper team of journos, eds, and legal scholars could have resolved this a month ago, but the modern newsroom is lulled into a partisan trance & asleep at the wheel."

No country has ever tried to vaccinate everyone in short order, much less without a proven vaccine.
The vaccine is one thing, but, once developed, a little thing in a big room. Making it, distibuting it, administering it. This takes months of planning including 'wargaming the scenario'. It seems not many countries did that and took on the results.
Look at Germany - efficiency personified - screwed up - backed the vaccine but not the infrastructure.
Look at France - total bureaucratic incompetence.
Look at the US - bureaucracy, no coordination, and a distibution ideal that is totally bonkers and favours the middle class of whatever racial background. Hpw can you jump queues just cos your internet is faster? How can you buy the vaccine?

Don't forget that the new variant spreads 70 times faster than the original covid-19 virus so that's why family units of border workers are getting vaccinated firstly.
The rest of us are getting vaccinated in winter and it's free. Though we only have a population of 5 million so in USA it's a logistical problem!"
2021-02-19 21:13:25,"Purely personal ire and dismay: from a local news piece today - if figures are correct, there are something like 71,000+ unused doses in NYS, while at the same time the state was announcing new allocations which look paltry by comparison ( and I got a call saying that my 2nd Moderna dose was not going to  be available on the planned date because of transportation issues, and upstate friends ( eligible) who cannot drive on their own from 2 to 6 hours  round trip don't seem to have a chance of landing a spot).

I know the battles to get this out there  aren't been easy, but it feels as if everything is being done by the seat of someone's pants.  Whose? The announced allocations  to hospitals, and medical groups and pharmacies also leave one wondering if there is any structured plan at all.  

Some of this is just  extreme frustration with being  on high alert for a year now ( almost).  

But a lot is because there is no transparent public health plan being advertised to assure people that they will be able to access vaccination according to a set of understandable rules that apply to everyone."
2021-02-19 21:20:19,"Thanks for beginning to clear up the mystery of where all the ""missing"" doses had gone. Any economist can tell you, though, that an announcements of ""shortages"" with trumpets blaring will lead to hoarding, just in case, and we've loudly announced ""shortages"" in almost every aspect of dealing with this pandemic."
2021-02-19 21:41:43,"I received my first vaccine shot Feb 11, 2021. The Moderna Mfg. Lot Number was 031M20A (as written on my CDC Covid-19 Vaccination Record Card).  I could look up the corresponding expiration date - Aug 5, 2021, but not the mfg. date.  It seems like there must also be a mfg. date or at least date range associated with the lot number.  

Logistically, the time between manufacture and shot-in-the-arm should be a good relative indicator of distribution timeliness.   Perhaps lot number to date manufactured conversion could be made available to the public, so that every person receiving a vaccine shot could clearly know how long it took for the vaccine to make it's way into their arm."

Yes, even scientists say that at the rate that climate change is taking place, with warp speed, our planet cannot exist like it is past 2030.

Secondly., public release of the information  about where allocations of vaccines went and how many were used, on a state website makes it clear that institutions cannot hide vaccines without facing public disapproval .Thirdly, Dr Arvula seems to be negotiating aggressively with the full faith and support of the Gov. there. 

SO - Would NYT reporters please demand the same information from Gov. Cuomo?  -And ask bluntly where the ""missing"" doses are being hidden?   NYS has a low rate of utilization of the vaccine available, which is inexcusable given the need and the demand.  The public does deserve to know."

Best case scenario: corporate chain execs signed the deal without talking into account the short staffing at pharmacies locally, with no one free to go out to nursing homes if that meant closing the pharmacy counter. Worst case: that stockpile of vaccines is a nice, free gift from the feds for the future when the phased vaccinations move into general population, representing a nice cash flow for the pharmacies.

(Our county did not receive an allocation for lay people 65-74 until this week. Executing this event within days is what I call warp speed) All around me recipients shed happy years, at the thought we might inhabit a first world country.

After 2 weeks of constant, frustrating, futile websearch on behalf of a NY-based relative, I called the Help Line and simply asked for the next available appointment at the SUNY Albany site. Within minutes (you'll need the insurance ID of the person to be vaccinated) my relative was signed up at the location of choice -- albeit for mid-April, but definitely for an appointment that was neither accessible or visible to any web-enabled civilian.

That is not to say that there is a one-size-fits-all means of addressing a pandemic of the one we've been facing.

Given that America and other Western cultures are so different from East Asian cultures in significant ways, we in the West were always going to seem like we were struggling, at least in comparison with those other cultures.

Nevertheless, we are learning lessons that will serve us extremely well in the future, and we're doing this without having to take on those aspects of East Asian cultures that Americans would be extremely loathe to accept, much less embrace.

This is not a matter of which approach or culture is best, but instead one that emphasizes approaches to crises that are acceptable and effective to given populations.

I am convinced that we in America will come out of this crisis stronger than we were when we entered it. To lose faith in that point of view is to lose faith in our national project, and I will never do that."

When the State of New Mexico Department of Health posted a website for registering for the vaccine we immediately registered on December 3.  We have heard nothing from the State since then.  My husband, who is a patient at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, received a call on January 31 from Mayo offering a first Moderna dose on Febuary 5.  We immediately accepted, got in the car and made a sixteen-hour road trip to Phoenix.  We will repeat this trip on March 5 for his second dose. In the meantime, I registered for every website I could find (clinics, pharmacies, etc.).  I checked the New Mexico Department of Health faithfully three times a day. Nothing. I received a phone call from a clinic in Colorado on February 15 asking if I wanted an appointment for the next day.  We got in the car and drove six hours in bad weather to make the appointment. We will do the same thing on March 16 for my Moderna second dose.  I have checked with New Mexico pharmacies, clinics, etc. to determine whether we can get the second shot somewhere closer to home.  No dice...you can only get the second dose from the same place you got the first dose, in spite of the fact that the Moderna vaccine is exactly the same.  In the meantime we learn that there are millions of doses languishing in the freezers of places like CVS and Walgreen’s."

Stop cutting down the rainforests!  Yes, China, like Brazil, will tell us to mind our own business, but this is everyone's business, millions of us will die because of stupid ""wet market"" and other practices.

2021-02-19 14:05:44,"Once again, the Times coverage of Covid vaccines undercuts itself. Apoorva Mandavilli says that teachers who are vaccinated cannot feel assured that they have little risk of being infected by unvaccinated children. Yet in this morning’s article on vaccine skepticism it is stated that there is very little risk of being infected and in spreading infection once vaccinated. That the theoretical risk has been overhyped by scientists and journalists. I’m fully vaccinated. I wear a mask in public mainly as a signifier to others that I care about them. However, it is my understanding that I most likely cannot be infected and cannot spread Covid to others. Studies have not yet been completed to demonstrate this scientifically. I wish this paper would coordinate its messaging"
2021-02-19 15:18:23,"In terms of vaccine alarmism, this episode felt like it's doing exactly what today's NYT's ""The Morning"" newsletter accuses experts and journalists of doing.  Walking away from listening makes it sound like the vaccine isn't going to be very effective, we'll still need masks, people will still get sick, grandparents still shouldn't see their kids, we won't have herd immunity, we can't fly with our kids, teachers will still get sick, and on and on.

However, The Morning ends with this quote:

What should the public messaging about the vaccines be? “They’re safe. They’re highly effective against serious disease. And the emerging evidence about infectiousness looks really good,” Grabowski said. “If you have access to a vaccine and you’re eligible, you should get it.”

Still trying to get my mind around that one."
2021-02-19 13:13:19,"I have still not seen an overarching strategy being disseminated and used as a guide. What is our goal? Is it to eliminate COVID19 globally? Is it to manage COVID19 keeping illness and death at a point where local economies can function well enough that corporations maintain what they deem acceptable profit levels? Decisions appear short term, and case by case. Is there a national policy stating the level of death and illness acceptable for students and staff in schools and what will be done to the infrastructure to attempt to achieve that?"
2021-02-19 13:31:39,"I usually enjoy The Daily, but today's episode was painful to listen to.

Michael and Apoorva should have emphasized the importance of children receiving covid vaccines...eventually. 

Children do make up 24% of US population. Children are not immune to covid. They ""catch"" covid just as easily as adults; however, the majority have little to no symptoms. This is why they are not a priority right now. 

We must focus on vaccinating the ~250 million adults who are at higher risk of dying before vaccinating our children. Our rollout schedule will take a while, giving pharma companies ample time to test on children. Considering that all homosapien adults and children share 99.9% of DNA, i'm confident, that in due time, there will be a vaccine approved for use on children. 

But then again, what do i know? I'm not a scientist."
2021-02-19 14:57:10,"I would really like to know whether students can be compelled to get the vaccine, once it's approved for children. Can schools require it as a prerequisite for attending in-person instruction? And what are the ramifications of that? Does it have anything to do with the emergency-use status of the vaccine? And when does that status change? Daily: please address this as I know you can!!"
2021-02-19 18:19:06,"I usually really enjoy the Daily but this podcast was really misleading. R0 in children is unknown but most likely much, much lower in children, particularly school-aged children. We see that very clearly in K-8 public schools, where transmission has been extremely low in places where they are open."
2021-02-19 13:22:30,"As a secondary public school teacher in New Jersey, hearing the emphasis from today's hosts that leaders and policy makers ""weren't thinking about children"" was more than a bit frustrating. Teachers have been doing little else other than """"thinking about children"", both out of concern over what they are experiencing --their learning loss, fears, anxieties, and isolation -- but there is also significant time spent seeing those we have dedicated our lives to teaching as potential threats to our health and safety. 

In my particular community, there is increasing  pressure from parents to fully reopen schools along with accusations about the laziness of teachers because we are concerned about that return.

In the midst of all of this, my colleagues and I are experiencing enormous anxiety that, because of our jobs, we are more likely to contract this virus and get sick -- or potentially transmit the virus to our parents, spouses, etc, and then have to live with the knowledge that we bear responsibility for infecting a loved one. 

And teachers aren't even ELIGIBLE to be vaccinated in NJ yet, but kids need to be back in school NOW.

So it is small comfort to hear that next year ""[teachers] can be a little less worried about getting sick or dying, but they cannot be confident that they won't give it to someone else"" as we face fact that our students' parents won't socially distance their children or themselves, or may refuse to vaccinate them once they are eligible."
2021-02-19 17:17:47,"I enjoyed the episode this morning, but I feel as though an important question was not asked of the guest. Herd Immunity is based on people who are vaccinated, as well as people who have already had the virus and carry some immunity. How was this question not posed to the guest? The calculation the guest was making assumed that no children, ~ 25% of the population, have had the virus and carry some immunity. I think that this oversight could lead the listener to feel that the situation is much more grave than it indeed is."
2021-02-19 17:27:05,"As always, thanks for your insight and a great show. 

They talked about how grandparents should continue to wear masks around grandchildren, but they made it sound like that's for the benefit of the safety of the grandparents. What if the grandparents have far more exposure to the outside world (especially after being vaccinated) than the kids do? Is it being over protective to think that my young kids (9 and 11) will still need to keep distance from my parents for the kids' safety?"
2021-02-19 18:30:01,"This Episode seemed to be filled with only the overly protective form of the discussion of level of protection that the vaccine is very likely to provide.

Although there are few studies that show that these vaccines will virtually eliminate the vaccinated person from spreading COVID-19, it would be surprising if it didn't. I am also not aware of any study that shows that a fully vaccinated person is able to easily spread the disease, but at least a few that show that they are not. That should always be stated when making such negative commentary about the effectiveness of these vaccines.

To my knowledge nearly every other vaccine virtually eliminates the vaccinated person from being able to spread the disease they have been vaccinated for. I feel like this extremely cautious and pessimistic way of talking about the vaccine is exactly what we do not want to have right now. It is the safe way to talk about these things, from a scientific point of view, but it is the exact thing that is keeping people from even wanting to be vaccinated, as discussed at the top of todays NYT newsletter."
2021-02-19 17:35:54,"Glad that someone else has finally admitted that without children vaccinations it is extremely likely we can reach herd immunity for COVID-19. Given the lack of trials for children and unknown side effects or long term effects from these vaccines on children, it seems premature to advocate widespread vaccination for children. Good science doesn't jump to conclusions without running the experiments -- granted that is more difficult to do so when people are involved, but is necessary. Given that proof of vaccination doesn't preclude either contracting or transmitting the virus shouldn't more emphasis be placed on developing better and faster testing protocols?"
2021-02-20 02:53:53,"I normally enjoy The Daily but this episode is a bit extreme and alarmist in its approach, even for me.  And also, I think, misinformed??

She undermines her credibility with that series of assertions. 
As we attempt to approach the 80% immunity that is required for herd immunity, don’t forget that it has been well established that about 50% or more Americans have recovered from the disease- which includes kids."
2021-02-25 13:31:04,"I've been a fan of the show but this may be the worst episode in terms of fear mongering with no nuance to the reality of vaccination.

The discussion about travel was simply not in alignment with reality. There are no vaccination passports. 

Lastly, there is no reality of no COVID. Risk mitigation is reality and to think life is zero risk is myopic and only throws fire on COVID paranoia."
2021-02-23 11:34:11,"You write, ""I can read trend lines.""  But that simple, seemingly obvious exercise, applied to the past would not have predicted the second and third waves of infection--much more deadly than the first--which have swept the country."
2021-02-23 11:34:53,"There is so much we don't know at this stage, Ross, so why would you make predictions based on your reading of a graph and the words of a few optimists?  Vaccination should eventually bring ""herd immunity,"" but I'm not confident that the vast number of asymptomatic positive cases will contribute.  We don't know if those people are actually immune.  In the meantime, this virus is doing what experts predicted: it's evolving more contagious variants, and it's probably evolving more harmful variants.  Those variants lurk for a while, increasing under the cover of background noise, until they're common enough to be recognized -- at which point, it's too late.  Our failure to contain the virus early has given it far, far more opportunity to evolve.  The responsible thing for us to do is remain vigilant."
2021-02-23 11:35:43,"The real and long-term solutions, so the emergency can peter out, include: reduce fine particle pollution, encourage no smoking, encourage healthier diets to avoid obesity & diabetes, and please reduce the human pressure/encroachment on the remaining lands occupied by wild animals. All require extraordinary changes in our globalized economies. So ""return to normalcy"" should not imply back to pre-2020 settings; I sincerely hope our politicians and leaders can re-adjust their mindsets."
2021-02-23 11:36:28,"Your analysis is based on the best-case scenario for herd immunity. The NYT article you cite says that ""the exact threshold for herd immunity for the coronavirus is unknown, but recent estimates range from 70 percent to 90 percent."" You then carry on the conversation by assuming that herd immunity will be achieved at 70%. If that estimate turns out to be true (let's all hope), then yes, herd immunity should be achievable by summer. If the more pessimistic estimates are correct, then we could still be creeping our way to herd immunity next winter or even beyond. It's disingenuous to accuse Biden and Fauci of trying to spin this. They're just delivering a rational assessment based on the range of realistic scenarios."
2021-02-23 11:42:04,"Biden and company must NOT make the country overly optimistic until there is truly a reason to do so. Many states, like Kansas, are delivering the vaccine at horribly slow rates."
2021-02-23 11:43:26,"I can agree with the gist of what you’re saying.  Realism can be put in the service of optimism as well as fear.  But it sometimes seems to me that all our discussions and debates about the path back to “normal” evade the important questions about what brought us to this crisis in the first place. If I had a heart attack, and the doctor attributed it to my lifestyle, I wouldn’t set my goal as returning to that lifestyle.  The Covid pandemic is essentially an environmental crisis, predictable & predicted.  Our relentless elimination of the habitat of other species leads to zoonotic infections, and the economies & lifestyles that entail millions of people jetting around the globe every day ensures their rapid spread.  There are no easy answers, but no one is even talking about whether and how the increase in these epidemics might be avoided."
2021-02-23 11:44:18,"Dear Ross,

At present, Buncombe County (Asheville) receives 2000 doses of vaccine each week to inoculate the residents who have put their names on the waiting list.  Presently that list of 52000 includes only healthcare workers and those who are 65+ years of age.  At the present rate, I will receive my first dose in late June or early July if the present priorities remain in place.  There is a high likelihood that teachers and other front line workers will be moved to the head of the list and that I won't receive my first dose until September.  The worst thing we can do now is relax our vigilance when we are so close to the end of the race.  I remember the experience of running the half mile on my high school track team.   The last 220 yards were pure pain.  Everything in my body wanted to stop running, and I seemed to be moving in slow motion.  It was a pure act of willpower to ignore all that and finish the race.  That's where we are now in the COVID crisis.  Don't quit.  Finish the race."
2021-02-23 11:47:29,"I get the mindset Fauci and Biden - better to underpromise and overdeliver than overpromise and undeliver.  But, I do think we're reaching a point in this pandemic where people need hope.  If we keep telling people to get the vaccine, but nothing will actually change after you get it, we're quickly going to reach a point where demand for the vaccine runs out and a significant portion of the population refuse to continue many of the pandemic restrictions.  There is real and significant reason to be hopeful right now about the state of the virus - it doesn't mean that hope won't crash head-long into a new twist or turn in the pandemic, but this is not the time to treat the American like children who can't hear the whole truth for fear that they go wild."
2021-02-23 11:49:24,"I would have more confidence in Mr. Douthat if he also hadn’t bemoaned his chronic Lyme disease and all the treatments he needed to feel better. 

He apparently had the money and insurance, but who pays for the people sickened if we open early without health care and benefits?"
2021-02-23 12:01:05,"We are a country, society or people - as you like, whos leadership has gone from "" The only thing we have to Fear is Fear itself""  to Fear is the only thing we have.  Biden, Fauci can proclaim whatever they want, at the current rate of expansion in vaccine supply the country will have inoculated  a vast majority of the population by late July. That majority will be paying attention to them by then."
2021-02-23 12:02:58,"Mr. Douthat, a little knowledge is a scary thing. What are the qualifications in medicine, public health and epidemiology that enable you to judge Dr Fauci with such confidence? Did you consider that his theory may be based on his decades of experience with infectious disease and the fact that this virus is novel and unpredictable? 

Of course everyone hopes for a return to normal life. Relying on enough people to assume personal responsibility is not reassuring while there are examples like Amanda Chase in the Virginia legislature who literally is in a perspex box because she refuses to wear a mask. The Epstein-Barr virus and Lyme disease are not spread in the same way as Covid. Joe Biden would be happy to announce ""with evidence"" that the emergency might be over by July 4th. Any politician would. But unlike Trump, perhaps he has the common sense to refrain from glib promises he cannot keep."
2021-02-23 12:04:12,"On Twitter, for months and months, conservative and libertarian media types (people who write articles and do podcasts) have been tweeting about the negative impact of lockdowns on children and families. None are mental health or medical professionals, epidemiologists, sociologists, economists, or suicidologists. They all present themselves as experts about mental health especially when it comes to children.  

When Trump was president they targeted local officials with their tweets about how lockdowns were killing small businesses and destroying the future of children. Now that Biden is president they’ve turned their focus on him as the problem.

This type of conservative or libertarian media type is very pro military service and assumes they are the most patriotic people due to their belief systems. Not surprisingly like many Americans they love the Greatest Generation.’

What they and Douthat seem to forget is that true patriotism, as displayed by the Greatest Generation, involves pulling together and making sacrifices until the war is won and everyone returns home. Once upon a time, conservatives didn’t spend all their time complaining about hard efforts or predicting American children would be facing a lifetime of mental illness because of a year spent sacrificing in order to save lives. No conservative including Douthat ever uses their platform to encourage Americans to keep at it until we get through this. 

It’s shocking to witness the decline of conservative values."
2021-02-23 12:08:22,"The virus is not going away.  Normalcy is not on the horizon - we will mask and social distance for many more months or years. But, students - from K through college - must be back in school. The mental health and educational toll on being remote is catastrophic and needs to be addressed immediately."
2021-02-23 12:16:01,"Curious. Mr. Douthat favors the less conservative approach.  Unfortunately, at this point in time, he is making some optimistic assumptions.  He is assuming that vaccination prevents very mild disease or nasopharyngeal colonization that would allow the virus to spread.  That is probably the case, but it is not yet entirely clear.  Secondly there is a risk that the more the virus is replicating, the more opportunities it has to mutate in a way that allows it to evade the current vaccines.  So there are advantages to minimizing spread in humans.  So I think we need a bit more information before opening things up.  If you look at graphs of disease activity in the U.S., it has gone down before, only to come back stronger than ever.  In this case, the more conservative approach may be the best option."
2021-02-23 12:16:48,"I find Americans excessively optimist .
You can see people already rejoicing and partying in small groups.
The drop in the curves is barely 2 weeks old.
Be careful of the consequences ."
2021-02-23 12:17:04,"What Fauci or Biden say about the state of the Covid-19 epidemic are quickly being overwhelmed by rate of reduction of infection and death here and in much of the world and the rapidly accelerating worldwide vaccination programs.

From a pragmatic standpoint, the CDC has stated that two weeks after the second Pfizer or Moderna vaccination, you no longer have to quarantine when coming into contact someone who is infected.  These people represent 5% of the country. If you add the 10 -20% of the country that are estimated to have been infected that means at least 25% of the country can already exercise a degree of ""normality"".

The various variants, as monitored by the UK, are not proving to be as dangerous as originally feared. That is one reason why PM Johnson announced that, possibly, by June 21 all restrictions in England could be lifted entirely.

It now appears that as quickly as Covid appeared it may finally be receding at a rapid rate as well to where it soon becomes just part of the yearly vaccination regimen."
2021-02-23 12:20:47,"This one bites off more than it can chew. Having a vaccine for kids is a huge piece of this puzzle. We’re learning more and more about some of the devastating effects the virus can have in children. And as mentioned, we’re looking at 2022 for the vaccine to be approved for young kids. 

So, it really is a tough decision - ride it out for another half year, or reopen very carefully with a LOT of extra effort and procedures in place (hint: it’s gonna feel ANYTHING BUT normal).  We should have a plan - one that’s continually reassessed as the situation develops and the facts come in. But I think it’s very important for folks to understand that it is a developing situation that is changing."
2021-02-23 12:22:53,Under-promise and over-perform. That is the secret to success in politics and just about everything else. Trump did the opposite and lost an election. Biden learned.
2021-02-23 12:23:20,"We need to stop focusing on herd immunity as the point where the gates open. It is premature. We don't yet know how effective vaccines are against preventing transmission although early data are promising, The prior analysis done in the NYT used the most optimistic assumption possible, which is unlikely.  When we consider that children are not likely to be vaccinated this summer, vaccine hesitancy, and increased transmission due to variants, the most likely scenario is that we will not reach herd immunity in 2021.  In fact, it is possible that we may never do so.
But we can and should still look forward to ""gate opening"".  If we focus on not overloading the health sector, we can find a way out. Fortunately, vaccines are spectacularly effective at limiting hospitalization. When we have enough people (particularly those at risk, but not only) vaccinated and the transmission is under some control (vaccines seem likely to help, but may not be enough, particularly initially) so that we don't have explosions of cases, we can return to more normal life.  The truth is we don't know exactly when this can be, particularly with variants that  impact vaccine effectiveness.  We may very well be able to reach this point before Christmas, but as it is also possible that we may not, our politicians and experts prefer to not set us up for disappointment. 
Frankly, I would prefer more honesty and less hedging."
2021-02-23 12:26:45,"I agree that things are looking better and a return to normalcy, in some form and to some degree, is possible by summer and the Administration is playing down expectations to avoid overpromising but that has downsides also. Widespread dismay at the growing numbers of dead and the still slow rollout of vaccine with the maddening difficulty of making appointments for so many is indisputable. I still do not perceive a clear national plan to combat the virus, increase vaccine production and distribution and the "" last mile"" of injections. Lastly, an inadequate job of informing minorities and vaccine skeptics is apparent. We must, at all costs, enlist trusted personalities to make public service announcements promoting the vaccine: figures like Oprah Winfrey, Alex Rodriguez, LeBron James. This PSAs should be on major networks continuously and social media in all languages. Biden is showing empathy and concern and Trump's crimes in dereliction of duty are obvious."
2021-02-23 12:28:11,"I don't believe that ""herd"" immunity is the goalpost, it should be full vaccination of the more vulnerable members of the population who then will be unlikely to die.   Now that's real progress and it's happening."
2021-02-23 12:28:43,"It is basically the end of the first wave in the USA.
Looking at other nation's pandemic should teach lessons.
Some countries are at their third or fourth wave : France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Portugal, etc..."
2021-02-23 12:31:40,"I wonder ...

What if the emergency doesn't end by the Fourth, but Biden follows Mr. Douthat's advice and soon starts promoting the happy thought that it might?

Will the tens of millions of people already having trouble grasping the complexity of the situation remember at that point that Biden only said it ""might be over by the Fourth of July""?"
2021-02-23 12:40:09,"I think everyone, including, it seems, Mr. Douthat, is grossly underestimating this thing.  I suspect it is going to last longer than a few years.  And I think we are never going to ""get back to normal.""  

This is not to argue we shouldn't do everything we can.  

But when you think historically--did things ""get back to normal"" after the Great Depression?  For many people, it never did get good again.  And the effects lasted for more than one or two generations.

I wish there were a way to be ""realistic"" about this.  But I don't hear anyone taking into account the entirety of the implications and ramifications of this pandemic and its accompanying economic and other disasters, many of which are and/or will be permanent."
2021-02-23 12:43:19,"Biden and Fauci are just being conservative.  

Lately, I've been thinking about the meaning of the word ""conservative.""   I'm an engineer; my field, ""conservative"" means to be cautious and careful. A  conservative engineer doesn't expect that everything will go exactly according to plan.  They put in buffers, safety margins, and contingency plans. A conservative engineer doesn't let his hopes for what might happen cloud his awareness of the risks, and accepts that there are times when that means he must put a damper on other people's enthusiasm for change.

It would be great to return to normal by July, but, conservatively, we should plan on December."
2021-02-23 12:43:59,"We'll learn more as we go. It would be premature to start forecasting the ""end"" of the pandemic until we see more evidence that optimistic projections are justified. I wonder if instead, Mr. Douthat would like to write a column on the end of the War on Terror, the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the like. Surely the same reasoning applies. Terrorism is now endemic, not pandemic. Maybe we can get rid of some of the restrictions imposed, like the Patriot Act. After all, the public has a right to know when the War on Terror will end, doesn't it?"
2021-02-23 12:44:26,"I agree. Once a significant portion of the population is vaccinated why can't we get back to normal? Note that I don't consider mask wearing an impediment to ""back to normal"". If we could just go back to 2019 life, but wearing masks, I'd be thrilled."
2021-02-23 12:45:02,"A good summary  of the active pandemic issues now  and well worth reading until the last paragraph- suggesting the emergency might be over by a specific date that is emotionally charged for the US- Independence Day- is not supported with specific evidence to justify the soft conclusion. The article was balanced, the title was not."
2021-02-23 12:45:17,"I found this article rather shallow.  As someone who is medically trained I totally agree with the longer view of Christmas.  It is not pessimistic it is reality, partially because of our inability to protect our children with vaccinations.  It is this last link in protection that good scientists and medical professionals are careful about.  That level of protection for the nation's children is critical to normal school activities.  Will we be able to protect our children before school opens in the fall?  Maybe, but who wants to risk our children's lives for maybe?"
2021-02-23 12:45:18,"This pandemic does not recede by wishing it away.  Scientists with deep expertise in virology, human behavior, epidemiology, and logistics are trying to determine outcomes based on these areas of expertise.  Outside opinion is not fully steeped in this knowledge.  You can guess, but that is all it is."
2021-02-23 12:45:46,"This opinion piece is flawed in it's reliance on two colleagues of Douthat estimating that 'the USA will have herd immunity by July.'  Here is the current CDC statement about herd immunity, ""There is no firm evidence that the antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are protective. If these antibodies are protective, it's not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.""  Until the real facts are in about herd immunity, along with a plan to address the new variants of the virus we will need a cautious approach to reopening the Country. Undo optimism, inaction, and ignorance has cost America over 500,000 lives.  Hope and optimism are essential to the human condition but should be tempered with the reality that scientific evidence and fact based action plans are required to truly eradicate this pandemic."
2021-02-23 12:50:35,"we are in a twilight zone.  schools are at the epicenter.  no scientist can ever say, nothing can happen that we haven't predicted.  they can say, the evidence so far says it is ok to open schools without vaccinating teachers.  Add a patina of political shading for a political donor and the message is, well you could open, but we now have enough vaccine to cover everyone so give it to teachers and open the school slowly, fully next year.

The main reason for the fear tactics now is the ovid relief bill where more than half the money goes to political favors and not to covid relief.  

All things need to be corrected for bias and the bias now is to scare people to prolong the spending spree.  No panic should go to waste; get while the getting is possible and extend the panic while the population is driven by fear."
2021-02-23 12:54:13,"I wonder if we need to look at this differently. Right now infections are going down and vaccinations are going up. With more dangerous variants looming and the virus less widespread, why not apply a knockout punch and do a two week national shut down and apply ever effort to test, isolate and contact trace every infection? This would be more effective now with lower numbers to locate and trace.

Bringing infection rates radically down quickly would buy time as vaccines roll out and prevent varients from being more widespread. It would save lives and perhaps make heard immunity more effective because when we are finally close to that threshold, there would be fewer opportunities to breech it.

This will never happen of course. We have become mediocre and casual about taking collective responsibility for anything in this country. Muddling thru festering problems seems to be our preferred strategy."

2021-02-23 12:55:05,"There are a lot of assumptions here. Critically, the notion that herd immunity exists for Corona Viruses in general is not well accepted. Most American's get one of the common Corona Viruses every year or two. Typically re-infections are asymptomatic or very mild. We do not know how CoV19 will behave in this regard. Even NYT columnists do not know this. Also, the variants do appear to be escape mutants to some extent, as Fauci notes, reducing transmission and replication will reduce mutations. Also, I suspect that Mr. Douthat knows that 10,000,000 or so Americans are immuno-compromised, and that he really doesn't care. 

It's pretty important to let qualified people make the decisions. It would be helpful if the echo chambers supported the experts. You can even pick and choose among experts as there is a huge diversity of opinions held by the knowledgeable. But when an expert adds a caveat that we don't know how long immunity lasts for CoV19, you should take that caveat seriously."
2021-02-23 12:57:14,"And then what?  We have not changed our response to this kind of vulnerability one iota.  The next pandemic will invoke another economic collapse and K shaped recovery.  States are no better equipped to digest a mammoth spike in unemployment claims now than they were last year.  Small businesses without strong banking relationships will sink again.  We need structural change to be able to ride out this kind of shock to our systems.  Universal basic income.  Medicare for all.  Immediate debt relief (not forbearance, as if the lenders were feeling the same pinch) when people cannot pay their bills.  Mr. Douthat seems to think that the end of THIS pandemic will mark a return to a happy, healthy society.  Not by a long chalk."
2021-02-23 12:57:14,"It’s a catch 22: if we act like it’s over, it won’t be; but if we act like it’s not over, it will be."
2021-02-23 12:57:21,I like you optimism.  But as we have experienced over the last 12+ months with 45’s outlandish optimistic views without any scientific based data. I would rather follow president Biden’s cautiously optimistic assessment following hard scientific data.
2021-02-23 12:57:29,"I will follow Mr. Douthat's advice when he shows me his Medical Certification as an expert in infectious disease.  Simply put, I will not second guess Dr. Fauci as Trump and the Republican party have done based on wishful thinking.  I would much rather have our county's leaders pushing us to be extremely careful while we recover than to jump the gun!  We are at 500,000 deaths and the adult thing to do is to stay vigilant!"
2021-02-23 13:02:47,"The difference in pandemic approaches between Republicans and Democrats are amazing, but not surprising.  It always seems to boil down to the issue of preserving human lives or maintaining a robust economy.  I praise those who favor the former.  Just look at Trump and make your own decisions, perhaps after asking the families of the 500,000 dead Americans what they think."
2021-02-23 13:03:36,"I couldn't agree more. It's just that many people isolated and swallowed in fear for the last 11 months. How can we get them to relax, know the cases are going down, that overwhelming odds show they will be fine even with zero risk. The outrage from teachers refusing to teach is incredible. Many of us have gone out all this time, and just did the right things. But the ones who didn't have to be reprogrammed into thinking life is safe again."
2021-02-23 13:06:48,"As the NYT showed with their excellent interactive piece the other day which listed the variables  in numerous combinations that contribute to when herd immunity will be achieved, this is a constantly changing situation with far too much uncertainty  to accurately predict when life will become 'normal' again.  Not the least of which is the behavior of people - possibly the hardest factor to predict. 
Using the example of not shutting down New England parks because of Lyme is not a valid comparison, as Lyme is not a highly infectious disease spread by human to human transmission.
     IMO, it's like attempting to say what the weather will be 37 days from tomorrow - just not possible.   IMO, what our President and Dr. Fauci are doing is  trying to prepare us for the worst, while hoping for the best.    Much of the answer to this question depends on what we all do - all of us.   For me, continuing to wear a mask and socially distancing will be a small price to pay for the foreseeable future, if it  helps to prevent the deaths of 500,000 more Americans."
2021-02-23 13:07:13,"In the face of 500,000 deaths (and still rising), caution seems justified. Fewer Americans were killed in WW2, yet we still have troops in Germany. Adaptation to prevailing conditions seems a wiser course than choosing a day when life returns to what we imagine it was pre-covid."
2021-02-23 13:09:43,"I am slightly perplexed that fellow commenters are so reflexively negative about the possibility of beating this thing by summer. I agree we ought to be cautious, but isn't it relatively straightforward when we lift restrictions? 

Imagine it's July and there are 3 Covid deaths per day nationwide and barely any cases. Will people still support the restrictions?"
2021-02-23 13:11:39,"I've had a difficult time writing a response, and I am not usually short on words...

The last year has been a difficult one. For me, the nightmare began as I was sleeping in Madrid when Trump announced there would be no more flights from Europe. I had taken a friend to Spain for her 50th birthday -- she had never been out of the country.

She was terrified. I put us on a plane to Malaga where we had a friend's flat for as long as we needed it. The next day, I put her on a plane back to the States. I followed a few days later, flying early because Spain was going into lockdown.

The worst part of the trip and, for me, the worst part of the pandemic was being held like cattle at border control at JFK. No one told us what would happen to us if we did have a temperature of 100.4+, and I still don't know. That was truly terrifying.

After finally getting home, I spent 14 days worrying that I had Covid-19. I didn't.

Fast forward to today, I am not nearly as afraid as I was then, but I am tired. I am tired of being at home. I am tired of not seeing my family. I am tired of missing ""normal.""

Understand that I understand my position. I live on 2 acres. I have been able to go outside whenever I want. I have not gotten Covid-19. I have kept my job at full pay. I never ran out of toiler paper. However, mentally the toll is real.

Regardless of how good things have been for me, I need a light at the end of the tunnel. So do others."
2021-02-23 13:16:27,"The amazing thing is that we now have federal policies to manage the viral pandemic. The Trump policy was let everyone get sick and if a lot of people die, well, tough luck. 
You may not agree with everything Biden and Fauci propose, but it is comforting to know that their proposals are based in science and patriotism."
2021-02-23 13:16:56,"Let’s be cautious, but then why do school buses not have seatbelts? How are risk ratios determined? Because a scientist makes a guess doesn’t mean the guess is science. Just saying."
2021-02-23 13:17:57,"Don’t let a crisis go,to waste ... the anthem of politicians. Career politicians on both sides have proven that their primary interest is keeping their job not the welfare of the country. As Covid-19 infection and death rates plummet, we rarely hear optimism from them. Look how much power they have grasped onto as a result of COVID ... shutdowns, lockdowns, massive spending, spotlight interviews virtually around the clock.  They seem to want to stretch out this moment in history for as long as possible. They seem to have little motivation to return the country to normal."
2021-02-23 13:18:15,"If this essay's approach to the pandemic crisis is any indicator, then as climate catastrophe approaches in the coming years, we can all look forward to pronouncements from King Canute tide-stopping conservatives like Douthat insisting that ""the crisis must end!""."
2021-02-23 13:18:45,"There are far too many uncertainties regarding this pandemic to take the Polyannish approach  the RD seems to advocate. Fortunately we now have a President who seems inclined to let the medical professionals mainly guide his policies. Sure we are all looking forward to relief, but the past mistakes should give us caution. Herd immunity is too uncertain a concept to make decisions by."
2021-02-23 13:19:47,We'll not live perpetually in the current state of semi-suspended animation but neither will we ever return to what went before (...whether that was 'normal' or not is an entirely different but very important question).  What has occurred has dramatically revealed far too many shortcomings in the status quo ante in so many aspects of life for us to simply return to what we did before.
2021-02-23 13:21:58,"When Mr. Douthat has some professional experience in public health, epidemiology, virology or medicine, I will consider listening to him.  As someone who works in public health doing contact tracing and case investigation, and as someone seeing the pace of vaccine roll out in a major city, Christmas is being optimistic.  Clearly, the author has not left his NY bubble.  If you go to Florida, Texas or other areas where rates are high and people refuse to social distance or wear masks, it will be longer.  
You have no basis to make these assumptions.  If you believe it, go move to a hot spot, wait for a vaccine and see what happens."
2021-02-23 13:23:03,"I typically view you as thoughtful, even if I don't always agree with you, but I'm not even sure what you're advocating here. A quicker return to normal? An announcement we might be able to return to normal quicker? 

We finally have an administration who is basing their actions on science and their predictions reflect what we know right now. There will be a natural accretion to pre-pandemic ways as more people are vaccinated or recover from Covid, but let's keep it natural.  

We're a nation of all or nothing thinkers and if Biden and Fauci let out the rope, even a little bit, many people will toss all caution to the wind, where their unmasked faces are likely to encounter particles of virus."
2021-02-23 13:23:29,"This is a quaint premise: The Covid Emergency Must End, because we say so.  We’re COVID-weary, our economy is struggling, there have already been enough deaths.  All true, all irrelevant.  To paraphrase Dr. Fauci, we don’t control the timeline, the virus does.
Remember that the rationale for “flattening the curve” was to keep our medical institutions from crippling overload.  This is as true today as it was a year ago.  We continue to see outbreaks when people choose to ignore the means of containment (because they’re weary, the local economy is struggling, they just need a little joy in their lives). 
What’s needed is an outlook re-boot: this may be with us for a long time, and we need to embrace the practices that protect us all.  The 2018 influenza outbreak persisted for more than 2 years before herd immunity was achieved (and that partially because the virus ran out of hosts, having killed so many).
I have been vaccinated.  I will continue to wear masks, avoid indoor gatherings, maintain social distancing.  I’m committed to doing my part - the only part that I control - until the virus is done with us."
2021-02-23 13:24:29,Ross is prejudging an outcome that doesn’t need to be prejudged.  It will be readily apparent that pandemic is over when it’s over and people will act accordingly quite on their own.  Why is he trying to box the administration into setting an arbitrary date now?
2021-02-23 13:28:30,"Wishful thinking may feel good, but prudent directives based on numbers should rule the day. If Biden's and Fauci's less optimistic  predictions are proven wrong, great. But to sunnily proclaim July 4th may be a return to normality may be the job of the columnist, but not of the savvy politician and especially not the job of the sober scientist. Expectations need to be managed, not stoked for political or emotional gain. The previous administration proved that."
2021-02-23 13:28:33,"It's nearly two months since the vaccine. Both Biden and Trump were in agreement it would arrive when it did. Trump had a more optimistic time table but it's happening.

It's hard to get a consistent idea of whats going on. a story on how  the hospitals are running out of space is followed by another saying hospitals never been so empty. New Zealand shuts down again. Germany, France, and Italy are thinking of it and we have leveled here. 

Keep in mind we count the dead differently than the Europeans. And it just wasn't NY's Governor that moved patients into nursing homes. The numbers we see don't tell the whole story. Neither does blaming it all on Trump.

I'm nearly 65 so I'll have to wait a little longer for my turn . Although I'm capable of using a computer it's hard to get answers and register.  I don't understand why they don't register everyone and move the date around till it available.

Then there's people without I-phones or computers who could only register by phone. I find it hard to believe people there's no technology to deal with registration without getting a busy signal for weeks at a time."
2021-02-23 13:29:50,"How about we end emergency measures when the emergency is actually over, rather than relaxing too soon, allowing allowing the virus to take off again, creating a situation that may be permanently uncontrollable. The situation CAN get worse. Victory is not guaranteed."

2021-02-23 13:33:33,"Thank you Ross. I feel like the ""just follow the science"" crowd has generally been understating the effectiveness of the vaccines in order to handle expectations/prevent mass reopenings. It's almost like an inverse of the mask discourse a  year ago. The blunt truth is that the vaccines are as close to a miracle drug as one can get and an accelerated campaign can end the coordination problem of lockdowns/mask-wearing by the summer. After that it becomes a question of individual risk tolerance, like driving a car."
2021-02-23 13:35:38,"So says Dr. Douthat, MD. After a year of misinformation, failures of leadership and unlettered pundits pontificating on matters of epidemiological expertise, it’s little wonder that we’re all a bit confused. The truth is that our best science still has much to learn about this virus and its potential to spread in the context of limited vaccines and their unknown effect on transmission.

It’s best to take things at a well considered (scientifically grounded) pace, erring a bit on the conservative side of science, allowing the public to rebuild its faith in a newly politically independent CDC. Half a million dead justifies a modicum of caution before launching headlong into reopening without a reasonably clear understanding of the consequences.

Yes, our sacrifices, and those of our children, are painful. As we approach a mortality count of comparable to the 1918 flu, be cognizant of the sacrifices our dear departed and their loved ones have made."
2021-02-23 13:38:23,"After just walking into two local businesses owned by seemingly mature local men not wearing masks while observing many of their customers both wearing and not wearing masks, I increasingly believe it's all about machismo in addition to profits. These guys are both educated  and not arrogant but their trade depends on some of the latter so they likely fancy themselves brave and practical and fitting into the local culture. Not surprisingly, the older men over 60 were ALL are wearing good masks properly."
2021-02-23 13:38:47,"During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the few American towns that completely shut their doors to outsiders and observed all precautions had no cases of flu. 

The rest of the world did not fare well; the horses were already out of the stables. New estimates of death in those years, based on more sophisticated computer modeling, are in the 60-100 million range.

Given all too many Americans' resistance to observing precautions, it might be that this coronavirus is very much here to stay. It behooves the rest of us to be careful. 

When spouse and I are vaccinated, possibly in March, for our first excursion since last year we'll drive down to Winterthur to see the remains of March Bank. And we'll still be wearing masks."
2021-02-23 13:40:59,"The article does not seem to take into account that we need a majority of individuals to be comfortable resuming everyday activities in order to get back to normal.  While it is dependent on  the confidence of our leaders on vaccinations, herd immunity and collective behavior, but it really depends on what individuals are willing to do. In my community many have embraced resuming normal life, frequenting stores, restaurants and the like. However, many more of us are just staying put, doing outdoor activities and take out.  I probably won't resume normal activities until I get vaccinated and even then will continue to be careful until we see some true sign of herd immunity in the US."
2021-02-23 11:37:45,"Unfortunately, for us, the citizens, Fauci's views and opinions, seem to change with the wind."
2021-02-23 12:07:32,"""But after a year of misery, death and sacrifice, the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over.""

In advance Mr. Douthat?!

Are you serious?

Dr. Fauci says ""degree of normalcy"", but you in your trend line studies expertise accuse him of being pessimistic?

As for ""in advance"", the rabbis of the Talmud had an interesting statement: after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, prophecy was taken away from prophets and given to fools and little children. 

How old are you Mr. Douthat? I assume not a little child. 

We know so very little about all of this. 

I would suggest a little more caution in thinking about ""normalcy""  or even a ""degree of normalcy""."
2021-02-23 11:25:35,"""I am not vested with ... Fauci’s expertise"" he says but goes on. 'Cause he's the smartest guy in the room? any room?

How about putting in some effort to understand what drives Fauci's pessimism 1st."
2021-02-23 13:30:33,"Sorry, really random wanderings on complex issues.  No news here, no useful advice. 

Herd immunity does not imply what you think it does.  Nor does the virus retreat or stop mutating."
2021-02-23 13:32:52,"I'd rather leave these decisions to medical experts, not conservative pundits."
2021-02-23 13:22:46,"The social contract of not hurting others needs to be promoted:  if you are have a fever or cough, stay home or use curbside. If your child has a fever, don't hand him a fever-reducer and send him to school.  Don't party without a mask and then go about as if you can't possible be asymptomatic. Don't assume that your vaccine means you can't spread the disease -- we all know of children who were vaccinated against measles and got measles anyway. 
 This is worse.  ""I got mine, the heck with you "" needs to be quenched."
2021-02-23 13:35:38,Time to call out how ineffective Trump and the Republican led Senate was in reacting to the Virus and how poor the planning for the vaccine rollout was. Is the next article going to examine the ineffective role of the Republican led Federal Government and then plan to give much more power to the states. Maybe Texas should be the guide to less Federal Government and more State government solutions lol.
2021-02-23 12:56:02,"""Fauci clearly has a theory of his own role that involves steering public expectations rather than just saying flatly what he thinks.""  Excuse me?  Fauci has been one of the loudest and clearest expert voices from the beginning, but you can read between some non-existent lines?  Just like we should accept that your reading of trends is the correct one?  Haven't you noticed that trends have been flipping back and forth for over a year now?  

And the rest of your argument is based on a lot of ""ifs"", and conveniently overlooks what happens if one of those ""ifs"" doesn't come out the way you say it should.  You presume everyone will have easy access to vaccinations before they get infected, but you say nothing about how class and race and gender affect how all this plays out.  I resent that you are so impatient that you would gamble with my health because you want to speed things up, because you have had ""enough.""  And I resent this ""optimism"" vs ""pessimism"" type of argument.  It is needlessly divisive.  How about ""pragmatism""?  As far as I'm concerned, this needs to take as long as it takes so that we aren't endlessly yo-yo-ing back and forth.  I'll wear my mask as long as I have to, I'll stay safe in public, I will not resent things not being ""normal"" until I know we are all safe.  I'm older than you, but I will take the time to wait.  I suggest you make a better case for speeding things up and/or slow down, because your proposals are just going to take us backward."
2021-02-23 13:43:11,"Wishful thinking is not a strategy. 
We will return to some semblance of normal when the virus has become less dangerous  due to vaccinations and herd immunity.  Pushing the timeline is not an answer."

Wouldn't it be fabulous if the scientific predictive analysis were not so variable saturated and ambiguous. Unfortunately, that's what predictive science is ; the best facts now but many variable could vary widely.  Thankfully, now we have a real President relying on real science & real scientists - and in real science, there is no hidden agenda, just a lot of variables and ambiguity. Better to support the leadership we now have that actually will do something about this pandemic; keep the pressure up, sure - but more infections is not the road to herd immunity, its the road to a larger death toll. More pressure on the public to comply & the government to hurry up; but the science is the science; better the science than the pie in the sky, fantasy reality we have so often been fed by conservatives in the last 4 years & the last decades: I'll continue to trust the science & the facts as they become available - you can create a fantasy and live in it if you like"

The people who are ""tired of these restrictions"", the ones in the gyms sans mask, in the bars yelling loudly, will be the ones dragging this out into next year.

It is reasonable to believe that every single person in this nation who is mentally fit wants this deadly threat to go away so normal life can return for our all-American ""pursuit of happiness."" But calling the exact date is folly, an invitation to ridicule and relapse, and leaves no room for changing hearts, minds and right-wing propaganda sabotage. 

This columnist owes us a follow-up opinion piece on July 4, 2021, which is a Sunday."

For those who must actually make decisions, however, with the health and lives of others in the balance, the better approach is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best."
2021-02-23 13:45:21,"Wasn’t it this kind of denialist thinking that led to the second wave last summer - and massive third wave of the recently passed holiday season? Yes we are all exhausted by masks, school shut downs, nursing home closures, MASKS, and other restrictions but let’s leave magical thinking to 2 year olds."

2021-02-23 12:26:46,"The former guy was screaming to high heavens that this COVID-19 is just a Democratic hoax among many other lies.

Also, aren’t opinion writers allowed to use the word “lie” over “without evidence?”

About the return to normalcy, Dr.
Fauci said it best —

“The virus dictates the timeline.”"
2021-02-23 12:18:06,It's estimated that general availability of the vaccine will be July/Aug. What world do you live in pal?
2021-02-23 13:47:44,"The problem with achieving herd immunity through infection, besides the mortality and sickness, is that large amounts of virus in large numbers of people produces more mutations and a greater likelihood of dangerous new strains.  It's a numbers game. That's why the virus must be suppressed as rapidly as possible through vaccination and preventive measures.  We are literally in a race against ever more lethal new mutations. 

Can we have, say, baseball again in the spring, with packed stadiums?  Probably not.  Maybe proof of vaccination is what is needed to get into the stadium.  We need some fresh thinking on this, but hurrying up a re-opening may be a disaster."
2021-02-23 13:48:38,"It's great that children either don't get the virus or don't have such extreme cases.  However, they live in homes with other people, perhaps elderly or health-compromised people, not to mention. siblings and parents.  If a child brings the virus home and, in spite of a weak case him or herself, what if the parent--breadwinner or homemaker--gets it and the case is severe?  Is that a problem?  Isn't that why teachers and many parents fear the opening of schools--not for the children's sake but for the sake of the more vulnerable adults?"
2021-02-23 13:49:14,"I was too a bit surprised seeing Biden's town hall, and Fauci on the Sunday shows this past weekend, where they made the Christmas declaration.  A few months ago the stated goal if I remember correctly is that we would be largely normal by the 4th of July with the usual caveats.  

I agree that it is important to shoot for a goal of sooner rather than later.  You want citizens to all work together with the goal of ""getting back to normal"" by Summer lets say.  If you push it out to Christmas, my worry is that people would just become fatalistic and just say that all this is not worth it.  Not to mention all the collateral damage, no school for kids, families stressed out, more economic suffering."
2021-02-23 11:36:17,"Promises, promises. Americans lack expertise and knowledge but they are supremely impatient and driven by self interest. So the governor of South Carolina refuses to close bars which fuel the spread. And the governor of NY underreports nursing home deaths because of the optics. And the governor of Florida, well, he just denies there is much of a problem in his state and by the way just keep those tourist dollars flowing. The facts are that medical experts are learning more gradually but the novel viruses are fickle and won't cooperate. So we wear our masks and don't do foolish things that might kill us or our loved ones."
2021-02-23 12:04:31,"I have gotten used to wearing a mask.  I don’t consider it to be some unbearable burden.  I consider it an easy way to express and act out, if only in some small way, concern for my fellow human beings.  The drastic drop in flu cases is a reason for celebration.  We need to get back to a mindset of all pulling together for one another.  MACA.  Make America Compassionate Again."
2021-02-23 11:12:49,I think that President Biden and Dr. Fauci are playing it safe.  They are not over predicting and will cope with being called for that when things get better earlier.
2021-02-23 12:25:20,"Trump over-promised and under-delivered. Republicans seized on his lies to demand re-opening way to early. Now literally hundreds of thousands of people who might still be alive and healthy are dead or living with long-term health problems, Biden promised that 100 million doses of vaccine would be delivered in his first 100 days as President, and he’s on track to be well ahead of that schedule. Tell me in what world overpromising and under-delivering is a better practice than under-promising and over delivering?"
2021-02-23 13:51:19,"My hope is that good personal hygiene habits and mask wearing remain after the pandemic.  Think of the money (and inconvenience) to be saved by reducing the rate of influenza, cold, and norovirus infection by 90%."
2021-02-23 13:52:34,"So you're more optimistic. Good for you. Here's my also uneducated opinion. Cases are dropping because of a mix of herd immunity among the careless and those who cannot mitigate the risk, AS WELL AS careful mask-wearing and social distancing among the rest of us. In other words, it's a balance, and I think you are reckless for proposing that we should drop our guard before the experts tell us it is safe."
2021-02-23 12:10:21,"Wrong metaphor. This is more like a war and you can’t predict with any certainty when a war might end. Under promise and over deliver is a good strategy as it gives incentive to people to pursue the best outcomes by cooperating in mask wearing for example. At the end of the day, this boils down to the Social Contract and the duties we owe each other in a free society. I wear a mask to protect me and you and you need to do the same. We’ve failed miserably in understanding and implementing the social contract with predictable results. How many of the 500,000+ Covid deaths could have been prevented by better cooperation? That one conditional statement is much more important than all of the conditional statements in this piece."
2021-02-23 13:52:59,"Since we have significant numbers of anti-vaxxers who refuse to protect themselves and their children from Covid, the virus is likely to remain in the population for quite some time, and mutations will also keep appearing. Perhaps the reason that President Biden and Dr. Fauci are saying that things will be back to normal by December is that they do not want people to lower their guards too early. Reopening states too early was a major cause of the virus spread. 

In addition, people are eager to resume travel for both business and pleasure, but to do so safely requires global herd immunity. That may not happen until December because those in poorer countries may not be vaccinated until then. Covid is a pandemic, and we should be thinking beyond our own shores, not just how to get the local bars full again."
2021-02-23 13:53:52,"Look at Portugal, which has been in a fairly strict lockdown since the beginning of the month, including a ban on intermunicipal weekend travel  to cut down on the custom of adults spending weekends with parents. Their rate of daily cases has dropped from over 16,000 (worst in the EU) to under 600 today.  In three weeks.

Yes, of course vaccinate. But do not try to manage lockdowns to a tolerable level of illness.  We do not try to handle air safety to a tolerable number of airliner crashes."
2021-02-23 12:09:07,I’m thinking this is a case of under-promise and over-deliver. We had Trump who promised everything and delivered nothing. This is the reverse and for good reason.
2021-02-23 13:54:15,"For once, I totally agree with you Ross. Once vaccines are available to all adults, if you choose not to get one, that's on you. Society has barely tolerated the restrictions placed on it when there was an actual emergency. Society will not tolerate them once vaccines are available to all."
2021-02-23 13:55:27,"Yes, we need to get back to normal as soon as all adults have had a chance for vaccination.  

The calls for never ending restrictions are not based on any rational cost-benefit analysis, and I suspect they also undermine what would be a much more realistic and impactful message: ""re-double your efforts to protect against Covid for another 2-3 months, and then we will be there"".

We know by now that the overall population infection fatality rate for Covid is somewhere between 0.5% and 1.0% (the CDC's recent estimate for total U.S. infections puts the IFR close to the lower end of this range), and for everyone less than 50 years old the infection fatality rate averages less than 0.1%.  The vaccines are proving to be more than 90% effective in preventing serious illness: that means the overall population infection fatality rate from Covid would drop to 0.05% - 0.1% for the overall population and less than 0.01% for middle age and younger Americans.  These levels of risk are a tiny fraction of the risks we always take to live our lives. 

Why would we live in isolation with a stunted economy, diminished interaction with family and friends, and inadequate schooling to protect against risks that will become less than the annual risk of accidental death for almost all Americans?  Life is for living!"
2021-02-23 13:55:57,"500,000 deaths. In part because many in government did not want to hurt the economy, or it will be over by April or more people die in automobile accidents or it is too expensive to protect those in nursing homes. We did not take the virus as seriously as we should in the beginning so let us not say we are out of the woods too quickly. There seems to be evidence that we may have to learn to live with this virus and the mutations for some time so getting back to normal may take longer than we had hoped for."
2021-02-23 13:56:05,"This will happen naturally.  People who are vaccinated will be less careful, despite what Dr. Fauci says.

Grandparents who are vaccinated will want to hug their grandchildren again.  Doctors, nurses, teachers, essential workers, and other vaccinated classes will be going back to restaurants and bars.

This attitude will spread.  The pressure to see friends and family, which was strong even at the peak of the pandemic (during the holidays), will not be lessened by 4-5 more months of isolation, and this summer will be mostly back to normal, regardless of what Biden and Fauci say. There will certainly be another spike, but it will be blunted by increased immunity due to vaccines and previous infections."
2021-02-23 13:56:26,"If most of the immunity was conferred through vaccination, I would be inclined to agree on an expedited timeline as that means, in theory, less infections and thus less chances for the virus to mutate. However, given the astronomical numbers of infections worldwide, the virus is persistently mutating which gives it the chance to infect vaccinated people which could in turn spur more mutations.

I'd be shocked if we see anything related to normal prior to 2022. Even today, with infection numbers still far above where they were in the summer, you see people not masking, not social distancing, engaging in risky behavior, restrictions being lifted, thinking that vaccination equals immunity. It all adds up to prolonged pandemic responses.

And just to underscore how fragile all of this is, my colleague's wife is a physician and received both doses of the vaccine (not sure if Pfizer or Moderna) and 11 days after the second dose (which should have provided pretty decent immunization at that point), she tested positive for covid along with her family. She had the worst symptoms of all of them (no hospitalization required, but she had very typical ""flu-like"" symptoms).

To my knowledge, no testing was done to determine the variant, but my guess is that it was perhaps a variant that can, at least partially, evade vaccination conferred immunity."
2021-02-23 13:56:43,"Another overly optimistic pie in the sky column regarding the pandemic. I do not know Mr. Douthat's situation, but I am acutely aware of my own circumstances - an over 60 educator fortunately without health complications which puts me at the very back of the vaccine line. I have been told not to expect to be vaccinated until some time in the fall semester which of course my employer will most likely want me to deliver in-person. I love my job but will not endanger my life and health or my spouse's life and health by an unvaccinated return to campus especially when I can count the years to retirement on one hand. I fully intend on physically distancing for some time and will wear a mask in public for the foreseeable future. Mr. Douthat can wish all he wants, but the virus will decide when it is finished with us, not the doctors, the politicians, or NYT columnists."
2021-02-23 13:58:13,"And what happens if Biden takes your advice, offers the public a likely date for a return to ""normalcy,"" and it turns out the pandemic isn't over by then?  I imagine people will be angry.  The Biden administration will have suffered a self-inflicted wound (much to the delight of Republicans).  But what's worse, public confidence in the new administration's management of the pandemic will be weakened.  Promised a return to normalcy and upset that the promise was broken, people just might take matters into their own hands and throw off pandemic restrictions that are still necessary, causing a new spike in infections and ultimately extending the course of the pandemic.  The Biden team appears to know that honesty is the best policy, and they aren't about to make promises they can't keep."
2021-02-23 14:03:07,"Hi Ross,
Can't argue with you about this trending in a very positive direction. But we are also in that period of time that if we stop wearing maskings, stop social distancing, and all  other the little things we must do, then we will lose more lives unnecessarily. Americans have been terrible at responding to warnings --  and will hear the positive news as permission to return to normal. So let's not get too optimistic too soon."
2021-02-23 14:03:11,"I agree all the evidence indicates we should be in a very different place by the summer. Fauci and Biden probably know this, too. Are they taking a more pessimistic public stance merely to be seen to ""underpromise and overdeliver""? Maybe, but that cynical political game doesn't seem to fit the character of either man.

What I think is, they are both genuinely worried - as they should be - that optimistic talk right now will lead to a premature relaxation of the measures that we still need to slow the virus and reduce its death toll until the vaccines take hold. What if their caution could save, oh, another 50,000 lives between now and then? I'd say that would be a good reason to speak cautiously right now.

There will be time enough for heady optimism when we are much closer to getting back to something like normal. For now, Biden and Fauci are right to preach staying the course."
2021-02-23 14:08:42,"Have we not been to the same position in our thinking several times, only to cause flare-ups in the virus spread? What about the segment of the population who refuse to wear a mask now and don't get vaccinated?

Optimism is good but only when there are reasons for it. At this point, excessive optimism will fuel the pandemic."
2021-02-23 14:11:37,"""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and right now both their takes look way too pessimistic.""

Thanks all the same Ross, but we know where amateur hour and contempt for experts got us."
2021-02-23 14:13:34,"""But once you can vaccinate the elderly and others who are vulnerable, the disease can still circulate among younger and healthier people without it being a constant mass-fatality threat.""

I agree, but the troubling thing is that there exists a large segment of elderly people who don't want to be vaccinated. I deliver food to elderly members of my parish, and when I ask them if they're scheduled for a vaccine, a lot of them respond that they won't get it since they don't trust the vaccine. As much as we laud how quickly the vaccines were developed, the campaign to convince people of its safety has failed miserably. I'm not an anti-vaxxer but even I'm a little nervous about Pfizer and Moderna, which make use of a technique that we don't even know the long term effects of. There's a reason why hospitals are having to throw away extra doses. Biden and Fauci are right to be pessimistic about the timeline since I think herd immunity is a lot farther away than July 4 as you postulate."
2021-02-23 14:15:36,"Well, not everyone who wants a vaccine is going to be able to get one by summer.  I have a child who will be 11 this summer, just outside of that age range for which the vaccine is currently being tested.  I would love for her to have a vaccine, but they're saying it could be 2022.  Sigh.  I hope you're right about big improvments within a few months, but it can keep spreading among children and vulnerable adults (for whom the vaccine was not effective) until there is a vaccine for all ages."
2021-02-23 14:29:48,"Douthat's opening line ""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies"" tells us all we need to about this argument. Mr. Douthat, leave public health and medical care to the experts, not to media columnists who have an agenda to push.

No, we don't close down schools for Epstein-Barr or Lyme disease because they aren't as highly transmissible as Covid, don't have as high hospitlization and death rates. But, actually, we do close schools when a virus is spreading in that school - whether Norovirus, hand foot & mouth, measles, or any of the other viruses that spread among children. Most importantly about these diseases though, many adults have already been exposed to them and are immune. The key danger of Covid is that it's ""novel"" - no one has immunity so it spreads like wildfire through the entire population.

And the assumption that we can just let the disease spread among the young population because they aren't as likely to get very sick is a slap in the face to the thousands of families who have lost family members who were supposedly too young or healthy to die of Covid. Plus, even if they don't die, folks under 40 - who are the key workers in our economy - might not want to be put in the crossfire of infection either."
2021-02-23 14:31:48,"It would be useful for both officials and professionals to level with the people.  Shading what you say not according to the truth as you know it, but behavior you wish to elicit is not only manipulative, but counter-productive.  If there is a hint that vaccines won't work, then anti-vaxxers are encouraged, and in no small way."
2021-02-23 14:31:53,"We just got finished with a president who promised us we'd be back in the pews by Easter -- of 2020. Biden and Fauci are making realistic predictions of when the virus will be contained, and I don't think they'll be shy if the news is better than expected. As for giving cover to ""overly cautious"" politicians, this is a red herring; there aren't any. Would that there had been more caution back when it was possible to save some of the 500,000 lives lost, a grim milestone reached this very day."
2021-02-23 14:34:06,"I think we may need to retool our concept of normalcy, the thing everyone seems to be pining for these days, as the virus has shown us it was an illusion to begin with. The empty streets in my area at the end of March last year were jarring. Then it all looked much the same again. Utah has been “normal” since May 16 except masks and certain distancing measures at restaurants, clubs or public events, and the governor’s brief state of emergency Nov. 9 to 23. Most schools reopened in August. Hospitals and care homes still restrict or ban visitors as I expected.

The world is a dangerous home, subject to earthquakes, storms, economic collapse or nuclear war at any time, disasters that can happen without warning. And if the state doesn’t punish us for health scofflawry, the virus will. Ross Douthat describes the objective factors related to Covid accurately. But he misjudges President Biden, who understands the emergency won’t end all on schedule by July 4. Optimism, in a liberal American Catholic view, consists of realizing we have life in a blessed land right now, not in the hubris of placing demands on the future."
2021-02-23 14:34:23,"""But once you can vaccinate the elderly and others who are vulnerable, the disease can still circulate among younger and healthier people without it being a constant mass-fatality threat.""

When I was looking at a collage that featured photos of the 500K dead, I was stunned at how many of them were younger people. So please stop with the ""younger people can get it and survive"" fallacy.
 
""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and right now both their takes look way too pessimistic.""

One of the primary reasons that the virus keeps spreading and spiking is because of people and state governments letting their guard down when the trend lines go down. I as well am not vested with Biden's authority and Fauci's expertise, but I can see the cause and effect in relaxing pandemic precautions. Maybe this will change once more people get vaccinated. 

The reason we are in our current predicament with COVID is because the previous presidential administration would not take the pandemic seriously and used it as a political football in an election year. Optimism based on deliberate lies and an entire lack of caution is what got us here; exercising caution is the only way out."
2021-02-23 14:37:48,"When I hear a date when ""anybody who wants a vaccine can get one,"" I am reminded of one year ago March 6, ""anybody who wants a test can have a test.""

I live in a state ranked 47th for vaccinating the elderly, and while my age group is finally--after teachers--supposed to be vaccinated, I haven't heard a word, and I don't expect to for some time.

If Biden said we would return to normal on July 1 and it were July 3, Fox and the others would label it ""The Big Lie.""  Under promise and overdeliver works just fine.  The lack of screaming is good for my hearing."
2021-02-23 14:38:11,"Really? The emergency *has* to end. Perhaps you can personally convey your suggestion to the virus. Maybe you think it reads your opinion column? Science is always interpreted. Then it's reinterpreted when new data is available. Deciding in advance what we like and discarding the rest is the callus disregard that got us in this vile situation. There is no normal for me to go back to because my mom is gone. I am eligible for the vaccine but there are no appointments. I'm thinking maybe summer if I'm lucky. And the mental equation you seem to be making between acceptable deaths and our economy is everything that is wrong with our nation. And, no, the virus coming or leaving won't change that."
2021-02-23 14:40:33,"Mr. Douthat writes that people are struggling, despairing and they need a sense of hope and a light at the end of the tunnel.
For me, that hope came way back in November 2020, after election results clearly showed there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  

When Representative John Lewis from Georgia passed away, Michelle Goldberg, Mr. Douthat's former podcast partner, wrote in a NYT piece that Rep. Lewis lived his life making hope a 'practice' instead of a 'feeling.'  I've remembered that everytime I put on my mask, watch my distance, or use that icky gel on my hands.  

Mr. Douthat also writes that ""the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably by over.""
In my humble opinion, that's just wishful thinking, the type of thinking we were getting from Trump this time last year."
2021-02-23 14:42:20,"The truth is that we don't know. Just as the present vaccines might not protect against a new variant, so to naturally acquired herd immunity might not protect against a new variant. What we do know is that the faster we drive down the spread of the virus, through masks and social distancing and rapid vaccination, the less likely it becomes that new variants will appear. And the longer we postpone the development of a new variant the more time we provide for the medical community and vaccine makers to catch up so they can deal with a new variant should it appear. It seems to be that is exactly what Biden/Fauci are doing. Finally somebody in charge with a brain."
2021-02-23 14:43:22,"Thank you Ross, for a bit of sanity: public health concerns need to be balanced against the other costs. I'm particularly worried about young adults, who are much less likely to die from Covid and yet bore the brunt of the costs of shutting down the country. My students haven't had a proper college course for a year, not to mention all the extracurricular stuff that is associated with being young. They lost their side jobs (waitressing, etc.). Most didn't even get a stimulus check, because young people who are on their parents' income tax get nothing (look it up), when seniors who still get their retirement payments got the full payment. These same young people, not seniors, will be the ones stuck paying back the huge national debt we incurred over the past year.
I know this goes against the instincts of our septuagenarian authorities (Trump, Biden, Fauci, Pelosi...), but we need to weigh the interests of the young against those of the old. We can't sacrifice this generation."
2021-02-23 14:45:29,"""What has been up till now a collective-action problem, justifying restrictions and closures and mask mandates, will become more of a matter of individual responsibility, where people who don’t get a vaccine are primarily putting themselves rather than society at risk."" This is an incorrect surface-level analysis.  We live in a complex society where people do not suffer their own consequences on isolation, as appealing as such simple schadenfreude is.  Yes, someone who is critically ill from COVID because they refused vaccination will take up an ICU bed because we won't let such people die on the streets.  While the numbers of such people will not swamp hospitals like the spring of 2020, they are still taking up finite resources in hospitals that are working through backlogs of surgical cases.  Such is person is essentially keeping a grandma in constant pain from getting a long awaited hip surgery, or delaying a surgery to remove a growing tumor that hopefully has not spread.  That's why it is best to leave public health matters and medical matters to the physicians and not the pundits."
2021-02-23 14:45:36,"Does “normalcy” mean what life was like before the Pandemic?

If so, I don’t think that life is coming back before the end of 2021. 

What will happen is that by the summer, many will have been vaccinated and there will be outdoor dining and activities.  We will feel some semblance of normalcy.

But will people return to international travel, cruises, indoor theater and concerts?  The end of 2021 may be optimistic, in part, because the world will not have been completely vaccinated.

And some of the changes wrought by the Pandemic may be permanent.  More people will work from home.  More on-line shopping may be the final blow for shopping malls.  The travel industry, especially internationally, might bounce back but with reduced clientele.  Who wants to get stuck in some international port during the next Pandemic?

So let’s enjoy the summer and hope for the best for next winter.

P.S.  Having just been fully vaccinated, I look forward to doing the same activities I’ve been doing, but with less fear.  But until the scientists tell me that the vaccine prevents me from transmitting the disease, I need to follow the protocols.  So no return to normalcy quite yet."
2021-02-23 14:45:36,"Gotta love the selective thinking of the conservative mind.  Douthat says if we speed up vaccination will arrive at herd-immunity faster. Yes, to state the obvious. But the speedy delivery of the vaccine was delayed by the Trump administration and all the conservatives who supported him.  They had no plan for an effective delivery and distribution system, nor any desire to create one. Conservatives resisted the very seriousness of the pandemic from day one. 

Furthermore, the vaccine deliveries have been delayed because of the recent cold weather and failure of the Texas electrical grid.  Conservatives don’t believe in spending the money to be prepared for climate disaster or pandemics. That would make a better column.

So it would seem that Douthat’s tribe has been the obstacle to achieving what Douthat is suggesting.

Douthat says we risk a spike if we don’t enforce social distancing or if a more infectious variant spreads.  But the silver lining of more death is more herd immunity. “More people will die,” but hey, that’s life, to paraphrase the omniscient Donald Trump. And Ross Douthat.

Douthat says: “I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise.”  Ross, let’s just leave it at that."
2021-02-23 14:46:34,"Why should (theoretically) low risk people take the vaccine if they still have to take the same precautions? They still have to wear masks, socially distance, endure lockdowns, and test when traveling. Plus the vaccine can cause nasty side effects and if they get sick from it their employer is not required to pay for their time off, even if they mandate it. They're still punished even if they're vaccinated. I don't see normalcy returning until the majority of people get vaccinated and unless people receive a reward for being vaccinated, they will be hesitant to get it. It will still take a long time for it to circulate through unvaccinated people. There's no way we will achieve herd immunity by summer."
2021-02-23 14:56:34,A real question for investigative reporting is why are children not included in trials?  Why is an important part of the population being omitted that could not only be at risk but put other segments at risk?
2021-02-23 14:58:24,"We've just come out of four years of constant gaslighting Mr. Douthat. This is what leadership by competent adults looks like. Sorry if it's not to your taste, but this isn't about 'feel good' messaging at the expense of dealing with real problems.

CNN has stopped carrying White House press briefings because they're apparently considered boring and a ratings loser. (I actually find them reassuring.) 

Would you prefer to be entertained and lied to, or would you rather live in the reality-based community? And when did you develop the expertise to tell us the emergency is over?  

We just hit half a million dead from the pandemic; it's not over. Vaccines are now available, but we're still struggling with getting them to the most vulnerable. We have people still insisting it's all a hoax, refusing to do the simple things we need because they don't want to be inconvenienced.

Sorry if you are experiencing 'emergency fatigue' Mr. Douthat, but you are just going to have to deal with it like the rest of us. We are entering the age of permanent rolling emergencies because we spent the last few decades refusing to take the steps needed to prevent them. 

Texas is just the latest reminder that climate change is real and getting worse. The attack on the Capitol may have dispersed, but the mob is still out there. Ebola is trying to flare up again. Trumpism is alive and well in the GOP. Millions are still waiting for covid relief.

Keep calm and carry on."
2021-02-23 12:34:08,"So, Mr Douthat, the Covid emergency must end.  You need to speak to ""god"" about that!"
2021-02-23 13:25:44,"Ross, you start your third paragraph telling us to stop reading:
""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but  . . .""

Nuff said."
2021-02-23 12:25:08,"""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but...""
So just shut up and be patient as those so vested respond to conditions over the coming months. Sheeesh!"
2021-02-23 13:07:12,"I was glad to see from your quote that Fauci uses the word “normality.” The word “normalcy,” which seems to have taken over from it lately, was coined, as I’m sure Ross Douthat knows, by the Harding campaign in 1920. It was a joke, a piece of satire, not meant to be a serious word. We Americans are tired of fighting aristocracy and autocracy and plutocracy and trying to make the world safe for democracy. We just want to get back to normalcy."
2021-02-23 13:44:00,"Spoken like someone who doesn't understand politics at all.

You ALWAYS under promise and over deliver.

You ALWAYS prepare people for the worst and strive for the best. 

Imagine what happens if later this summer we have enough vaccine deniers running around spreading new variants that the only way out is another round of vaccines modified to deal with the new problem.

With Fauci and Biden's approach there will be authority and credibility to deal with that problem.

If you just tell everyone that by July we are 100% back to normal and things go sideways you have NO authority or credibility and then we REALLY have a problem on our hands. 

Good grief... Is it THAT hard to understand the reluctance to just say ""It's all gonna go away in a few months"" after what we have been through already?"
2021-02-23 14:12:10,"Meanwhile try buying an N95 mask. They should be free at every street corner. Same with the vaccine. Russ, you’re living under a gentle delusion, but a no less dangerous one than Trump’s. Covid’s not a hoax and there’s no prayer, positive thinking or politician that can make it disappear."
2021-02-23 12:07:32,we saw what happened the ex administration did not listen to Fauci and true medical disease  expert a set back more cases more deaths. it is not polical it  it called being safe and smart. you really need to here what they are saying. then look and see a certain groups don't follow it. that is why it will take longer.
2021-02-23 13:00:06,I doubt seriously that Covid cares what Mr. Douthat thinks.  It's a virus.  It'll do what viruses do.  We can take measures to prevent infection or we can do what people do when they catch a virus like Covid.  Die.
2021-02-23 13:52:56,Don't tell us; tell the virus.
2021-02-23 14:12:32,"So the author and a couple other authors haver come to the decision that the epidemiologist is wrong...

I'll listen to the epidemiologist, thanks."
2021-02-23 13:06:06,"The tone of this in the face of America just passing the  500,000 dead count is astounding. Dr. Fauci is a scientist and as such is going to always consider that the data may change with further mutations.  So ironically he will never be as optimistically arrogant as a op-ed journalist ""who can read trend lines"".  Here is a trend line I read.  Viral infection vanishes this summer, everyone  cheers and goes on, and then winter  returns.  If we have not vaccinated enough, here we go again."
2021-02-23 13:22:02,"So where, exactly, did you get your graduate degrees and experience in public health?"
2021-02-23 14:44:54,"Wow, you are not vested with authority or expertise but like any good conservative are imploring the President to provide evidence to suggest the Covid pandemic will be over by July 4th.  And if it is not....well then the good conservative can pillory the President for failing.  The Former Guy failed miserably at keeping people alive and President Biden IS TELLING THE TRUTH yet the good conservative still wants the Covid crisis to ""go away by July 4th"".  The good conservative even italicizes the phrase ""with evidence"", OMG evidence now matters.  Ross, perhaps you should watch the crisis resolve through the rest of the year and not try to read the tea leaves.  President Biden is doing his honest, decent, transparent best to keep us safe.  Learn from his example."
2021-02-23 12:01:25,"Let’s keep it all locked down until Joe and Democrats are out of office.  

How many people died on Joe’s watch?!?

This was their political strategy."
2021-02-23 12:53:21,""".... might be over by Easter.""

That was last year, and here we have our second Easter coming up.
How sad that you didn't say all this last year.
Instead, you and every Republican refused to confront Donald J. Trump on his crank cures and his fighting with any authority or organization.

Thanks for nothing, Ross.
Yes, it's another Easter coming again.

Wear your masks."
2021-02-23 12:55:43,"Why do this harm? ""I have neither authority nor expertise, but I know better."" That's about as good as ""alternative facts"" and ""fake news."""
2021-02-23 14:48:42,"Did we just read the ""kinder and gentler"" version of Trump's pandemic denial?"
2021-02-23 12:29:05,"Yeah Ross, ""we are rounding the corner"", ""like a miracle, it will just go away"". The delusion of republicans trying to tap dance around the incompetence and malfeasance of their chosen one is nothing short of astounding."
2021-02-23 13:37:32,"I certainly hope the virus and all its variants and mutations have read your editorial, Ross. They need to know that you mean business. All  that seems to be missing here is their punishment if they don't go away. 

I remember being thoroughly disgusted when I heard Tucker Carlson admonishing people for listening to Dr. Fauci. ""Nobody elected him"" were his words. For future columns on this subject, I won't be surprised if you refer to Dr. Scott Atlas."
2021-02-23 14:49:00,"What about kids? On The NYT’s The Daily last week, it was stated that without vaccinating kids we cannot get to herd immunity."
2021-02-23 12:22:57,"Sure,

I will take a Republicans advice on (nothing at all).

pretty funny.

A Republican squawk box giving out viral transmission advice.

What's next Ross, gonna start an investment advisory firm?

LOL"
2021-02-23 14:48:29,"I wasn’t sure where you were going with this.  The problem with your armchair quarterbacking of Biden and Fauci’s statements (and those of just about every infectious disease expert I’ve seen) is that you are not recommending any action.  Are you saying we should start opening up restaurants? movie theaters? sporting events?  When should we do that?  Should we plan on throwing away masks in July?  No, of course you’re not saying anything specific because armchair quarterbacks like you (and Trump) feel comfortable suggesting the plays without being responsible for the final score.  For the first time since this pandemic began a year ago, I have confidence that the country is moving in the right direction under this administration.  Biden is being transparent, but you expect clairvoyance now that Democrats are merely following the science.

Suggesting optimistic outcomes is what we got last year, and we now have half a million deaths.  If we do reach a level of herd immunity sooner than the end of the year, it will be apparent in the medical statistics—and it will be because people continued to take this pandemic as the lethal threat that it is.  It’s the science and the numbers that don’t lie.  Opinions like yours are politically motivated and predictable, unfortunately, and we’ve had more enough of that."
2021-02-23 13:40:04,"What hot air. Based on nothing but speculation with one million  if this, then that, but who knows."
2021-02-23 12:43:54,Ross - with what expertise are you even vaguely entitled to question Dr. Fauci? He has authored many textbooks of Internal Medicine. And you have done what exactly?
2021-02-23 13:35:48,You think American's are actually heeding the advice of Dr. Fauci? When did that start?
2021-02-23 13:41:36,"Just a year ago Trump and his GOP cronies were in denial about Covid. Trumps response was limited to making up nicknames like Kung Flu and China Virus to entertain the GOP base.   Democrats were ridiculed for being panick mongers and snowflakes.

And then the virus took hold like a forest fire at the end of a California Summer.

Its a bit rich for Mr Douthat to accuse the new Biden administration of anything when his own party just supported an insurrection."
2021-02-23 14:03:08,"Russ says: "" I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and right now both their takes look way too pessimistic.""

By any chance, did you stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night?"
2021-02-23 14:38:50,"After 500k American deaths, overcautiousness seems a more than justifiable response to the previous administration's more cavalier 'approach'."
2021-02-23 14:46:12,"Ross Douthat would like Joe Biden to provide the evidence to support Ross Douthat's opinion that everything will be fine by the Fourth of July.

Maybe Ross Douthat misunderstands the role of an opinion writer and the difference between having a plan and making a wish."
2021-02-23 13:56:35,"What is the point here? Ross admits he has no expertise. So why is he demanding that people who do say what he wants?

It's tiresome. How about just letting the epidemiologists and medical experts and statisticians evaluate the evidence as it develops, and not ask them to predict the future you dream of?"
2021-02-23 14:04:03,"Dear Ross,

See you at CPAC. Don't bother bringing a mask: Covid is a myth. Those 500,000 would have died eventually anyhow. By the way, neither Lyme's Disease nor Epstein-Barr made the Top 10 in the NCHS Mortality stats for 2019."
2021-02-23 12:17:18,"Absolutely agree, the New York Times, the media in general and the government seem to want us to isolate and mask up for the next five years, most Americans won’t have it.

The lockdowns time is very limited, no one‘s even wearing masks here in Miami anymore, there will be Civil War in the streets before there is another lock down￼￼"
2021-02-23 12:34:59,"Ross Douthat is a good writer, not entirely surprising since he has a Harvard B.A. with a concentration in history and literature.

However, he has no medical or scientific credentials or training whatsoever that qualify him to pontificate about when and how the US (or any other country) can lift Covid-19 restrictions.

I know, this is America, and everyone is entitled to his or her or their opinion. 

Nonetheless, when it comes to topics in medicine and science I place greatest value on comments from those who know what they are talking or writing about."
2021-02-23 13:46:27,"Everything will be ok in the end, if it’s not ok, it’s not the end; John Lennon. The end will happen, the ifs, when, why, how are just fodder for newspaper columnists. The rest of us are just waiting it out knowing there will be an end in sight, no matter what anybody says."
2021-02-23 13:52:19,"Ross, you need to place a phone call to Michael Osterholm (epidemiologist, regents professor, and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota) and talk to him about the future of COVID.  Others:  see his interview on PBS Firing Line last Friday to hear some straight talk about the coming months of battling COVID."
2021-02-23 14:12:04,"Anyone who thinks the pandemic is going to be essentially over by summer time, as Mr. Douthat clearly does, is not in touch with reality."
2021-02-23 13:44:06,"Eh, I prefer to err on the side of caution. Mr. Douthat's calculations look to be be smartly thought out but they are not persuasive. Fauci has a much more credible platform from which to make predictions about disease and death than does an op-ed columnist."
2021-02-23 14:44:19,"""Alternatively, if social distancing declines rapidly in the interim or a more infectious variant spreads, then we’ll get a last spike of cases and more people will die — but more infections also means more immunity, so even in that grim scenario herd immunity could actually arrive sooner still""

I would like to say collectively we the American people apologize  to you Ross, for not dying at fast enough rate to make it safe for you to go out without a mask. How dare us."
2021-02-23 14:45:23,"""....cover and encouragement for fearful officials."" Huh? America has officials that are fearful and that is our problem? Take a look at Australia or NZ or Taiwan or Bhutan and tell me that we are in the mess we are in with half a million dead because our officials were OVERcautious. Give me a break. Here come the ""government is the problem"" people once again."
2021-02-23 14:06:23,"Ross,
I propose a whole column on the effectiveness of wearing a mask along with a pep talk for the people who refuse to wear them. You might also include a timeline of falsehoods and lies that lead to the politicizing of wearing a mask. Mask wearing is also about respect and caring for your fellow man."
2021-02-23 14:30:06,"Wow, is this a statement:

“ But after a year of misery, death and sacrifice, the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over.”

We can’t tell the future, many predictions have been wrong, caution is advised. Why is that so hard to understand? 

“The public has a right to know”...as if they are hiding something or lying.

After a year of lethal mismanagement, now suddenly people are demanding precision in fortune-telling."
2021-02-23 14:11:58,"Reading this, I was reminded of when I used to take my elderly, mother-in-law to her appointments with the endocrinologist. She  would listen to him explain why he was changing medications and dosages, then turn and ask me “well, what do you think?”  My opinion, me - the guy who never considered medical school and chose a career in the arts.
Fauci or Douthat... I just can’t decide who to believe."
2021-02-23 14:13:11,"Dear Ross, no one in the White House, or the real medical community will read this column but to discover the new Party line, or the misdirection propaganda that is given a balloon trial here. No, the unmasked “freedom” base of the GOP will not where masks now or be vaccinated. Why? Because Trump and friends wanted to “open up” the economy in the fall. Because the Trump base wants “freedom” from masks and limits on assembly and have succeeded in using the 1st Amendment to violate the 1st by establishing religion as a “trump” to public health. No mention, thought or concern here for the Americans of color who have suffered disproportionately. Why? Racism blinds the right? 
Herd immunity? Speculation about it and July 4th should be a warning to Biden and the DNC. In the past, the 4th was a time when we could rely on harvesting thousands of organs, because unhelmeted motorcyclists and unseatbelted motorists crashed and suffered catastrophic brain trauma. The helmet and seatbelt laws were instituted. For years, “freedom” deluded would go to state capitals and protest without helmets and a few would become organ donors. It wasn’t until a Federal mandate required both that organ donations decreased. We need a federal mandate to mask until this disease is defeated. Every American should be issued N95 masks in the winter. Church and other venues must be regulated. Rapid testing must be required before entering any place with large gatherings including schools."
2021-02-23 14:43:42,"I think Douthat is being very reasonable here. Unfortunately, this last year has proven that many Americans are not. People like Biden and Fauci know that if they say Covid will be mostly behind us by the Fourth of July and it's not they'll be pilloried for it and the crazies on the right will insist there's no difference between them and Trump with his Easter claim. The fact that it's nuts to think so doesn't mean many Americans won't be shouting about it. They can always come out in the summer and say ""Hey, America did great and beat this!"" That's way easier than having to convince a hostile opposition that they made an honest mistake."
2021-02-23 14:44:02,"It was most distressing to read this column because it flashes back to the Trump-think of the past four years:  ""The Covid Emergency Must End"" because I and many others say it must end, never mind what those elitist experts and that pesky virus have to say."
2021-02-23 15:02:25,"If Douthat wants to talk about the longevity of the crisis, how about laying it on the line. How about addressing how conservatives turned an unfortunate pending crisis into an historic disaster. Write about the denial of science, the ridiculous claim of infringement on ""freedom,"" the excitement about herd immunity, and on this list can go. Crises can be averted or at least managed by competent leaders and responsible citizens. But this one wasn't averted or managed because half the citizens of this country either didn't care or put their faith in incompetent leadership. As Times' resident opinionated conservative, Douthat is the one  writer I don't want to hear from on Covid."
2021-02-23 15:02:32,"I largely agree with Douthat here. David Leonhardt largely makes the same points when he argues the messaging on the virus misses the optimistic points about  the vaccine.   Roughly 20 million people have had both doses, and at least 40 million have had at least one dose.  We have not heard of any cases of people becoming sick from the virus after vaccination. If that is the case this should be broadcast loudly, and more people would want to get vaccinated."
2021-02-23 15:03:28,"Biden + Fauci may be a bit too cautious, but to use the old phrase - ""better safe than sorry""......Further, Mr. Douthat's comment that ""...Alternatively, if social distancing declines rapidly in the interim or a more infectious variant spreads, then we’ll get a last spike of cases and more people will die — but more infections also means more immunity, so even in that grim scenario herd immunity could actually arrive sooner still..."" is a very sick and awful one....He sounds like the LT Gov of Texas who was leveraging herd immunity and said - in my translation - ""if a bunch of old people die so we can have a good [opened up] economy, so be it.""....I also believe that Governors will determine when the economy and more normal activities will resume.....and most of them (save some Trumpster ones who have in general ignored all safety measures) do want to open up + return to a more normal way of living - - and will do so with a mix of precautions - something Mr Douthat and all of us would like. I think Fauci + Biden are doing the right thing being cautious + the Governors will tailor their responses to their individual states circumstances which may end up splitting the difference between the Federal spokespersons and Mr Douthat. In any case, let's hope for a safe but quick return to near normalcy (or, if lucky, really normal !)"
2021-02-23 15:03:58,"""herd immunity"" is a myth.  the vaccinated are not ""immune""- they become ill at a rate 5% of the unvaccinated.  the previously ill are not ""immune""- there are cases of repeat infections, documented by genotyping of the infectious agents.

we don't know how long even ""relative immunity"" persists in either the vaccinated or previously infected, and whether or when boosters or modified variant vaccines may be needed.

there will never be ""herd immunity.""  get used to it, and stop promulgating that myth.  

the disease will become endemic and over time it is reasonable to hope that nonetheless it will not present nearly the threat it has over the last year.

the implications for masking, distancing, and group events remain unknown, and even if they were known are likely to evolve and change over time.  get used to that, too."
2021-02-23 15:04:28,"During the AIDS crisis, hospitals and first rsponders developed what they called ""universal precautions"" to slow the spread of blood- and tactile-borne diseases. Before then, parademics handled bleeding people and those who were visibly very sick with their bare hands; hospitals gave far too little thought to post-surgical infections and deaths arising from operating-room sloppiness; and anticeptics like hand sanitizer were nowhere to be seen across the medical profession.

We are slowly but surely adding to those precautions in an era where the potential for pandemics has surged faster than our imiginations. Mr. Douthat seems to be oblivious to this reality."
2021-02-23 15:05:42,"I continue to believe that we are asking the wrong question when we wonder when life will return to ""normal"".  Our definition of normal evolves over time and we are in the midst of an event that will surely change what normal looks like.  

I believe we are better served if we look ahead to what our new normal might look like and how we can best get there."
2021-02-23 15:12:52,"Mr. Douthat engages in some specious reasoning when arguing that keeping COVID in place measures due to long-term effects would be like closing schools over Epstein-Barr or closing parks over the threat of Lyme disease.

Last I checked, neither of those diseases are airborne. In fact,  Lyme disease is not transmitted person-to-person at all, while Epstein-Barr requires fairly intimate contact with another person's bodily fluids.

While I agree with much of the thrust of the essay, the thing I most agree with is the author's admission at the outset that he does not possess a Faucian expertise in the area of infectious disease. 

He might also want confess to a lack of scrupulous attention to obvious differences between the choices of diseases he uses while attempting to draw analogies."
2021-02-23 15:12:52,"The question of the date that this will be over is the wrong question and so the issues raised are the wrong ones.  We should be talking about how we reduce the infection rate below 1 per 100,000 (or by proxy, reduce the positive testing rate to below 2%)  If our current methods aren't working, as they weren't in November, December, and January, we adopt more stringent ones until we reach that goal.  Once we have something that works, we keep at it for a few months to keep the disease at bay until we can vaccinate enough people to keep the rate down.  
Americans gripe and complain, but we are very adaptable.  We can get the job done regardless of the time it takes.  We need to look at the goal of reduced cases, not the calendar."
2021-02-23 15:15:15,I read just before reading this the Rasmussen guest piece explaining clearly why the masking and distancing needs to continue. I wonder what Douthout's reaction is to that piece. Would he adjust what he suggests based on that information?
2021-02-23 15:18:52,"What else would you expect from Douthat? He is from the Catholic beliefs and hard-line conservatism control all political perspectives school of thought. That leads to such positions as ban abortions but, severely limit access to social services and monetary assistance. All of it being penned with a I-know-better-than-you  attitude;

In this instance, the liberal arts graduate knows more than the scientists and we should ignore them and heed his advice. Positively Trumpian, Mr. Douthat.  But, in case you hadn't noticed, this last November the American people voted, in part, to go with the science people instead of the voodoo priests. It might turn out to have been a bit overcautious but, I'm willing to wager that there are at least 500,000 families that would tearfully and heartily recommend it."
2021-02-23 15:20:59,"Americans work best when we pull together, think, WWII, the moon landing, defeating polio, or the Interstate highway system. Things go awry when we fight against each other, think Civil war, race relations, the Trump saga or Covid. We have the highest Covid death toll in the world, mostly due to political infighting over masking and public health rules, led from the top. A huge chunk of our population is resisting vaccinations and any other measures to defeat this thing for perceived culture war reasons. The pandemic is not going down easily if we cannot and will not stop fighting each other for the sake of tribal identity."
2021-02-23 15:21:32,"“But after a year of misery, death and sacrifice, the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over.”

The public had a responsibility to protect each other by wearing a mask and distancing. We failed. 
We now have a responsibility to continue to be masked and distanced now that we have seen these basic measures work to keep numbers low. 

This is a tone-deaf article encouraging irresponsible behaviour come summer, on this tragic morning when the country has just crossed half a million lives lost. 

It’s frankly insulting."
2021-02-23 15:24:02,"Lo and behold, for once I agree with much of what Mr. Douthat has written! Here in Connecticut about half the population of 3.5 million have had the disease or have received at least one vaccine dose.

The official tally of those positive with the disease in the state is 275,000 but every study of true numbers say it should be at least 4 times, if not 10 times that number. I'm going conservative with 4. 

Another 900,000 have been vaccinated and even if you reduce that number to 600,000 to account for those who got vaccinated but already had the disease Connecticut now has 1.7 million people who've either had the disease or have been vaccinated.

By the summer that number should be much closer to 2.5 million which would be more than 70% of the population. Things should be much different then and, geez, could the Nutmeg State use that!"
2021-02-23 15:27:08,Mr. Douhat might benefit from reading about the difference between vaccines that lessen the danger of a disease and vaccines that provide invulnerability that was well-articulated in today's paper by Angela Rasmussen: Does the Vaccine Stop Transmission.
2021-02-23 15:27:39,"I don't disagree with the thrust of this column but I also think there's more than a small chance that Biden is underpromising, as it were. He did this with his not-so-ambitious goal of 1M vaccinations/day. We were already at 1.5M to 2M vaccinations/day before the winter storms disrupted the rollout, but the expectation was that we could still very much ramp up beyond that number.

May not the same be the case here? (or maybe not, obvs speculating). Not necessarily saying that this is the correct approach - I'd rather a government that talk to the American public like the adults we aren't. But it's undeniable that there is a political windfall in setting these not-so-ambitious milestones to bring the pandemic to a close, and then blow by them triumphantly."
2021-02-23 15:32:13,"I don't think what Biden and Fauci are saying is that there will be lockdowns until Christmas, but there might be some restrictions. Biden has indicated that he thinks he should be able to get most people vaccinated by summer. Colleges are beginning to think about opening--depending on the vaccine. 

I also think it will be a slow open (which is entirely reasonable). Many things will open but perhaps others like large gatherings, theaters etc. won't, or will only do so with testing and masks, social distancing, proof of vaccination etc."
2021-02-23 15:36:09,"Throughout this crisis certain people, call them conservatives, have ignored the fact that we don't know what we don't know. This is a new virus. We won't actually know when we've achieved herd immunity until after the fact. It's possible Dr. Fauci is being overly cautious, but the man has at least tried to follow the science for the past year. We don't actually know what things will look like in September. Personally, I trust a guy like that way more than I trust his many detractors."
2021-02-23 15:36:52,"Great column.  A clear statement of all the conflicting indicators that, taken as a whole,  encourage optimism about an earlier-than-Xmas slow slippage into something like normalcy."
2021-02-23 15:37:11,The goal post has moved. Early in the pandemic the goals of social countermeasures were to relieve pressure on intensive care units in hospitals. Now the goal is to prevent illnesses in children that are less common than lightning strikes. We are now now so risk averse that anything short of eradicating the virus will be seen as insufficient.

In your last paragraph Mr. Douthat you require evidence from the president and good fortune. Now both of your requirements may bare fruit by July 4, 2020, July 14th  or August 13th 2022."

2021-02-23 15:38:37,"Mr, Douthat may have missed the press release that Trump is no longer president. So it really doesn't matter what he said about July. It is now on Biden and Trump gave him two vaccines the began distribution mid December plus a distribution process which Biden acknowledged. If we continue to give vaccines at this rate, just about everyone in the U.S will have the opportunity to have received at least one shot. But to be fully immunized, it could take well into 2022.This is like a war and plans go out the window when you meet the enemy. Covid 19 has shown that variants are a constant new threat,  We  may have a better idea by July. But we do not control of the rest of the 7.7 billion people on the planet. Biden is also planning on let a whole lot of people from below the border come in and has not defined any test to assure us they will be corvid free. That is the requirement for the rest of the world including returning citizens. So, to make plans to open everything up by July, would be premature and reckless."

Biden and the Dems are explaining that using a mask and social distancing will save lives, that's why the messaging is so strict. it is good public health policy to do this.

The economy and health of the United States was damaged by Trump and the GOP ignoring science and health policy.

If you open up too soon, the chances that a variant that beats the vaccine increases, this is rudimentary stuff.

the GOP don't care about society or people who don't follow there politics, it Is just ""Me"" the people rather than ""We"" the people"

It’s too bad most conservatives can’t see past their Calvinist viewpoint of “deserving” to get to a point of compassion."
2021-02-23 15:42:04,"""the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over.""
Could we please consider Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Singapore for a moment? They took covid seriously at a governmental level- including draconian quarantining measures for ANY entry to the country whether you were a citizen or not- and it has worked. And the populace obeyed the rules, thereby limiting the spread. Yes, I realize they are all islands! But we have borders- as does every country- and limited contact tracing as far as I can see. I'm as tired of this as everyone else, and to me it is American Selfishness that has prolonged the pandemic: from the refusal of so many to sacrifice any of their ""freedoms"" for a ""hoax"" etc etc. Whatever happened to the grit of our citizens evidenced in World War 2? Our willingness to make sacrifices to help others has greatly diminished over the decades; hence, the unneccessary prolongment of this pandemic. Please do your part, Americans! And realize that, despite Mr. Douthat's pronouncement, it's up to us as the virus is not intelligent enough to give us a timetable as when it might go away and bother us no more."
2021-02-23 15:44:17,"I agree with Ross! There's a first time for everything.

There seems to be a strain of doom running through everyone now that will not allow any hope to permeate, even on evidence. I don't think we can stand another year of these measures. It has already taken a permanent toll on us all."
2021-02-23 15:47:55,"Let's not kid ourselves; it's already over for some.
Dozens of my friends and family have already been infected.  They do everything they were doing before, unafraid of further infection.  Three of my relatives are fully vaccinated.  They do everything they were doing before, too.  The few people I know who never took it seriously are also acting as if the thing that never happened is now over.  
Those of us who've yet to bury the loved ones we lost may never feel as if it ends.  But as soon as I'm fully vaccinated, I'm going back to giving hugs."
2021-02-23 15:49:47,"Many of us feel entirely numb to these horrific death counts. A half a million Americans dead, in just a little over one year. And yet, so many of us are just psychologically exhausted. We no longer have the emotional strength to really grasp the enormity of this loss. 

I recall the Viet Nam War quite well. And  recall the country's collective outrage at 58,000 dead. This is no longer that America.

So I've struggled to understand why these numbers were so numbing. And I realized it was because, for me, there was never a sense of ""we are all in this together"". Nearly half of us actively deny the existence of the pandemic. Nearly half of us listened to their ""dear leader"" as if he were a god, and parroted his lies about the virus. Nearly half of us exercise reckless behavior that puts the rest of us at risk. 

And so I realized there were two fronts to this pandemic ""war"" - the virus itself first, and second, many of my fellow Americans. And the realization that both fronts worked together synergistically was what broke me. 

I know I would have looked at this pandemic much differently, had more than 95% of us understood and accepted the gravity of this pandemic and acted accordingly. I would have had some sense of community with my fellow Americans. 

But instead, for me at least, it is just inexorable numbness to these horrific numbers. And to the continuing realization that nearly half of us have absolutely no problem with half a million of their fellow citizens dead."

Some things in life are battles, and you win them by fighting, not by trying to make yourself feel good about how it's going.

Maybe worry less about touchy-feely messaging and more about what everyone needs to do (wear a mask, get vaccinated when your turn comes, social distance, actually listen to the science, the facts and the experts... and don't get complacent until the war is actually won) and not how tired and discouraged they are.

We are so underwhelming as a generation (collection of generations, actually, because we've passed it on).  After decades of prosperity and entitlement, of ""looking out for number one"" and becoming exclusively transactional, we all are now weak, whiny and ridiculously ""entitled""."

2021-02-23 15:53:06,A significant number of Americans are going to refuse or simply avoid vaccination.  Possibly in the 20 per cent range.  We also do not know how long the vaccine will work.  Do not count your chickens before at least some of them hatch.
2021-02-23 15:55:09,"It is far better for Biden and Fauci to make conservative (a word that you should admire) projections about when normalcy can be achieved.  They can then more easily dial back the mitigations if normalcy is achieved earlier, as you suggest might be possible.  In contrast, if they were overly optimistic and had to reimpose mitigation when everyone was expecting normalcy, the backlash would make that impossible.

We are in the early days of an unprecedented universal vaccination effort and the vaccine hasn't even been approved for children.  Trials for kids under 12 haven't even been started.  It's clear that vaccines are less effective for the South African variety, some don't work on it at all and we have no idea what other variants will appear.  The most likely source of spontaneously vaccine-resistant variants are third-world countries (e.g. South Africa) which have little access to vaccines.  Mass vaccinations are very likely to select for variants that are specifically resistant to those vaccines.  

At this time, pessimistic projections are the wisest course since they can be eased.  Your rosy projections would make it impossible to respond if those projections were wrong.  

And we just don't know."
2021-02-23 15:56:23,"Even if this article is accurate, the result depends on everyone actually taking the vaccine.

Now the ongoing mitigation of the virus requires optimism and hope and 'one last push' to help keep safe behaviors in place.

Instead he's telling vaccinated people they can't yet resume their lives for many many more months to come.  This too is a mixed message for the non-Doctors out there....someone might think getting vaccinated is not important.

We are rapidly moving in the right direction. However, giving up 100 yards before the finish line of this marathon would be foolish.

I stopped reading after that sentence AND Mr. Douthat's arrogance that he could look at the data and see that Dr. Fauci is wrong. He wants the country to re-open and his 20/20 foresight gives him the skills to claim that the ""Emergency Must End.""

An article in the science based ""Nature"" Magazine last week pointed out that we are likely to face the Covid virus forever with continuing mutation variants requiring seasonably adjusted shots. The article admitted that the lethality of the virus in years ahead is unpredictable. That prediction is based on the fact that influenza is not gone and requires yearly vaccination.

No. Many Trump Republicans still don’t believe there is a crisis.  They don’t wear masks and won’t take the vaccines.

2021-02-23 14:57:29,"My Odin! All ""pundits"" should be forbidden from using the term ""herd immunity"" to justify business as usual.

Outside of Douthat World, here is what the term means.  You can check with the CDC and WHO for more information, if you want to fact-check, and you should want to fact-check.

Herd immunity [HI] against a particular virus occurs when enough people develop immunity naturally or through immunization. Developing vaccines to prevent transmission decreases rate of infection, which prevents the viral population from increasing.

However, that was not the strategy under the previous administration and it is not the strategy of the GOP, where even the most basic scientific facts are ignored. Instead of limiting transmission, the GOP has encouraged people to ignore basic public health measures and increase the infection rate in hopes of reaching HI. This strategy also increases the viral population which, in turn, increases the probability that a new variant of the virus will arise for which there is no immunity. Look at what the NYT authors presented and you will see that the US (world?) reaches HI in July only when the lowest limit of infection is reached. That scenario is unlikely. 

Finally, a zoonotic virus causes COVID-19. We know that other animals can harbor and spread the virus. Increasing infection rates risk spreading the virus to new species through factory farming. This may not only give rise to new variants, but entirely new viruses. 

So, maybe we need to wait."

Why would you think that the Biden adminsitration wouldn't be delighted to relax restrictions as soon as it could be done without risking another 100,000 preventable deaths?

2021-02-23 16:09:00,"Question:  During the pandemic, why have politicians and leaders failed to level with the American people? 

This would be an interesting research piece; or article. It would cover every aspect of situations where a politician said something publicly, or implemented a policy, knowing it is not true, such as Biden and Fauci are now doing; and, which many have done in the past. For example, closing outdoor dining, which is safe, in order to facilitate reduced economic/nighttime activity levels overall. This failure of politicians to trust the American people to make good choices is part of the pandemic. Some have been trusting, others not. Some have been honest and forthright, others not. Why, and what were the results?"
2021-02-23 15:36:32,"A complication:

The population is not homogeneously mixed.  The socially active have likely achieved herd immunity by natural infection.  They account for the vast majority of cases, which are dropping rapidly.

The socially distanced (roughly, those who exercise precautions) have very little immunity, and won't until most of them are vaccinated.  If they were suddenly to relax their precautions, the disease would likely resurge among them.  They should wait until they are vaccinated.  July 4 may be a target date for ending the emergency, but not March."

We wouldn't be in the terrible place we now find ourselves, and July 4th 2021 could be celebrated just as wishes, instead of how it needs to be if we're to get past this pandemic before another 500,000 are killed."

Until ""the people"" get their act together and decide to all pull in the same direction we simply will extend the calendar of infection. Don't forget the antivaccers. Get real Ross.

2021-02-23 16:17:30,"Ross,  I agree with you that the days of severe restrictions should be ending soon.  The news media wants the public to be fearful.  And it generally succeeds.  Americans across the political spectrum are afraid of their own shadow.  In reading most news articles, there is nearly always an unspoken message that   ""Things might get worse"", ""You should fear the new variants"", etc.  It is tiresome and not justified.  By the way, the current storyline of fearmongering is much the same as the storyline of about 20 years ago when the media message was ""There's a terrorist behind every tree""."

It's hard to accept that a population with a significant resistance to simple measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, in the country that is leading the world in Covid-19 deaths, is simply at the mercy of dithering political and medical leaders who are intent on under-promising and over-delivering. A more sober view is that given free rein, Americans will be back to packing ballparks, bars, gyms, concert venues, restaurants, churches and every other venue where we ""normally"" congregate in large numbers 15 minutes after the experts flash us the green light.

Anecdotally, I've had numerous conversations with people who have been vaccinated, every single one of which has been some variant of now we can go out to dinner, now we can get together for a glass of wine, now we can go back to the gym... this from people who've gotten 1 shot in a state (New Mexico) where less than 15% of the population has been vaccinated. Extrapolating this to the east or west coast population centers is not encouraging. We may have a calculus on when we'll hit herd immunity, but we don't have one on when we'll hit common sense.

I'm as desperate as anyone to open things up, but we simply don't have the platform in place to do so safely, and until we do, shot or no shot, I'm keeping my distance."
2021-02-23 16:20:44,"THANK YOU ROSS. I have been the staunchest of supporters of community restrictions, self-sacrifice for the greater good of the community, mask wearing and social distancing. But your points are becoming more and more valid. I have received the vaccine and I am FULL of both antibodies and hope for a normal life on the near future!"
2021-02-23 16:21:29,"I'll explain it for you, Ross: Both President Biden and Dr. Fauci are taking the precaution of talking about normalcy not much before the end of the year because there are still enough people who fear the vaccine more than covid itself; or they believe the entire thing is a ""hoax,"" as perpetuated by your very own political party; and, there are still enough who won't wear masks (Republicans and Libertarians, generally, with the occasional anti-vaxxer types) which means continued spread of this virus that is all too real. IF this changes, the move toward a more normal life arrives earlier. Maybe you can do some of the heavy lifting to convince the GQP doubters that the only way back is to get the vaccine and to wear masks, both before and after. It's a shame you didn't so this all along the way, instead of continuing to bash progressives. Who knew - as it turns out, Science is real and can successfully show us a path."
2021-02-23 16:22:13,"Herd immunity is not an on-off switch, and neither should be our response.  Right now we are seeing cases and hospitalizations decline sharply WITH continuing adherence to masking, distancing and limiting large gatherings.  We don't have levels of immunity yet (through either infection or vaccines or both) high enough to stop transmission if we suddenly end all precautions.  The example of Manaus, Brazil is very instructive.  They thought they were at or close to herd immunity after about two-thirds of the population was infected.  They slacked off precautions and got hit even harder.

When vaccination plus infection rates get to the 70's and climbing, we can start thinking about GRADUALLY allowing more outdoor gatherings, bringing more people back to offices and schools, some carefully managed indoor dining, etc.  Indoor concerts and sporting events, bars/nightclubs, business conferences with a lot of eating and drinking, will need to be the last things to restart.  We need to get case and hospitalization rates down to no worse than a moderate flu season,  AND have vaccines widely and easily available so that anyone who is not yet vaccinated and wants to be can get a shot quickly and easily, without scheming to get a scarce appointment or waiting in day-long lines like they are trying to score front row Stones tickets."
2021-02-23 16:23:32,"Nature, and the disease itself, the number of deaths and numbers of sick, are going to determine when we get to a New Normal. Handwringing and wishing and ignoring the obvious: This Is NOT Going Away Any Faster Than The Common Cold, and so we had better all get used to it being here, and a danger, as The New Normal, and forget trying to get back to the old model of doing things because doing things the old way KILLS, well, half a million so far.

Going ""back to normal"" is a nice fantasy, but how about you stay in and report about the Real World."
2021-02-23 16:24:09,"The President and the experts have fallen into the television weather forecast syndrome. For years, TV weatherpeople would somewhat overestimate the likelihood of temporary bad weather. The logic was that if they underestimated it, and people got caught without their umbrellas, their credibility, and thus their ratings, would suffer more than if nice weather turned up when they had predicted rain.

These days, short-term weather prediction has gotten so much better that this probably doesn't happen anymore. But predicting the course of COVID is much harder.

Trump did not take the advice of the old-time weather forecasters, and now he's living in Florida. The 2022 mid-term elections are going to be close and could derail the Biden presidency. If things look good by July, people will be happy, and politicians will THEN lighten up, the economy will boom and all will be well. Fauci and Biden will recognize the changes, and we will go forward under the new estimates.

For the time being, however, giving people hope now would mean that a lot of voluntary caution would disappear, and we would get that result the Ross sort of waves off, a final surge in fatalities.

Finally, here's a really perverse idea. Has anybody done a correlation between COVID deaths and political preference? Will this flip when the precaution opponents become relatively more at risk?"
2021-02-23 16:26:18,"You are right you are neither vested with the authority or the intelligence of Dr. Fauci’s let alone his decades expertise and dedication to saving American lives. 

So as my teachers always told me when i was talking though my hat in class. “Sit down and be quiet”. You are not being helpful."
2021-02-23 16:30:05,"I agree with the summer goal wholeheartedly... as long as it is made clear that it is a goal. Let’s incentivize all Americans to vaccinate and wear masks for 4 more months, and then HOPEFULLY we can celebrate mid-summer with actual independence. Sounds like a goal America would rally around. If the numbers get worse, we can always revise the goal."
2021-02-23 16:31:20,"I enjoy Mr. Douthat's editorials; he always has something interesting to say.  But in this case, I think he focuses way too much on government actions and way too little on individual behavior.  

I live in Austin, Texas.  What the elected officials here say about going out and resuming normalcy has zero impact on my behavior.  I am scared.  I don't want to get the corona and suffer and die.  I don't go into buildings, period.  I pick up groceries and prescriptions outside in my car.  I haven't been in a restaurant in a year; I pick up takeout food.  I haven't been with a group of friends in a year; I zoom.

Wait, you will say.  Haven't you got both your vaccine shots?  Yes, I have.  But I will continue to mask and social distance, because I can still be a carrier.  How would you feel if you proclaimed your freedom after the two vaccines, neglected masking and social distance, carried the corona, gave it to someone else without having had the vaccine, and they get sick and die?   The same way I would feel; horrible.

So, I don't care what government officials say.  I am playing it safe until some point when the number of new cases and deaths has dropped way down. My body could be a dangerous weapon.  I believe in community and being my brother's and sister's keeper.  I will continue to be safe for safety's sake."
2021-02-23 16:33:05,"Douthat's argument ignores evolution. 

Individual virus particles in our cells mutate randomly all the time. But if the changes don't prove advantageous to the spread of the virus then the mass of the virus circulating remains unchanged. But if, like in the UK last fall when a harsh lockdown reduced the spread of 'normal' virus, those virus chains that randomly happened to have a mutation that made catching it easier had a significant spreading advantage. Those chains, collectively called B.1.1.7, became dominant.

Clearly, once a significant proportion of potential hosts have been vaccinated against the current 'normal' virus, it seems inevitable that some viral chains will prove be resistant to these vaccines and they will become dominant. Then a revised vaccine will be necessary.

Success in defeating this pandemic will pit the agility of the vaccine community versus the agility of the virus. Dating the outcome of this contest seems to me impossible."
2021-02-23 16:36:54,"Wasn’t it just yesterday that we marked the sad and shameful passage of 500,000 dead in what we hope is a once in a lifetime pandemic? Had you and those with influence used your platform for the last twelve months to champion science and highlight the Republican malpractice that led us here, perhaps we might be in a much different place.  For now, we can celebrate the fact we have vaccines and a President who is committed to the truth and opening up safely.  The trauma of the past year will not be undone by a rush to indoor dining and sports events.  I will do what’s necessary -wait for the vaccine, wear my mask everywhere, and look forward to when I can hug my family and friends again."
2021-02-23 16:38:22,"The best way for you to help achieve or approach normality as quickly as possible would have been to not base a column on hand waving and wishful thinking. Just because you can read, doesn't mean you understand! Viruses maybe small but their behavior can be very complex. So let us not pretend our present situation is easy to predict."
2021-02-23 15:47:15,"Douhat’s last paragraph tries to make wishing for a miracle to sound reasonable.  He wants Biden to suggest “with Evidence” and “reasonably good fortune” that  we will be back to normal by July 4th.  Russ Douhat, you are doing exactly what Trump did, wishing a miracle.  Only, you picked the biggest day for Patriotism instead of the biggest day for Faithism."
2021-02-23 16:40:53,"I’m so tired of the message that public health restrictions are all about government control over free people’s lives.

And I’m really tired of the cheerleaders hollering “Yay! Herd Immunity” at every leveling or drop of infections, rather than allowing reality to determine policy.

The spike of cases in January, and deaths in early February, followed by declines, were both predicted.  We are *exactly* where we were told we would be back in November.

That was before “Operation Warp Speed” became operation failure-to-launch, and the old guy’s vaccine rollout turned out to be an uncoordinated hot mess.

The people who were right then predicted another surge in cases in March as new variants spread faster than immunization rates assuming a competent rollout.

America spent a long year watching the cheerleaders undermine the realists.  Why not let reality drive our policy for more than a month before undermining us yet again?"
2021-02-23 16:18:59,"When someone says ""I'm not the expert in this subject, but it seems to me ...""  you can safely stop reading right after that ""but.""

No, you are not the expert.  You are also not an expert in reading trend lines because if you were you'd know that they are meaningless, as any study of the past of this pandemic would show that ""trend lines"" go up and down and all around.

Stick to making up stuff about politics.  It's what you're good at. Leave science to the folks who are good at that."
2021-02-23 16:03:22,"“But after a year of misery, death and sacrifice, the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over.”

Hmm, did Londoners have advance notice of when WW2 bombings would stop?  Did people in say NYC in March 2020 have advanced notice that people would die in great numbers and that their city would be filled with sirens and hospitals filled with desperately ill people.

What would you do with this knowledge ?  Would you plan some socially distanced small event in a park for July?  Or would you head out to a bar today ?

Fauci is a public health specialist and as such his job is to announce health measures that improve public health based on today's knowledge.  Right now that means wearing masks and staying away from others.  It means reopening schools might involve vaccinating teachers and slowly reopening .... not allowing 40 students per class to show up next week based on a Times Opinion columnist.

Also it is really hard to trust this ""other side"" when we had to listen to fiction for a year rather than hearing the truth, that we were in a bad place, with hundreds of thousands of deaths likely .. but if we wore masks and behaved responsibly ...."
2021-02-23 16:42:52,"Some of your facts are incorrect and, I think much of your reasoning is faulty. In essence Covid public policy must be guided by facts but there are many moving parts to this novel virus. As a healthcare provider for 39 years, working with public health officers it seems to me to be better to err on the side of caution. We must respect what we don't know and what could harm us.
We don't know how mutants will affect the situation. Nor do we know how convincing we will be with vaccine skeptics. We don't have a good handle on does the vaccine prevent asymptomatic infection and therefore contagiousness to susceptible people. I think given the bredth and complexities of a worldwide pandemic it is reasonable to try and factor in unknowns that glom up our efforts. Ignorance, laziness, selfishness, misinformation, lack of resources and preparation and the whirlwind of entropy are all recognizable factors that can derail ideal hopes. In light of the seriousness of millions dying  worldwide and the world economy stagnated we would probably do better to try and over prepare and then be pleased if things can be lifted early rather than discover, yet again, that things are worse than anticipated,"
2021-02-23 16:43:18,"Its on us to do this. We the people are the disease carriers. We have adequate information on masks, distance, indoors gatherings etc. We now have access to a vaccine that will help very much. No matter what the ""leaders"" say its up to each one of us to be soldiers in this war .

We will win if each of us does our duty to ourselves and others."
2021-02-23 16:01:43,"We need the Goldilocks prediction. Trump, the delusionalist former guy, predicted the virus would just disappear when the weather got warmer in 2020.  We all know how that turned out. Biden/Fauci now predict that the pandemic won't be fully controlled by 2022 and they are probably right about that. Bur how should we Americans behave when all of us who want to have been vaccinated, probably by the summer of 2021? Will that be enough to provide sufficient herd immunity to allow us to all go back to leading normal lives before 2022?"
2021-02-23 16:15:31,"As soon as they announce “this is all getting better and its almost over, getting ready to open everything really soon!” the anti-maskers will gather in large numbers in tight indoor spaces to celebrate and reverse all the progress."
2021-02-23 16:09:47,"So after a year of denial, mendacity and outright undermining of public health for political gain, we have an administration that is actually committed to doing something about the pandemic...you know, actually engaged in solutions...and all you can come up with is this?
You really seem to be looking for something to criticize here.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party is fully in thrall to the man who is 'morally and practically responsible' (citing the Republican Senate Leader here) for inciting a white supremacist mob to overturn the results of a free and fair election, and censuring those who dared to vote their conscience by holding him to account. Let's not forget that most of the Republicans in congress have still not openly accepted the election results, presumably because they're too afraid of the Don.
I know what my bigger fear is here. 
I have not doubt that when and if we can fully open the economy it will be done...because the people in charge now have demonstrated that they can actually care about public health and the health of the economy at the same time, and that they can put public health above their politics."
2021-02-23 16:44:39,"This sounds like a column from September when people were declaring ""herd immunity"".  That was over 200,000 deaths ago and didn't play so well November through January.  

The whole issue with this virus is that by the time we get negative signs, it's too late.  Positive signs don't mean it's over, they mean the current methods are working."
2021-02-23 16:48:10,"COVID emergency will continue as long as the virus continue to kill us. We lost more than 500,000 Americans and big number are being killed every hour. 500,000 is not a number or statistics. Lot of families are left behind to mourn. Lot of families lost their wage earners. Lot of kids became orphans and lot of women became widows. Millions of people have been suffering from complications. The healthcare workers are sacrificing and taking risks of being infected. Let all of us be careful and do our part like wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands. Hopefully we will see the lights in near future."
2021-02-23 16:01:46,"What in the world is this column about?  I'll make a suggestion:  Mr. Douthat wants to say something meaningful about the Pandemic, and he hasn't any expertise, nor access to anything but his own opinion about it.  So what is it he comes up with? 
President Biden must by summer end the emergency, or at least say that he will.   ""The American Public deserves to know when this will end.""   My goodness:  the illogic of this, the utter unreasonableness of it is simply staggering.   Bring out a crystal ball, tell us what it says, Dr. Facci, and President Biden, we have to know, but be sure what you see there is a positive outlook.  We deserve it."
2021-02-23 16:49:02,"While I generally agree with the content and sentiment, I also agree with other comments that state that underpromising and overdelivering in this case is welcome. I think we all can read the trendlines, but I am not sure people can deal with another disappointment. It will be better to be coming to people with great news in summer, than trying to hold people back in summer because we are not as far along as hoped. In dealing with public health crises at scale, caution is preferred."
2021-02-23 16:03:01,"Good leadership under-promises and over-delivers. 


Biden and Fauci are getting it right."
2021-02-23 16:50:46,"Consider the fact that so many people are not getting vaccinated has little to do with fear of the vaccine. At least in this community, the people who are not getting vaccinated are largely old, very poor, and people of color, and the reason is they have no access to transportation or the internet.  This is the problem that needs to be addressed.￼."
2021-02-23 16:53:02,"So Douthat would rather err on the side of Trump's optimistic spin, aka lies, than on the measured and scientific evaluations of experts like Doctor Fauci? Governmental agencies are (mostly) following the CDC calculated recommendations for necessary standards to be met prior to reopening. And those guidelines are created with the knowledge of what is not known. This would include the new, more contagious (and more deadly?) variants recently identified. 

So I would rather hear the realistic advise of Doctor Fauci than from Douthat's ""two colleagues"" with all the ""ifs"" proposed. If we reach herd immunity, and if we speed up vaccination, and if a last spike in infections will hasten herd immunity are two many ""ifs"" to me."
2021-02-23 16:54:58,"Neither ""librul"" or ""Con"": we do what needs to be done and call it over when it is over. Herd immunity is fine for some of the survivors, but it doesn't reflect a policy that can help people. And helping people is the only rationalization for having an entire class who can impose it on others."
2021-02-23 16:56:07,"If America had taken more aggressive steps early it is very likely that we would be much closer to a Christmas 2021 ""resolution"" to this crisis.  As we all know, that did not happen and it was not taken as seriously as it should have been from our national leaders in early 2020.  

Asking us to take the guardrails off now as compared to listening to the experts is the same type of thinking that got us to a Christmas 2021 date in the first place."
2021-02-23 16:56:47,"I am going to be the annoying person who points out that ""They just require its dangers to diminish to the point where the reasons for suspending ordinary life no longer obtain, and the emergency measures taken against Covid-19 no longer justify their cost"" probably was supposed to say ""apply"" instead of ""obtain."" Annoyance over."
2021-02-23 16:59:42,"Mr Douthat seems to have confused fear with prudence.  It is prudent for me to wear a mask, observe social distancing, avoid crowds.   Neither he nor I nor Fauci nor Biden knows enough about this virus to predict  reliably its future path.  We can hope for a speedy resolution, but cannot rely on our hopes. Meanwhile to  talk about fear as driving response does a disservice to the public by framing the response in an overly emotional vocabulary. 
 We have seen too much inflammatory rhetoric recently  and the results are deplorable.  Please refrain from such language when talking about this epidemic"
2021-02-23 16:45:33,"Let the data speak for itself. We are still at risk until after we see COVID cases stay low and vaccination rate that are above a the herd immunity threshold. 

I trust Dr Fauci to do just this. We’ll be told if the numbers improve and when they don’t."
2021-02-23 17:04:14,"Dear Mr. Douthat, Your columns are thoughtful must-reading. However, in this case, you are failing the famous ""Marshmallow Test"". It has been a struggle to get the independent-minded citizens of America to follow the guidelines set out by the CDC, including vaccinations. President Biden is right to highlight the need to be hypervigilant until his advisors tell him it is time to relax the policies. For once relaxed, we will be loath to return to them. Peter H. Dohan, MD"
2021-02-23 17:07:44,"I for one am not wondering why the Trump administration failed to adopt the easiest of Covid mitigation procedures, like every major industrialized nation was able to do;  Their unstated goal was an attempt to achieve ""herd immunity,"" while knowing that it could lead to as many as a million extra deaths. All the while disregarding the fact that the more infections there are, the higher the probability of more dangerous variants of the virus developing.  Which now is occurring. 
It is prudent not put out more Trump style ""happy talk"" for the sake of the economy while we are about to possibly encounter the next wave of infection. Science will tell us more in April."
2021-02-23 15:10:56,"This whole mess is going to be over when the people say it's over.  It's wrong to think that any administration, Democratic or Republican, holds the key to lock that's going to unleash a sanitized solution for all of mankind.  We've lived through flues and plagues for as long as we've been walking around on this earth and to think for a moment that we're going to stay ahead of these deadly diseases is truly pie in the sky thinking.  Free people reject totalitarian rule and that's exactly what American's are being directed by our government to accept.  Big brother knows what's best, just do what we tell you and all will be just fine.  Perhaps for the elite rule makers but not for the masses.  The ""keep em scared and keep em dumb"" era of governing is rapidly running out of road.  Once the temperatures rise and the great outdoors beckons do our leaders really think they can keep us penned up for another summer?  Or come fall that we're going to allow any institution to tell us that our kids are going to set home for a second full year?  The government can print and hand out enough money to keep its people and businesses under their thumb for much longer."
2021-02-23 17:08:58,"I don't think we've even come close to experiencing the unintended consequences of our most over-the-top reactions to this virus.  Whether masking and distancing help much, they certainly can't hurt.  But lockdowns do.  Closing schools do.  Disrupting supply chains do.   

Fear, for good reason, is the human animal's most potent instinct.  But in this day and age, our reactions to our fears can be overwhelming.  Like closing down the world economy.  And, sadly, when the threat is new, overwhelming reactions become all too easily implemented.

There are lots of potential unintended consequences to our reaction to this virus, like what it's done not just to our kids educations but to their mental and physical health and saftey or like what it's done to the less advantaged people in this world or like what it's done to those with non-Covid conditions or like what it's done or like what it's done to the mental and physical and social health of ALL of us or like....

But my biggest concern, frankly, is what its' done --- or, more pointedly, going to do --- to the economy.  Maybe the Fed's non-stop printing presses will make it all OK.  But, if not, we may be in for one heck of a ride."
2021-02-23 17:10:02,"I travel and have travelled throughout this pandemic. 

I have noted with great interest the many, many free states and cities where COVID-19 is already long since been relegated to what once was. 

People living life almost completely as they once did before. 

I will continue these travels because life is no dress rehearsal."
2021-02-23 12:02:37,The virus does not appreciate our needs for normalcy.    It is best to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
2021-02-23 14:17:30,"Tell me are you in the habit of closing your eyes and relaxing because you are almost home from a long difficult drive, or do you wait until you park your car?
Do you often lie down of the floor of your home because it's almost bed time, or do you wait and actually get in bed?
The most dangerous time is just before you finish a task or resolve a problem. You have invested almost everything to complete the work but it's not yet done. If you falter just before the finish line you can destroy all the work you completed without getting the benefit.
This is where we are as a nation, this is no time to coast, no time to relax and worry about something else, now is the time to make one final effort and push it over the goal line."
2021-02-23 17:14:25,"It is clear that Mr. Douthat has never been responsible for the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. If he ever had been he would realize that promising people something that one is not in control of is highly irresponsible. Even with the benefit of models the future of the evolution of this virus is unknown. What about new variants that are vaccine resistant? There are several already and we don't understand their behavior as well. What about people dropping precautions because the president said tings are better? Mr. Douthat confidently dismisses these uncertainties because he can rest assure that, if he turns out to be wrong, he will not be to blame."
2021-02-23 17:14:31,"Having just passed the half-million mark in US fatalities due to this virus, the tone of this article is very misdirected. You can read all the vaccine studies and trend lines you like, the bottom line is that the pandemic will be over when it is observed to be over.

There are clearly reasons to be hopeful, but until community retransmission decidedly drops off. the emergency remains. With all the progress we have made, the mortality rate today is still greater than at any point prior to the winter surge we are just coming off of.

When the retransmission rate of the current strains of the virus are observed to drop below 1, we will see that in a marked falloff of cases, and not before, all speculation about herd immunity targets notwithstanding.

There are certainly reasons to be hopeful, but declaring Anthony Fauci to be excessively cautious amounts to a declaration of willful ignorance."
2021-02-23 17:17:39,"Thank you, Doctor Douthat, Epidemiologist Extraordinaire. One would think that, 500,000 deaths on, you'd have learned your lesson, along with all of your Republican and ""conservative"" friends who have never once in this long, deadly year accepted that there were ANY ""reasons for suspending ordinary life,"" no matter what the cost in sickness and death. Now, we do finally have solid reasons for hope -- as much because we now have a fully engaged federal government for the first time as because we have effective vaccines. But only 5% of our population has been fully vaccinated so far. We have a mutating virus. No one really knows how much immunity vaccinated people will have after the three months that was trialed. Having enough vaccine manufactured by July is not the same thing as getting everyone vaccinated. And we don't yet know how many will refuse it -- a number bound to increase as more people like Douthat declare the crisis is over. There really is no material difference between what you are doing now and what Trump was doing a year ago with his ""open by Easter"" nonsense. Like Trump, you, Ross Douthat, are just talking through your hat."
2021-02-23 17:22:35,"Yogi Berra observed ""It ain't over till it's over."" I don't think he was talking about the pandemic, but it applies nonetheless. Predicting when the pandemic will be over is a pointless exercise in guesswork whether it's based on experience (Fauci) or on wishful thinking (Douthat). There are just too many variables from vaccine production to emergence of mutations to really pin it down.

I suspect that when it's over, we'll know it."
2021-02-23 15:01:04,"Russ, your piece should've began and ended with 'I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise...' .

The key point here, which many may miss or chose to ignore, is the part I have emphasized *with evidence*. The rule of thumb for getting through any crisis is to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. In a nation that prides itself on being made up of “rugged individuals” and “free” this may be harder than it needs to be. Given the cult that formed around the person now known as “the previous guy” there are 74 million reasons to be nervous. As the great Yogi Berra would have said, “It ain’t over ‘till it’s over”."

Next up, Easter 2021, where we will be tested once again on our success at vaccinations and  ability to stay out of crowded places.  If we fail, there will be another spike and the 4th of July will slip away once more.
It's up to us, not Fauci nor Biden, to control the virus spread.  We could use more vaccine doses, btw."
2021-02-23 17:30:25,"There won't be any ""normalcy"" for a long time. Especially now that there are tons of variants of the disease in the country. It might be downgraded from ""pandemic"" status to just ""epidemic"" but that's about it."
2021-02-23 17:32:19,"Douhat got one thing right:  ""I lack expertise.""  There is still the potential for a fourth surge.  If Douhat wants to open up faster, he should be seeing how he can encourage vaccination, encouraging people to continue being responsible to avoid rapid rise of new variants, and encourage testing and tracking of new variants in every state as a priority.  

Continuing to push a false narrative about business vs. experts or painting overly rosy scenarios in no way helps us to avoid another surge and return to normal."
2021-02-23 17:36:20,"The recent downturn in cases is significantly better than anything I expected. 
The numbers do suggest an optimistic outlook. 
On the other hand, more contagious variants have been identified and we know a single individual can be a super-spreader. 
Let's approach this with extremely cautious optimism, not an ideologically-driven rush to be back to normal."
2021-02-23 17:36:26,"In the US, the virus will likely be contained by the end of August, but the old normal was never good enough to begin with. Of course people will struggle to adapt to the reopening, but vaccine skeptics and mask shirkers will inevitably cause sporadic, isolated breakouts of COVID. This is where rapid contact tracing will be extremely helpful. While effective contact tracing is a fantasy under current conditions, it will be instrumental in preventing future breakouts from taking hold (especially in the case of the emergence of new variants). After vaccine-based herd immunity is largely established, there needs to be a red telephone available to any doctor, nurse, or healthcare provider so that the Federal government can get to contact tracing ASAP as soon as a new case emerges."
2021-02-23 11:30:04,"The anti-vax machine needs to embrace the idea more than Biden and Fauci, but they don’t seem to be interested and remain ignorant."
2021-02-23 14:55:08,And your medical degree is from where? As usual you take the least amount of knowledge even ignoring a news article in your own paper and fail too admit the utter lack of scientific evidence we have regarding how long the immunizations last. Whether you are capable of transmission after being vaccinated. As well as the number of mutations and how the current vaccines efficacy are against them. You want a specific outcome based not on scientific data but the tooth fairy. The day you dictate Covid 19 responses the quicker America will reach a million dead.
2021-02-23 15:48:54,Demanding and promising that Mother Nature do your bidding is a fool's game.

Anything else?"
2021-02-23 16:28:11,"Why don't you write about how the U.S. became the worst case scenario?  Why don't you call up The White House and ask what was in the folder left on Biden's desk in the Oval Office marked ""what we're been doing about Covid""?

The U.S. has the worst record of responsible responses to Covid.
Why are we in that emergency you want out of?"
2021-02-23 12:07:28,"After the non-stop denialism and lying of DJT, I welcome the frank assessments from Biden and Fauci.  Call it a case of ""underpromise and overdeliver"" but I'll take it after months and months of deceit from ""the former guy"" and his sycophants."
2021-02-23 17:39:31,"Douthat is exactly right, although most readers don't seem ready to hear it. It may be comforting to believe you are following the science (and therefore all the more anti-Trump), but his point is that all these restrictions are political. 

Remember the protests? Gathering outside is safer than gather inside, but it's certainly not safe. Yet we collectively decided it was worth the risk. Private schools are open, public schools are closed. Restaurants were open and closed with little regard to the statistics. The label of ""essential"" itself is a political decision. 

Even with the vaccines, the original CDC recommendation accepted the idea that an ""equitable"" distribution would result in increased deaths among certain groups.

The costs and benefits of restrictions are not a question solely for medical experts."
2021-02-23 11:22:54,"Hey Ross,

Did you forget what your mother told you years ago?  You can’t always get what you want.  Moreover, if Biden and Fauci say what you want them to say, what will be your response if they’re wrong?"
2021-02-23 13:49:20,"Our struggling, freezing country didn’t get here because of Biden, Ross, so don’t scold him for his abundance of caution. And by the way, you’re too smart to equate chronic long term Epstein-Barr and Lyme disease with covid. You know neither is contagious. That’s just wrong for you to use them as comparison."
2021-02-23 17:41:02,"""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and at this moment both their takes look way too pessimistic.""

You are not vested with either Biden or Fauci's intelligence, wisdom, experience nor with the burden of responsibility each carries.  You do however have more than enough hubris and arrogance to top the two of them combined and several more to boot."
2021-02-23 17:44:05,"When you rely on assumptions to make a decision, you have to be reasonably confident you can prevent inordinate number of deaths.  Douthat does not know the assumptions the Administration is working from.  There is a huge difference between observing trend lines alone and observing trend lines as a means of adjusting their assumptions. 

Red states have been a huge contributor to the spread of this disease because not only were they setting the wrong examples but they were actively making it harder for blue states to take the right measures.  We don't want to go down this path again."
2021-02-23 17:44:33,"Every day the pundits ask the experts or politicians: ""When are we going to get back to normal?"" What a trap. The other day I was watching Dana Bash on CNN press Dr Fauci for a juicy soundbyte about ""normal"". With reluctance he gave one to her and I saw it all over the media within hours. The man has the patience of a saint. The best thing about Mr. Doubthats article was the title, since it made a statement instead of putting it in question form - I hope that becomes a trend. However I should have stopped reading after: ""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but..""   His last sentence contained the word ""might"" not ""will"" - ok, I can buy that much.  The arguments in the middle are a lot of sound and fury. Grant me the steady patience of Fauci."
2021-02-23 17:44:53,"Finally a reasoned and seemingly politics-free take on how we come out of the COVID-19 darkness. As we approach what appears to be the end of the deadly phase of the pandemic, I think it's important to take the steps that the UK did this week and for various levels of government to establish a clear plan that shows the way to reopening. Overly cautious messaging is as damaging in my mind as the laissez-fair ""let it rip through us"" mentality.  As in everything, there must be a balance. I think we all see everyday reminders of the wide divide in people's thinking here. Witness the denier trying to enter into a retail store mask-free or on the other end, someone alone in their car wearing a mask. Sadly this has all become far too politicized. I think we need to move beyond this factionalism to find the kind of rational middle ground proposed in this piece."
2021-02-23 17:46:45,"In order to get back to near-normalcy as soon as possible our country needs to start creating incentives for individuals to get vaccinated as soon as possible.  By mid to late summer the following rules should be in place.  Want to fly on a commercial aircraft? Go to a sporting event? Go into a store? Dine in a restaurant? Go to school or college? Go into a government building? Cross state lines? GET VACCINATED!   It would take a combination of state and federal laws or regulations to accomplish this, but they should be implemented.   Our country failed miserably on the front-end of this pandemic but we can still get the back-end right, and get it right ASAP!"
2021-02-23 17:49:07,We opened the economy in the spring and got the summer relapse which was worse than the first episode of Covid. We reopened again in the fall and got the recent spike which was worse than the other two. We are not back down to where we were last summer yet as far as Covid incidence. The vaccines are coming to be sure but they are not here yet in adequate numbers. We need to  wait until we have won the war against Covid before we declare victory or we are likely to have an even worse relapse.
2021-02-23 17:49:18,"Hope doesn't make the difference. Data does. when societal behavior crushes the curve, we can loosen the restrictions. We all want to return to normal yesterday.  But projections like ""summer' and ""Christmas "" mean nothing."
2021-02-23 17:41:50,"The one group you did not mention was health care workers.  The toll this has taken on them -- emotionally and physically -- is immense.  My niece is only 24 and started as an ICU nurse, just before COVID hit our country.  When inmates were shipped from a nearby county, she was one of the ones who cared for them and watched some of them die.  While I actually agree with much of what you wrote, we need to be able to monitor and act quickly.  This may involved localized, hopefully short lived, emergency measures.  An over-burdened healthcare system places our heath-givers at peril, but also everyone else who needs treatment for other reasons if there is no room or no one to give treatment.  As for mask wearing -- for gosh sakes.  I have spent a fair amount of time in Asia for work before COVID, and it is often just a part of life -- not an infringement on freedom."
2021-02-23 17:50:23,"""Conservatives,"" by definition, want things to remain ""normal,"" or to return to a state of things being ""normal"" when things have -- somehow -- managed to change. Determined ""conservatives"" who desperately want things to get back to their particular version of ""normal"" are known to conflate ""want to"" with ""must do"" -- hence, ""The COVID Emergency Must End!""

Always in unwitting deference to their wants, self-promoting ""conservatives"" are prone to ""We told you so!"" -- even when they have not in fact told us so. 

Example:
""At that point, with herd immunity close and vaccines generally available, the arguments marshaled by Covid skeptics and lockdown critics, which have been mostly wrong or misguided up till now, will begin to make more sense.""

The arguments of ""Covid skeptics and lockdown critics"" were ""wrong or misguided"" because they flew in the face of science, common sense, and even human decency -- as they still do. It is basic logic that a counterfactual argument made in one set of circumstances does not somehow start to ""make more sense"" just by referring to a different set of circumstances, as Mr Douthat seems to believe. 

But ""conservatives"" are relentless, still trying to promote free market efficiency, trickle-down economics, and fiscal austerities as some kinds of virtues, even though they demonstrably do not work. Just saying something over and over doesn't make it ""normal"" -- unless you just like the sound and don't mind ignoring the content."
2021-02-23 17:56:28,"“What has been up till now a collective-action problem, justifying restrictions and closures and mask mandates, will become more of a matter of individual responsibility, where people who don’t get a vaccine are primarily putting themselves rather than society at risk.”

I would argue that it will continue to be a collective action problem for a significant amount of time. For one, I heard from a credible news podcast (apologies, don’t remember which one, might have been Fauci himself) that experts are now thinking herd immunity will take somewhere around 70 percent of the population being immune, and approximately a quarter of the US population is children and not yet eligible for a vaccine. Add to that the significant portion of adults who so far will refuse to take the vaccine and we come to some trouble reaching the right number quickly.

All of this spells danger for those who cannot take the vaccine even though they want to. They rely on our collective action; it is not merely a matter of individual responsibility. I hope we don’t forget those people in our society so soon. I am happy to at least wear an uncomfortable mask to protect them."
2021-02-23 17:56:33,"In science and medicine, everything is known only through comparison of comparable, large groups of people (one group being exposed to the intervention/drug while the other not). Тhe evidence is clear now: Lockdowns failed to reduce death tolls anywhere in the world. Period. 

Florida (no lockdown) experienced about the same number of deaths per capita as CA (with strict lockdown) even though FL's population is much older. Similarly, there is no difference when one compares Mexico (no lockdown) with AZ and TX, Brazil (no lockdown) with Argentina and Peru, Japan with Korea, Holland and Sweden (no lockdown) with the UK and Belgium. Even though the UK and Belgium have been totally locked down, these countries lead the world in terms of mortality from COVID-19.

If the authorities were really interested in ""flattening the curve"" and in saving lives, instead of quarantining entire countries and states, they should have invested a year ago in medical infrastructure (extra hospital beds, hiring more staff, involvement of the National Guard, etc.).  

Instead of providing extra support to the health care system, they decided to destroy the entire socio-economic life, which made people more susceptible to cancer and infection due to the ensuing economic malaise, depression, mental illness, educational disaster, etc. Instead of investing a few billion dollars in health care, they are now spending TRILLIONS to fix the ruined society. Isn't this absurd?"
2021-02-23 17:58:44,"Maybe the greatest hope comes from that people will selfishly do what they think is best for themselves. Those that aren't vaccinated will continue to be careful, and those that are vaccinated will do as they wish.  This will bring on the normalcy, and the continued concern, in near perfect quantities. Or close enough."
2021-02-23 17:58:40,"It's still astonishing how our political stance determines our view of the pandemic and its dangers.  

Douthat sounds like he might have been halfway comfortable at one of the Trump 2020 super-spreader events, where going without a mask was a political statement.  

Up until the current era, conservatives were extra-careful and prudent, especially about risks to health.  Not anymore. Maybe Douthat can recycle Trump's ""let's pack the churches on Easter and show Covid who is boss"" message from last year.  

He seems to almost echo Trump, when he told Americans not to let the virus dominate us--words he mouthed after nearly having to go on a ventilator and getting specialized care unavailable to  average Americans."
2021-02-23 18:00:08,"“I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and at this moment both their takes look way too pessimistic.”

Because in Douthat’s mind strict measures to eliminate the danger Covid poses “do not justify their cost.”  The cost that he and other conservatives ignore, consistently and callously, are half a million deaths, in the US alone.

I’ll take the well-informed exercise of authority and expertise over a pundit’s agenda-driven reading of trend lines and vaccine studies."
2021-02-23 18:00:11,"Create low expectations and do better and the people will applaud.

2021-02-23 18:00:21,"Up here in the Northeast, it looked pretty darned good for a while this past summer.  The surge this Fall was markedly worse than the previous Spring.  I embrace the possibility, but reality tells me that too much depends on getting vaccines into everyone as quickly as possible, continued vigilance on mask wearing, and collectively not letting our guard down.

Our leaders leaders do embrace the possibility of normalcy, and are trying to get us there.  But it all depends on everyone and every thing coming into place and doing their best until this pestilence is pushed back.  Otherwise, surge, retreat, repeat."
2021-02-23 18:04:01,"We cannot let our guard down. Trump's administration dismantled the previous pandemic readiness panel and abruptly terminated the EcoHealth alliance's NIH funding to trace the wildlife source of the present coronavirus pandemic, without explanation. (Some of the funding was afterward reinstituted.) 

Nearly all pandemics come from human interactions with wildlife or unregulated poultry or land animal agriculture. The Chinese government is hindering international investigation into the origin of the virus from Wuhan, most likely from the unregulated ""wet"" markets. 

Without such science investigation and regulation of meat markets, pandemics will certainly come back. And again. This may be the new ""normalcy.""

We need Presidential administrations to invest in scientific investigation, not to run away from it or falsify it. 

The next Republican administration will most likely not be up to the challenge, to put it mildly, based on past performance. So here we will go again."
2021-02-23 16:28:08,"Mask-wearing became a patriotic act. So should vaccine-getting. Reminders that your vaccine protects yourself is good, but insufficient. If you want your family back, your community back, your country back, you should feel obligated to get the shot—as soon as possible. I welcome PSAs with this message."
2021-02-23 17:12:42,"Once containment failed in January of 2020, it was always clear that this thing would be over only once there is immunity --  from having had the disease or from vaccines. Ironically, due to the approach the US took, this moment will come sooner than in other nations, because 20-30% of the population will have had the virus and recovered, in addition to the 40-50% who will be vaccinated.
Now we have new variants, but the vaccines appear to still deliver protection against serious illness and complications, even if they are less good at preventing infection from the new variants.
Infections with new variants won't matter if they won't kill us, or make us seriously ill, just like covid19 would not have mattered to our society if it was ""like the flu"", killing only few people.

Once we are all vaccinated (or rather, everyone who wants to), new variants will still appear, and should be monitored and studied, but don't justify extending restrictions unless they are found to not only lead to spikes of infections but to spikes of deaths among the vaccinated! 
And among the unvaccinated? I don't feel like enduring any more pandemic restrictions just because some anti-vaxxers couldn't be convinced. At that point, if they want to play the personal responsibility/liberty card that's ok, it will be on them if they get sick. The rest of us will be vaccinated by then."
2021-02-23 17:24:12,"Although I agree with much of what the author says (for perhaps the first and last time), there is a little voice in my head which keeps repeating the same mantra: ""Consider the source. Consider the source. Consider the source"". Ross Douthat, a right-wing pundit, has a vested interest in seeing this Democratic president make the mistake of promising/predicting a state of affairs in five months which may or may not become reality. ""...the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over ."" Well,""should reasonably be over"" is a judgement call. So if the president ""presumably hopes to underpromise and overdeliver"" as the author postulates, he is following a sensible and politically wise path which is exactly what the right wing, which is rooting for him to fail, fears most.
     Stay the course, Joe. Don't fall into the sly, cynical trap which Ross Douthat and his ilk are setting for you. As the vaccination numbers go up, and, hopefully, the hospitalization and death rates continue coming down, we citizens will have no trouble summoning hope, or seeing- for ourselves, without prompting from the oval office- the ""light at the end of winter's tunnel""."
2021-02-23 18:07:40,Regarding Covid: From the beginning the medical experts and government officials have consistently spoken with authority and confidence only to be contradicted by subsequent events because what they believed to be true was not.
2021-02-23 18:10:06,"So now you're more of an epidemiologist than Dr. Fauci? All of this piece is wishful thinking and absurd. If there's anything we can say about this virus is that it's new and unpredictable. We need to follow the science and the data and we don't have all the facts yet. How do we know for sure that even those fully vaccinated won't be spreading the virus when they get out and about without any restrictions? The vaccine trials happened under emergency conditions and we don't have much information yet on real world results. For heaven's sake, what is the big rush? I thought that patience is a virtue...should we not be called to virtue and responsibility instead of indulgence and arrogance? It's not that hard, really, if we put others first. Let's work the problem and stay the course--we can't throw all this effort away now that we may be close to a finish line....which, according to medical experts, could be by next fall or winter...or whenever the virus dictates!"

We can’t wish and claim and talk our way out of it, especially with conservative bravado. 
It demands the facts, not wishful thinking. It demands to follows the facts where they lead. Deal with the virus as it demands to be dealt with! 
We’ve now spent a year dealing with the consequences of the wishful thinking the author suggests. 
It’s cost us half a million lives. It’s harrowing to see people like the writer say what they say. Haven’t we faced enough suffering?"
2021-02-23 18:13:53,"“But after a year of misery, death and sacrifice, the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over.”

Agreed, but, in truth, nobody knows when that will be, estimates vary from early  April to late December.

We’ll have a much better idea of when we’ll be out of the woods in about a month, when over 100 million Americans will have gotten at least one shot.  

We’ve underestimated this virus before, with disastrous consequences. 

No more wishful thinking as official government policy."
2021-02-23 17:55:35,"Ross is trying to sound reasonable here, but is still making it sound like governments are somehow responsible for ""shutting down"" the economy.

Let's try to make a sustainable and just new version of normal, even if it takes a little more caution and care than reflexively resuming every old habit. The best athletes in most team sport are expert at recognizing when they have more time to make a key decision than is first apparent. We need to step up our games."

You've got so many equivocations in this piece that your message is a bit muddled. Personally, I'm being very cautious about assuming herd immunity by summer. There are far too many unknown variables.

Like everyone else, I will be pleasantly surprised if it happens."
2021-02-23 18:19:56,"What happened this spring?  Cases went down a little, we jumped the gun and opened before they had gone down very far, and we had a summer surge. The same thing happened this fall.  Are we going to do it a third time? Looks like it.  And we now have more infectious variants around, including a brand new one in California, to make a bad problem even worse."
2021-02-23 18:20:01,"Mr. Douthat demonstrates that he can be as wrong-headed in writing about how to deal with the worst pandemic in at least a century as he has been in extolling the virtues of Donald Trump over the last four years. I'm waiting for him to embrace the Qanon group, or did I miss that column? Perhaps Mr. Douthat should visit Australia or New Zealand (oh wait, he's not allowed in either country) to see how those two democracies have escaped most of the horrors of the coronavirus plague by being almost excessively vigilant in identifying and quarantining not only the infected person(s), but whole cities and states for a period until it can be ascertained that the virus has been contained. For this reason, Aussies and Kiwis are far more free to pursue their daily life and its pleasures than we are here in the United States. 
Mr. Douthat, it's not over 'til it's over. And it ain't over yet."
2021-02-23 18:23:22,"Douthat is correct.  When Covid stops infecting and killing at rates above normal seasonal flu levels, we should stop taking extreme action, like closing schools and businesses, isolating from loved ones, and outlawing gatherings.  

The CDC should establish the necessary metrics (vaccines delivered, herd immunity levels, etc.) and medical guidelines for a return to normalcy.

Most people won't mind wearing masks in large crowds for a while, but our children are suffering from remote learning and our elderly are suffering from loneliness.  How much longer before we can offer them a simple hug?"
2021-02-23 18:23:43,"While I agree with most of what Mr. Douthat posits, the missing piece imo is the ability of underserved communities to receive vaccinations. Even now, vaccination is less available to communities of color: Blacks and Latinx, undocumented or otherwise, in particular (possibly more due to economics than racism, but a problem nonetheless). There is admittedly more resistance to vaccination in those communities--at least partly for legitimate reason--but those who are wiling to be vaccinated must be vaccinated before we can consider lifting restrictions."
2021-02-23 18:25:05,I will continue to wear my mask and wash my hands when I am around people.  I have gotten used to it and it's just not that important to keep discussing it.  It will happen when it happens.  Continue to be safe and enjoy life when and while you can.  There are bigger obstacles ahead in the not too distant future with climate change which will make the corona virus pale in comparison.
2021-02-23 18:25:29,"Does that mean that you are volunteering to negotiate a peace settlement with rapidly spreading virus variant in California, that appears more transmissible, able to “better” evade existing vaccines and antibodies, and that seems to cause more serious illness?

We have managed to put (or at least find) ourselves in the middle of an evolutionary arms race with a human-novel virus that started with quite unusually high transmissibility.

We don’t get to wish our way back to normal, or choose the final, eventual timeline of this pandemic.

We have, impressively, very rapidly created quite effective vaccines, against a pretty clearly moving target.  It is still speculation, even by experts - which you clearly are not - as to if our widely varying, ever changing levels of precautions, the expanding pool of vaccines and simple herd immunity’s combined “ability” to contain the situation, can actually control the virus on anyone’s hoped-for timeline, as the virus evolves in the face of these challenges.

It would indeed be wonderful if the pandemic wound down in a predictable and relatively rapid timeline.  At this point, while we can certainly wish for it, we cannot make the virus play by our rules, and cooperate toward our ends.  We can certainly influence the course of the pandemic, but we lack the will, global coordination and easily and uniformly distributed vaccines to assure its speedy conclusion."
2021-02-23 18:29:09,"I have limited faith in Douthat's ideas in politics, and that's an area he has some experience and expertise in, not about the virus. I think I'll defer to those like Biden and Fauci who have way more knowledge of the matter. In the meantime, I'd rather have pleasant surprises, like underestimate and overachieve, than Trump's promises of the virus magically vanishing, or delivering on great, cheap heath insurance and prescription drugs, etc."

Mr. Douhat’s realistic proposal, based on current trends, vaccines and likely herd immunity are countered with defensive postures as if honest debate no longer exists. Some even attack the writer instead of addressing his words, a clear sign that they do not have a thoughtful argument. I for one, am a strong believer in a sooner than later back to normalcy. I’m a physician, I had COVID and I’ve been vaccinated. We can choose to live in fear or be rationally positive and take risks as we see fit, as long as they do not compromise others.

All these arguments he sets up to knock down (it's no worse than seasonal flu) are the arguments his crowd used to evade their responsibilities.  Just like it's the ignorant selfish GOPers who will be the ones refusing to get the vaccine because of some lies they believed on social media.

Americans need to know how many lives could have been spared if Trump had not disbanded the CDC Pandemic Response Team in 2018 and slashed operational funding of the CDC experts; if Trump had listened to the early warnings of intelligence agencies and the CDC about a pandemic arriving from China; if testing supplies and protective gear and ventilators had been MASSIVELY scaled up in January, 2020; if universal nationwide testing had been initiated in early February 2020 at the latest; if Trump had not said the pandemic was a left wing media hoax and then advised people to drink bleach and lysol.. Americans need to know how many lives could have been saved if at the start of this crisis, Trump would have done everything possible to lessen the spread of COVID including stressing the importance wearing a mask. It is one issue to be unprepared for a pandemic, it is another matter to deliberately undo preparations that have been made for such a disaster and then to pretend there is nothing to worry about ----hundreds of thousands of Americans have died because Donald Trump was in the White House, - a disaster we were truly unprepared for"
2021-02-23 17:41:06,"“Just under a year ago, Donald Trump was justifiably pilloried when he suggested, without evidence, that the worst of the pandemic might be over by Easter.”

That is only the tip of Mr. Trump’s malignant, narcissistic iceberg.

“ … there was another big lie in 2020, also propagated by former President Donald Trump, involving the coronavirus pandemic. It was a lie that systematically downplayed the severity of Covid-19 and the utility of face masks. It very likely resulted in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans … When the history of the American war against the coronavirus is finally written, historians will note that Donald Trump's big lie about masks was the original sin.”  (Jonathan Reiner, MD, CNN, 22Feb2021)"
2021-02-23 17:57:42,"Ross, you are a columnist, and are entitled to your opinion.  But I will listen to the experts like Dr. Fauci first.  If we had listened to experts from the beginning, we would be in much better shape right now and not mourning 500,000 deaths."
2021-02-23 17:44:03,"So this commentator knows more about this than the president and the nation's leading disease expert? How can that be? There's no such thing as being ""too cautious"" about safety measures as is easily proved with our newfound global reputation of half a million people dead. Never, not once so far, have we behaved in a fashion that can be described as ""too cautious"". The economy has suffered? Well that's a shame, you can stack that reality up against say, being dead."

2021-02-23 17:03:52,"Everyone in politics and media is simply hedging their bet, as they have been since the beginning of the virus. Once the 65  population has had the opportunity to be vaccinated, and deaths reduce to a few random cases spread out over a month, I imagine that most people will resume life as normal regardless of the department of health’s guidelines."

2021-02-23 16:15:00,"If you agree with this conclusion about the virus you also should be against the massively wasteful $1.9T 'relief' bill the administration is jamming through congress. If you look at many of the details they represent giveaways not based on any economic need. Do fully employed Americans need $1400, do states whose revenues have almost fully recovered need $350 billion with no strings attached (and not allocated based on budget need), and a $15 min wage that even dems know has zero to do with covid."
2021-02-23 17:36:20,"I'm reminded of Jim Collins' Stockdale Paradox: “You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, AND at the same time, have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.” Collins' was inspired by the experiences and insights of Admiral Jim Stockdale, a POW (with John McCain) who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for withstanding brutal torture during his many years of imprisonment.

Collins recounts (in his book, and on his website) that when asked who didn't survive, Stockdale said it was the optimists:

“The optimists. Oh, they were the ones who said, ‘We’re going to be out by Christmas.’ And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. Then they’d say, ‘We’re going to be out by Easter.’ And Easter would come, and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart.”

Easter, when the virus was going to magically disappear, has come and gone. Thanksgiving and Christmas, too. Now, Mr. Douthat, you want a new president to promise us July 4? As grim as it is, I'd rather our government help us confront the brutal facts, with a steely resolve that we WILL get through this eventually, than set us up for more heartbreak. Covid is heartbreaking enough on its own."
2021-02-23 17:57:40,"Why can't we just be vigilant? What is wrong with saying Christmas and then we can all be delightfully surprised by the news that it's Labor Day? Wouldn't that be a delightful Christmas present? 
It would be a lot better than saying 4th of July (or Easter 2020) and then folks think- free for all!- and then it's back to lockdowns. 
Let's err on the side of caution and then celebrate when we get out early."
2021-02-23 18:18:33,"Why do conservatives want to trade our lives for their money?  They have always been against masks, social distancing, kids out of in-person school, and any measure that reduces economic activity.  Our free market method of dealing with a crisis, the 50 different state solutions that each have a hundred different locality solutions, cost over 500,000 lives so far.  Look at European countries, including Great Britain, who dealt with wave after wave and are still trying to be cautious to save the lives of their people.  The conservative clamor to constantly tempt mass death and sickness as a way to protect balance sheets is disgusting."
2021-02-23 18:35:37,"Thanks, but I prefer to listen to scientists."
2021-02-23 18:36:16,"People wouldn't wear masks and social distance even in the height of the pandemic. The problem here aren't over-prescriptive politicians and elites telling people we're in for a long haul - no one is benefiting from this economic shutdown. The problem is people not listening to experts while also following common sense. COVID-19 will be here for a long time and it makes sense to have a culture in this country that is nimble in decision-making and follows science. I hope we're mostly back to normal by July 4th, but that's not a given and neither is Christmas."
2021-02-23 18:37:19,"What is the goal of a more optimistic forecast by Biden & Fauci? Does anyone believe that the behavior of anti-maskers or disease-phobics would be altered by a more positive public tone?
Does Douthat imagine major private investments or restaurant openings will follow projections at this point ?
What parent wants to risk a child dying from MIS-C after covid infection ? What teacher wants to risk death or long term disability if vaccinations, ventilation and UV/cleansing could reduce risk in every school ?
Shouldn't we all be prepared to wear masks in crowds, indoors and accept this as a new normal? All through Asia, this is routine precaution.
We surely face future respiratory pandemics, let alone toxic disasters- and an increase in possibly fatal viral blights. Balmy up beat talk is silly. Realism is not crepe hanging."
2021-02-23 18:39:29,"Ross, ""herd immunity"" is an urban myth. To start, which herd, in a globalized world? Further, what about new mutants, only  tapering off in frequency as more people are vaccinated against old ones. Thus, finally, as I understand the process, it's more like a frog jumping half-way down the log, than half-way again, etc. Hence the questions in the alternative: Keep growing immunity as rapid as possible by keeping our guard up, notably our masks on? Slow it down by indulging our eagerness to return to the old normal? Personally, I'm in no mood to be sacrificed for the ""herd""!"
2021-02-23 18:39:39,"From the CDC website  ages 1 to 14  covid deaths are 140 from a population of 58 million if you move the needle from 1 to 24 years old 795 deaths from Covid from a population of 95 million or almost 1/3 of the total US population. Point is that sadly this virus attacks from age 65 and older where the death total is almost 400,000. Throw in more than likely the true number of Covid cases are 90 million and roughly 64 million vaccines are done and probably 100 million or more in total in the next 2 weeks. 
The argument for sooner than later is clear. It does not affect the young, covid cases are higher than we know and people are getting the vaccine."
2021-02-23 17:48:37,"This country leads the world in Covid deaths, which is quite an indictment. Without a doubt it was because of mentally deficient leadership in the White House. Imagine if Trump had advised his....followers to wear masks early on. Or at the very least, let the pros handle this medical emergency. Instead, Trump promised it would go away like magic. And wearing a mask became a sign of disloyalty to his majesty. There's an old saying that a country gets the president it deserves."
2021-02-23 18:43:03,"The issue isn’t so much about the public’s ‘right to know,’ so much as it is what people DO with what they know (or think they know). Most people are actually very poor at calculating risk - history has shown this time and again, so why would this time be different? The people who will ultimately wear the blame if things go sideways are right to be cautious."
2021-02-23 17:45:50,This Douthat guy is something else.  What exactly is wrong with under-promising and over-delivering?  If the leader of the Republicans had done this over the past 12 months we'd be in a much better position today.
2021-02-23 18:02:23,"""the coronavirus does not appear to be more dangerous for children than the flu""... Huh?  Tell that to the parents of the children who have died, like the 9 year old in Texas highlighted on the national nightly news last night...And even if these children recover, who knows what still lurks in their bodies, what health challenges they may have long-term?  Besides lungs, doctors are seeing psychoses, heart defects, eye defects et.al. et. al.."
2021-02-23 18:31:12,"If there is ever a time to look to the experts, it’s when faced with a pandemic. Douthat is not an expert and it’s his lack of expertise that shields him from the fears of a Fauci.  Fauci appreciates what he and his colleagues with similar expertise don’t know.  He appreciates the virus has been in humans for just over a year.  We don’t know much about it and about any long time effects it might have on young people who get it and recover. Fauci, and Biden, are cautious out of fear, not undue timidity.  Douthat can pontificate and say oops if something goes wrong."
2021-02-23 17:09:55,"""But after a year of misery, death and sacrifice, the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over.""

There has been a lot of idiotic right-wing verbiage spouted in the 21st century.  The above sentence encapsulates that stupidity with almost profound grace.  One, no, the public does not have 'a right to know in advance'  because Two, nobody has the foggiest idea what circumstances will be TWENTY ONE MINUTES FROM NOW, never mind if, how and when we are going to come to the end of COVID.

We may NEVER come to the end of COVID.  The worst case scenario has this disease shaving 15 or more years off of life expectancy, since it kills one-third of 80+ year-olds who get it, if it becomes endemic and evolving.  AND NOBODY KNOWS OR CAN KNOW IF THAT WILL HAPPEN, or not.

I am sure that in Aug 1944, everyone wanted to know when WWII was going to end and what the shape of life would be like after it ended.  Yeah, like anyone could predict what the post-war world would begin or be like!  Same idea.

The self-entitlement and delusion of the right-wing never fails to astonish :("

Talk to the runner who, maskless, ran within 1.5ft of me from behind, the people in the  grocery with the mask not covering their nose, the get-togethers of 20+ ""friends"" who cannot seem to realize that asymptomatic means you can spread the virus even though you feel great! We know exactly what to do to short circuit the virus, but there are far too many who just do not think that this is up to them.  Perhaps if  we stand up strait and click our heels 3 times, that will work.  Not any less likely than your suggestion!"
2021-02-23 18:34:11,"What you're asking for are prognostications on future events by the President and Dr. Fauci.  

They honestly don't know but can only hope that our vaccines will help bring down the numbers of infected.

We came to this point of economic and mental depression because so many eschewed masks, the only proven way to prevent transmission. And angrily and bitterly and disastrously, through lies, corruption and sabotage, the anti-mask, anti-vaccine, this is just the flu lunatics have undermined the effectiveness of the fight to contain Covid-19.

Now we are exhausted, sickened, poorer, defeated, and we have to pick up and try to make this nation ""normal"" again, whatever that means in a country where half the people believe in imaginary dangers of Q Anon and the other half just want to stay healthy, get vaccinated and go back to school and work."

Epstein Barr? Lyme? really? Didn't know theses were diseases overwhelming our health care system.

The biggest threat, IMHO, are those folks that are not compliant with guidelines - masking and so on.  So let's please stay vigilant - false hope is not healthy - and could make folks less vigilant.  July?  Fantastic.  

But let's not embrace that possibility.  Let's be hopeful - you gives folks a date and it doesn't happen - credibility is lost."

I think whether or not you disagree with what the government says/does, one 's ""dharma"" (roughly translated: life direction with good purpose for the many) is to PROTECT yourself and others.

2021-02-23 16:29:06,"Americans, like Ross, want someone to give them a definite answer to an open ended problem. Ross has his prediction based upon a trend line, but assumes perhaps incorrectly that the trend line is linear! I agree that Americans are tired of the isolation and that bars, restaurants, and tattoo parlors want to reopen without restrictions. Yes, Biden and Fauci are reluctant to give a firm date because predicting the future is fraught with peril and it is better to announce good news later than to put the country back on lock down. My only regret is that pundits like Ross, Rush (when he was with us), Sean, Tucker ad nauseam could have their tirades implemented and then have to live with and explain the outcome."
2021-02-23 18:44:42,"It's better to be cautious than to be reckless. Yes, the rates of new infections is dropping and more people are getting immunized but it's still far too early to declare victory and to celebrate by opening everything willy nilly like nothing ever happened. With new variants popping up every day there still could be a third spike in cases and deaths."
2021-02-23 18:46:38,"I've been a registered Democrat since 1976, and I am glad Democrats control Congress and the White House, but I fully agree with your comments on the pandemic and how important it will be to relax restrictions on a wide range of activities in keeping with the facts.  The media was remiss in never stating how the term ""effective"" is defined in drug reporting, and even now, is doing to little to fix the widespread misconception that the vaccines are far less preventative of significant illness than is really the case.  Still, those with a public health background will try to stick to a maximally cautious approach and worse, many officials use any excuse to exercise authority over people and businesses given the chance.  I've known too many individuals who sought positions of authority because they like to give orders, and health crises are a perfect cover.  If Democrats and well-meaning career leaders leaders like Dr. Fauci err on the side of restriction and deliberate pessimism for more than another few months, I think the Trump right will take Congress in 2022 and the White House in 2024.  The emphasis needs be how incredibly preventative the vaccines are.  Also, the government needs to offer some rewards to society (and officials) for speeding up the vaccination rate above all else.  Like, ""We'll reopen our restaurants when X percentage of the population has gotten both shots.""  Imagine the push by those businesses to encourage vaccine drives if that were announced."
2021-02-23 18:47:21,"Fauci and Biden are definitely ""under promising"" in the hopes that they will ""over deliver"". That is a good political strategy, especially when you are talking about a timeline of about one hundred days and things are uncertain.

Ross wants Biden to talk up the possibility that things will be good by summer, because the trendlines look good. Well, let us hope the trends continue and we do seem more normalcy by summer. Talking up the possibility that things will be normal by summer will not make one bit of difference.  Perhaps Ross, a conservative, does not want Biden to reap the rewards of voters being happily suprised?"
2021-02-23 18:49:12,"May I recommend David Quammen’s NYT article of last week? As humans spread Covid-19 to the great apes, great cats, domestic cats, while-tailed deer, and mice, we risk being subjected to new variants through new vectors. Sure, we might be able to achieve something close to pre-Covid living sooner than the end of 2021, But we might not. We have seen, now, the cycles of relaxing the rules leading to peaks in the infection rate. Given that we don’t know how long the vaccines are effective, let’s err on the side of caution. Under promise and over deliver."
2021-02-23 18:49:58,"Does anyone want to bet that you can be vaccinated and still transmit?  Because I'll take the other side.  

The messaging should be much much simpler, get vaccinated and you're safe and safe to be around.  When the most vulnerable have been vaccinated, or offered the vaccine, it's over.  

If case counts are down, and those other things are also true, these controls will only be ignored, and the authorities will look weak and ineffectual.  Nobody, or very few, will listen."
2021-02-23 18:53:43,"Man plans.  God laughs.  

Projecting an Independence Day Grand Re-Opening is a fool's errand.  Because - the virus doesn't see this as a negotiation.

The reason why our infection and fatality rates are SO terrible, and why we have 500K dead, and about 400k of those needlessly so, is because we decided to ignore the science.

EVERYONE wants to return to a normal and freer life.  Trying to predict and accelerate the all-clear absent science got us much deeper in than we needed to.  

Rather than worry about the prediction of the all-clear date, let's spend more effort on prevention and mitigation.  Then we can let the facts on the ground speak clearly.  And open when the facts tells us it's safe."
2021-02-23 18:54:44,"I keep reminding myself that Trump was given the opportunity to lock down the purchase of more Pfizer vaccine last fall and he turned them down.  So now our biggest problem is a shortage of vaccine as they manufacture as fast as they can.  Trump's incompetence still follows us.

I tend to think your summer expectation is correct, Mr. Douthat.  However, maybe the experts fear that if they told us we'd be free by summer, the people would start loosening up immediately, and cause another surge.  Just hold on for a little longer.  We're almost there."
2021-02-23 18:55:30,"There are certainly trade-offs in staying locked down.  For a large portion of the population the virus is much less dangerous than traffic (those under 40).   For the elderly once they are vaccinated the risk diminishes to a much lower risk than just life over 80 (about 13% chance of death is normal).   

Even more awkward is the current lockdowns and mask policies only seem slightly correlated with outcomes.   For example California has done worse than Kentucky and is likely going to pass Florida in deaths per 100K despite Florida having a significantly higher percent of the population being elderly.

Florida... Florida is open and living and the end result might end up being the same as a lockdown with heavy handed restrictions.  In Virginia the bars are open and for some strange reason the state has done much better than most (currently in the top 10 for best outcomes).  I could not tell you why because it doesn't make sense?  Maybe this region being one of the most fit in the US is helping?"
2021-02-23 19:00:18,"The ""waiting for Christmas"" communication seems completely appropriate to me. Much, much better to get people mentally prepared for the long haul, and then have the pandemic ease up earlier than the alternative. When this thing began, I told myself it would be 2-5 years before normalcy. I imagined the American Civil war, or being in France during WWII. Where ""people like me"", in societies I can imagine, had to endure. And I told myself I could do it. Consequently, I've been in pretty good shape during the pandemic. Not bleating about lost opportunities for indoor dining and whining about not having Thanksgiving celebrations. Set people for the long-haul, and they will be better prepared. Christmas is less than a year away."
2021-02-23 19:00:33,"Run this through your mind for a moment:

What if there was no vaccine?  What then, would be the damage that Trump had visited upon the United States?

He only ever treated it like a PR problem for himself.  There was no statesmanship around its reality.  There was no move to implement a testing and mitigation strategy and the ones that got through were blunted, muddled or actively silenced.  His lieutenants purposely fed him sanitized information or worse, calculated the toll would inordinately afflict his political ""enemies"" (his very own people + citizens in states that happened to give their electoral votes to his opponent).

His incompetent malice and responsibility can never be overstated.  His administration did more damage to America than in the most fevered dream of a Cold War era Soviet General.

Thankfully we do have a vaccine.  Coming months of increasing distribution will help us overcome.  The 4th of July this year should be truly celebratory but we can and should spend the balance of the year remaining vigilant.  That is all that is being said."
2021-02-23 19:03:24,"I would refer Mr. Douthat to an article in today's NYT by virologist Dr. Angela Rasmussen that makes the important distinction between a vaccine's capacity to prevent the disease Covid 19 and and its probable inability to prevent transmission of that disease. As immunized carriers, the vaccinated can still wreak havoc amongst the unvaccinated, especially if the precautions with which we have become familiar are too soon abandoned. While I value Mr. Douthat's ability to, for instance, clarify the the incongruities of a given church-state dilemma, I am not prepared to seek his guidance in matters epidemiologic."
2021-02-23 19:04:24,"Just tell us all will be well by the 4th--so that when it isn't, we can be up in arms because, well, you PROM-ised.

Didn't we have enough of that everything-will-be-alright-next-month in the previous administration?

Look back on the past year--more than once, when numbers stopped increasing, people let their guard down, and the numbers rose even higher.  It's not difficult to imagine that now, with the vaccination process beginning and spring coming, it could happen again.

So much is not known about the South African variant and others that might be emerging--wouldn't it be better to hold on and actually wait and see w/o promises than to relapse into another surge of serious illness and death across the country--and even worse mental depression and exhaustion?

Maybe we will be back by July, maybe not, but as I remember from childhood road trips with my parents, asking, every few miles, ""are we there yet"" didn't get us there any sooner."
2021-02-23 19:06:03,"You want this to end?
One: expend your efforts and capital on convincing people to wear masks. That is the number one way to slow down the pandemic.
Two: acknowledge that the Former Guy and the GOP are directly responsible for some of the spread: opposing mask wearing and not doing enough to obtain vaccines.

In other works:  Learn and Do rather than Whine and Blame.

No, you don't have the expertise of Fauci, who has clearly stated that there are so many factors, that we cannot predict when things will be more ""normal."" 

I sure haven't read that we are going to achieve herd immunity by summer - but perhaps you know more than the experts."
2021-02-23 19:07:07,"Well, I think Fauci and Biden are doing the responsible thing, especially for vulnerable populations. I remember going to a gas station last year when I was convinced of some outré theory and the African-American attendant was frustrated that all of her customers weren't wearing masks. There's a reassurance in the mask, which has become like a talisman allowing us to more or less resume regular activities. I can tell you I feel fine with the June prediction, despite not knowing the full picture (if anyone does). I think setting a June expectation is midway between Fauci-Biden's behavioral predictions and someone like that Wall Street Journal op-ed writer's perfect case scenario. Also, there is evidence that sexual activity may be the largest spreader of the virus, though that is not the only way it spreads. A report I read showed that while the virus infects many major organs, it can be spread through semen and possibly vaginal tissue. Now you might see why speaking of a later date makes sense. If what we have is an airborne disease that is also spread through sexual activity, then you really want to reduce shaming. For instance, a high school student who contracts the virus and is asymptomatic might spread it to his younger siblings via air droplets. What would society think if people knew about sexual transmission? It would cause chaos, violence and possible conspiracy theorizing. I'm dancing around the point, but if I'm to speak freely, I think June."
2021-02-23 19:09:40,"Oh please, stop your carping. There are a lot of unknowns and plenty of reasons to be cautious. There is far more danger in people becoming overly confident and tossing masks and social distancing prematurely than there is in taking a measured approach, seeing how things develop over the next months, and responding accordingly. If late summer turns out to provide us with an early Christmas present, great. If not, let's be prepared to do what needs to be done."
2021-02-23 19:11:37,Am I mistaken that the nation is living through the tragic consequences of its former leadership making coronavirus-related promises supported by nothing but that leadership’s misguided attempt to engineer re-election? And that surely current leadership should be free to make crucial decisions and announcements based on something other than the delusions of a very stable genius?
2021-02-23 19:11:44,"""but more infections also means more immunity, so even in that grim scenario herd immunity could actually arrive sooner still""

yes but why is it so hard to understand that:

more infections also means more mutations and consequently greater odds of new variants with characteristics that are problematic, such as greater transmissibility, greater lethality and resistance to existing vaccines. each infection is a cast of the die."
2021-02-23 19:16:07,"The bottom line: return to normalcy a little later than absolutely necessary and lose some cash and pay some opportunity costs. 
return a little too soon and potentially back to square one. You would think that after 500,000 deaths we might want to err a bit on the side of caution."
2021-02-23 19:16:57,I'm fine with the way the administration is handling it. I believe that we will be through the worst of it by summer and will probably be able to open up everything while still observing some precautions.  We SHOULD NOT think of the whole situation in a binary fashion (i.e. either we are open of business as usual or we are locked down). Rather we should gradually relax  covid requirements as it becomes apparent that it is safe to do so.
2021-02-23 19:18:19,"As a faithful Catholic, there is one question I have never seen adequately answered—why do the most religious people also tend to be the most resistant to Covid restrictions? The phenomenon crosses religious lines to include Orthodox Jews, evangelicals, my own Catholic community, and the members of the Amish/Mennonite community who live around me in Central Pennsylvania. This is the opposite of what I would have expected. These are good people, usually very giving and unselfish, so I just don’t understand why they are usually so opposed to simple measures like masks and distancing. The truly pro life response would seem to be to do whatever it takes to protect the vulnerable, even if it involves economic or personal sacrifice. Ross, if you could explain this paradox to me I would be very grateful."
2021-02-23 19:18:32,"Given that illnesses are unpredictable Douthat's statement that we have a right to know comes across as imperious and wrongheaded.  We DON'T know.  What we know is that there are vaccines out there now that work.  People are being vaccinated.  (Even though the way it's being done is almost guaranteed to give you more agita than you need.)  People are, to some extent, following the rules of engagement.  

But if Douthat were to walk up to Fauci or any other epidemiologist and make that demand the first thing they'd do is laugh at him.  Then, after they finished they would explain to him that being cautious is far better than running the risk that any illness like this can get another foothold in the country.  This is NOT Lyme disease or Epstein-Barr one of which has treatments that work.  

If I were Douthat I'd be grateful that this wasn't Ebola given how poorly it was handled by the Trump administration."
2021-02-23 19:19:13,"For once, I agree with Ross.  There's every indication that immunity has spread farther than the number of diagnosed cases would suggest and there's every reason to believe that the pace of vaccination will increase.

Once overburdened ICUs will have time to improve treatment, saving more lives.  And the most vulnerable will, for the most part, be vaccinated.

The big caveat is variants, and by allowing the disease to spread, we create more opportunities for the virus to mutate.  And remember that variants can cross borders. So the caution Dr. Fauci counsels is probably appropriate.

I think there's light at the end of this tunnel.  But don't turn off the headlights just yet."
2021-02-23 19:21:46,"Sure, we all want to get back to something resembling normal. Could be things will happen sooner if everyone cooperates. But let's leave these decisions to qualified experts who know what they're talking about."
2021-02-23 19:27:16,"The whole idea of the lockdown from a public health perspective is to keep ICUs at less than 100%. Hard stop.

That's what they are looking at. They are not looking at schools, or your feelings, or the economy. If the ICUs are at or over 100%, lots of people die. Hard stop.

So, you can wish upon a star and talk about the economy and shopping and schools, but public health officials are looking at deaths.

Since we had an administration, and still have politicians and commentators, dismissing the need to take precautions like wear masks and wash your hands and avoid large gatherings, we are still behind the curve in bringing this under control. People will continue to get infected and die for the next several months because of this. So, the adults in the room will continue to look at ICU capacity and make their advisories."
2021-02-23 19:28:34,"I fear that you may be onto something.

For an administration that promised to ""follow the science"" when it comes to Covid, they are now doing the opposite. This weekend on Meet the Press, Chuck Todd asked Dr Fauci when it would be safe for children to go back to school, given that the CDC and Am Acad of Pediatrics both said that it should now be possible. He literally refused to answer the question and went off on a tangent. It appears that the position of the teachers union is being taken more into consideration than science.

And the White House is now pushing that we wear 2 masks, while the CDC is recommending only 1. I suspect the 2 mask recommendation is so that in 6 months they can then tell us that ""we're making progress"" and now we can go back to wearing only 1 mask.

Science indeed."
2021-02-23 19:29:05,"I disagree.  We've been here before.  On September 12th, the national 7-day moving average of new cases was below 36,000.  And what happened?  States decided to open up the economy and the number of new cases skyrocketed to a 7-day rolling average of 254,000 new daily cases on January 12th.   It's since declined to 69,000 average daily, but that's still almost twice the September number.   

If cases continue to decline AND we can get masses vaccinated, we can ""open up"", but those are big ifs.  

What part of half-a-million deaths do people not get?    That's more than ten times the number of Americans who died in Vietnam and 167 times the number of Americans who died on 9/11."
2021-02-23 19:36:12,"Mr Douthat’s concept of herd immunity is flawed.  
  When the virus first arrived it had a vast unbroken  and fertile prairie of biomass to frolic in. As people died, become vaccinated, or survived, the prairie became criss crossed with paths that the virus had taken through the prairie.  These paths are inviable to the virus.  
  Between these  paths, isolated islands form, which become playgrounds for the virus and incubators for mutations. 
  As the paths multiply they form a maze like structure that becomes more and more difficult for the virus to navigate.  The islands in between become smaller and even more protected by isolation.  They are still ready to feed the virus though and it will flourish where it can. It will incinerate what small islands it can settle on even while others remain undiscovered. 
That is herd immunity.  It is still a very dangerous environment and one would be whistling past the graveyard to cross it carelessly."
2021-02-23 18:58:10,"This is the exact ""opinion"" (not science) that got us into such a mess in the first place."
2021-02-23 18:39:16,"Ross Douthat, epidemiologist-in-chief.  A stunning example of the Dunning Kruger effect, the cognitive bias that leads ignorant people to wrongly overestimate their knowledge or ability in a specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their own skills.  Oh, and profound hubris is a contributing factor."
2021-02-23 19:02:58,"“Alternatively, if ....... a more infectious variant spreads, then we’ll get a last spike of cases and more people will die — but more infections also means more immunity, so even in that grim scenario herd immunity could actually arrive sooner still.”

It’s clear that some currently known variants are not prevented well by current vaccines. It is not clear that infection with current or future variants will confer immunity to other mutant versions of the virus. 

In medicine, one should not just make stuff up. I thought that would end with Peter Navarro’s exit from the government. Apparently Ross has taken up the gauntlet."
2021-02-23 19:23:31,"I agree: Ross has neither the authority of the president nor the expertise of Dr. Fauci. I hope he’s correct, but I’ll listen to those with authority and expertise. There wouldn’t be 1/2 million deaths today had we all done so all along. We’ve had far too much advice from arm-chair experts."
2021-02-23 18:46:13,Emergency must end? Let's say it should and let's say it does. Is mask wearing and social distancing anything more trouble than wearing a life jacket while boating? Your point Ross is that because you are writer and can read that you know better? The lack of leadership in 2020 and the attempts to control information from Fauci are the reason we are in this mess. Things always take longer to clean up when the mess is this big. You are underscoring one month into the Biden administration that you will be and foster others into becoming a hinderance and Doubting Thomas.
2021-02-23 19:09:35,Nobody wants it co tinge a second longer than it does. But thinking you can just declare it over and “make it so” is like king Canute telling the waves to not come in.
2021-02-23 18:50:45,"This over-intellectualized, but still poisonsouly neoliberal screed for individual responsibility and ""freedom"" in a time of profound, COLLECTIVE crisis.
 should give us pause.

Much of this is simply ridiculous--Lyme disease is an analogy for Covid?

Not a surprise that the simple courtesy and civically responsible of mask wearing gets a mention here.

What comes through this piece is its barely repressed, almost hysterical fear of government, comically ridiculous in a right-wing Catholic who genuflects before the world's most authoritarian and anti-neoliberal institution.

Would Ross wear a mask if the National Council of Bishops told him so?  Would this be ""overreach""?
Calm down, Ross.  You'll be able to go around maskless eventually."
2021-02-23 18:40:20,"It feels irresponsible to publish something like this, let alone write it.  We've got 500k dead, many of those unnecessarily so.  Ross should've re-read what we wrote, and realized he was on the wrong track when he wrote this: ""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and at this moment both their takes look way too pessimistic.""  That's certainly where I stopped reading."
2021-02-23 19:12:09,"The bortom line is simple; if you won't wear a mask or get vaxed, you will surely become infected sooner or later. Many of you will get very sick. Some will die. The timeline for that is 1-2 years, give or take.
 For the rest of us wo comorbidities  who already have antibodies,  have been or will soon be vaxed, serious covid infection sequelae are unlikely 
I agree with Ross. By July, America needs to reopen- Music! Travel! Social events!!! These things are who we are. Given any other course , the "" cure"" is worse than the disease. I have no desire to wait out the selfish antivaxxers and resent being expected to do so."
2021-02-23 19:02:08,"So, what do you know?  Ross, who criticizes his distorted interpretation of liberal individualism ad nauseam and presents himself as a conservative communitarian is at heart the very sort of liberal individualist he condemns. It is the real liberals who are prepared to make sacrifices for the common good, who are acting in accordance with communitarian values and self-professed communitarians like Ross who are libertarian anarchists."
2021-02-23 19:01:38,"I am endlessly fascinated by those who studied philosophy or political science begin to explain the details of how to manage a pandemic (that may be switching to an endemic disease).

Of course we are tired of COVID.  Of course we all want it to go away. 

But being stupid about COVID has cost the US 500,000+ lives with another few hundred thousand soon to be added to the list.  This is more than double any other country's death rate.

And, how did we do so badly?  We listened to politicians and pundits who -- led by the denier-in-chief -- announced that we could live our normal lives, that masks were too inconvenient and that when we got bored, the pandemic would give way."
2021-02-23 18:43:56,"Only Americans will think that the virus will take a holiday just because it is the fourth of July.

Meanwhile in New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore and any other country who trusted scientists from the get go, dining out, movies, concerts, etc are back to pre-COVID 19 normal."
2021-02-23 18:48:36,"From your mouth to Mother Nature's ears, Mr. Douthat?  

Trump said it was a hoax and from day one the media started shouting about vaccine, vaccine, vaccine when they knew it would be months - maybe years - before a vaccine would be found.  It lulled people into thinking COVID 19 wasn't all that dangerous and - like lemmings - many kept the 0.01% economic engine running.  Then their family members, friends, co-workers and neighbors - and they - started dying.  Those who could stayed home but, unfortuneatley, the poorest had to keep working for low wages and high danger.

We all want to defeat COVID 19.  One sure way is to WEAR A MASK OUTSIDE YOUR HOME AT ALL TIMES AND STAY AWAY FROM CROWDS.

So simple.  Let's be smart, use our heads and get through this together.  It's the only way to escape Mother Nature."
2021-02-23 18:50:42,"Whenever I read an opinion piece as replete with as many hedge words as appear in this column, my antenna goes up.  Speculation is just that:  speculation.

But there are concrete steps that could be taken even now -- and should have been taken long ago:  for the millions of us who registered in our counties or states for an inoculation, it would be very beneficial to know what number a person is in the queue.  

I receive notices that tell me ""oh, yeah, we know you registered"" and my latest favorite, ""oh, yeah, you're still in our database,"" but they apparently don't seem to value the feeling of relief one might expect from knowing that the the local government is presently on inoculated-person #xxx and you're number is yyy.  They know how many doses they are receiving a week, which they could share as well, so you'd have a chance to plan.  What a concept!

Just how hard can it be to share that information?  What about it, Mr. Douthat?"
2021-02-23 18:51:31,"Joe Biden and Dr. Fauci should not make any ""hopeful"" predictions to the American people about when this will end.  As an American, I do not want Joe Biden to suggest that the virus will be over by the 4th of July.  Why?  Because I work in a nursing home and witness the virility of COVID-19 each and every day since March 10.  Nothing has changed here.  The only thing we really know about the virus is that it is unpredictable and deadly.   That's it.  Even less it the efficacy of the vaccine.  We already know that you can still get the virus after you have been vaccinated.  It will take time to see if you can make others sick carrying the virus after vaccination.  It is way too early to make any hopeful predictions.  I agree with Biden and Fauci to cautiously state that by Christmas we should see an improvement - but that's it.  Please don't make any false promises.  The other term for ""false promises"" is ""lies."""
2021-02-23 19:45:29,"I'm all for having these discussions.  Problem with this viewpoint is that saying that people who won't get vaccinated are primarily putting themselves at risk ignores a massive problem--my daughter, a doctor, having to work up to 90 hours a week in residency at her hospital dealing with the fallout of those putting themselves at risk.  If we could just deny them admission to hospitals, I'm on board with letting folks decide their own fate vis-a-vis the virus, but only if the rest of us don't have to suffer the consequences of their foolish behavior."
2021-02-23 19:45:44,"I understand Mr. Douthat is trying to draw inferences from the best available data, and, by extension, trying to suss out a timeframe that can be reasonably estimated whereby we can begin returning to normalcy. Unfortunately, we simply do not know enough about the virus's behavior over the long term. We've seen variants develop quickly and do not have a full picture of what can emerge in the weeks and months ahead. 

Until we get hard data that is time-tested on the current and future vaccines, we must take the necessary precautions to protect human life. The worse thing possible is to create false hope and return to normalcy before we fully understand the progression and mutational capability of this disease. One wrong move at this stage could lead to an order of magnitude rise in infections and death."
2021-02-23 18:49:41,Thanks Douthat but I will continue to take my guidance from Dr. Fauci. I believe he knows a lot more about it than you.
2021-02-23 19:19:45,Along comes a conservative telling us to ease up on restrictions earlier than expert. Wave of COVID follows. Isn't this like the fifth time I've seen this show?
2021-02-23 18:06:43,"It is easy to bloviate on what you are not an expert on.  Fauci and Biden are not ""pessimistic"".  They have the responsibility to communicate the most conservative case that would result in the fewest deaths.  You, Ross, have the luxury of being able to say ""Oops, I was wrong, so sorry!"", they do not.  Have you not yet learn the mathematics of viral infection?  You would not be so blasé about this."
2021-02-23 17:32:02,"Who really needs opinions like Mr. Douthat's about the timeliness of the coronavirus? He is not a qualified medical professional, epidemiologist nor scientist and should just stick to his conservative, political and ideological commentaries and not muddle the waters of an ever-changing novel pandemic as if he were an expert on such a life-threatening virus. His layman projections do not merit the slightest consideration of an already confused and anxious majority of the population."
2021-02-23 18:03:10,"Where is the call for the Republican Senate to support Biden's bill, and actually help us get to normalcy by July?"
2021-02-23 19:19:53,"Over the summer South Dakota agreed with Ross. Really kept the embers burning for our second wave.

I'd be more worried about the right being cancelled if they had any ideas that weren't stupid, lazy, or dangerous."
2021-02-23 16:17:55,"It's great that you feel more qualified than Fauci to read the trend lines, Ross. Trump thought he was, too. The facts are that the US has had the worst outcome in the developed world exactly because we are always planning and executing on a ""return to normalcy"" well before that would be advisable, or even sane. The US has three to four times the death toll of India, in spite have one quarter of its population and any vastly greater resources. Exceptionalism is begging to appear to be indistinquishable from idiocy."
2021-02-23 16:43:47,"It’s a virus that is mutating without bounds; the virus doesn’t care what we think or believe. It will take every biological opportunity to propagate itself and mutate to avoid new vaccines and methods to eradicate it. The United States has created the perfect breeding grounds for infection, death and mutation.

No one, not even Dr. Fauci or the president knows when it will all end and when we will return to normality, whatever that will be.

We had our shot to eradicate the virus a year or so ago. That opportunity was squandered by trump, republicans, Fox News and governors. There are no re-dos in this war; every battle lost to the virus costs lives and people’s health, and gives the virus, and now it’s cousins, ample opportunity to take the upper hand and continue its assault on mankind.

Trying to guess when we will return to normal is a fools errand."
2021-02-23 19:42:55,"""The Covid Emergency Must End... We might be able to achieve normalcy by summer.""

More magical thinking--a baseless assertion ""supported"" by a hugely problematic ""might.""

Of course the Covid emergency must end--but that should be when the pandemic is under control and thousands aren't getting sick and dying on an ongoing basis.  In case Mr Douthat missed the news, the USA has now suffered half a MILLION deaths from Covid.  

And with that *fact* in yesterday's news, today, Mr Douthat  grandly proclaims that it's time to end the emergency asap.  Cavalier, utterly illogical magical thinking."
2021-02-23 19:38:07,"Russ, how do you scientifically measure ""reasonably good fortune"" as a metric for reopening?
You had a case for you opinion, but blew it at the end.
Americans will determine when we get to a post-covid normal. Not the government, not scientists, but regular Joes like you and me."
2021-02-23 19:37:56,"“Herd Immunity” has an almost positive vibe to it, but it hides a terrible truth. It meant the death of up to half the human population in the mid 14th century, taking 150 years for the population to recover. It meant the death of at least half a million Americans of a population a third of today’s in the 1918 flu pandemic. It has meant a ravaged defenseless population left after innumerable human harvests throughout history. It is a term so horrific that it is blasphemous to use it for political machinations. Do not do so."
2021-02-23 19:51:23,"""Covid fatigue"" is an international issue. Note, for example, the recent ""Dutch curfew riots"" and other lockdown protests that have occurred in Germany, Spain, France, and other foreign countries. So we are not alone in our hope for ""normalcy."" 

Medicine is inherently conservative, and doctors at times walk a fine line between conveying optimism and yet having patients face the facts of their condition. If you were diagnosed with a rare cancer, do you want your doctor to underpromise and overdeliver? Or offer a dozen ""ifs"" and caveats about the potential success of your treatment along with a lengthy list of its possible side effects and risks?

We're all desperate for the end of this GLOBAL stressor. But we have to recognize that recovery will have a long tail. And, unfortunately, millions will never recover."
2021-02-23 19:51:36,"Until we have more real world data, we under-promise. Wait just a little bit for the real world data. You only get instant answers in the opinion business, and this is not that."
2021-02-23 19:52:01,Personally I'd rather have leaders that under-promise and over-deliver. Remember when The Old Guy said it was like the flu and would be gone in two weeks?
2021-02-23 19:52:37,"You say, ""the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over."" 

I'm sorry to break the news to you, but that is impossible. Facts are not always predictable. The emergency could even be over more quickly, or not. We just don't know. This is even less certain than predicting the weather.

Ross: Please quit playing dangerous games with truth and facts."
2021-02-23 19:54:35,"What is the point of this essay? ""I think..."" I have colleagues that think....""   Ross, everybody and their brother has an prediction about what's going to happen; and while trained opinions are much more likely to be accurate than speculation by essayists, the fact is nobody can be sure.  We will deal with this, as we have been, one step at a time, based on the numbers on the ground.  I, for one will continue to follow public health guidance and not try to second guess the situation. I suggest you do the same."
2021-02-23 19:54:50,"Man the comments sections in these covid articles are so harsh! We are already seeing massive declines in case counts, sustained declines in the death rate, and we should expect and might already be seeing steep drops in the IFR as the most susceptible population (the elderly) are mass-vaccinated. This is great news! And the news is only getting better, as we'll have a higher than expected delivery of mRNA coming online in the next few weeks. We still have work to do, but Douthat is right -- normality is in sight. Why scold or judge people for yearning for that? We can mourn the virus's awful toll while also appreciating what modern science and industry have accomplished in less than a year since the first US lockdowns."
2021-02-23 19:55:13,"What is it with Republicans and their belief in the power of wishful thinking? After a horrifying year of over-promising, predictions of the miraculous and outright lies, I for one, find President Biden's frankness and balance in his public statements refreshing. Perhaps it's a bit like a bucket of ice water on our hopes of a return to normality, but that's a whole lot better than the the putrid stew of bad leadership that we've been soaking in since the first case of COVID-19 was reported. Better that we embrace the reality of 500,000 dead and counting than embrace any possibility that we can safely start to ignore the virus and it's variants and pretend that this pandemic never really happened. The hardest part of this is probably still ahead of us."

Do you imagine people dying and saying ,""Oops,"" and expecting a do-over?  Would you give up six months for more precautions to be more certain of living? 

Who are these people lurking to extend their control?  

Better safe than sorry, Ross.  Try some responsibility leadership."

Setting dates like Easter or 4th of July is as silly as it gets. It will only encourage people to get reckless as those dates approach, and if the 4th surge would happen, these people would be the first to blame others for false promises."
2021-02-23 16:34:19,"Brother Douthat,

Millions and millions of American Know Nothings still refuse to wear a mask, refuse to socially distance and refuse to show the slightest pandemic courtesy to their fellow humans.

Until that portion of Americans grows up, wakes up and shapes up, this nation will remain in a state of ignorant, misanthropic turmoil.

2021-02-23 19:46:06,"That's right Ross: I totally agree a broken clock is, in fact, correct -at least- once a day. I'm sure your ship will come in any day (it'll go away). In the meantime, enjoy your kids!

But I would much rather Biden and Fauci underpromise and overdeliver than the Trump model, which is stick your head in the sand.

But yes, once the vaccine is available to anyone that wants it, you wait a month for the second shot and it to kick in, then you open up. Those that choose not to get it are at the mercy of nature."

we're still to read critical journalistic ideas about what was behind the trump's pillorying. or for that matter, anything, something- about the trump withholding of vital information pertaining to the impending deadly virus- which obviously killed more than 500,000 Americans. where are the calls for his impeachment for that ?!
the wishful thinking for "" opening up, no masking, etc"", which we heard about from trump and his administration, directly implicated the WH for at lease some of the great damage, suffering and death we've seen.
Dr. Faucci is the country's foremost authority on the science ( excuse the use of that word !). if anyone understands, and have the experience in dealing with pandemics - its him."

We all want to know, but the trouble is that  all projections are based on expectations and on uncertainties: variants, public adherence to protocols, distribution of vaccine, speed of vaccinations.  I think that Fauci mentioned Thanksgiving as a possibility, by the way."
2021-02-23 19:57:01,"While Mr. Douthat's column may be a few weeks premature (more vaccines need to be given; the predicted B.1.1.7 variant surge in March/April needs to be overcome), it eloquently makes the point that the cure might be worse than the disease. For younger adults, especially those who live alone, nearly a year of lockdown or quasi-lockdown vis-a-vis restrictions are beginning to their toll. Mental illness and suicide among otherwise individuals is on the rise. There must come a point, when ICU's are no longer overwhelmed, that our leaders say ""enough is enough, let people make their own choices"". We know for sure that obesity and overcrowded (often illegal) living quarters are leading causes of Covid fatalities and spreading; let the leadership of this country do something about that. Arbitrary lockdowns and restrictions have been, and will always be, a Band-Aid solution to deeper structural problems in the US."
2021-02-23 20:01:13,"Like Scotty used to do on Star Trek, it's better to slightly overestimate how long solving a problem will take and be pleased when it's a bit faster, than be overly optimistic and then disappointed or have things go to heck when it doesn't work out."
2021-02-23 12:03:41,"We simply have to relax requirements for the vaccinated. I understand that *everyone* needs to continue masking in public. That makes sense because we don't know if vaccinated people can still spread the disease, though there's a lot of solid indications that their chances of spreading are far, far less. 

Besides, we don't want people working in public places to have to confirm that every unmasked person is fully vaccinated.

But let's ease up where we can.

Allow vaccinated people to gather with each other. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are so effective, it hardly matters if a vaccinated person can still spread the disease. 

In many states, multi-household gatherings are banned -- and even when they aren't, trusted state health officials aren't giving this a clear public green light, so fully vaccinated folks are still sitting home alone!

2. Any state that has quarantine requirements for people traveling from out-of-state should follow Vermont's lead and drop these requirements for vaccinated people. 

These two safe and simple steps will be a critical first step towards normalcy -- not to mention an incentive to get vaccinated."
2021-02-23 13:00:12,"Thank you for this opinion piece. Either the vaccines work or they don't. The promise was always to return to normal with the vaccines. Reduce the risk to that of flu and we should be back to normal. Moderates need to push back against the chicken littles, otherwise my vote will move to a party that will start opening up America again. Americans are tired of this and want normalcy. I hope the Democrats dont overplay their hand."
2021-02-23 11:22:41,"I greatly appreciate the nuanced tone of this post. I work in mental health and I cannot emphasize how much of a toll the pandemic has been taking on people. Recently, I am seeing depression with hopelessness as the lockdowns, isolation, job loss, underemployment, stressors of homeschool are starting to look endless to people even as they can see cases are dropping and vaccines are out. People were able to hang on while waiting for a vaccine but now that it's here and there's still no talk to ease the pains that those that are less susceptible to the vaccine have suffered in sacrifice for those more susceptible, hopelessness has set in. I'm seeing children and adults with depression and suicide attempts. Medication can only do so much to treat what is caused by a situation and therapist are back logged and still expensive. I hope that those in power from the federal level to the local will realize it is time to give up control and allow people to take their own risks again."
2021-02-23 18:03:38,"""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and at this moment both their takes look way too pessimistic.""

As a physician I can honestly say that it is this attitude that will lead to many more deaths."
2021-02-23 20:05:55,"This is now as much a political issue as a health one.  Local and state government officials are enjoying their ""emergency powers"" a little too much.  Protect the elderly and the immune compromised and let's get on with it."
2021-02-23 20:07:14,"I’m all for leaders pointing to the positive and seeing light at the end of the tunnel, but I’d also rather have President Biden and Dr. Fauci’s cautious optimism than, for instance, the ex-President and Jared’s foolish denial. Remember when Jared said we’d be “really rocking” by July 2020? People let their guard down and we know how that worked out. If vaccinations happen faster than expected and herd immunity kicks in early, great! There will be cause for all to celebrate. If it takes longer, I’ll be grateful that the experts refused to jump the gun to give false hope."
2021-02-23 20:09:58,"I guess I don’t agree with statement: “But after a year of misery, death and sacrifice, the public has a right to know in advance when the emergency should reasonably be over”  The true answer is NOBODY KNOWS when the emergency will be over. Every adult with a little coaching should be able to deal with this uncertainty. Biden/Fauci are using a robust, resilient approach that accepts this uncertainty. Why is this so hard for you and every other conservative to accept? I don’t get it."
2021-02-23 20:10:14,"I hope you are right, Mr. Douthat. The problem I see is that from the beginning DJT shoved every responsibility for Covid to the governors of the states. Each governor has made the rules according to the status of that state, or the whims of that governor. That control is not going to change now. Governors will decide when to open up their state, hopefully with the support of the WH and in accordance with the latest science. The numbers reflect which states are doing a better job, and I'm not sure the conflicting methods in the different states will help us attain herd immunity any sooner. What we so desperately want and need with human contact can and will still kill a lot of us. I'm all for getting back to normal but I don't want to see any more of my friends and relatives die."
2021-02-23 20:10:55,"The more virus that is out there the more chance of mutations.  That's just the mathematics of virology.  We have not paid attention to the virologists or the epidemiologists so we have paid the price in lives lost and lives ruined with chronic illness and a crippled economy.  Most of us do not understand the math and science behind Fauci's and other scientists' recommendations.  We assume they can ""fix"" everything with a vaccine.  Fauci is saying that is not necessarily true.  We need strict mitigation measures for a considerable length of time and he has explained the timeline.  Fauci told us we could lose a half million Americans if we did not follow their recommendations, and sure enough 500,000 Americans died of Covid.  These are not random numbers or a good ""guess.""  The mathematical models predicted the infection and death rate.  We did not understand the math and science then, and the vast majority of us (including Mr. Douthat) do not understand it now.  We must rely on the scientists and epidemiologists to tell us what is safe and what is not safe.  They can tell us what the mathematics says about infection and death, and how our behaviors determine the numbers.  Choosing to believe the scientists is in the realm of opinion, but the math and science is in the realm of facts.  We have had too much opinion and not enough facts.  That's why we have all of those dead Americans and such a ravaged economy."
2021-02-23 20:11:51,"Granted, if the vaccine is available and able to prevent serious disease or death, it makes sense to reopen as soon as possible. But one thing that Douthat hasn't considered: the willingness of people to fully reopen the economy -- to fly, go to the office, eat at a restaurant.

I've had my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine, will soon have my second. That should prevent hospitalization and death. But would I then go to a bar or a movie? Even if it weren't necessary to protect other people, my sense is that I would not, because as anxious as I am to get back to normal life I'm not particularly anxious to get sick (I well remember the plane flight on which everybody was coughing, and how I came down with the flu and spent my vacation shivering in bed).

Perhaps that's overreaction on my part, but I don't think it will be uncommon among older people or those who can otherwise anticipate a symptomatic case."
2021-02-23 20:13:25,"If, and it's a big if,  people who have not followed recommended guidelines for mask wearing, social distancing  and embrace vaccinations  maybe just maybe the emergency will be over.  However, I am not counting on these folks who deem these recommended guidelines as impinging on their freedoms to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem."
2021-02-23 20:15:54,"If the messaging is that even if you get the vax, life will remain status quo with social distancing and masks until 2022, then why bother getting one?  Especially low risk groups like the young."
2021-02-23 20:16:21,"So, Joe Biden tells us that we can celebrate July 4 without danger. Then something happens.
Maybe one of those variants, which are still appearing as more people get the disease, proves resistant and/or more deadly. Maybe the people who had the disease, but weren't very sick turn out to have immunity that lasts only a few months. There are a lot of them and nobody knows about their immunity. 
If a large cohort of people refuse to get vaccinated, that will throw a monkey wrench into the calculations. It might just be in some pockets or it could be more widespread. Will all those people who won't wear masks get vaccinated? Who knows?
Anyway, we get to September and things are better, but it's still not safe to go to a theater. Or schools turn out to be deadlier than is believed at this time.  It wouldn't take much to throw the nation into turmoil. 
What do you think would happen to Joe Biden and the Democrats in that turmoil? I think he's wise to wait to see how this evolves. If Ross is right, we'll see things really opening up in July. I hope that happens, but I plan to be cautious along with the president and Dr. Fauci."
2021-02-23 12:32:44,"As a Catholic Douthat should know that, man proposes and God disposes."
2021-02-23 20:18:39,I'd rather that the approach be more cautious than necessary with a great surprise of early relief from those measures than what we have had in the past.
2021-02-23 20:24:42,"Mr. Doubtfire, what do you think of the elderly and the younger immune compromised not really being prioritized for vaccination?  In California, sure, those over 65 can just recently be vaccinated. The younger vulnerable, not yet.  But seniors are fighting for slots with teachers (who have been allotted 10% of the vaccines) and numerous business groups. Not just healthcare workers.  With the governor keeping as many business as possible open so he does not get recalled, s long as a small percentage of ICU beds remain open.  It's the economy over lives."
2021-02-23 20:25:14,"I really, really hope schools are open normally next fall.  By then, barring an unpleasant variant surprise, any adult who wants to be vaccinated should be vaccinated and protected.  My elementary-aged children will presumably not be vaccinated yet, but they and other young children have already sacrificed SO MUCH to help keep older people safe.  In the fall, when older people will have had the shots if they want them, it will be time to put children first. Their educations, their health, their happiness."
2021-02-23 20:25:51,"The empty and dangerously ill-informed rhetoric in this waste of newsprint is inexcusable. I am so sick of those, like this writer, who minimize this crisis. Those who become ill and do not die, often suffer unimaginably. The health-care workers are exhausted, depressed, and suffering. Front-line workers have paid an enormous price. In no way are the precautions worse than this disease that has mounted a death toll greater than a major war. If the outcome we all hope for comes sooner than predicted, we can celebrate together, Until then, caution and patience and community are what we need."
2021-02-23 20:26:27,"President Biden said he would get 100 million shots into people's arms in the first 100 days.  He's on track to exceed 150 million shots.  You would have asked him to project 200 million and have him seen as falling short of what was realistic.  

Where were you when our last president said the virus would go away ""like a miracle"" or when the weather got warm?  (Did you speak up when it didn't go away?)  When he made wearing masks a culture war?  (Although it would have saved lives.)  

Comes Biden, acknowledging that no one can know for sure when the pandemic will be over – instead of painting gilded pictures, only to disappoint people as Trump did so many times.  

Thanks anyway.  But I prefer to believe to be pleasantly surprised if the pandemic ends sooner, rather than have my hopes crushed yet again."
2021-02-23 20:29:28,"I can't figure out what it is about conservatives that always leads the to a position of denial when it comes to the covid19. 

Can it really be about keeping anti-vaxxers in the fold and carefully choosing language which says ""everything is ok and everybody can go to church because it is all a hoax and Jesus will protect us "" ? 

Trump basically lost re-election because he refused to recognize that there was a dangerous virus going around. His constant denial (and the mismanagement it implies) is a good enough explanation as to why Pfizer waited just under a week after election day to announce the outstanding results they achieved in trials with their vaccine. 

This isn't the only space publishing the ""fact"" that ""herd immunity"" is setting in as an explanation for the recent decrease in covid cases. 

My guess is that denial will cost Republicans the next cycle. Dems will run on creating a new  paradigm for dealing with all the various viruses that could prey on humanity in a globalized atmosphere and republicans can run on ""say, what, huh?  big government bad...""

Another republican myth? The 100 year virus, no doubt borrowed from the old ""100 year flood"" idea. There were no intercontinental airlines in 2018 when the Spanish Flu hit. Novel corona virus number 19 will not be a 100 year event. So what has Trump done in his last year in office to prevent future damaging viruses? Nada.

Rich republicans love flying to Cancun and Mar-a-Lago for the week end, virus or no virus."
2021-02-23 20:29:42,"I recall Dr. Fauci saying that if we did things right, it would look like an over-reaction.  So far, the only over-reaction has been to people unwilling to care others to end this thing, or at least vastly reduce the carnage from it."
2021-02-23 20:33:23,Wow people really don't like this optimistic outlook. As a cautious person from a not very cautious state these replies have lost contact with reality. Most people from GA are behaving close to normally unvaccinated. You are thinking they are going to follow restrictions after being vaccinated?
2021-02-23 20:35:58,"This is absolutely spot-on.  Once everyone who wants to be vaccinated IS vaccinated, the emergency measures (restaurant closures, mandatory mask-wearing, etc.) should be ended -- provided that the vaccine protects all but a tiny percentage of recipients from severe symptoms.  In other words, if Covid-19 really is ""no worse than the flu"" if you're vaccinated (for both)."
2021-02-23 20:37:08,""" But the danger of the overcautious, wait-for-Christmas public rhetoric from Biden and Fauci is that it provides cover and encouragement for fearful officials to extend the whole suite of emergency measures for many unnecessary months. ""

I never heard ""wait"" for Christmas. What I heard from both Biden and Fauci was ""we don't know."" It beats the heck out of ""It will magically disappear,"" or that ""it will be gone by Easter.""   My husband and I have had our first shots, with the second scheduled for early March. I turn 65 in April. He's 67 and has COPD/Emphysema. I don't know what ""emergency measures"" you're referring to, but I'm guessing we will be wearing masks in public for the rest of our lives. And when the emergency measures are gone there will still be a new ""normal."""
2021-02-23 20:38:39,"As long as Fauci refuses to come out vigorously in support of a First Doses First Policy, in face of all the scientific evidence that suggests it is a better approach, and against what a rational public health risk assessment would demand, he is either playing politics or has professional pride invested in the two-dose status quo. Either way it’s proving to be deadly and a real hurdle to an expedited vaccination for the US. Why would Biden keep him on?"
2021-02-23 20:38:53,"When you write ""ther arguments marshaled by Covid skeptics and lockdown critics, which have been mostly wrong or misguided,"" can you say ""I like to have it both ways?"" They were not mostly wrong or misguided. Given a megaphone by the ex ""mostly not a"" president, they were wrong. Period. Trend lines and prognostacations are so beside the point. Anti Vaxers have vilified vaccines, significantly, since the 90's, none of it supported by vetted scientific method. Oh, so prior to theis pandemic, measels started to make a come back.  Great position. Ask Sweeden how their herd immunity pre vaccine plan worked out. Better to spend valuable column space repetitively typing ""Get the vaccine, ASAP, if you want to be more sure than not, of living a normal life again."

2021-02-23 18:16:05,Ross—as a woke republican you know the pandemic is a farce which will go away by itself and vaccines are a conspiracy by Soros and Gates to implant microchips that will take control of republican superior brains.   So it must be time to blame democrats for slowing progress towards normalcy.   Woke up
2021-02-23 16:08:38,"To the many excellent comments about a more conservative and cautious approach,  we should also add that while seasonal flu is merely a very unpleasant illness for most,  covid also has long term debilitating effects for as many as 1 in 3 victims.   Kind of like Lyme Ross, except you can easily avoid Lyme by taking tick precautions but you can't evade covid.   Endemic Covid is a frightening prospect and we have got to do more than go from raging fire to smouldering-- we have to hang in long enough to put this fire out."
2021-02-23 17:16:09,"The title of this OP-ED isn't bad except for the typo in the title  where Must was substituted for Might. The only Must I'm confident of is that both Mr. Douthat and his readership will at some time in the not too distant future all be deceased.
Some other mights that should be considered
1. Current vaccines might only provide short term immunity. The common cold is a not do distant relative, of  the current COVID.
2. The current vaccines will fail to provide effective immunity against the British and South African mutants. We (the USA) may be producing mutants as I type, but since we do very little sequencing (Unlike South Korea, etc. etc.) we don't know yet. Ignorance almost never produces bliss.
3.The current vaccines are unlikely to produce sterilizing immunity, i.e., asymptomatic individuals may well infect the immunologically naive. Ergo, masks may still be important.
4.Current evidence suggests that some infected individuals can be reinfected and significant numbers of infected individuals are very ill for a long time (weeks, and months)
Perhaps the best we might hope for is an annual COVID+Flu vaccine"

If masking was supported at the begijnng and everyone did it, we never would have had to close the schools

There is no help for Inside dining or crowded venues.  That’s just in the past for now

But I feel if everyone is masking I can get on transportation, sit in a classroom or a meeting  it’s fine

Republicans brought us here with their stupid war on masking which should be criminal."

2021-02-23 19:56:52,"I think President Biden likes to under estimate so that he can look like he over performs. Remember when his vaccination goal was originally only one million people per day ? I would rather him say the emergency is over by Christmas, and have it gone by July.
It is certainly better than lyin 45 , saying that it would magically disappear by Easter."

Vaccines are coming and should be here is sufficient supply by early summer.    At the same time, NY has seen its first cases of the So African variant.   There is no current research to show the current vaccines will work and this is where we started a year ago.  

No one wants to go back to the days of overrun hospitals and mass graves.    Please do not write pieces that continue to encourage the ""it's only a virus"", ""masks infringe on my rights"", ""it's too hard for me"" groups.   We have lost 500,000+ or our citizens.

2021-02-23 20:12:59,"COVID19 is an enemy. From the start, we had the weapons needed to defeat that enemy-- a mask to trap aerosol transmission, hand washing and sanitizing to kill germs, staying home, socially distancing--and yet millions of Americans choose not to use any weapons.

It's as if an army of monsters were approaching, people were handed guns, and they refused to fire the guns because having a general tell you what to do is ""Big Brother"" and ""an infringement of my rights"".

It has been crazy to observe this. In nations where everyone used the available weapons against COVID19, there were far fewer deaths. 

Here, it's like people are into embracing a death cult. Willful suicide and willful manslaughter of others merely because of petty party politics, and a belief that helping others is weak."

First of all, when the conditions truly and factually exist for a return to a modified normality, Fauci and Biden will no longer be saying otherwise. Secondly, no one would pay any attention to them if they did. Did you just need to contrive a way to fault the Biden administration?"

So -shhh.  We need fewer blowhards and more people who will listen to science."
2021-02-23 20:14:33,"Dr. Anthony Fauci has been on the front lines of other dangerous pathogens such as  HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria as well as emerging diseases such as Ebola and Zika and, of course, SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19).  His conclusions about them are often surprisingly simple, yet grounded in his up front witness to their reality:  ""The virus decides"" how quickly we are going to get back to normal, if there will ever be such as thing after the clouds clear on the other side of this.

We won't be able to move in front of this virus until we respect its power:  its power to morph, shape shift itself as it is currently doing through new variants, necessitating the need for scientists to adjust the use of some vaccines/remedies accordingly, or to render other aids as largely useless. 

It is like the first lesson of a 12-step program, the admission that we are powerless over something that has consumed our lives.  Notwithstanding the remarkable achievements of the scientific community to fight it and the new ways of mankind to protect ourselves, we must still keep our heads down.  We have paid an unthinkable price of 500,000 plus  lost and countless millions who will forever mourn them. 

In the end the virus decides.  The virus is the clock."
2021-02-23 20:28:55,Really July has Douthat been talking to Trump or noted epidemiologist Peter Navarro.  Seem to recall a rosy Wall Street Journal article by Pence touting the end of the virus just before the wicked resurgence last summer.  I am okay with best guess forecast given the number of variables that make accuracy impossible.

What would anger people more - being told they can expect normalcy by Christmas, and it actually turns out to be summer, or being told to expect normalcy by summer and that turns out to be wrong?  I know which one would make me angry."
2021-02-23 20:39:54,"The emergency will end when people can both feel safe, and are safe, resuming normal activities. Quit with the arbitrary -- ""it's gotta be by summer"" -- stuff. I, and lots of people like me, won't resume normal activities, including routine economic activities, until numbers of infections are low enough for it to  be safe. Sorry to disappoint you, but face it -- you can't just dictate when this will be over."
2021-02-23 20:16:11,"Key issues include the number of people who have already developed some immunity through prior infection and the possible emergence of new variants.
Most likely, the number of people who have been infected with COVID greatly exceeds the official number of ~29 million. The true number could be as high as 100 million. Moreover, about 60 million people will probably have been vaccinated (at least 1 dose) by the end of March. If these people have robust immunity for a year or more, then the incidence of new cases should continue with a generally downward trend.
Conversely, new virus variants  may be somewhat resistant to the current vaccines and to natural immunity. This could push us in the wrong direction, big time.
Douthat is, however, quite correct that COVID restrictions are causing major economic and psychological damage, not to mention a severe adverse impact on education. Further, lots of people are extremely sick of many widespread restrictions. I have no objection to masks, but lack of movie theaters, indoor dining, and restrictions on shopping are very annoying. There are limits on how long the United States can keep up the restrictions we have endured for the last 11 months."
2021-02-23 13:13:44,"Michael Osterholm PhD said recently we are headed towards our “darkest days” of the pandemic due to the variants of Covid 19. Dr. Osterholm has been right about this pandemic since the earliest days. Remember when we were watching the bodies pile up in Italy? Well, the same thing just happened in England with the variant. 
I’m sticking with the scientists who know what they’re talking about."
2021-02-23 20:44:52,"As a café owner (diminished to a takeout window), I am justifiably anxious to see the the pandemic end. I received my first inoculation; the second one is due in two weeks. I have also been told that, in spite of my being immune by the second shot, I have to wear a mask during working hours. The whole thing is getting to be a real nightmare, one that I don't wish to repeat. I haven't heard any confident voices from our government on when it will all end.

Mask wearing and social distancing have inched closer to political correctness than preventative measures. People alone in parks, or at a distance from people in the out-of-doors, wear them as an expression of solidarity to the political woke. Some double or triple layer them,which makes them appear worse than an Egyptian mummy. The gloves, hand disinfectant, and takeout containers are all getting to be signs of environmental disaster. It is the dark ages, at about 1346 CE. all over again.

I have some concerns on the way America has responded to COVID. The worst of it is the unfairness to essential low income workers. Every time you bite into an apple, think of the poor migrant that could not work from home."

If you want to live afraid in your basement that's your choice...stop thrusting that onto me.  You love masks?  Wear two, one for me and one for you. Get yourself an N95 and the mask shaming of ""you wear yours for me and I wear mine for you"" can end.  Life is about CHOICE, FREEDOM and PERSONAL responsibility. Now that the vaccine has arrived and there is the ability to purchase N95 and KN-95 masks you can now officially not concern yourself with my own personal choices and make your OWN choice to not participate in daily life/ return to normal.  It's not my job or anyone else's to make you ""feel safe/better"".  -Antibody positive/ fed up individual."
2021-02-23 12:59:49,"Last year, summer looked rosy.  Infections were going down, people were having BBQ's in the backyard.  People dared to get married with friends present.  Life seemed on the mend.  Then Bam!!! Wave two and Wave 3 came.  I think Ross is engaging in wishful thinking, much like many did last summer.  Frankly, I think President Biden and Dr Fauci wold love to engage in the same and paint an optimistic view.  It is their job to resist the temptation, be honest with us, and state facts as they see them.  Their job is not to make us feel good."
2021-02-23 18:14:16,"When I got vaccinated I was given a card with a date and a sticker that verified I was inoculated. Biden and Fauci should be  telling people that they can go to work, school, the gym, a bar, or on vacation, maskless and without social distancing, provided they have that card on their person. Sure, some people will fake it (though anyone who would probably hasn't been following guidelines throughout the last year anyway) but most will simply use such a policy as motivation to get vaccinated. 

The constant underpromise-and-overdeliver-ing from the Biden administration has been discouraging because they haven't been ""promising"" much of anything at all. If people are told that by next Christmas, when all of the vulnerable population and most of the rest are vaccinated, we still won't be ""back to normal,"" why get the shot at all?"
2021-02-23 20:47:02,"Emergency management is winding down in my county, state and around the country.  It looks as though emergency management in terms of managing the spread of the Covid-19 disease may be only a memory by July 4.

Then there is that part of emergency management dealing with the economic disruptions.  Those emergency management plans will continue through at least the First Quarter of 2022.  The pandemic has disrupted the livelihoods and lives of millions who have never been infected but still need help.

The distinction between the medical emergency and the economic emergency gets lost when we speak only of ending the emergency.

The pandemic has affected everyone differently.  Some of us are eager to resume our pre-Covid lifestyle.  Others not so much. Before the restaurants, bars and barbershops were shut down by emergency orders, many reported revenue losses of 50 to 80% because people were staying home.

Many of us had imposed emergency restrictions on our own lives before government imposed emergency.  And many will not lift their self-imposed restrictions just because government ends its emergency restrictions."
2021-02-23 18:58:32,"Russ,
Do you understand that ending the pandemic emergency depends on community behavior not some wand waved by the government? And that so far Americans collectively have behaved rather badly? Everyone must do their part for things to “normalize”. The political insanity needs to end. There is no place in this country where people should feel free to go without masks in public. The fact that some governors refuse to acknowledge that is screwing the whole country."
2021-02-23 17:23:54,"Mr. Douthat, your case is reasonable as far as it goes, but you seem to forget that we don’t know what we don’t know: for example, we don’t even know how long the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines remain efficacious; we don’t know how many subsequent iterations of the disease there will be, and how well, if at all, the current vaccines can thwart them; whether subsequent strains might prove as dangerous to the vaccinated as the unvaccinated—and the list can be prolonged. Do these circumstances suck? Of course. I haven’t hugged my parents in a year. I miss my friends. But I cannot fathom how separation and patience and the chance at a reunion that is genuinely safe enough for an actual expert like Dr. Fauci to say so, is preferable to heightening anyone’s risk of sickness and death. 

Americans like to crow about toughness. We fancy ourselves to be like our truck ads. US strong, or some such thing. But this pandemic has revealed how weak and pampered too many of us are (I mean, of course, those of us privileged enough to have a choice about social distancing, etc.—not heroes like our healthcare workers, or those hapless victims of everything American, our poor). These, too, are the times that try [people’s] souls. Let’s see this through with courage and caution: festina lente, as the old saying goes."
2021-02-23 18:52:18,"My fear is government inertia. 
Think of the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan; once we were committed the presidents involved ""couldn't"" get out. Their political instincts told them that they would be blamed for everything that happened after our troops left. So we continued to spend lives and resources in a hopeless, irrelevant and useless cause. The Legislatures followed in lock-step; checks and balances be damned!
In the same way the Governors of each State will be unable to relax the restrictions, regardless of the actual numbers. This because of the fear that every subsequent death (and there will be more deaths) will be followed by a headline of ""He/She killed my Grandma!""
As long as the legislatures act in lockstep with the Governors, masking and distancing and remote learning will be part of our society.
Eventually, just like the wars, a new generation will decide they have other things to worry about and will stop paying any attention. Only then will the Governors be ""able"" to do the right thing; that's 10 or 15 years from now. 
Just like the wars."
2021-02-23 20:52:36,"Ross, I hope you're right about resuming near-normal life this summer instead of at the end of the year.  But may I remind you of the times doctors gave us prescriptions that we were required to complete even though the symptoms vanished before the medicine ran out.  We felt fine, so why bother taking the rest of the prescription?  We've all done it just to get a relapse - not always, but do you want to risk another year or more of a lockdown?"
2021-02-23 20:53:36,"Does anybody remember the summer of 2020 when Pence wrote an Op Ed in the Wall Street Journal decreeing that the pandemic was nearing its end?  It didn't seem all that unreasonable given that cases seemed to be going down.  

Of course, back then there were these pesky experts warning about a second wave inevitably coming, but aside from the fact that these so called ""experts"" have spent their lives and careers studying and understanding these phenomena, what knowledge did they have that couldn't be gleaned simply by looking at the infection rate curve going downward, and believing (without any real proof) that more people were asymptomatically infected than being reported?

We should have listened to the experts back then - they were right.  And we still should.  Don't listen or be swayed by Ross whose thoughts on this are, well, just thoughts, not scientific reasoning."
2021-02-23 20:55:50,"It really doesn't take much to understand that if the S. African and Brazilian variants significantly reduces protection by the current vaccines, they will NOT BE SUFFICIENT to reach herd immunity.

If we vaccinate 100% of the population (not happening) and the vaccines are only 50-60% effective vs S. African/Brazilian (also new UK variant with E484K mutation), we WILL NOT BE ABLE to reach herd immunity without a booster.

Caution is warranted, and Dr. Fauci is erring on the side of caution. CORRECTLY."
2021-02-23 18:24:28,"If you really would like to help, how about telling people to mask up, wash their hands, and stay the heck away from people as much as possible until this thing is ACTUALLY over, and not trying to get back to normal as soon as things look like they are starting to change?  

The beginning of a recovery is not a recovery.  It is a beginning.  See it through and finish it, or we will just go back to more spikes in cases, more super spreading situations, and more death.  And yes, there will be more economic hardship, as if that is comparable to death.  (It isn't)"
2021-02-23 18:21:34,"This is completely ridiculous ... this demanding that a specific date when all this will be over be established.  
Why did Mr. Douthat even bother to write this childish article?"
2021-02-23 21:03:13,"I don't believe that federal, state and local governments want to maintain restrictions on commerce and personal freedoms one day longer than it is necessary to reduce the spread and lethality of this corona virus to that of a seasonal flu. It is not in the re-election interests of politicians to do so. I would venture to guess that Mr. Douthat does not know whether this will occur by this summer, by this Christmas or sometime later."
2021-02-23 21:04:26,"The COVID emergency is ongoing for our health care workers.  Doctors, nurses and others are completely exhausted and stressed.  They have not had any normalcy for months.

We must continue masking, social distance, not meeting inside in groups and more to protect our health care workers.  How much longer can we expect them to work these long hours under this tremendous stress without breaking down?"
2021-02-23 21:06:29,"It would seem wise and prudent to overextend the pandemic protocols rather than shorten them. The history of the virus over the last 12 months has shown this to be true.

We really need to be mindful of the term, ""herd immunity."" It is a statistically derived number. Many communities, especially those that show resistance to taking the virus, could continue to see the staggering and deadly effects from the virus while the country as a whole has reached herd immunity.

Lastly, we will continue to see mutations of the virus, some more deadly, especially in those countries that have minimal vaccine programs and the virus is allowed to flow unabated by vaccine programs. Those mutations will not likely be contained in one area, but spread worldwide."
2021-02-23 21:03:03,"It seems that everything Biden is doing is based on the opposite of Trump.  Covid included.  Presidents like FDR, JFK and, I pause to say, Bill Clinton, would have taken true executive leadership over a crisis and been square with the American people. 

That we blame the number of deaths on Trump not wearing a mask or something narrow-minded from Fauci just exposes the leadership vacuum.  Unfortunately, Biden’s being more of a sentimental mourner in chief (which is valuable too) than the leader we need to move us up and out of the pandemic period."
2021-02-23 20:46:06,"Ross, you’re free to believe the COVID emergency is over today. However, until a majority of professional public health experts agree that the COVID emergency is over, please try to make an effort to stay least six feet away from me if we should ever meet by chance in a public space. Although my health may not be important to you, it’s very important to me. Thanks."
2021-02-23 21:14:56,"""We don’t close schools for the Epstein-Barr virus, despite its link to chronic fatigue syndrome, or expect New England state parks to shut down all spring and summer because of the risk that Lyme disease turns chronic.""

Both aren't contagious."
2021-02-23 21:20:18,"Reality is that no one has put a real cost on the lockdowns, especially those putting businesses and people into duress."
2021-02-23 21:23:54,"I plan to continue wearing a mask in certain conditions even after Covid is tamed,perhaps by late summer, perhaps by Christmas. Whenever. I have not been sick at all this season, and I attribute that in large part to wearing the mask. It's no big deal to wear one. I hope others do too."
2021-02-23 21:15:51,"Take a breath Mr. Douthat. What is going to matter are realities. If positivity rates drop below 1% around the country, then having talks about moving cautiously toward normalcy makes sense. The Times has Santa Fe county, where I live, at about three percent now and we are opening slowly. The Governor is prepared to put the brakes back on if rates go back up. Predicting a timeline to normalcy is a useless pursuit. To paraphrase the famous Supreme Court pronouncement on pornography: we'll know it when we see it."
2021-02-23 21:04:44,"Not surprising that we have conservatives continuing to say that the Covid emergency must end; they've been saying that since early in the pandemic, when the disruption to the national status quo worried them that their way of life might be altered, their power, wealth, and influence reduced, if only slightly and briefly. Even if they now are right after a long period of being deadly wrong (even a broken clock being right twice a day), I note something else:

It would be good to hear those same conservatives saying that hunger must end, homelessness must end, unaffordability of medical care must end, racism must end, inequality must end, unliveable wages must end, ignorance must end, legal injustice must end, abuse of power under color of law must end, political grifting must end, economic monopolies and near-monopolies must end, commercial manipulation of consumer demand must end, national economic gains overwhelmingly going to the already-wealthy must end, environmental destruction must end...

I won't hold my breath for any of that, I know that the oxygen in my bloodstream would end long before conservatives became bothered by the consequences that inevitably flow from their self-centered ideology of unfettered capitalism coupled to hobbled, starved government."
2021-02-23 21:09:23,"So Ross has decided to jump on the Fauci-is-lying-to-us bandwagon and preach ""optimism?"" The so-called ""optimists"" last spring claimed the death toll wouldn't even pass 10,000, that closing restaurants to indoor dining wouldn't be necessary, that the epidemic will magically go away when the weather got warm, and that scientists like Fauci were being ""pessimistic."" 

Now half a million are dead. But Ross and the other ""optimists"" are calling Fauci and other epidemiologists liars again. Or, excuse me, ""pessimistic.""  

It's like the Dunning-Kruger effect in action. The people who have no idea what they are talking about never stop and think, ""gosh, maybe I should just listen to the professionals for once."" They just keep talking, and talking, and talking..."
2021-02-23 21:10:07,"Good gracious, how did Americans ever get through food and gas rationing during the years of WWII?! What has turned us into such a bunch of namby-pambies who can't put up with some mask-wearing (the populations of other countries do this without a second thought) and social distancing in order to protect one another?! Yes, this has hurt so many economically, mentally, educationally, but hasn't the experience of last Summer's reopening taught us anything? Can we not wait to see what the situation actually is before we start mouthing off about when in the future we'll be able to start putting things back together? Perhaps Mr. Douthat should start an office or online pool (like the managers at a Tyson plant did early in the Spring about how many of their worked would come down with COVID-19) about when certain restrictions will be lifted for good. He could make it a state by state thing, although we already know how certain states will go. How smart will it look if Douthat is wrong about July 4 reopening, and does he really think Biden and Fauci will recommend keeping restrictions in place if all is hunky-dory?"
2021-02-23 21:29:31,"Seriously, Ross?  We just passed 500K deaths, as you note.  We are heading down to a trough.  Whether we stay there is VERY uncertain, and given the new variants and the low percentage of the population that have actually received a vaccine, prudence requires caution and maintaining our guard.  We may swing up yet again.     As a physician myself, I would never say to a patient “it looks like you're in remission, so you can abandon all of the precautions that you were taking before."" Similarly we cannot say that to the population yet, if ever. Learn to live with it, Ross. We may have to make permanent adjustments to our lifestyle to cope with an endemic fatal disease."

 I think I’ll probably be safe, so if another half million die, I’m willing to accept that. 
I think hat would be reasonable."
2021-02-23 20:43:04,"I just want a solid answer regarding the South African and UK variants.  If they are so contagious, why have cases in those countries fallen off a cliff?"
2021-02-23 21:31:11,"As a retired physician I have read all of the data from the clinical studies on the vaccines and data gained from people who are antibody positive from prior infection.
I strongly feel that the as we gain experience from the mass immunizations chances are very, very high that vaccinated people are very safe and do not transmit the virus and we will know that by summer.
And the truth will set us free.
Fauci does not want Biden to be in the position that Trump put himself in with false promises, magical thinking and just lies.
Douthat does not seem to understand that what physicians and all scientists say is always with the caveat that when we have more data we may change what we say.
Fauci and Biden to not claim as the Pope might to speak ex cathedra and to be infallible.
Medicine is fact based, theology is myth based. 
Douthat lives in the myth based world."
2021-02-23 21:34:06,"Where Fauci differs from you is that he's a scientist, and a leading expert in epidemiology.  He might see an optimistic future with respect to Covid-19, IF its variants don't vary too far.  But he knows that we live in a world where the next pandemic might be only a few years away.  So he knows we won't be going back to ""normalcy"".

Where Biden differs from you is, apparently, that he better remembers his Churchill.  When you're at the beginning of a long struggle, you don't paint happy pictures of how it will all be over soon.  You talk about shared sacrifice and why we're going to win in the long run.

Where both differ, I suspect, is in remembering that Covid-19 is probably a minor event - a canary in the coal mine - prefacing a century or more of struggle to address humankind's rather unsatisfactory relationship with the planet we live on.  Both this virus and the next one - and the Texas blizzard and the West Coast's next wildfire - will be part of a long, hard slog toward an uncertain future.

In short, both leaders know that - for all our whiny  adolescent narcissism - we will never, ever return to anything we think of as ""normalcy"".

And, by the way Mr. Harding, the word is  ""normality"""
2021-02-23 21:35:22,"I think Douthat's view that there could be a return to normal by summer is a bit optimistic and not based on the science.  Many of us won't even be able to get the vaccine before then.  I do share the view that there needs to be a cost/benefit analysis which weighs the risk of infection vs. the harm to the economy and mental health.  If we can get the vulnerable and front line workers vaccinated, then it becomes more like influenza risk.  Once we are there based on facts (not speculation) then we should discuss opening up based on the costs/benefits of doing so."
2021-02-23 21:36:30,"Nobody tells a fire that it is time to end until the flames are out. If the blaze gets hot enough, you learn that it is still too combustible to tread on once the flames are out until the heat is gone. If you want to rebuild on the wreckage, you would be wise not to do so until the utilities are back and the toxins from the char are gone. If you want to invest in a home that will grow in value, you would not build again until it seemed safe to do so in case the next blaze is only a matter of time. We cannot rush back into things because the smoke is getting faint. That is what you are suggesting and it is deadly dangerous. We can and should rebuild, but honestly, it would be more wise to consider just how much of exactly the same habits we should really be getting back to before it happens again."
2021-02-23 20:33:09,"So let us not listen to the expert but a right-wing pundit with a national platform.

2021-02-23 21:15:26,"In an important way, neither Biden nor the much accomplished and respected Dr. Fauci's opinions matter much more than anyone else's. Why? We are in uncharted territory and we have been for more than a year. The sooner we accept the idea that no one really knows and that we have to live with uncertainty, the better. Aside from the hard science emerging about the virus, we are in uncharted territory and have been for more than a yr.

I've been reading the tea leaves, and looking at the stats and trends and I, too, see reason for optimism. Here are three main points: acquired immunity from having had the disease (with or without symptoms), the protection of the shot or shots and, last, the statement by the CDC that double masking can stop over 90% of the spread. Even if the last skips over the fact that most often the virus spreads at home where people don't wear masks, there is still reason for optimism. We have the tools in our hands.

I posted my take on this not long ago on Substack:

<a href=""https://dougterry.substack.com/p/good-news-coming-from-the-bad-on"" target=""_blank"">https://dougterry.substack.com/p/good-news-coming-from-the-bad-on</a>

Fauci and Biden have an interest in keeping people worried, like forecasters predicting how strong a hurricane will be. They don't want us to ""let down our guard"" before the all clear is issued.

My bet: the all clear will NEVER be issued. We, citizens all, will have to declare it and get on with our lives, taking risks and doing the best we can. Yet, like Biden and Fauci, I also say: be careful. This thing is far from over."
2021-02-23 21:24:50,"No. We were lied to by Trump, Pence, McEnany, and Surgeon General Adams for the entire time they were in charge of Covid. I’m not about to trust anyone else telling me not to worry, just get out there and do this or that, I’m being paranoid...

And I’ve really had it up to HERE with all these obvious right-wing, pro-Trump groups masquerading as parent/student advocacy groups demanding the schools or businesses reopen and start carrying on about kids mental health and addictions. While I don’t doubt the pandemic has taken it’s toll on some people’s mental health and/or addictions, I find it strangely curious that right-wing republicans are suddenly taking interest in this. Sounds like a passive-aggressive way to imply democrat Covid restriction enforcement caused people to commit suicide and take drugs. How pathetic. This is why I have zero respect for people like Ted Cruz and Sarah Sanders."

One of my children is high-risk for complications from Covid. There is no vaccine available for him, nor will there be one any time soon, probably not until 2022. Plenty of kids have given up a lot to protect older folks. Now it's time for adults to step up and protect those kids that are still at risk. People who don't get a vaccine will be putting my child at risk. People who stop wearing masks will be putting my child at risk. People who have large indoor parties will be putting my child at risk."
2021-02-23 21:41:43,"Can we ask what the data says rather than how we feel about it? What does science say? What does the modeling say based on various scenarios? We have Germany experience a second wave. We have people who refuse to be vaccinated. 

We can be praying but it  doesn’t help conjure up data. Data is what it is. It is time we correct the course on rational thinking to pave the way out of the pandemic or the climate crisis. We have been duped by the government with the wrong heads on policies and implementation. For once, there is some coherence on what we know and don’t know on science."

Maybe, if it outweighs the years of life lost from the shutdown. Robbing a generation of education, creating mass unemployment, and the mental health consequences of prolonged isolation kill people too both directly and by lowering life expectancies. I haven't seen an analysis of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lost from the shutdown, but wouldn't be surprised if as many life years have been lost from the shutdown as from the disease."

I'm not vested with authority or expertise either, but last January, when my family members were returning from SE Asia, I predicted in writing the horrible disaster the United States was about to inflict upon itself. 

Airports in Thailand, Korea, Japan--airport officials wearing masks, gloves, using sanitizer. Temperature checks on all passengers before boarding. Constant spraying and cleaning of tables, luggage carriers, etc. Full awareness that we were at the potential beginning of a pandemic. 

Arrival at JFK: no masks, no sanitizer, no gloves, passengers required to use touch screens to enter their data--like a factory for passing the virus around. Deadly oblivion.
 
A year later, Thailand, population about 70 million. Deaths from Covid-19, 83. That is correct: equivalent to fewer than 400 deaths in the USA.

Ross, if you can read the trendlines and studies, where were you a year ago, before the United States had committed what is essentially a form of suicide/homicide on ourselves?

I didn't like having to get an ""authorized"" but not ""approved"" vaccine--but I took it. We don't know yet what will happen to Covid long-haulers, nor how many of them there will be. I'll cooperate.

""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" DJT; Feb. 2, 2020

""Looks like by April, you know in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away."" DJT; Feb. 10, 2020.

""The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero."" DJT; Feb. 26, 2020.

""We're going very substantially down, not up."" DJT; Feb. 26, 2020.

""This is a flu. This is like a flu."" DJT; Feb. 26, 2020.

One year later, over a half a million Americans are dead. Covid is not like the flu, and Covid has nothing in common with Lyme's; it’s a blood borne bacterial infection treatable with antibiotics. Still, you better believe if nearly 30 million Americans were infected with Lyme's in a year, over 500,000 of them died, and 10 million had permanent organ damage, we'd close the parks.

You'll have to excuse me if I choose to listen to President Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci; you and DJT forfeited the right to advise us."
2021-02-23 21:59:14,"President Biden should do nothing of the sort. Conservatives, bitter that their narrative of a second post-Reagan tax-cut fueled economic miracle was stolen from them by an act of God (who must be liberal), are still trying to wish this biblical plague away. No, Mr. Biden is not trying to manipulate the public for maximum political gain. He’s just acting as a responsible president should act. America bungled The Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020 triggering the most deadly American crisis in a century because for the past forty years our government has embraced the political philosophy of the popular Former President Ronald Reagan, the upward redistribution of wealth and an irrationally austere approach to societal problem-solving and social spending. This is why America, the richest and most powerful nation on Earth, leads the world in infections and deaths despite having access to the science and the resources to have controlled this microbe. Addressing public health crises affecting millions of commoners is just no longer something our government can competently do any longer because it’s been out of practice for so long."
2021-02-23 21:59:53,"""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies""-Douthat.

Yes indeed.  I would just as soon give more credence to a New York Times columnist over Dr. Fauci, than I would give credence  to the Former Guy.  

If nothing else, it will be months before this country reaches herd immunity.  By then prognostications may be more trustworthy."
2021-02-23 22:02:11,"I very strongly recommend taking it one minute at a time, every minute of every day, until we arrive at a place where we are certain this is over. That means we'll be looking at the end of the pandemic in the rear view mirror when we realize we went right past it.

Otherwise, all the trend lines and vaccine studies will only serve to ""prove"" to people such as yourself that we're ""past it,"" which will only serve to prolong the pandemic.

A measured, reasonable response is required, but with the understanding that we will not know we are past it until we are well past it."

2021-02-23 22:06:54,"The message should be that a lot depends on the actions of individuals. Yes, it's true that we must all wait for vaccine to become available. However, in the meantime we must continue wearing masks, washing our hands, and adhering to social-distancing guidelines. And when we're able to get vaccinated we should do so. The more people who fail to follow this approach, the longer this pandemic will drag on."
2021-02-23 22:09:10,"Here' the thing, this is entirely new, we have some good research, but the reality is Nature in  control, not us.

As the impatient Nation that we are, we expect perfect answers fast.  We need to continue to be patient, at least those of us who never believed it was a hoax and have done what was asked for us.  Mask up, socially distance, do not hang out in a closed room with a bunch of people.
This is not rocket science it is cautionary.

Even the health care people are still learning as they go."
2021-02-23 22:13:50,"I’m pretty liberal...and I’m a scientist...and I think some of you folks are being awfully dogmatic about this. Many of the comments here are in favor of “following the science,” but while scientific literacy is a necessary condition for opining on the subject, science alone cannot make the choices we need to make. I focus on two things: (1) hospital resources, and (2) the elderly and vulnerable. These were the main reasons for not pursuing herd immunity & allowing covid to spread unchecked. Vaccinations appear to prevent people from developing serious illnesses that would require hospitalization. They can protect the elderly, and slow the spread so that hospitals won’t get overwhelmed. If they turn out to be effective, why should we keep the restrictions in place? Why shouldn’t we celebrate that?

Will there still be new covid cases in the post-vaccine world? Hospitalizations? Deaths? Absolutely. But the vaccine changes the calculation. That’s the whole reason we invested in the vaccine in the first place! (For comparison, a bad flu season in the US sees ~60,000 deaths.) I’m not saying we should give up on the mitigation measures just because we’re bored of the pandemic. No, something has changed: a vaccine is becoming available. With something as game-changing as a vaccine, shouldn’t we take stock and re-evaluate, and take yes for an answer?"
2021-02-23 22:22:43,"It's a conservative value not to be too rosy in one's predictions. I remember when liberals were criticized for trying to see the world through ""rose-colored glasses.""

Imagine how disgruntled and uncompliant they might be if they are promised fireworks on the 4th and we get a new strain? Best to be conservative. That's why I wear a mask, even though some grouchy man challenged me about it: I'm a conservative. We try to prepare for the worst."
2021-02-23 22:29:23,"If the restrictions are not going to be lifted, what's the point of getting vaccinated? If life before the vaccines is going to be the same as life after the vaccines, why would anyone bother?

After a year of moving goalposts, why would we expect this to stop with vaccinations? This was never about public health and safety. From what I can tell, it was maybe four main things:

1) Forced imposition of the preferences of the most risk averse ~10% of the population on the rest of us
2) Attention seeking and opportunism by our ""expert"" class to promote themselves among their peers and on social media with media friendly hot-takes backed by poor science
3) A classic example of the ""we have to do something"" line of politics rearing its ugly head (not that we should have done nothing, but let's just say the cost/benefit analysis wasn't exactly well thought out, if done at all)
4) A power grab by our already overly empowered executive branches

None of the above has a thing to do with vaccinations, hence the lack of willingness to change. 
Sending the message that the restrictions will never end is counterproductive and dangerous.

At the end of the day, implementing and/or arguing for the most strict and invasive measures does NOT give someone a monopoly on concern for public health.
As a society, we whiffed on that during this pandemic when it comes to our dialogue."

""Obtain""?  Pertain?  In any event, this is a very vague definition of a national condition, especially given the diversity, economically, racially and geographically, of our country.
So what is the equation that justifies the cost of emergency measures?  And what cost?  Financial, social, familial?
We were ""led"" by a science denying fraud, whose ignorance and lies contributed, in very large part, to the damage Covid-19 has done to us.  We are the worst nation on the planet, when it comes to per capita deaths and infections from Covid-19.  We reacted too late, too ineffectively, and too little, in may ways and areas.
We must continue as we are until ""herd immunity"" can be clearly seen.  But that means hard metrics, not exasperated complaints."

When people feel safer activity will begin to return, but many, especially, older people will proceed slowly until they feel safe. Just like the sun coming out someday,  eventually, experts expect life to return to normal. Unlike you, I figure I have one shot at life and am in no rush to have it end any sooner than necessary."

2021-02-23 22:37:41,"Mr. Douthat may have missed the press release that Trump is no longer president. So it really doesn't matter what he said about July. It is now on Biden and Trump gave him two vaccines that began distribution mid December plus a distribution process which Biden acknowledged. If we continue to give vaccines at this rate, just about everyone in the U.S will have the opportunity to have received at least one shot. But to be fully immunized, it could take well into 2022.This is like a war and plans go out the window when you meet the enemy. Covid 19 has shown that variants are a constant new threat,  Today it was reported a much more contagious variant is in California. We  may have a better idea by July. But we do not control of the rest of the 7.7 billion people on the planet. Biden is also planning on let a whole lot of people from below the border come in and has not defined any test to assure us they will be corvid free. That is the requirement for the rest of the world including returning citizens. So, to make plans to open everything up by July, would be premature and reckless."
2021-02-23 22:42:32,"The COVID emergency response was more political and media madness than real. In the absence of a vaccine a year ago and with shortages of proper masks, sanitizers and antivirals, the response by governors was irrational and as we now find out that it borders on being criminal.

Now that we have vaccines being administered at WARP speed, we can achieve normalcy but with still following the CDC safety guidelines but with no more business shut downs or lock downs."
2021-02-23 22:44:20,"Mr. Douthat, your ""maybe Fourth of July"" conclusion does not follow from anything you wrote above it.  ""Maybe"" could be lots of dates.  I see no good reason to promise and lots of reasons not to. People are not likely to be ""understanding"" of undue optimism."
2021-02-23 22:44:38,"I firmly agree with this op-ed. I think most Americans are eager to both be safe in the short-term (masking until vaccines are widespread, etc), while also realizing that herd-immunity or at least something reflecting that will be upon us this year. I think it's also worth noting that Fauci is NOT the only voice on covid, but was elevated to godlike status by the media because of his sensible counterpoints to Trump's lunacy. Now that Trump is gone, I suggest people follow other epidemiologists to hear a variety of opinions from experts, including twitter accounts from Dr. Topol, Dr. Rasmussen, Dr. Gottlieb, etc. They don't always agree, and that's part of the fun of science (and really any academic profession): the devil is in the details. I find my mental health and anxiety much decreased when I read studies on vaccine effectiveness, listen to a variety of trusted medical sources, and refuse to 'bend the knee' to doom-bearing News headlines."
2021-02-23 22:49:58,"In 2019 I had the flu, pneumonia, bronchitis, and a car accident. In 2020 I had none of the above. I’m not excited about being in crowded places mask free after the pandemic."
2021-02-23 22:57:00,"If there is no perk to getting vaccinated, how do you convince people at low risk of death from Covid to get vaccinated? How do you convince the hesitant -- let alone the deniers?

You're going to need (eventually) to get young, healthy people on board with getting vaccinated. You're going to need to win over the skeptics and the hesitant.

And you can do this by opening up social connections and some semblance of normalcy to those who've had the vaccine.

I mean, sure, mask up in public. Limit gathering sizes. But if we don't allow some perks for the vaccinated, we're never going to *get* to herd immunity. We'll be stuck in the chicken or egg forever."

Doing too much, too soon has already resulted in too many cases and deaths in the US.
I'd rather change what we do after we see if it is time to do so. I don't want to drop my guard on a prediction.
We're all sick of restrictions and requirements, but Biden and Fauci didn't say we cannot cancel them until December, just that it could take that long. 
Every time we've make assumptions and predictions about this virus, it came back and made them wrong. Let's not do it again."

No Ross.  More infections means more death.  

More infections means more overwhelmed hospitals and more overstressed medical professionals. 

Herd immunity, and if and when we can achieve it, will be on the terms set by the virus. Not by you or anyone else. 

The virus has been in control of this country for a year, and it isn't going away anytime soon.

Time for people to accept that reality."

2021-02-23 23:09:26,"The probable eventual herd immunity is a useful strawman model of where we will be. However, even with that, people will still catch Covid and some will die, so it's not immunity on a personal level. It's deceptive to call it immunity until the fraction of protected people is quite high. Is herd resistance or herd protection better? The economy allowing, can we please err on the side of caution, so we don't need to do this one more time next year? I think the use of the epidemiological language by the general public can cause misunderstandings and poor decisions."
2021-02-23 23:12:23,"I frequently disagree with Ross. No surprise here is another disagreement. 500,000 Americans have died. While there is a reason for optimism, there is no reason to abandon caution now.  The virus doesn’t care bout humanity. It exists to reproduce. Humans are just the vessel for that reproduction.  We can make the choice to be that vessel or make the choice to exert caution.  Put out the fire completely so it doesn’t flair up again. As Smokey the Bear said, “Only you can prevent forest fires!”."
2021-02-23 23:20:13,"Let's not forget:  Had Trump taken the looming pandemic seriously a year ago, and shown some presidential leadership, we likely would have had a couple of hundred thousand less deaths and things would have been far far closer to ""achieving normalcy"" than we are now."
2021-02-23 23:26:12,"There's a great deal of reasonable speculation about brighter possibilities here, but at bottom this is just another ""Stamp Your Feet And Make It So"" argument that feeds COVID restriction resistance among those happy to let others sicken and die, while assuming they and theirs will not. That's the kind of thing that got us where we are today: by far the wealthiest  country in the world with the 8th highest death rate per capita.

Biden and infectious disease experts are not rushing to ""embrace the possibility"" of an earlier than predicted return to some kind of normalcy precisely because they are acting responsibly to encourage the kind of public behavior required to get us there. Douthat is not. He's doing a Trump-lite, suggesting that restless Americans' real problem might just be or soon be pessimistic, fearful bureaucrats and those selfish experts, intent on perpetuating their own authority."

If the US had that same death rate amongst its population, we would be looking at around  14,000 deaths right now. Instead, we have, as you know, over half a million deaths. Not only is that the highest absolute number of deaths, it's the highest RATE of deaths of any developed country on the planet, exceeding even the notorious Covid-denying  countries like Russia and Brazil.

But much more important, most of the world will be far behind vaccinating in a global economy. So much for visiting 2/3 of the world.

The recession and Covid microinflations will still be rampant. Airlines will be half empty. A vax/no vax Aparteid will emerge increasingly across society, as Israel is already planning. Which unvaccinated folks will you invite for Halloween? Trick or Treat!

While I have appreciated the responsible and even cautious approach of the media after, say, mid-March, one thing it has blown repeatedly is fail to convey the realities of how the virus works ... and doesn't work. 

In short, unless you are in a large, mostly unmoving crowd, or speaking up close to an infected individual, for a considerable period of time (CDC suggests 15 minutes for the latter), you are *not* going to contract or transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus outside. There is no evidence that this is even a small possibility (the one Japanese study finding that 1 in 18 cases was contracted ""outdoors"" notably did not characterize or seek to examine what ""outdoors"" meant).

Our leadership dropped the ball at the beginning.  Public Health was politicized.  Personal liberty was ruled more important.

I feel success has always revolved around testing to locate the contagion and if a person was positive than isolate until they were negative.  Leadership failed.  If every one could do a simple inexpensive home test each morning and act appropriately we would not be the worst country in the world for deaths. Americans have never taken the world pandemic seriously.

In terms of going forward we need to remain positive, show patience, encourage testing and isolation if positive, wear the simple mask, vaccinate essential workers (yes teachers and grocery workers) and vulnerable first, distance, hand washing, stop the selfish behavior and help someone less fortunate than you (helps your mental health), stay connected to Public Health notices for ""hot spots.""

The ironic thing is, it is up to individual American's actions that will ultimately determine when the end is in sight.  If I never hear the term ""herd immunity"" again I would certainly have improved mental health."

The inability of the media (including influential outlets like the NY Times), to properly communicate relative risk during this pandemic has led to a collective fear based hysteria that has gotten away from us like a runaway train. By Memorial Day, everyone who wants a vaccine will have the opportunity to be vaccinated. Once that happens, hospitalizations and deaths will be closer to pre-covid levels (remember 3 million people die in the U.S. every year). Politicians will need to lift restrictions so that society can function while covid still circulates at a lower transmission among those who decline the vaccine.   There is no perfect, risk free solution, but this summer is when  the madness of ""zero covid"" absolutism has to end."

Young people including young children can be horrendously damaged by this virus.   To even suggest it can circulate among the young is short sighted, dangerous, callous and non-helpful.

""We have a right to know......""
Answer:
This is an evolving situation.  What do you not get about this being a 1 in 100year event.  There is no certainty right now, not even for those best placed to give us advice and understanding.  There is only evolving knowledge so 'best advice' and 'knowledge' are being frequently updated.

This journalist needs to seriously study the only 2 Western nations that have Covid under control, and when it does occur again, they know how to stop it again.    That's Australia and New Zealand, and it's not because they are islands.  Yesterday, in Australia, a country of 26 million people, there were 4 new cases. In New Zealand after no cases for awhile, there is a current small breakout again.  In Australia and New Zealand the economy is functioning again and children are back in schools.

What this American journalist doesn't get is until you get the virus under control the economy and schools will remain under much stress.  

It is always surprising that America, in general, looks within for answers when most of what happens in the world is outside of America.  'American Exceptionalism' will not help you with Covid.  Look outside.  There is new expertise there that you do not have innAmerica."

So my question is: doesn't this guy have an editor who might have questioned him?  Just because it's an opinion column, wasn't it clear that his was an incredibly flimsy argument?  And not for the first time?  I understand that the Times wants to have ""balance"" and that means employing voices from both the left and the right (and in between).

Microscopic life, like the coronavirus, is tenacious too. Whenever it encounters an obstacle to its existence, natural selection for advantageous traits makes sure the line continues by ducking and weaving around the obstacle.

The difference between coronavirus and Homo sapiens is that the latter are supposed have an edge the former does not enjoy: intelligence! The problem is, too many of us (especially Troglodytes and Neanderthals) are either unable or unwilling to use it.

The solition is very simple: deny the virus a host in which to thrive and mutate, and it dies. All it takes is masks, social distancing, and washing hands, all physical barriers to virus success.

Instead a persistent minority insists on redefining a public health emergency as a personal liberty issue, defies those solutions, and offer themselves as Petri dishes in which the virus is free to mutate and evade the defenses our medical professionals have worked tirelessly to develop.

With all due respect sir, E-B was and is not likely to be a pandemic in good measure due to the genetic susceptibility component of the disease. 

I don't think the folks who still diss others who wear masks, some by coughing on them and then finding that amusing, need any encouragement from intelligent people like yourself. That you think your reading of trend lines and studies is commensurate with the expertise of medically trained professionals comes of as hubris.

Dr. Fauci has been a consistent voice of reason during this entire ordeal, albeit some early misstatements will likely outlive him. I'd be more inclined to listen to him than most other sources."
2021-02-23 23:24:24,"Far from being pessimistic, Dr. Fauci has been unrealistically super optimistic.  Late last April, he predicted (with prominent headlines in the media) that the total American deaths would be less than 100,000 and probably only about 40,000.  Premature optimism, like Fauci and especially like your column, will cause even more people to start unmasking and attending group events...and the pandemic will rally on.  Your words about seniors belie the CDC statistics that someone 75 years old has a 55 times (not 55%:  55 times) greater chance of dying from Covid than someone 30-to-40 years old.  Taking a vaccine with even 95% effectiveness will not fully equalize the risk."
2021-02-23 23:57:03,"The San Francisco had a blazing headline today with the following first paragraph: ""A California-bred variant that has spread widely across much of the state since the start of the year appears to be more infectious than other versions of the coronavirus, and may also cause more serious illness and be somewhat resistant to the body’s immune response, according to two studies released Monday."" Note the key words, ""appears,"" ""may,"" ""somewhat."" One of the investigators said, ""“We don’t want to be alarmist. It’s not as aggressive as the U.K. variant.” I don't expect certitude from the science. I don't believe in conspiracy theories either. So really, we need some reasonable decisions from the people we voted for."
2021-02-23 23:54:45,"If we needed any further proof that Mr Douthat is what the late John McCain would call a wacko bird, this column proves it. 

He’s never run anything except his mouth, never held any position where lives depended on his judgement, and has consistently undervalued leadership. 

Doesn’t not deserve the space provided by this newspaper."
2021-02-23 23:51:08,Your optimism is also infectious Ross but just in case keep drinking bleach. Everything will be fine by last Easter.
2021-02-23 23:50:42,"If you don’t use evidence to support your argument, why should Biden?  After a year of deadly lies, and resistance to public health measures, it’s good to have officials who are frank about uncertainty.  Of course you AND Biden should use numerical evidence.  But he and Fauci actually do.  And the know it’s complicated.  You on the other hand don’t seem to be able to trust people with nuanced information.  Sounds all too sadly familiar."
2021-02-23 14:18:46,"The weakness and selfishness of Americans have proven that they will abuse any good news for their own self interest at the cost of killing others. The equation of visiting relatives for Christmas vs killing a few older at risk people was, for many, easy to justify. They can't be trusted. 

Compare ourselves to previous generations in WWII, the Depression, Dust Bowl... It is pathetic. Or was that all a hyped up mythology? Now it's easy to imagine how Americans respond to changes from climate change - everyone for themselves, the rich vs poor, ineffective politicians, angry uneducated white dudes ready to suck up any stupid idea about who to blame. So what if the Russian's can hack our power grid, we can blow it ourselves."
2021-02-24 00:05:06,"Trump promised it would all be over by last Easter.  I can do without promises or predictions from those who aren't disease specialists and have other agendas beyond the public health interest, and that includes pundits. If the medical professionals -- and politicians who heed their advice -- urge caution, I'm inclined to listen."
2021-02-24 00:02:19,"The Covid emergency must end? Can he get the virus to listen?Given his religiosity, perhaps Douthat's time might be better spent searching for some of the humility we need in the face of this still evolving and not yet completely understood biological disaster."
2021-02-23 23:57:19,"I am glad that Mr. Douthat ""can read trend lines and vaccine studies.""  I have read scientific papers on medical conditions my wife suffers from, and I have found it about as easy as translating any language I can't read into English that I can.  Good for you, Mr. Douthat!  Nevertheless, I will stick with Dr. Fauci. Last year, around this time, he said that a vaccine would be developed sometime before Christmas, 2020.  He was right on the money.  Then he added that a vaccine would probably become generally available in April 2021.  That seems on target, too.   He made these predictions a year ago. Both of them.  What seems to have gotten the knickers of most Republicans in a twist --- from a livid Meaghan McCain, who wants Fauci fired, to the more reasonable Ross Douthat --- is the good doctor's reluctance to say, ""Don't worry, dears, it will be all right when you say you want it to be all right.""  I heard what Fauci said on CNN. He clearly stated he would not give a personal opinion, but that the CDC would soon give an official opinion on what Mr. Douthat is complaining about. This issue is a tempest in a teapot good for only a hissy from Meagan McCain and a screed from that ace medical report reader, Ross Douthat."
2021-02-24 00:05:16,"What a piece of work to celebrate the grim day announcing 500,000 deaths. Everything’s coming up roses!

What on earth is wrong with Douthat? Is he channeling Trump?"
2021-02-24 00:06:42,"A perfect example why NY Times op-ed writers should not be making medical decisions.

The tactic in conservative circles right now is to  morph Biden and his cautions on the pandemic into  Jimmy Carter's infamous ""malaise"" speech from 1979 in an attempt to set up the 2024 GOP candidate as another morning sunshine Reagan.

Here's a simple number for you, Ross:  One third of the country says it will not get the vaccine.  Since that means fewer than 70-80% will get it then how will herd immunity be achieved.

And I like the line about how more infections means more immunity.  Is Ross running for Lt. Governor of Texas and telling people they have an obligation to die?

We shut down half the economy last March.  That, and the direct costs of the pandemic combined with lost economic output is estimated at $16 trillion.

And it was all for nothing because Trump said ""we've turned the corner,"" then ""LIBERATE,"" and the flattened curve started to peak.  Then peak again from that peak until we were suffering 3 times the cases and 4 times the deaths as the first wave.

We cannot let that happen again just to soothe the sensibilities of angry conservatives  who want their country back and will try to take it any way they can.

Biden is striking the right mix of hope and caution and leaving the fake science to the My Pillow Guy and the rest of Trump's base."
2021-02-24 00:06:44,"""but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and at this moment both their takes look way too pessimistic"". Go ahead, you've got a BA from Harvard. Seriously, my daughter is an epidemiologist. I'll have her give you a call if she has a problem. Trump was a self proclaimed expert, too. ""“People are really surprised I understand this stuff,” he said. “Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability.” Yep. Get a right winger in there, ""experts"" are no longer needed. I'd be thrilled if Ross was on the same airplane I was, knowing if necessary he could land it safely."
2021-02-24 00:06:37,"The (im)morality of not getting vaccinated will never change.  These people will be the source of more mutated variants of the virus.  A few of these will be dangerous to those who already had COVID or were already vaccinated.
Get a vaccination as soon as it's your turn."
2021-02-24 00:09:26,"I received my first vaccination this afternoon and my second is scheduled for three weeks from now. My parents have been fully vaccinated. By next week about 20 percent of people in my state will have been vaccinated and another 30 to 50 percent have probably already had COVID. One expert says we probably already have herd immunity.  I’d like my life back now, not a year from now."
2021-02-24 00:28:23,"You have to weigh the continued cost of shut downs and school closings - on everyone's mental health.

How many people have died over the last year from alcohol and drug abuse? Suicide? Not going to the doctor or ER when desperately sick? Domestic violence?

It's easy for those who work from home or are in other circumstances where they can self-isolate to get all holier-than-thou about continuing lock downs for a virus that has a 99% plus survival rate.

I would venture that for most people, exercising reasonable precautions such as wearing a mask and social distancing will be just fine if governments would just re-open everything.

Florida seems to be doing great, with an unemployment rate of 6% vs. California's 9%. And just how well are continued lock downs working out for them?"
2021-02-24 00:08:58,"We may grieve for the fallen. It is important to remember the lost lives, but we also have to realize the importance of progress in the world since COVID19. 

As soon as everyone is vaccinated, we will have the biggest bull rally in the markets. We will have children who will be able to learn at home and at school. We have workers with a Swiss Army knife of online talents. We have doctors at the push of a button online. We will curve global warming because fewer people will drive combustion vehicles. Last but not least, the numbers accumulated during COVID19 will influence governments in every nation.

 Everything trickles down or might tickle up, but COVID19 will not be the century's biggest news article."
2021-02-24 00:13:36,But but . . . Fauci said we will be wearing masks through 2022.
2021-02-24 00:09:27,"You actually get paid to write ""I don't know what I'm talking about, but this is what I wish were true so I'm going to discount those who do know what they're talking about""?

What a great gig."
2021-02-24 00:18:36,Dr. Douhat? i think not. ill take my chances and wait a few more months.
2021-02-24 00:10:46,"you're against abortion, its just like abortion: let's not outlaw any abortions, just get them so low that it is obviously a last resort of women. Let's re-open when the deaths, a certain number, are acceptable. Then, make sure these deaths are not me, my family, or anyone I know."
2021-02-24 00:21:18,"Ross, I'm far more vested with Fauci's expertise than I am with your opinion. It's going to be a new normal anyway and given some of the hatred and idiocy out there staying home - while getting so tedious - sometimes seems like the best thing to do."
2021-02-24 00:11:10,"What is the situation today? Quite a reach to go after anyone for taking this too seriously. This feels like kind of attempt to manufacture discontent in your readers Ross.
Maybe we should go back to rosy predictions, the people are smart enough to know not to let up precautions right? After all that strategy has worked till now."
2021-02-24 00:07:34,I trust Biden and Fauci's 'cautious' statements. They strike me as responsible and prudent - when we had just the opposite during the previous administration.
2021-02-24 00:22:07,"I suspect Dr. Fauci also reads vaccine studies and watches trend lines. I wonder what makes him think Christmas of 2021 is when he thinks we will return to ""normal"". 

He does have more experience in infectious diseases than I do. Perhaps more than you do as well."
2021-02-24 00:17:18,Have  you and your wife been vaccinated yet?
2021-02-24 00:14:18,"Good to know Mr Douthat has figured out the proper end date for the pandemic - not certain if that is based more on anyone with a Harvard degree having an expert opinion on everything or the hubris that goes with being a NYT columnist

2021-02-24 00:31:27,"I feel so much better now that Dr. Douthat is on the case.  I was beginning to feel overwhelmed with doubt that we would ever return to normal.  But Dr. Douthat has settled the case.

So, I am ready to throw away the masks and standing on floor stickers that say ""Stand here"" by July.  That is the summer, correct?  July in the Northern Hemisphere is the summer, n'est pas?

Take me out to the ballgame -- with the other 35,000 people.  Yup, buy me some peanuts and cracker Jacks, in the crowded bleachers. I don't care is I never get back to the hospital with COVID.

I mean, really, was does Dr. Fauci know.  He really needs to be more positive, take a brighter position. Thank you Dr. Douthat.  You are certainly giving Dr. Oz and Dr. Phil a run for their money."
2021-02-24 00:31:11,"Ross,
Please go to mass and pray for my soul because my faith is in science, medicine, and educated professionals. You and your impatient faith can     continue to pine for short term release from the trails and tribulations that life has presented us with but I can’t help but question the direction of your religious faith. It sounds awfully self centered and interested only in your own impatience and lack of personal satisfaction. Please think of others and less of yourself."
2021-02-24 00:48:17,"In the state of NJ, 5 million of the 9 million residents are now eligible to get the hard to find vaccine.  People under age 65 without a connection or who are unwilling to lie about their health will be waiting many many months.  Even those over 65 have to win the lottery to find one.  Perhaps if the priority of vaccines was federalized and uniform, Biden and Fauci could be more optimistic.  Every time the death or infection rate goes down, states sabotage their progress by opening up more activities.  Israel got it right by issuing vaccine passports because without sufficient vaccine, only some will return to normal by summer."
2021-02-24 00:49:58,"Things don't always work out when ""they might work out"". Far from it. Who wants to continue the limitations that this pandemic places on everyone? No one.
Throughout this pandemic, both here and most notably, the UK, there has been a virtual army of second guessers and amateur epidemiologists fretting and frowning about when lockdowns should end, when school should start, when restaurants should be able to serve inside etc, etc.
Invariably the  pandemic mitigation efforts took on the appearance of a yoyo. Open up, the cases rise, close down again the cases fall, again and again.

If you can't depend on the skill and knowledge and expertise of world  experts in disease and epidemiology, I suggest having your appendix taken out by the guy down the block."
2021-02-24 00:53:19,"A political argument is not appropriate in every situation, even if you are a political columnist.  Given the mistrust and misinformation that have nearly overtaken us, what we need is a sincerely considered scientific or moral basis for our assertions.  You have neither."
2021-02-24 00:56:22,"Why require not wearing masks for normalcy?

I would say going to school, going to work, normal health care patient volumes, and rare covid deaths would be normalcy.

Wearing masks is like driving the speed limit. It protects you and protects those around you and is tolerable. 

Stop picking fights and do something to help your society. Wear a mask, wash your hands. Get vaccinated. Understand that facts are different from made up conspiracies. Evidence matters. 

 It may save a waiter or bartender's job if you do this, and it may save somebody's grandparent from an untimely death."
2021-02-24 00:54:39,"Don't mention Donald Trump in any part of your reasoning for what Joe Biden or Anthony Fauci should be doing.

They know what they are doing. Your Republican president did not."
2021-02-24 01:06:05,"Ross means well but he seems confused.
When you think about danger, you are really thinking about two very different concepts: risk versus uncertainty. 

The first implies enough previous information to accurately estimate the likelihood of a bad event and the losses incurred if it happens. Life insurance, car crashes, for example. Responses to risks can be weighed in a cost vs. benefit manner.

Uncertainty is a different animal. We have relatively poor data about the rate of evolution of new variants and their transmissibility and dangers. Citing one data set from South Africa is not convincing.
The reality is we will be living with uncertainty for a long time with this set of threats. Our leaders need to treat us like grown ups and tell us that."
2021-02-24 01:07:07,"I am very sympathetic to ending restrictions earlier than later but I am not sure Americans can see how advanced they are in going back to normal relative to Asia, the actual epicenter of the crisis.  In part for all the wrong reasons the US sort of functioned ‘normally’ during the period it should have taken moderate steps to reduce transmission which would almost certainly have allowed less scarring than actually has occurred in minority communities.  Nonetheless, this approach has created a deeper pool of immunity which complemented with vaccines (kudos to science here) affords the US the unique situation to actually be, suddenly, way ahead of the curve.  More importantly Americans and most democracies have learned that Covid is endemic and will need to learn to live with it.  Psychologically and biologically the US is ripe to lead the world to normality, if it is necessary to push things out another six months it is a small price to pay to protect society of any further scarring.  In the meantime, places like HK and China look almost impossibly aligned to never open to the world again as they have pursued a 0 cases strategy by ripping apart the fabric of society and creating an unbelievable fear of even one case.  What envy!"
2021-02-24 01:09:11,"It is demonstrably false to say that for younger children Covid-19 ""does not appear to be more dangerous . . . than the flu.""  Death tolls are not the only measure of harm, nor are cases of severe illness upon first infection.  With research showing that 50% or more of even asymptomatic cases have lung and/or heart damage that for all we know may be permanent, we need to stop talking and acting like it doesn't really matter so much if kids catch Covid.  Kids who experience only mild illness now may face decades of poor health in the future as a result."

2021-02-24 01:11:04,"The go-slow reasoning of Dr. Fauci and Joe Biden is a judicious approach to driving down COVID-19 infections and ensuring that public expectations for a cure do not exceed reality.

Douthat concedes that his prediction of herd immunity by summer could be foiled by new COVID variants or by the premature lifting of masking and social distancing requirements, as do the forecasts he cites.  

Against this backdrop, Douthat should be supporting Fauci and Biden, not criticizing them. Better safe than sorry."
2021-02-24 01:09:58,"Your ""my two colleagues over the weekend"" reference is disingenuous. Great, they wrote about herd immunity by July IF.... and also added that an additional 200k people would die under this scenario. 
But you didn't speak to that. 
And that is exactly what this country does not need. More deaths and an almost laissez faire attitude, evidenced by this opinion piece writer, toward the exponential grief caused by people who just want it to be 'back to normal'. Selfishness on the scale we are seeing is not normal. 
I'll stick with Biden and Fauci. Experts in their fields and compassion in their souls."
2021-02-24 01:10:50,"No thanks, I take my chances with Dr. Fauci and his president Biden.

Let’s set a date, open all businesses first, and think later. right?

Nope, let’s keep all basic precautions in place, evaluate the progress in April, again in June, and make adjustments at each turn.

Your reaction is akin to Meghan McCain, who thinks  Dr Fauci hurts her feelings by being realistic and cautious."
2021-02-24 01:15:21,Insurance companies should inform people that they will not cover people who refuse to take the vaccine.
2021-02-24 01:13:59,"Most pandemics last a minimum of five years.

We are in this for the long haul.  There are reasons why America has lost 500,000,000 people.  Those reasons are not going to change easily.  Wishful thinking and frankly grandiose as well."
2021-02-24 01:16:57,"Politics and Pandemics are always the worst mix.  Camps are divided between skeptics and realists.  I think Mr. Douhat projects Politics into the situation by focusing on the disparate emergency measures.  500K people did not die because the Pandemic was prevalent, they died because we had Governors who didn't react enough or ignored it (and a POTUS downplaying it). If as some had pointed out, everyone participated in the lockdown or do the right thing (social distancing, masks and hand washing), it would have minimized deaths.  However, some continued until the Holiday seasons (Thanksgiving and Xmas) to do the wrong things.  Emergency measures would have never been necessary to prolong if everyone cared at the same level.  Being cautious is not the same as Politically deciding that schools remain close and business gatherings in events or restaurants need to be open by summer for indoor dining.   Each state needs to examine statistics and trends in their state and those that border them.What is safe in WI is not necessarily safe in IL (Milwaukee vs Chicago)."
2021-02-24 01:18:56,"You are ignoring the one big factor, difficult to predict and  impossible for health officials to control, that can summon the contagion back with a vengeance: science-denying legislatures prohibiting mask mandates in the name of “freedom”.  Because of this unknown, we shouldn’t make predictions about where we will be by certain dates, but instead set positive thresholds for various levels of reopening. 

Stopping Covid is no longer a technological challenge, but a social one.  If you can predict a date by which the ND GOP begins to demonstrate borderline competence, we might be able to predict reopening."
2021-02-24 01:23:15,"Ross, 
We can get there, but we're not close to home free yet and it's irresponsible of you to not make a strong appeal for the behaviors that will move us further along - ongoing masking, distancing, vaccinations, etc. Please don't spread the magical thinking of the right and leaning while we just witnessed a disaster in Texas that may sadly devolve into a super-spreader event. I read you to see another point of view, but put your wand away!

By the way, we don't need to go back to ""normal."" We need to move forward with a well-funded public health infrastructure, social safety net, and universal insurance.

So it must.  But it will not be ended by picking a date from the calendar, as the impatient Douthat insists.  We already had a president who tried that (several times, in fact).  How did that work out?

2021-02-24 01:26:04,"Biden and Fauci:  Don't overpromise and underdeliver. It's as simple as that. If good conditions arrive sooner, we can quickly pivot. What we don't need to raise expectations only to have them dashed.

2021-02-24 01:29:41,"If by the summer this is no worse than the flu, the restrictions will melt away. Worrying that they won't because Biden and Fauci aren't predicting that in February is silly.

The whole concept that the sacrifices people are being asked to make are some massive leftist social control project unrelated to what's really necessary to prevent massive death has been the bogus right wing fever dream throughout this entire pandemic. It's a total fantasy. Every time there's some hopeful turn in the pandemic out come the folks insisting it's all over and further sacrifice is unnecessary. And the the pols, left or right, to a greater or lesser extent, give in. There's very little evidence of any politician being able to resist that and no reason to expect that will change.

I don't need Biden and Fauci to tell me all will be well in August to keep my spirits up. I need Biden and Fauci to take appropriate action day after day, week after week. Seeing that will keep my spirits up. I'm more than capable of hoping on my own that that will lead to normality in August."

The worst thing officials could do is create a premature expectation of a return to normality, which Douthat admits depends on variables we can't (and often refuse to) control, 

Every step of the way, vast numbers of Americans have behaved childishly and irresponsibly regarding the pandemic. Predictions should be cautious and conservative. 

What Douthat assumes is that once enough people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 everything will be fine. However, we could have a dangerous flu season or a new pandemic, since there is nothing to prevent COVID-21 or 22 or some altogether new viral threat from emerging. Telling the American people all will be well this summer, even if that is a realistic hope, but not certainty, will be potentially disastrous if that date can't be met.

Better to say and hope for December and if things go well enough to make it safe for major changes by July or August, then we'll all be happy. Even December is far from certain."
2021-02-24 01:35:53,"Why do people talk about 'normalcy' and attempt to predict the future? I don't understand. If kids are in school, businesses are operating at capacity, and all businesses are open but were all wearing masks is that 'normal'. If its the same as above but without masks except you can't travel from South America and Africa where the vaccine isn't available is that normal?
I know it makes a nice headline, but we have to appreciate that no one, not a single expert believes 80% of the entire worls will be populated by the summer. Yes, local life might be 'near normal' by Summer. Normal has left the building."
2021-02-24 01:45:02,"I can’t say I agree with the all of the author’s premises. There are so many unknowns with a new-to-human virus whose natural history is not understood. Nobody really knows why cases are decreasing right now or what will come in fall or winter.  But there are limits to what humans can tolerate for long periods. Isolation is devastating, and those people who are lucky enough to be working full-time do not fully understand what it’s like for others who don’t have the distraction of work. This isn’t like WW2 where every person had a job to do in supporting the country’s common goals, even if it was Grandma minding the kids while Mom worked. The human toll of COVID goes far beyond the obscene number of deaths. We cannot, as a country, survive another year of lockdown like the last year. We simply cannot."

The risk of optimism that does not work out, is a risk of tens or hundreds of thousands of lives, as well as the related suffering that it imposes upon families and friends."
2021-02-24 02:15:43,"I think that we have not really tried to count all the costs of the measures that have been taken to save lives. And many costs are probably immeasurable at this point:  the mental and physical damage to some of the isolated elderly, the misery of children suffering at home from lack of opportunities to work and play with other children, the families economically crippled with growing debt for past-due rent or credit card purchases.  We tolerate other avoidable deaths because of a cost-benefit consensus. Can we not talk about this?"
2021-02-24 02:25:16,"Yes! If at risk people who choose to be vaccinated have been, why would we not go back to normal?"
2021-02-24 02:27:37,"Over optimism is what caused the mess we are still experiencing. An alternate view suggests that the decline in cases recently is mostly about a greater number of us following CDC guidelines, and abandoning the political fueled falsehoods of the past four years. Selfishness is experiencing a downturn?

So.........unless we know the future, pessimism is the best policy. 

Btw, the numerical data alone suggests that this viral illness creates orders of magnitude greater societal damage than Lime Disease of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome."
2021-02-24 02:34:07,"I'll err on this side of caution. Fauci is advising Biden and Biden is listening.And  I see the benefits in Dr. Fauci  projecting a more  cautious timeline. 

People are just now, in the last 2 months seeing the efficacy of masking and distancing to control the transmission of the virus. The holiday spike, long predicted, would have been of lesser severity had there been clear and consistent messaging and reinforcement of that messaging. 

So, we tighten our belts, keep the masks on, manage our social contacts as needed, and continue to mitigate risk. When we get the greenlight from Fauci and other experts after they've looked at the trends in the data we can reopen safely and responsibly. 

WW2 lasted 4 years. And there were  great sacrifices made on the home front. I think we can adapt to a late 2021 expected date of recovery. It's been a long haul, people are tired, but"
2021-02-24 01:54:22,"Mr. Douthat, do people even read what you write?  The comments make me wonder.  It's like people are locked into a mindset and can't even envision a world after COVID -- which was kind of your point.   Or they're locked into a partisan reaction towards anything you say, and get a dopamine rush when people agree with them, as they know they will.   Maybe the headline didn't quite reflect the nuance of your writing.  I did appreciate the subtle diplomacy of your comment: ""Fauci clearly has a theory of his own role that involves steering public expectations rather than just saying flatly what he thinks.""  I think that's actually a chapter in the public health crisis handbook, and it seems to work for this audience,  as far as the steering goes."
2021-02-24 01:53:11,"People need a sense of hope and they need to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  Only you can't just stamp your feet and say be gone to a pandemic any more than you can say it to a hurricane or a drought.   That's why Biden defers to Fauci who defers to science.  Because the best thing to do is make an informed decision based on facts, and that may differ from what people want or even need.  You have a public mic, Ross. and you have a responsibility to try and persuade people to believe in data and to believe in science.  Using your platform to cast doubt on Fauci and science is frankly despicable."
2021-02-24 01:56:35,Mr. Douthat: Reaching herd immunity does not mean it is time to return to “normal”.  Herd immunity is simply a statistical tipping point at which the rate of infection begins to tail off.  And that can be a longer tail if we drop our guard.  See articles about herd immunity overshoot - including in the NYT.
2021-02-24 02:22:19,"The burden on young people of these pandemic restrictions has been underestimated.  At some point you must let them live their lives.  Frankly, the time has already passed so let's get on with it."
2021-02-24 02:06:36,"Douthat is not a doctor, not an epidemiologist, not a public health professional.  He's just a guy.  My neighbor is a guy.  My friends are guys.  My daughter is an ICU nurse in a covid ward. If I were to listen to someone's advice, I don't think I would turn to Douthat; I think I'd turn to Fauci, to my county health officials and to my daughter. Everything else is bar talk, the things people say to make themselves relevant at the next bar stool."

2021-02-24 02:12:50,"I remember when Tom Friedman was pushing the Swedish-style herd immunity approach, which did not produce immunity - just mass death. I resolved then to never again give any credence to NYT political columnists with zero expertise or inside knowledge opining on how covid should be handled - especially when they presume to know better than someone like Fauci."
2021-02-24 02:46:31,"Biden is President. Fauci is an expert in viruses. Neither is a fortune teller. 

There are enough variants already in circulation that the possibility of something going seriously wrong is unknowable. We need to do everything possible to stop the spread to reduce that possibility."
2021-02-24 02:47:41,"This strikes me as an irresponsible use of space, even in the OpEd section. The virus isn't going to be swayed by your opinions, but some readers might be persuaded into letting down their guards - just like they did last summer. What we need is to continue working together until it is safe to do otherwise. What we definitely don't need are more empty promises or meaningless predictions made by people who claim that they can ""read trend lines and vaccine studies."""
2021-02-24 03:00:13,"We have hope for the day the vaccines start to bend the curve, but for now, only one factor determines the ebb and flow of caseloads, hospitalizations, and deaths;

Our behavior.

The risk environment has not changed, and may be becoming more dangerous as new variants inevitably spread. Drop you guard, cases will increase. 

Look, we’re all tired, and we all have made sacrifices. To shortest path the beating this maintain the discipline to do what is necessary to stop spread. What makes anyone think wishing the virus away will work any better this time?

Adjust, do the best you can. If eveytakes basic common sense precautions, we will be able to carry on as much of our normal life as is possible."
2021-02-24 01:55:07,OK. So you know more about Covid than Fauci.
2021-02-24 02:21:05,"Ok riddle me this Batman. How has China done it??? Billion people a healthcare system certainly not as advanced or expensive as ours. A rural population basically in poverty and I believe 1 in 3 just travelled from end to end for the Chinese New Year.

They are lying ?? If so why not web reports of thousands dying in the streets?? How could they possibly have rolled out enough vaccine since January??"
2021-02-24 02:56:03,"""I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and at this moment both their takes look way too pessimistic.""

In other words, you do not know anything and can safely be ignored. Why not go back to whining about ""guns, grit and god""?"
2021-02-24 02:54:37,"Eoss Douthat, if you want Bide, Fauci and co to open up the economy, how about you write regular columns on why Americans should emulate NZ, Australia, S. Korea and Taiwan.

Some of those countries allow citizens to go to ball games, movie theaters etc. But there is an outbreak, they lockdown and the people cooperate.

Here we have none of that compliance. Like babies some of us cry when some ""rights"" are infringed and this refusal to comply with health regulations is why our infection rates are still stubbornly high and the deaths just crossed half a million. Shame on us. 

Why we should we sacrifice more people to reach herd immunity which is no guarantee that the disease has been defeated if there are more contagious versions ready to pounce."
2021-02-23 14:42:22,"I hear the same thing repeated on every newscast and in every article, the most vulnerable people are not getting vaccinated at an equitable and fair rate. I propose a nationwide hotline on which you can get ALL information about Covid and make appointments in all 50 states and U.S. territories. 1-800-Covid19. It’s even got the correct number of digits. And a www.Covid19.gov corresponding website. Staff it with some of our many millions of newly unemployed, pay starting at $20/hour. For me and everyone I know, lack of knowing where and how and when is, at best, slowing the escape from this pandemic tragedy, at worst, 500,000+ people die and continue to do so."

2021-02-23 11:43:38,The one thing that the over 65 can do is prepare their end of life wishes and even request DNR with no chest compressions. Statistics of surviving cardiac standstill are poor; the biggest favor you can do besides Covid precautions is not indulge in futile gestures at the end of life that are time consuming. A cardiac arrest can take a precious half hour away from other people who have a better chance of surviving.
2021-02-23 11:51:50,"ICU nurses are used to having to do this.....for a couple of days.  But not for this length of time.  And the question will become how do hospital systems take care of them after this is over?  Watch how the CEO's of the healthcare systems and the hospitals get bonuses for weathering the storm.  And then turn around and tell the nursing staff ""Well, you know, we really took a financial beating during all this.  We'd love to help you out, but, well, you know how it is""  or my favorite "" Sorry. It's like this everywhere"".  And let's not forget the techs and unit secretaries and transporters, etc, etc. who get paid little and have to function at a very high level. And deal with stuff you would find only in your nightmares.  The fall out from this will be ""Hmmm.  Beat myself to death and take huge risks in the ICU?  Or take less money, get out at 5PM, no holidays, overtime or weekends""  working for an insurance company or doctor's office.  And just remember, if that happens,  the really good, seasoned nurses with all the experience will be replaced by people with little to no ICU experience.  But, hey, you will have CEO's who are very good at saying no to the workers.  When your life is on the line.....what more could you ask for?"
2021-02-23 12:09:17,"As difficult as it is to read the struggles of nurses and doctors because of COVID, their presence is crucial and they have been the real heroes that have prevented deaths from being even higher. Better pay and compensation through government funding!"
2021-02-23 12:40:42,"At every NYS mass vaccination site - some 15 statewide -- there are currently ""no appointments available through early April.  That suggests to me that there is sufficient vaccine to run these sites 24 hours a day, and open up more appointments.  That may tax the healthcare staff giving the vaccines more, but isn't it better than the alternative, where people who are waiting for vaccines get infected and land in the hospitals?"
2021-02-23 12:21:28,"To simply say thank you to healthcare workers seems like a feeble expression of gratitude, but with all my heart, thank you."

Human nature and human behavior is a real mystery.  If anyone has any ideas how to get people to adhere to simple safety precautions, please share..."
2021-02-23 12:25:48,"Because of how our nation's healthcare system is structured, many of these workers (especially the doctors) are also doing all of this while dealing with pay cuts. Many hospitals make most of their money on surgeries. With fewer surgeries happening to make space for COVID patients and to free up staff for their care, there is much less money coming in and that deficit is being passed on directly to doctors. Many are working even more than they usually do, in more dangerous, stressful, and traumatic situations than usual, and for significantly less pay. This should be a national shame on par with the government's initial failures to take care of 9/11 first responders. I hope there will be a similar movement for ICU workers who have worked through this pandemic to get the care and money they so deserve."
2021-02-23 12:44:29,"There are many emergency medicine residents completing their residencies  this spring who, after working through this pandemic period, cannot find jobs.  The reasoning is that the hospitals cannot afford them at this time.  If every hospital CEO took a pay cut this year, I am sure the cohort would be fully employed."
2021-02-23 12:52:12,"I work in healthcare and I do not know how our doctors and nurses have found the fortitude to endure the onslaught of patients. I anticipate that many will choose early retirement or an alternative career when we get to the other side of this pandemic. There is only so long that people can work in that type of overdrive mode. When it goes on as long as this has, it leaves a permanent mark. At one time, I worked on the clinical side of healthcare. While I enjoyed taking care of patients, we were always staying late/working overtime to cover surges in demand. When it gets to the point that you don't know at what time you will be able to leave work on a daily basis, it becomes unmanageable. There is only so much rearranging of your personal business that is possible and opportunity costs become a serious concern. I mean....it isn't worth sacrificing  literally everything else in your life for the sake of a job. I like to work, but there needs to be a limit. Anything more than a 50 to 60 hour week is a HARD NO for me."

This isn’t over yet, by any means."
2021-02-23 13:23:27,"Having left ICU, and having taken care of proned ARDS patients, I cannot imagine the toll on nurses and all ICU staff during Covid.  Try proning someone over 300 lbs, without dislodging the ventilator tube, dialysis catheter, arterial and central lines...  A few things that the lay person does not always understand: 1. Non ICU nurses cannot simply slip into this role. Some types could do it more quickly but It takes time and preceptorship. Who has time to precept someone now?  2. There has always been a scarcity of equipment because admin wants to run lean (thanks Six Sigma) so IV pumps, SCDs to prevent blood clots, even vents and dialysis machines--sometimes can't be found.  3. When one patient (or more) is in trouble, more hands on deck. That means a remaining nurse is now monitoring all of the other patients. 4. There are no nurses waiting in the wings to give lunch or bathroom breaks.  I didn't see the cafeteria during my career as it was--the time to walk there would eat up my break.  We always brought our food so we could eat.  5. We need to have national legislation NOW to permit interstate licensure. There is nothing unique done in one state vs another. Currently only 34 states participate in this.  Physiology and nursing process is not somehow different between Arizona and New York. We need to have MORE flexibility in America to allow nurses to work in any state and go where they are most needed.   Time is wasting. Remove this artificial barrier now."
2021-02-23 14:14:25,"I am a retired neurologist who in practice occasionally ""owned"" an ICU with multiple patients. I have  helped nurses change patients  when I could (it's a good way to examine the back and buttocks of a patient which is extremely important), and even made beds on my own, if I had time. I didn't deal with Covid, which is far more labor intensive than almost everything I dealt with. It takes a special breed of nurse to be able to deal with ICU patients, where the mantra was too often, ""So much work for so little result.""  

That's just the labor.  Add to that putting on PPE and trying to deal with families who can't see for themselves what is going on, and having it day after day, week after week, with much of the rest of the country not bothering to do simple measures, and you have a recipe for burnout. 

In medicine, there are no business days to do something. And I define a week as 3 business days, given that people are catching up on Mondays and leave early on Fridays, unless there is already some holiday for something or other, in which case they are gone.
And in the ICU, there is no ""your call is important to us,"" only ""this patient is important to you...and to us.""

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to everybody who works in an ICU.  Heroism is way overused in this country, so I will simply write that you are a rare breed, special, deserved and deserve so much better."
2021-02-23 14:09:27,"Food for thought, as human and hospital resources are limited by nature and circumstances. Your phrase ""You don't have time to cry; must be strong for the next patient"" caught my eye. As a retired physician, however much one cares for patients, one must remain objective to be useful. Here goes Bruce Brown's (an MD) excellent phrase: ""The good Physician: You and I cannot be friends, for now. I must coldly probe, pain and score you. If I care too much, Yours, and all the others' pains will drain, weaken, and kill me. My love must be shallow enough for both of us to survive""."
2021-02-23 13:48:13,"As a healthcare worker, during times when the healthcare system is overloaded, I believe in something self invented called the ""Dog hypothesis"", which I have shared generously with my co workers over the years.

You have two options. You can either consider all your patients to be dogs, treat them accordingly, and remain a human yourself. Or you can consider your patients to be humans, overwork yourself beyond the point of exhaustion, and turn into a dog yourself. Either way, someone is going to have to be the dog. You get to chose who the dog is going to be."

Those of us who have worked in hospitals and want to stay alive are doing everything we possibly can to stay out of an ICU in a pandemic.  

We know very well what damage can happen when the system works normally.  And we don't want to test our luck in this situation."
2021-02-23 15:17:58,"The daily stress these environments presented is hard to describe.  Several times early on, I treated patients off COVID units only to find the patient I treated tested positive.  The PPE was limited to only COVID units.  By then, it’s too late to know if you’ve contracted it or may have spread it to your family.   And my colleagues in the same situation, were testing positive, with some passing from it.  Pile on an election year, conspiracy theories, etc., and any hope for effective management was out the door.  Time heals, and I’ll get past this.  I don’t know if I’ll get past my loss of respect for our country."

This is happening in the outer boroughs is hospitals with far less financial resources than the major players (Mt. Sinai, NYU Langone Northwell etc) in Manhattan who cater to the most affluent patient demographic. Of course the result is a two tiered system with marked disparities in quality of care and patient outcomes. And all of this is happening right in front of all the city and state regulatory agencies who turn a blind eye to the situation."

Shame on those Americans who flaunted caution due to unbelievable stupidity and/or outright arrogance. Churlish.

You taxed good people (and I have a beloved healthcare worker in my family) needlessly and your actions meant that hundreds of thousands who needed care for accidents or attention to symptoms of other disease were afraid to seek it. 

This is on your heads. And as much as ""that former guy"" failed to lead, tossing out lies and diminishments, smart people don't behave like sheep. You did. So much avoidable tragedy is your karma."

In the meantime - thank a nurse - wear a mask!"
2021-02-23 16:03:36,"The article also makes me think about the situation with Cuomo. 

I'm not defending the delay in reporting data, but his decision to transfer stabilized Covid patients to nursing homes last March and April at the height of the pandemic in NY and particularly NYC.

Apparently, most of his critics were fine with leaving stabilized Covid patients in the hospitals. As if the staff and facilities weren't overwhelmed enough. 

It was urgent that they be transferred to take the burden from hospitals.

Basically, if critics are saying that the stabilized patients should not have been transferred to nursing homes, they should identify an alternative.

And no, ""the ship"" wasn't an option. At first they flat out refused to take any Covid patients at all, then took only a handful, and only if they met a list of over 50 separate criteria.

The Javits Center was essentially a field hospital. My understanding is that it wasn't able to accomodate patients with dementia, fall risks, and many other chronic conditions (i.e. it wasn't set up to take care of the vast majority of nursing home patients). They also had a long list of exclusionary criteria which stymied attempts by hospitals to transfer patients.

But the notion persists that Cuomo just on a whim ""forced"" patients into nursing homes. If other alternatives existed, exactly what were they?"

2021-02-23 15:57:29,"Yes, there is a reason that healthcare workers are frustrated with those who wouldn't recognize the impact of COVID. We had two surges in my hospital and each was an incredible challenge. The effect on our ICUs was sudden and profound. Beyond ventilators and beds, we had only so many trained ICU nurses and respiratory therapists. When some of them got sick, we had even fewer. When suddenly many patients needed ICU care all at once, there was only so far we could flex to take care of our patients. We managed, but we are all tired and none of us want a third surge. Please stay safe. Too many have already died."

Healthcare workers are not replaceable. We don't want banging pots and free food-all we ask is that you wear a mask, don't do stupid things, help out your elderly neighbors and get vaccinated.  We are offended when we see you going into crowded places unmasked because you are undoing any progress that has been made to get us out of this mess."
2021-02-23 16:48:12,"A friend of mine who works in a major New York hospital told me that as of a couple of weeks ago (she doesn't have more recent information), a high percentage of nurses in the hospital were choosing not to be vaccinated themselves.

As a teacher, I know the extra emotional lift I have done this past year to bolster the mood of my students studying remotely; so many mental health crises. Thank you again."
2021-02-23 16:37:03,"It has been one long year working as a physician in a safety net hospital. Just this morning I read this quote by Toni Morrison that someone sent me. 
“I am staring out of the window in an extremely dark mood, feeling helpless. Then a friend, a fellow artist, calls...he asks, 'How are you?' And instead of 'Oh, fine...and you?', I blurt out the truth: 'Not well. Not only am I depressed, I can’t seem to work, to write; it’s as though I am paralyzed, unable to do anything...I’ve never felt this way before…' I am about to explain with further detail when he interrupts, shouting: 'No! No! This is precisely the time when artists go to work...not when everything is fine, but in times of dread. That’s our job.' I felt foolish the rest of the morning, especially when I recalled the artists who had done their work in gulags, prison cells, hospital beds; who did their work while hounded, exiled, reviled, pilloried. And those who were executed... This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we love. That is how civilizations heal.”"
2021-02-23 17:48:45,"Our healthcare system did not get overwhelmed because of COVID-19.  It became overwhelmed because of greed.

Greed is the constant pressure on our healthcare system that structures itself to yield more profits and not more healthy patients.

Our for profit driven healthcare system is meant to handle as many patients as possible with the least amount of doctors, nurses, and other medical staff to squeeze as much monetary benefit for those at the top.

Ever wonder why ERs have such long wait times?

Ever wonder why doctors barely spend 15 minutes with you for an appointment?

I know many doctors and other health care professionals that want to spend their careers caring and nurturing patients but instead they spend their careers nurturing the corporate bottom line.

It is an assembly line of patients, creative invoicing, and surprise billing."
2021-02-23 18:23:19,"I have as a client a healthcare foundation that raises money for the associated healthcare system. A great deal of Covid-specific fundraising has occurred over the past year. In addition to necessities like PPE along with funding testing and vaccination, donations have been made to offer staff mental health support, as well as material gifts for the holidays, and wellness experiences (massage, safe cultural outings, etc) in order to offset the incredible stress they are under. When I have read some of the quotes by their healthcare providers, it is heartbreaking. We must support our providers and keep them safe by doing our utmost to prevent the spread of the virus."
2021-02-23 18:16:15,"I retired about 10 days before the shut down, but had worked in one healthcare system for almost 40 years. I know them well. They talk about taking care of their staff, but have put hiring freezes in place (one friend worked in an area that was down 1/3 of their staff a year ago, and because of the hiring freeze, worked that way for most of the year), froze vacation and leaves (another friend's father is dying, and she was a couple of day s off to go visit him in another state for almost 8 months), schedules have been changed every month (which is really tough for women who have to deal with child care), and had no mechanism to implement their own policy if someone had to take time off because of a Covid exposure.  Everyone is looking for a way out. Anyone who can is planning to retire, reduce hours, try to get a job working in a clinic, anything but have to deal with hospital care any longer than the have to. So, they will stay at the bedside til this is over, but in six months, anyone who can be will be gone. Hospitals have exploited staff, ignored their concerns, and provided very limited support. Hospital administration departments (HR, IT, EHR administration, Admin) use Covid as an excuse as they work from home and don't support staff who are  actually at the bedside. If you've delayed a surgery because of Covid, schedule it now, because in 8 months, all your providers will have just taken off their cap and gown."
2021-02-23 18:53:28,"This pandemic has been a terrible strain for everyone, especially for our health heroes.

Thank you to each and every healthcare professional who risks his/her own life to take care of us all."
2021-02-23 18:34:13,"On my way to work right now where latey I've been taking on 3 if not 4 ICU patients. This article doesn't begin to describe how physically and emotionally exhausted healthcare staff is. We are burning out and everyone should be concerned. If we are assigned 4 patients each what kind of care do you think they will get? Not what they should, despite out bests efforts we simply don't have time or resources to do double the work. There's only so much a single person can do. Please where a mask and get vaccinated when you can!"

How the Virus and Selfish People Have Tested the Limits of Hospitals and Staff"
2021-02-23 18:40:52,"When are we going to set aside a day and thank all those healthcare workers that persevered, have been infected, assumed the role of family because patient visitors have not been allowed, missed their own family members, and died of COVID?  

We need to stop ignoring and expecting these people to carry on! 

We are way overdue!  Give them something!  Something!  Please!"
2021-02-23 19:28:20,"I'm a social worker in an emergency department. I want recognition and want to be heard. The amount of times this article mentions nurses and 'the other healthcare staff"" without identifying them is infuriating. I spent an evening this week going in and out of the ED to spend time with and provide info to a mother in the lobby whose teen daughter took an intentional overdose. I had to get info from the ED doc bring it out to the mom in the lobby, back and forth, for hours before the young teen was life flighted to another hospital. I'm not sure how she is doing."
2021-02-23 19:42:03,"I retired from a major medical center working in critical care 15 years ago and there  was always a  staffing crisis for the almost 30 years I worked there. It was like a revolving door of staff. New staff would just get trained and leave for greener pastures leaving seasoned RN’s an even bigger burden. As critical care got more complicated and  sophisticated the physical and mental toll on the RN’s  escalated not to mention long hours, few breaks and subpar pay. Management’s attitude was that everyone is replaceable and retention was not high on their list. No one in Hospital management should be surprised at the crisis they are in over the past year considering what has transpired for years."
2021-02-23 19:43:35,"As an ex- ER nurse of many years, I have never been so glad as to ""retire"" to correctional nursing last year. I have done trauma, worked coast to coast, have had 10 patients or more in high volume ER's with codes left and right, and I can say without reservation I'd be terrified to work ER in a major metro hospital right now. Thank you, bless you, stay safe out there.  May the prayers of a grateful nation lift you up."
2021-02-23 19:34:06,We need a new national holiday....the COVID-19 Healthcare Worker Appreciation Day. Who's in? Who can help make that happen?
2021-02-23 19:42:50,"Physicians and nurses were burned out before COVID19 hit (see Mayo and Stanford article below) primarily due to the immense regulatory burden placed on us by Obamacare and the requirement to sit in front of a computer for hours a day (EMR requirement in the ACA). COVID19 just pushed us over the edge that we were already standing at.
Want to help us out? Find somebody else to pick on when you talk about “reforming healthcare.”

2021-02-23 20:04:59,"Yes, and most of FL and other states still don’t believe it in, or won’t take the vaccine, bc they want “us” to do it.  I just cannot believe this mess, as a RN we are overwhelmed with travelers to FL (I know it’s cold up north), but my gosh, then just wear a mask, but they don’t and complain to us in the clinic when they have to.  Why don’t we care for others more?  What happened?"
2021-02-23 19:42:49,"During this time, COVID-19 was the foreign enemy invading  our country and our healthcare staff were the army...who ""soldiered on"" putting themselves nose-to-nose with an unknown virus in spite of having limited supplies of PPE...and...in spite of non-compliance to safe behaviors by some of the general population...and in spite of the anti-vaxxers and in spite of having to learn on their feet to adjust treatment protocols as the outcomes data came in. Had it not been for their tireless efforts, the death toll would be much higher than 500K."
2021-02-23 19:50:36,"Could someone at the Times ask nursing and medical and technical schools how their programs are doing, and then write a article about their findings. Perhaps include other essential personnel for other industries and our institutions, such as mental health care practitioners, lawyers, engineers, teachers, librarians, etc.

In other words, should we prepare for future extreme shortages in nurses, techs, aides, doctors, physician assistants, physical therapists, etc. in the coming months and years?"
2021-02-23 22:38:10,"Excellent description of the GOP crime against hospitals. 
Wrong Wing Republicans have stepped on a lot of people but few more egregiously than hospital staff. 
One of our congressmen said of overwhelmed hospitals, ""Hospitals can manage their facilities"". End of his concern. 

Yet in spite of the wholesale abuse and criticism coming from the GOP they have acted heroically. 
Hero is a word that is bandied about carelessly but it fits the nurses and doctors who are there for us 24/7. 
500,000 dead Americans is beyond shocking but w/o hospital staff it would have been so much worse. 
Would be wise to support them with your vote at the poles if you want quality care."
2021-02-24 03:15:58,"With over 3,440 United States healthcare workers dead...... they should not have called us heroes. They should have called us martyrs. That was a PR stunt... and we all know it. The public doesn’t."
2021-02-24 04:17:28,"I have seen the overall death toll, the aged death toll, but I haven't seen any report on the toll of hospital workers: doctors, nurses, aides, staff (admissions, cleaning, washing, cooking, distributing, stocking). What is the infections rate, what is the death rate of these most forward front-line workers? How does it compare to medics on a battlefield? A similar question arises for other essential workers: not just police and fire/paramedics, but grocery checkers and shelvers, postal and other delivery workers. Surely the statistics are being recorded?"
2021-02-24 04:30:35,"At the height of the initial deadly surge that hit and overwhelmed healthcare workers in the NYC area, I wrote a song in which I tried to capture the enormous stresses these healthcare workers experienced throughout their days, from the time they left their house until they came home exhausted at night. Numerous healthcare workers shared photos of themselves, which allowed me to include a montage of photos of these heroic workers who each day dress in green, white and blue. Here is a link to the song: <a href=""https://youtu.be/XM_xq1GgrDM"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/XM_xq1GgrDM</a> We should all rise up for and thank our nurses, doctors, nurses aids, orderlies, emergency personnel, who kept and continue to keep us alive through this plague. I know, as my wife and I were among them."
