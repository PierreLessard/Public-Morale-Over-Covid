2021-01-30 17:06:52,"I think one problem with this article is that is suggests that we should have been able to come up with effective treatments for COVID-19 by now had the research infrastructure worked better. From the beginning of time until 2021, we have discovered extremely few effective treatments for any viral respiratory infection. There are a few influenza antivirals that are all the same mechanism of action and modestly effective at best. We have an antiviral against RSV that is even less effective. So the fact that we have any (and we have multiple) effective treatments all discovered within 1 year is pretty impressive to me. I think better clinical trials infrastructure would have mostly helped prove things don't work faster than it took us to figure out."
2021-01-30 17:10:49,"After one year with COVID-19 pandemic, we got vaccine. But vaccination is so much confusing and frustrating. The process is extremely slow. Trump administration had no plan and I do not understand why those experts stayed in job doing nothing. We do not see any therapeutic treatment for the virus. Only Merck is coming out with some antiviral treatment. There is only one medicine Remdesivir which very expensive. There should be global efforts to find out remedies and eradicate forever. Otherwise a significant percentage of world population will face sufferings and death. There will be new normal for human beings on the planet."
2021-01-30 17:22:44,"In June 2020, BARDA, the disgraced federal agency that was found to have ""lost"" $500 million, suspended support for development of immunomodulators and therapeutics targeting lung repair, and interventions for pre- and post-Covid prophylaxis. Instead, under pressure from the Trump administration and the my pillow guy, the agency wasted many millions on useless hydroxychloroquine, 

These interventions could have bought patients valuable time for their immune systems to clear the virus and prevent lung decline. This failure likely cost many lives."
2021-01-30 17:24:18,"There is a lot of evidence that Ivermectin is effective against COVID, but it is an inexpensive, generic drug and so has been largely ignored or maligned."
2021-01-30 17:37:12,"BARDA, formerly run by Bright who is now a Democratic hero, seems to have focused on vaccines over therapeutics, and that level of funding inevitably drove the direction of research to vaccines.  FDA does have their CTAP program which helps assure that therapeutic research is properly structured. However, there is no fundamental way to control the melange of academic research,  which as the author notes is often poorly designed and managed, as exemplified by the initial Oxford vaccine trials."
2021-01-30 17:39:05,"The drug discovery process is ill-suited to viral pandemics like the present one.  It simply takes too long to identify and develop a treatment, and by the time a good candidate is ready to be distributed, vaccines are available, the pandemic has pretty much run its course, and there's little demand for the drug.  
As this article points out, whatever we do discover is more likely to be of benefit in some future pandemic - and even that is going to be a matter of luck."
2021-01-30 17:45:04,These drugs are available but not enough patients are aware they exist. My understanding is you have to demand this treatment as soon as you test positive and have underlying health issues.

2021-01-30 17:50:04,"What is making the anti-virals? Sarepta Therapeutics was funded by the Fort Detrich and the CDC.  Was contracted to identify and create anti-virals in a matter of days. The tree drug targets if worked like their successful Ebola and Marburg and H1N1 drugs. FDA requires lab results, animal testing, safety testing, stage 2 and 3 trials and a FDA review. So about time we have it approved it is no longer needed. What's wrong with this picture in a pandemic?"
2021-01-30 17:57:03,"It is undoubtedly true that research and development of vaccines took the place of a lot of research into anti-viral treatments.  

But it probably would not have made any difference if there had been more treatment research.  There have been 2 proven effective anti-viral treatments available for several months (from Regeneron and from Eli Lilly).  Although only available in limited quantity, even that limited quantity has not been fully used.  Why?  Because those treatments must be given early in the course of the Covid infection and are inconvenient to the medical people to administer since they are infusions which must be administered in a medical facility.  

That presents an insurmountable barrier for regular people who get infected.  First, unless you are a doctor or his family or a politician, the doctors don't want to even see you once you are determined to be infected.  They just tell you to stay at home and call if you get near death.  By that time, it is too late to use the anti-virals.  

Of course, if you are a doctor, a doctor's family, a politician, or perhaps a big shot hospital donor of lots of money, then the doctors will see you early in the infection and will bear the inconvenience to administer the anti-viral infusions.

That is why a substantial portion of the anti-viral drugs go unused every month."
2021-01-30 17:57:08,"This article gets it a little wrong.  Other than vaccines, antivirals have been the ONLY focus, and have caused us to misallocate our resources and attention.  What we know now is that elimination of the virus does not always prevent progression of the disease to its severest forms.  What has always been needed, from day one, are treatments for the sickest patients, and treatments to prevent the hyper-immune response.  Lowering the mortality rate and preventing severe disease have huge potential to end this pandemic.

There are multiple late-stage therapeutics for severe and critical patients that have never been mentioned by the NYT, and their absence is particularly glaring.  Please consider looking into Lenzilumab, Leronlimab, and Aviptadil, all of which are concluding phase 3 trials in critical patients.  Anecdotal and EIND evidence suggests that one or more of these could lead to miraculous recoveries in the sickest populations."
2021-01-30 17:58:14,"All the success in the world in developing a vaccination does no good whatsoever until it is administered into the arms of people who need it. By that standard, vaccines have failed. The distribution process has been a complete disaster. I speak from personal experience:  in PA those in group 1A, as I am, simply cannot find a vaccine.  I spend at least an hour a day trying and failing. 

The manufacturers of the vaccines have all been paid for the doses, so they don’t care about failures downstream from production.  But we should all care about the abysmal job being done to get those doses into people. Nothing will change about our lives until this happens.  I am shocked at how slow the process is and at the chaos that local governments seem incapable of surmounting."
2021-01-30 17:58:55,"As someone involved in early stage efforts to discover new drugs for treating CoVID, I can tell you that the lack of interest and funding has been fairly shocking.

2021-01-30 18:04:55,"Tens of thousands primary care docs like myself diagnose early covid in our offices. There is no shortage of patients. But we can't add the administrative and regulatory burden of a clinical trial to our workflows. The US needs to have a mechanism to centralize trial administration so that we can quickly stand up much larger, centrally coordinated, outpatient studies in times of crisis. The NHS did it for inpatient trials (RECOVERY), and it quickly led to a national network with over 100 sites and the life-saving dexamethasone data."

An Open label study of highly comorbid (e.g. cancer) patients on ventilators with has shown 72% survival taking Zyesami vs. 17% who did not receive the drug. Further data, submitted to Operation Warp Speed showed a roughly 5x improvement in recovery from respiratory failure (getting people off ventilators) vs placebo.

2021-01-30 18:03:31,"I wonder how much of the cost of the trials are the drugs vs the overhead. If you're willing to waste a lot of doses, we might want to screen people for test subjects & hand out meds for potential use at the time they're being tested.

2021-01-30 18:27:11,"This is a very good article on drugs.  We need also to consider more carefully adjuvants like gargling and halotherapy.  The only (small) clinical trial of gargling showed it to be effective against COVID-19 in the upper respiratory tract.  One advantage of generic adjuvants is that they tend to work well against a wide range of viruses, so they would not be so easily outflanked by new variants."
2021-01-30 18:30:13,"We had Covid back in February when it wasn't thought to be a big deal yet, so we didn't do anything but treat at home as a passing viral thing. I was sicker than I have ever been for a couple of days, and lost my sense of taste and smell. As we always do when we're coming down with a virus, we took a standardized extract of elderberry. It is well studied (as in years and years worth) and works like Tamiflu...it contains a neuraminidase inhibitor.  We were recovered, cough and all, in about a week. I still have lingering effects (started in March), but count myself lucky. It couldn't hurt to keep it on hand for maintenance until the pharmaceutical industry can run some studies and get something more expensive approved."
2021-01-30 18:06:14,"To me, the point of this very good article is that getting serious—really serious—about imposing the public health measures we’ve known for a darn century would have bought us time to develop some of these drugs rationally, in the course of a fast but coordinated research effort.

We blew them off. We didn’t coordinate jack. We spent billions—literally—on quackeries because the Thing, and his Beagle Boys in Congress and around the country, demanded it. 

Well, so far Biden seems to be doing one heckuva better job. But morons STILL won’t mask up, states lifted restrictions too fast for the THIRD time, new variants (which also got time to emerge because we gave it to them) are emerging, and now, well, now we pay."

That said, there should be organized research on therapeutics and that should continue.  Had we taken SARS and MERS a bit more seriously in 2003, we may have had a vaccine at the ready with few or no modifications.

Yes, politics and science do not mix, and  also irresponsible reporting that is accepted without further scrutiny by doctors.  Just because Trump endorsed a treatment, that does not mean in does not work:  Biden does not have the capacity to endorse anything technical.   For example, there were multiple politicized articles posted in the NYtimes denigrating the monoclonals, and now they sit on pharmacy refrigerator shelfs instead of being infused in those individuals that would benefit from them.  Plasma also has been demonstrated in large clinical  trails to  be effective when infused early.    If there were promising drugs that could be repositioned, the pharmaceutical companies by theirselfs would have managed and funded the clinical trials.     The same holds true for trials in other West European countries.  Likely there were very few of those.   Stop the misinformation  that ends up costing lives."
2021-01-30 18:25:59,"There needs to be an investigative commission to determine exactly who made decisions that halted progress on therapeutics, and who profited by those decisions.

Why doesn't anyone talk about the abrupt cancellation of the grants for therapeutic drug trials, by the Defense Department's BARDA program? Literally the day before grants were to be announced, they announced that there would NO grants for therapeutic drugs.

Instead, political theater focused on vaccine development. Curing sick old people -- who cares?

Some small drug companies have struggled forward, funding 100% of the research themselves. CytoDyn is repurposing an HIV drug for gravely ill COVID patients (with seeming success thus far), and Innovation Pharmaceuticals has an incredibly effective COVID virus-killing drug, Brilacidin. BOTH of these companies could have had clinical trials completed ago, had not the FDA and cessation of government research grants hampered them. In the meantime, the government wasted millions by stockpiling doses of hydroxychloroquine, which was not only useless, but which INCREASED the death rate at the VA hospital.

And again -- why isn't anyone investigating why the FDA suddenly refused to let Novavax continue manufacturing vaccine at the facility they had contracted with, instead booting them out so that Pfizer could use that manufacturing capacity? This delayed Novavax, which had been in the lead, for 3 months, while they had to find another manufacturer, in South Korea."

2021-01-30 18:53:54,"The studies of the anti-viral drug remdesivir--first in Ebola and later in COVID-19-- show that it is a very effective inhibitor of virus replication.  It can prevent lethal infection of primates when administered within one-two days of virus exposure.  But effectiveness drops rapidly as the interval between infection and onset of treatment increases, and a delay of 4-5 days is too late. Five days after infection when symptoms appear, virus burden is peaking, and the host immune system is already activated.  Thus, administration of remdesivir to newly-symptomatic hosts was not effective in the 2018 Ebola outbreak in Africa or in the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Drugs that target the virus are much more likely to be effective as prophylactic agents in recently exposed asymptomatic hosts."
2021-01-30 19:20:28,"Our toxic politics is more dangerous to our future than anything Covid19 can do to us.  So many of us think we have the answers, if only those who disagree would concede to our program.  The problem Covid19 has created is far too complex for any one person to comprehend.  So we resort to politics, which essentially is the process of simplifying any problem until the solution fits into a 20-second soundbite.  Reality is neither that simple nor can it be negotiated with, as DJT finally found out.

2021-01-30 19:49:05,"This article should mention one of the greatest obstacles to drug development: American trial lawyers and lawsuits.

Drug companies have flaws, the prices they charge Americans for many drugs is near the top of the list. But the nation and world need these firms to develop, test, and manufacture drugs and vaccines.

Today, lawsuits pose an existential threat to many pharmaceutical companies, including the American company Johnson and Johnson, a major vaccine developer, and the German company Bayer, which assumed tremendous liability by purchasing the American company Monsanto.

Literally tens of thousands of lawsuits have been filed against drug firms, many for literally billions of dollars each.  These are lawsuits which can, and do, drive companies to bankruptcy.  Defending the suits diverts resources from drug development.  Many suits, probably the large majority, are not based on corporate malpractice, but on junk science, sympathetic plaintiffs and jury emotions.

During the 1970's and 1980's, trial lawyers and their lawsuits nearly ended vaccine availability in the US. Only a last minute tort reform law passed by Congress, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, allowed vaccines to remain readily available in the US.

We should not end liability and tort lawsuits; it is a necessary check on business. But the system we have today is very badly broken, and must be reformed at the Federal level.

We need drugs and vaccines a lot  more than we need more lawsuits."

Therapeutic drugs will be the key to reducing the death toll from this disease. And yet scant attention and resources have been devoted to them. There are drugs available now that have shown great promise in treating this disease. Institutional resources should be focused on getting these out into the field ASAP.

The first two, Leronlimab and Aviptadil are just finishing phase three testing and will be the first drugs to successfully treat serious/critical Covid cases 
(and quite possibly long haulers too).
The third drug Ivermectin may well treat all stages of 
the disease. This drug was characterized in this article 
as merely promising and was unfairly associated with Hydroxychloroquine. There is a wealth of accumulating evidence that supports the use of Ivermectin.The same doctors who advocated using Dexamethasone for months before finally being listened to (Dr Kory and Dr Marik) 
are now advocating the use of Ivermectin for all stages of Covid. We shouldn't wait months this time, before taking their advice.

These three drugs, when used properly, will make a massive difference in reducing the hospitalization rate and the death toll. The sooner they are used, the better for us all.
We don't have to wait for 2022... 
We can address this situation now!"

Ask anyone who has ever worked on influenza- we have never been good at treating severe forms of viral pneumonia.  Until we have a finer understanding of the human immune system, a true life saving treatment for late-stage COVID-19 will likely remain out-of-reach."

The compound in the spray, a lipopeptide developed by researchers and the directors of the Center for Host Pathogen Interaction, is designed to prevent the new coronavirus from entering host cells.  According to Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 
""The antiviral lipopeptide is inexpensive to produce, has a long shelf life, and does not require refrigeration. These features make it stand out from other antiviral approaches under development, including monoclonal antibodies. The new nasal lipopeptide could be ideal for halting the spread of COVID in the United States and globally; the transportable and stable compound could be especially key in rural, low-income, and hard-to-reach populations.""  An earlier article in the NY Times, ""Nasal Spray Prevents Covid Infection in Ferrets, Study Finds,"" also talks about this, saying that ""If the spray, which the scientists described as nontoxic and stable, is proved to work in humans, it could provide a new way of fighting the pandemic. A daily spritz up the nose would act like a vaccine."""
2021-01-30 19:12:38,"Judging by a lot of these comments, it’s not just at the Federal level that we fouled this up.

The various networks that flash folk remedies, pseudo-sciences, conspiracy theories, and the typical, “I saw in Reader’s Digest that they have a CURE because they tested it in a lab someplace, on six monkeys, and a guy in Decatur, Illinois,” claims have worked all too well to get in the way at every level from wearing a mask up to Trump’s crazy notions and interferences. 

And all too often, they’ve been fanned by a very large “natural cures and vitamins,” industry that may not be as gigundo as the dreaded Big Pharm, but is in there pitching. Generally without the inconveniences of regulation and actual research. 

I guess you have to expect that in a pandemic like this, people are going to be scared, and that’s going to turn up the volume on the traditional nuttinesses. 

But gee, I sure wish that folks’d settle down a little, compose themselves better, take the public health measures we’ve known about for a century, and skip playing scientist."
2021-01-30 19:17:50,"The so-called South African variant appears to be more contagious, more virulent, and more resistant to current vaccines. Some South Africans who contracted and recovered from the initial variant have been RE-INFECTED by the ""South African"" variant; that would merely set the whole world back to square one if this mutation achieves global predominance. And of course it's charging across the USA, having been found among South Carolinians with no recent travel history. More over, it appears that this mutation may not have originated in South Africa.
The new Johnson & Johnson vaccine may not be available for a full month--more inexplicable bureaucratic inertia--or foot-dragging to ensure greater market share for Pfizer and Moderna?  This is maddening. People are dying and suffering. You think ""get-along/go-along Joe"" is going to try to supercharge this approval dance? Keep dreaming.
The chaotic, fragmented, rollout of the vaccines is merely an extension of the overall incompetence and corruption in evidence in the COVID response: putting commercial and corporate interests ahead of human lives in both cases. It's dismaying and discouraging, but hardly surprising. Neoliberalism is a death trip--and that trip is now accelerating very quickly barring a miraculous seizure of sanity and decency among the global elites, so accustomed to deference to the private sector that they have lost the will or the competence to govern, even in the midst of a worldwide emergency."

2021-01-30 21:39:23,"The run amok-immune response(cytokine storm) that kills and sickness many covid patients has been well documented for the past 15 years at least. It all started with Dengue.  Doctors and researchers couldn't  figure out why many people especially children would only get a very mild case after their first exposure to Dengue and then either get extremely sick or die after the second or third exposure.  This culminated after Sanofi Pasteur began vaccinating  people in 2016 and by 2017 in the Philippines, hundreds of kids were dying after their vaccinations.  Turns out the same culprit was responsible- their immune system, just as Covid has been doing now to people of al ages . My question is: Why hasn't something been done all of these years? The medical community had over 15 years to  develop drugs to counter act the ""cytokine storm"".  Personally, i think it was a third world problem , why bother dealing with it  since the drug companies couldn't make money off of poor people.  Now that covid has affected the ""White"" first worlders , everyone is scrambling for the piece of the profit-pie. It's seems plain as day to me."
2021-01-30 18:34:57,"The CDC just issued an order, requiring masks on all transportation.

“The CDC says it reserves the right to enforce the order through criminal penalties but ""does not intend"" to primarily rely on them. Instead, it ""encourages and anticipates widespread voluntary compliance as well as support from other federal agencies in implementing additional civil measures enforcing the provisions"" of its order, ""to the extent permitted by law and consistent with"" an executive order President Joe Biden signed last Thursday.”

The order is about 10 months too late, but we’ll take it. Mask wearing is the surest way out of this, ten times more effective than any drug. It’s simplistic: the virus gets into your body through your nose, mouth or eyes, cover them up and the virus has a very hard time getting through the mask of the person who is sick , traveling through the air and then getting through your mask. That’s how simple it is.

With the new variants, and none of us wanting to start all over again, isn’t it time for the federal government to implement those criminal penalties...AND MAKE EVERYONE WEAR A MASK..we’ve been gently encouraging people for 10 months now, that’s long enough to know that gentle encouragement isn’t working."
2021-01-30 18:38:54,"Excellent summarization of the ineptitude of all our governmental scientific institutions. The disconnect between pharmaceutical research and doctors on the ground is startling. While Dr. Woodcocks admission appears very honest, it is obvious that continuing on with the same obviously deficient strategists in Biden’s regime would be entirely detrimental. Hopefully scientists will feel humbled enough not to aim for the Nobel first and the virus second as the team who bungled the release of the first covid tests did. Biden’s team appears fabulous. There is hope in learning about the many ugly deficiencies Trump and the Republican senators unleashed on the US. My fervent hope is for simple initial measures to be financed. Perhaps UVC radiation to kill viral aerosols without harming human tissues, other inhaled aerosols that may reduce the initial dosage of any virus into human cells, initial antivirals that act on viruses on immediate entry and of course the vaccinations which will be hopefully advantageous once someone manages to acquire an infection. One cannot stick all funding in the vaccine basket as if it is magic. We need to approach this problem at each stage of attack and infection. So glad if the present committee will finally have a national manifesto for dealing with this virus."

2021-01-30 19:09:15,"With all due deference to the author, the lack of effective antivirals is not for lack of attention or money. Since SARS in 2002-2003, through MERS, and even now any number of antivirals have been tried on coronaviruses, largely without success. Even our “ win” remdesivir, really isn’t that helpful in my experience. But we have looked at quite a few.

The issue is two fold. One, we are not good at stopping viral replication with coronaviruses. Perhaps more germane to our pandemic is that people generally don’t die viremic. Most people who get Covid-19 get an exaggerated cold. Most people get over it without incident. But in an unlikely few we get a second  bimodal response. An immune system run amok, where lungs and blood vessels get overwhelmed with immune substrates. That is why Decadron probably works so well.

Even with an effective antiviral, you would need to start it incredibly early, perhaps as soon as the day before you get symptoms. Which is silly. If on the first day you got symptoms, before your immune status is super primed, maybe if you had a test at the first sniffle that said you had coronavirus, they might work. But how many people with a demo/rhino/enter overuses are you going to test.

Early on we realized the best way to protect the unfortunate few who will have severe Covid is to prevent them from getting it. Isolate. Mask. Vaccinate"

2021-01-30 18:58:46,"In all the focus on novel therapeutic drugs to fight coronavirus, public health professionals seem to have lost focus entirely on promising prophylactic measures to prevent people from contracting the disease in the first place. The reason older people are particularly vulnerable to the disease is hardly mysterious: they simply have deficient immune systems. Nor is the reason for this a mystery either: their immune systems have only 50% or less of the key molecule NAD+ in their cells than do the immune systems of younger adults. NAD levels are easily raised by any one of a class of B-vitamin derivatives including nicotimanide riboside (NR), nicotimanide mononucleotide (NMN) and niacinimide—all safe, relatively inexpensive and available over the counter. Why research hasn’t focused more intensely on prevention with these and other so-called “nutraceuticals” is hardly mysterious either, as they aren’t nearly as lucrative as the “magic bullets” Big Pharma and its political allies favor."
2021-01-30 19:01:54,"The real article we need s not about missed opportunities on therapeutics. The article we need, is the one that starts a public discussion on what can be done to make people wear masks.

Masks will buy us all the time we need to vaccinate everybody, while keeping the variants from spreading.

Everywhere that masks are tried with 100 percent compliance they keep the virus from spreading. Most recently masks have been shown to stop the virus from spreading inside schools.

So what can we do?
Biden’s national Mask Mandate hasn’t gotten one person who wasn’t wearing a mask to change their actions.
So, step 2: penalties and fines across the board.
One thousand dollar fine for not wearing a mask outside the house 
100,000 dollar fine for hosting a party in your house .

That should do it. Even very stupid people understand when money is taken from them."

This can be changed, China won't be anymore the factory of the world because it's clearly a huge disaster, could you pay the same Covid price a second or third time ??? I don't think so, the world can't afford another bill like this, otherwwise it's the end of all civilisation on earth."

In the future, when we aren't in a pandemic situation, the work that is currently in progress to develop good treatments for COVID will be critical - helping those folks who contract the virus recover faster. Counterintuitively, it's far more difficult to develop these treatments than to create vaccines. As another poster said, how many truly effective treatments do we have for folks who have influenza? Essentially nothing. 

Obviously COVID-19 is far more than an upper respiratory disease, and the broad impact of this virus means that it's critical to determine what works well, and why. Gotta run the studies for this - and those take time, even going faster than ever before. If we're lucky to find existing medicines that work well for some - bonus. But they can't be worse than the cure (e.g. hydroxycloroquinine), because that just ends up hurting people worse!"
2021-01-30 23:03:34,"The various pharmaceutical companies know how to make drugs that are protease inhibitors. Antiviral drugs that are protease inhibitors have proved to be very effective against HIV. Over time little to no resistance to this class of antivirals has developed. Rhinoviruses (common cold) have a protease called C-3 and protease inhibitors have been developed, Agouron/Pfizer. Coronaviruses has a protease so similar to Rhinovirus that it is also called C-3. The point is that the research pathway to develop this kind of antiviral drug has already been well established. Coronavirus protease inhibitors will almost certainly be effective. A nationalized to find a protease inhibitor that is effective against Covid-19 should have been initiated 10 months ago.  
There is no reason that with a nationalized effort this couldn't have already been accomplished with an antiviral drug in clinical trials."

Yet, a previous article in the NYT uncovered the fact that they were often sitting in freezers instead of being used, especially in hard hit areas were all the focus was on finding ICU beds for an influx of patients, and is now shifting to vaccination. Is that still the case? Can we get an update on that?
Because if scientist develop treatments, but these treatments remain unused due to the inability of hospitals to focus on delivering them, we're not going to get very far."
2021-01-30 23:54:14,"There are funding problems, responsible for the lack of progress with drugs vs vaccines. But they aren't just about cash amounts. Vaccines, including mRNA ones, aren't really that specific to the virus. Yes, the antigen is specific to the virus, but the platforms aren't. You noticed that pretty much all vaccines focus on 1 target, spike protein. The changes, if any, introduced are also pretty much the same - the two proline substitutions to ""fix"" the spike protein in the ""prefusion"" conformation (UniQuest tried to be cute and used ""molecular clamp"" made out of HIV gp42 with predictably disastrous results). Basically once the virus genome sequence is out, it's all straightforward from here. With drugs there are two major paths: try to ""disable"" the virus, or try to mitigate the body response to it. Since both require a deep specific understanding, these paths are way less straightforward. With only superficial idea of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 infection causing aberrant immune/inflammatory response the search for drugs was down to ""repurposing"" - throwing everything and the kitchen sink at the patients to see if anything sticks. Expectedly already designed/tested for something else, the search for drugs in the old toolbox didn't yield much. Designing drugs against virus itself went down the same road of ""repurposing"", because till this month there was no efficient in vitro system to do high throughput/high resolution screening of drug candidates."

As this article points out, his administration neglected so many other aspects of fighting a disease that we as a country will be living with for many years to come, even if we are successful in getting the vast majority of the country vaccinated in this, what is likely to be, first wave. All signs I see point to a world with COVID being like the flu, something you have to get a shot for on a regular basis."
2021-01-30 22:53:51,"This article left me with more questions than answers.

Why the ACTIV-2 study, the federally funded COVID treatment research organized by the NIH, isn’t mentioned is beyond me. Could the authors please explain why this was left out of the article?

Compared to prevention, it feels the treatment side of COVID research wasn’t a robustly funded. And according to this article, it wasn’t. $18.5 billion vs.$8.2 billion. As a veteran of the HIV treatment research endeavor, that’s not surprising.

But to say nothing went on that was federally funded or coordinated is a big oversight in this reporting. A potential oblique reference to us, “monoclonal antibodies” hardly covers it, and is dismissive."

Most trials of CCP in the U.S. have been given to patients on death's door, weeks into the disease. Libster's trial in NEJM was conducted in Argentina in 2020 as a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Why is this information not getting out there and why isn't the FDA and NIH and CDC touting this more?

Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (made by Eli Lilly and Regeneron) can also be given early at outpatient infusion centers within 10 days of symptoms or a positive COVID test. CCP and these antibodies are passive immunity which have been around for about 100 years. Research shows also that these treatments can be used prophylactically.

The reason? Instead of opening the world's research to the world' researchers, everyone had to start from scratch, rather than building on routes shown to be successful.
Controlled capitalism is the ideal way to develop most products.
But when humanity itself is at stake, use controlled socialism to develop a product everyone will need, then pay all those who follow successful formulae per dose manufactured.
Sure, there would be need for substantial seed money to get the ball rolling, but now that we have results, concentration on the controlled capitalist side - manufacture with profits limited - is what we need.

My point here is that I get the impression that new drugs are being produced in rapid succession, and I think from some information I have read that it involves new compounds that are rapidly patented, and then sent through some trial method that FOCUSES ON MONEY.

And yet in a pandemic that already is approaching a half a million people dead within a year-  (the US alone) when we talk about treatments including mass produced antibodies we hear how logistically problematic it is to get the treatment to the patient. And in the mean time it is largely us older folks dying. Things would likely be moving much more swiftly regarding treatments if children and young adults (young workers) in society were dying in large numbers. We older folks are expected to die, and some in power probably see us doing so as economically enhancing.

The cumulative case fatality rate in the USA is  34 times higher than in Singapore, and 29 times higher than in Thailand. Even assuming the USA catches more cases than either Singapore or Thailand (unlikely), the outcome for someone diagnosed with Covid 19 in these Far Eastern countries is normally far better. In part this is because Singapore and Thailand have been far more willing to experiment, and far less willing to shove a respirator down the throat when a cytokine storm is the root issue. For those with the most severe consequences of Covid 19, hospitals in the Far East have been willing to use off the shelf drug cocktails to fight the damaging immune system response. Early in the pandemic, best practices were traded across borders in SE Asia. Did arrogance prevent the American medical profession from asking how these low death rates were being achieved?

We still know very little about this virus and all the reasons for the effects it causes in the human body. Such basic science work would also lead to new anti-viral drugs (topic of this article), improved vaccines, and a better understanding of the alarming new mutants.

Thousands of innocent have perished in this country because of that narcissist declaring in the very beginning COVID was a hoax.

2021-01-31 18:33:16,"This is a discouraging article.  The arrogance to believe that science is like a supermarket where you buy what you need is wrong. Science and medicine are the search for truth with much uncertainty.  Research has uncertain results.  Just think Nixon declared war on cancer and while many advancements have been made we still have cancer.  Believing that better planning and management results in better treatments is arrogant.  Better planning and management helps  improve the chances of finding cures, but it does not guarantee them.   I always tell people that research is like a lottery, you spend money but the return is uncertain.  You can spend a lot of money learning a lot of things don't work."

The UK’s NHS has been responsible for virtually all of the organized clinical trials with clinically relevant endpoints that are ‘powered’ enough (ie, enough patients in both placebo and drug groups) to show conclusive results. 

They are the ones who demonstrated that dexamethasone is a viable treatment for Covid 19 and when it is the proper time to give this intervention.

2021-02-02 22:47:20,"This is really disappointing. The vaccine program is going to save their bacon but to have absolutely NOTHING for treating covid at this point other than standard pneumonia care is really sad. 

The story isn't critical enough of NIH. Yes normally NIH thinks in terms of decades, not months, but that needed to change in early 2020, and it didn't. 

There were researchers around the country ready to start trials when there were plenty of patients, and NIH didn't even return their phone calls, let alone offer any funding or support. 

The Hydroxychloroquine question should have been answered by summer 2020, but it lingered because NIH did no trial of any kind. The only drug NIH showed any interest in was Remdesivir and that was because of the close relationship between Gilead and NIH officials -- but even now the evidence in favor of Remdesivir is very thin."
2021-02-02 23:17:53,"What you missed in the article is the RECOVERY trial in UK which in partnering with NHS showed the efficacy of Dexamethasone and also showed the HCQ and Convalescent plasma  are not effective. In fact, they recruited over 30K patients with very little money in a few months. In fact, if it weren't for the RECOVERY/SOLIDARITY trials, the death toll would have doubled! NIH clearly need to take some lessons from NHS.

It is unfathomable that NIH/CDC which is the largest research funding agency in the world (44 billion/year) and home to the best scientists in the world couldn't even come up with a decent drug trial even after a year of the pandemic that killed almost half a million in US!!

Certainly an interesting time to be pregnant, to say the least."
2021-02-02 18:41:16,"As someone who has been pregnant twice in the past year, this has also been a big question for us. A friend suggested that pre-conception should be a priority category for getting the vaccine. I know it would ease a lot of couples' minds if we could get the the vaccine quickly before trying to get pregnant, rather than potentially waiting another 9-12 months to get vaccinated after giving birth. Not realistic, I know. Also nytimes, please consider using ""pregnant people"" instead of ""pregnant women."" Thank you for your reporting on this issue."

The known adverse effects of COVID are far greater to me and my family than the unknowns of the vaccine. I had a robust immune response to the second dose, requiring a day off of work. But now I feel extremely relieved that both I and my unborn child are protected from a virus that has killed hundreds of thousands or people in this country."

I am glad that they left this decision up to me."

I think a major reason that pregnant women in the US may be skeptical of the vaccine is because of how pregnant women are given medical advice generally.  For all other aspects of pregnancy, women are urged/shamed into being extremely cautious if there isn't data to confirm that something is safe (I've felt anxiety over having a cup of chamomile tea because ""there isn't sufficient data"" to show that it's safe).  Emphasizing that the risks of contracting coronavirus are greater than the risks of vaccination is key.

Also, the article seems to imply that all vaccines are safe during pregnancy (""Vaccines are generally considered to be safe...""). 
 Some (like flu shot and Tdap) are safe and encouraged during pregnancy, but there are vaccines that are not recommended during pregnancy because of the presence of a live virus (MMR and chicken pox) or because of ""insufficient data"" (see the CDC site).  There's no reason to think that the COVID vaccines are unsafe, but this statement about all vaccines in the article may make pregnant readers skeptical of the other information.  It might be better to explain to the layperson why the COVID vaccines are different from MMR and chicken pox.

2021-01-29 14:19:01,"The implications of the mutations, which affect the efficacy of the vaccines, appear to show that we’ll be living with this virus for the long term, with new vaccines yearly. The dilemma is since this virus is much more contagious, and deadly than the normal flu, do mid-aged and older adults ever take the risk of attending sporting events or concerts again? Not certain I’ll be comfortable packed in with many screaming strangers, knowing my vaccine offers 50% protection against whatever the latest yearly mutation brings."
2021-01-29 14:20:36,I’d opt for the J&J vaccine. It seems to be effective in preventing severe cases or deaths and I think that’s good enough. Given the chance to take a single shot I’d rather do this. I won’t be eligible for the vaccine for quite some time given that I don’t fit in any priority group that’s been planned for. So I’ll be watching for this one.
2021-01-29 14:27:36,"Personally, I will not take this vaccine knowing there are options available that are far more effective and you only get the one chance at it, even if that means waiting in my house another 5-6 months. I wonder how these stats will impact interest from the population at large"
2021-01-29 14:28:21,"What are the actual numbers of infected people, how many from the vaccinated group, how many from the placebo group, margins of error? We must understand that real-world use will not follow exactly these trial results, as we have seen, trials in different countries have different results, by age group, etc. We are actually entering the Phase 4 of vaccine development, when millions of people are vaccinated and then one has actual results, including efficacy and safety."
2021-01-29 14:28:55,"This vaccine is certainly promising and can help the U.S. achieve herd immunity, which is fantastic.  But with a 72% effective vaccine that drops 57% against variants, I would not rely on it personally.  If it's all that I can get it's better than nothing, but with this one no restaurants, no sporting events, nothing, until the rate of community transmission is near zero.  I would much rather get the more effective Moderna or Pfizer vaccine than this one, which seems far inferior."
2021-01-29 14:31:19,"Given that J&J is fridge stable and a single dose but a little less effective, why not distribute this broadly (e.g., doctor's offices, medical groups) and open up administration to the low-risk general public.  Around 100M shots going into the arms more quickly would push us towards herd immunity while saving Pfizer / Moderna shots for more at-risk popuations."
2021-01-29 14:32:46,"I think people need to realize that there's a difference between overall efficacy and efficacy against severe cases. That it is 57% effective in preventing transmission doesn't mean the vaccine failed for 43%. Influenza vaccines do almost nothing to prevent transmission, and yet reduce hospitalization by 40-60%. This one reduces severe cases by 85% even against the variants while cutting transmission by more than half. That's a huge win in my book."
2021-01-29 14:34:33,"It appears vaccines are working, but less effectively against the virus variants that are emerging. This is not unusual, the influenza virus mutates rapidly, and so it's necessary to have annual flu shots.  (Surprisingly, many choose not to, but that's a separate discussion).

The pharmaceutical companies are able to respond; it is  a truly extraordinary accomplishment that the vaccines we have today were developed from scratch by multiple drug companies in less that a year.

It should be obvious that for all their problems, the United States and the world badly needs an agile and viable pharmaceutical industry.

In the US, drug companies face a real and existential threat: American trial lawyers. In the years prior to the pandemic, lawyers filed literally tens of thousands of lawsuits, each for billions of dollars, against drug companies, including vaccine developer Johnson and Johnson. Most of these suits were likely based on bogus science, and won through jury emotions.

This litigation can (and does) bankrupt companies.  A few decades ago lawsuits nearly shut down vaccine production in the US; only a last minute liability reform law passed by Congress in 1986, the Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, allowed vaccine availability in the US to continue.

Today, once again, we need tort reform at the Federal level to allow vaccine and drug development to continue.  

The simple truth is we need continued development of vaccines more than we need lawsuits."
2021-01-29 14:35:28,"We need a huge effort to educate people on the effects that compounding has on disease spread or cure.  Not emphasizing the individual efficacy of a particular vaccine. 

Having people waiting two or three months to get the “better” vaccine will have a profound effect - increases the number of deaths and the chances for mutations. We need review and approve these three new vaccines as soon as safely possible, so as much as we can to make vaccines mandatory and then once we have reached our capacity, vaccinate the rest of the world. 

If anything, COVID has opened my eyes to how many people we lose to fly each year. This is our chance to reduce the number of COVID strains, which in turn will control how much damage this virus dies every year going forward. 

I don’t think we can eradicate COVID, but it does seem that we can make it less deadly than the flu if we vaccinate aggressively and globally right now."
2021-01-29 14:40:26,"I never understood why they have the same number of vaccine and placebo participants in all the tests if the intent is to quickly achieve an accurate estimate of effectiveness.  For example, if your first estimate is 90% effectiveness, you would want the vaccine group to be 9 times the size of the control group so they would both achieve an accurate number of infections at the same time (which would be about half as long as a 50/50 group).  The result would be a much more accurate estimate much sooner."
2021-01-29 14:42:13,"So it comes down to corporate greed.  J&J developed a vaccine with a lower efficacy rate than others already in use.  Why would the FDA grant emergency approval and a billion dollars for a vaccine that can, at best, be described as good enough?  You don’t get an A (and a billion dollars) for C+ work.  Send them back to the drawing board, and for the money they’ve already received from the government, they should open their manufacturing facilities to the companies that can make vaccines with a higher efficacy rate.  To do otherwise is simply offering corporate welfare to J&J while gambling with people’s lives.  Good enough should not be good enough in a pandemic."
2021-01-29 14:42:19,"I see this as good news. Another vaccine in the arsenal against Covid. Even if its efficacy is lower than desired, it is better than having no vaccines available. The more vaccines, the greater number of vaccinated people."
2021-01-29 14:43:40,"As long as there is a place for this virus to hide, in places where there is not enough of a highly effective vaccine, everyone, vaccinated or not,  remains vulnerable to the next mutant. New mutants can find their way around the world in a matter of a few weeks, and that’s barely enough time even to characterize them, let alone concoct a vaccine against them.  If this virus was more stable, ordinary public health measures might be effective enough to bring the pandemic under control.  But the situation seems to be far worse, we can see that the virus is getting ahead of us.  The response around the world continues to be too timid and too slow.  We are living in an extreme emergency without mounting a sufficiently urgent response.  This is, finally, a real emergency."
2021-01-29 14:44:24,"statistics are always dangerous.   Nobody knows other vaccines' efficacy agains the variants first specified in the UK and South Africa.        The J&J single dose did not prevent everybody in the trial from getting the virus, but NOBODY in the entire group that was vaccinated had serious illness : a 100% saved rate.     I would rather have a vaccine in which 40% (I am in south africa)  get the disease but 0% get seriously ill / die."
2021-01-29 14:45:20,"Weird. J&J didn't release the actual data i.e. What is N and what is the number of people who got sick with and without the vaccine in that cohort? One needs that information to evaluated the effectiveness. One can't just take J&J's word for this, as one needs to know what level of significance they used. For instance, Pfizer user 90% significance and Moderna used 50% significance when calculating the effectiveness. In Moderna's case if they had used 90% it would have only meant a few percentage points lower but they obviously were trying to match Pfizer so they lowered the significance. I wonder what J&J is up to here."
2021-01-29 14:48:14,"""The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease, regardless of what variant caused it,""...That is a very critical element and it is very good news. The next important question is, did the people who were vaccinated and got the variant anyway develop protective antibodies to the variant after their infection? Going forward the role for an effective antiviral drug would seem to be a critical element in the medical armament. Where is it? Why hasn't the government initiated a nationalized program to support its development? We know that protease inhibitors have proved to be effective antivirals in the past (HIV). The coronavirus protease is an obvious and doable target."
2021-01-29 14:49:33,"I don’t get it. 

Why isn’t J&J producing either Moderna or Pfizer vaccines? Both have a higher efficacy than the new J&J vaccine.

Why would we settle for a vaccine that is less efficacious than the two benchmarks?"
2021-01-29 14:55:27,"With the current rate of mutation, and the impossibility of vaccinating everyone on Earth anytime soon, it sounds as though those of us lucky enough to live in developed countries should plan on yearly vaccinations that are adjusted for the variants. 

More importantly we need to triple down on a global public health effort. How we do that, while also fighting global warming, will be the challenge that defines Gen Z."
2021-01-29 14:55:45,"My question is do I have a choice about which vaccine I get? I can understand the need to vaccinate as many people as possible, but I see an aura of inequity beginning to form with the introduction of easy to store and administer, but far less effective vaccines coming to market. Better than nothing is good, but not good enough. If I got only this vaccine, nothing in my life would change: no travel, no restaurants, no concerts or plays, no in person shopping."
2021-01-29 14:55:46,"The 95% initial efficacy of  Modera and Pfizer was published by vendors in the US and reviewed and approved by FDA  using the data without independent verification. 

 Had these mRNA vaccine tests were performed in the same manner in different countries with different strains, the efficacy rate might be much lower as Modera has found out recently in South Africa and Brazil.  Furthermore, these results are more reasonable and also in-line with the results in Turkey, Brazil, Peru, Indonesia, UAE and etc from the vaccine made in China."
2021-01-29 14:59:30,"We are leading the world in Covid vaccine doses administered. We are second only to the UK in percentage of the population vaccinated in a large country. We are using vaccines with mid- 90's percent efficacy. Our production of Vaccines increases everyday and the ground game to translate doses into jabs in the arm builds and refines everyday.   The best defense against variants and mutations is vaccination and we are on it. Give the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the under 25 cohort where the serious illness and death rates have been akin to a bad flu season. 57 of the 22,000 death in NYC were of people under 25. under 25 with co-morbidities get the higher efficacy vaccines. the word to everyone is, wait your turn and stay vigilant in mask wearing and distancing. We are within months of beating this thing."
2021-01-29 14:59:58,"US and EU healthcare approach is puzzling. We have spent billions of vaccine research, billions on expensive new drugs like Remdesivir, billions on ventilators, billions locking people up in lockdowns and zero on early at home treatment. 

If you get Covid, what are you asked to do? Stay home and call the hospital when it’s too late and you cannot breathe. That is criminal. We would not tell someone with heart disease to wait until they have a heart attack to seek help, would we? 

We need to wake up from this obsession on the vaccine and recognize that our current treatment can be improved, lives can be saved even without a vaccine and that a vaccine is not going to be a panacea. Coronavirus diseases have been with humanity for a long time and they are unlikely to be eradicated by a vaccine. Anyone ever eradicate the common cold, another coronavirus? 

We need more coverage of at home, pre hospitalization treatments as that is what will relieve pressure on our healthcare system and reduce the fear in our population."
2021-01-29 15:04:04,"The time to stop being lax about masking and social distancing, and businesses that are flouting compliance regulations and shutdown orders is now.  We are not going to vaccinate our way out of this. Vaccination will play its part, but we need stiff and effective compliance enforcement in every state. And the sustained federal aid to individuals, businesses and localities to make that possible. Wishing and hoping there won't be yet more dangerous and transmissible variants than even the South African one is not going to cut it. Even if we vaccinate at impossible rates and reach 100% of our population, the virus will still be mutating in other parts of the world. And even more variants will get here sooner or later. Before that, we must reach a level where testing, contact tracing and quarantining can work."
2021-01-29 15:12:22,"Once again, I have to ask, why would anyone want a vaccine that's 72% effective when they could get one that's 94% effective?  Why can't the U.S. government force Pfizer to license their technology to other labs to make their vaccine?  Why are we re-inventing the wheel, and a square wheel at that?"
2021-01-29 15:13:15,"What isn't known at this time is whether the variants will cause severe COVID in people who are vaccinated.  This is a point of hope.  Scientists have been hoping that this coronavirus will become like the four endemic coronaviruses that produce cold like symptoms and not death.  As the variants become the dominant strain, we will see how well vaccinated individuals hold up against the new strains.  Right now, we just need people to develop strong immunological response via vaccines.  We can hope that once the world has developed antibodies to SARS-CoV2, all future strains will be no more than a cold."
2021-01-29 15:14:27,"It’s 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death, just after a single shot and without any need for ultra-cold refrigeration. Given how chaotic the vaccination rollout has been, it’s great news indeed!"
2021-01-29 15:32:24,We need to greatly expand the genetic testing for the South African variant.  Then robust contact tracing and mandatory quarantining.  Make international travelers quarantine at their own expense for 10 days as they do in Australia.  Discourage people from traveling unless absolutely essential. Otherwise it is just a matter of time until the predominant virus strains mutate to where the vaccines lose effectiveness.
2021-01-29 15:35:42,"This kind of news is confusing and makes people wary of taking any vaccine at all. One reason so many hospital staff members don't want to get vaccinated yet is these vaccines aren't FDA approved. They were approved for emergency use.

The previous Adm. deserves credit for helping develop them, then utterly dropped the ball. Biden was left with an empty cupboard and colossal mess. The White House needs to clarify the messaging to allay some of the confusion."
2021-01-29 15:36:54,"The article mentions that the adenovirus approach has been tried for decades without success, but doesn't mention why. Adenovirus delivery has been attempted for gene therapy, but has been plagued by extremely serious adverse reactions including death and permanent neurological damage. No thanks. I will be taking an mRNA vaccine sometime in the (distant?) future when I am able."
2021-01-29 15:38:04,"The fact the this vaccine only requires one dose and does not require freezers, makes it ideal for mass workspace inoculations. Vehicles could go to meat packing plants, agricultural fields even grocery stores and vaccinate everyone quickly"
2021-01-29 15:47:05,"It sure looks to me like J&J's initial results mean that two doses of any of the coronavirus vaccines are optimal and that proof will come with their two dose study. Certainly Novavax's two dose study shows protection against the original strain that is nearly/probably equivalent to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines - really that is a nice proof of concept that immunity to Spike is critical.

Regarding the lower rate of protection (Novavax) against the South African variant, it is still worth noting that the rate of severe Covid 19 among recipients was very low. So, looking on the bright side, wide implementation of both current vaccines and Novavax (and maybe two dose J&J) should reduce Covid 19 to something like a seasonal influenza - that healthcare systems can handle.

While the variants are clearly concerning to experts, applying an understanding of immunology to the emergence of variants is important to determining next steps. For example, T cell responses generated to the current vaccines are very likely sufficient to provide a basis for building immunity to new strains when vaccine recipients are exposed - even if antibodies are less efficient at neutralization. I see that as good news that should be communicated to the public."
2021-01-29 15:26:26,"Flu shots are only around 50-60% effective against the absolute latest strains, often less.  This is, all in all, still pretty good.  

Let's not fear monger NYT.  This will still be very effective in preventing death and getting the world back to normal.  Boosters annually will be required."
2021-01-29 14:23:52,"So maybe the glass is half full?   ""The vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease in all three regions where the trial was run: the United States, Latin America and South Africa."""
2021-01-29 14:29:10,Article really missed the most important part of the clinical results. No death from any Covid variant after 28 days following vaccination. How do you not highlight that fact!
2021-01-29 14:34:25,"This is a question.

I thought travel was restricted.  Are people still flying around the world and when they return to the U.S., why are they not in quarantine?"
2021-01-29 14:43:07,I don't want this vaccine.
2021-01-29 15:39:20,The drug companies are going to be riding the Covid money train for as long as possible. Variant after variant we will have new vaccines to be made. This is shaping up to be like getting a flu shot every year.
2021-01-29 14:25:06,"Don't shoot me as they say I'm just the messenger, but we have 5 vaccines now, Moderna, AZ, Pifzer, J&J, and then Novabax?Yet, none can say it prevents passing the virus on to others, can say how long does the efficacy last, why those under 18 can take the shot, in other words we take these shots so we don't catch it and get badly sick. I'm glad we have something to fight the virus but there are so many unanswered questions, and of course no one wants to talk about the variants, up to three that have alarmed scientists. Are we really safe when the enemy changes their uniforms and are different?"
2021-01-29 15:05:47,a virus that is mutating faster than we can counter it.  this is our worst nightmare.
2021-01-29 15:20:15,"This article fails to state clearly that 72% efficacy refers to CLINICAL DISEASE (symptoms).   This is important because: 1) you may still be INFECTED (and contagious) even if vaccinated; 2) it confuses people, so that they may feel no need to wear masks after vaccination.

The failure to state--clearly--when efficacy refers to clinical symptoms, seems to be very common across a variety of media.   Hopefully, the NYTs will correct this in the future .   It's a fundamental caveat to any claims of effiacy."
2021-01-29 14:59:26,"The NYT should change the headline about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine offering ""strong protection"" with an efficacy rate of just 72% in the US and a measly 57% of the South Africa variant. 

Compared to the first vaccines given in the US the Johnson & Johnson does not offer ""strong"" protection.

The Moderna vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.1 %, while the Pfizer BioNTech has an efficacy rate of 95%.

In my opinion Johnson & Johnson should not  receive emergency clearance yet.

The distribution would only be more chaotic with two vaccines that are over 20% more effective versus one that leaves people more exposed to  get Covid-19."
2021-01-29 14:47:25,"If all of the vaccines including J & J's are over 90% effective at preventing the need for hospitalization and nearly 100% effective at preventing death from COVID-19 then that is a really huge win.

Would a trial using the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine initially and the J&J vaccine as shot #2 be useful? That might mean a much path to vaccination of everyone willing to take the shots."
2021-01-29 15:22:24,"As long as we have a system in place to know who got what vaccine, getting first doses into everybody as fast as we can should be the main priority. Then we will have breathing room to go back and give the second dose, which J&J may well recommend.

Note: having a system in place.  This cannot not be underestimated and blown off. Perhaps make it a color code for each person: just don't use red or blue."
2021-01-29 15:36:09,"Now we have choices. How we make them, and our subsequent behavior, is key to our national and worldwide recovery from the pandemic.

Back when trials were first starting and experts said that even 50% efficacy would be a success, I posed in a NYT letter the airplane question: Would I get vaccinated and then get on an airplane with a bunch of maskless vaccine deniers? No - 50% is not enough. Then we got the mRNA vaccines and the question seemed less relevant.

So now we have J&J about to enter the market, and we have virus variants in the population. Now the question seems relevant again. It's a vexing question, even for a science oriented vaccine supporter.

My wife, a doc, just got her second Moderna dose. Her boss is one of those experts, often on NPR, and lately suggesting a change a mind in favor of using a single dose of a mRNA vaccine to more quickly get at least some level of immunity in more people. I asked him how I should react to a protocol that was not part of the Phase 3 trials, an emergency change to a FDA Emergency Use Authorization. How should I behave after being vaccinated, once only?

So I pose the question again: When my wife gets on an airplane, if I got the J&J vaccine or a single does of mRNA, would I join her? I truly don't know. Nor do I know whether the international destinations we might choose will accept us or whether we would be let back in the USA. Should I accept the J&J vaccine, if it is offered, or wait for mRNA? Hard questions."
2021-01-29 15:01:08,"These comments are very helpful. Just goes to show that the experts really are flat footed in confronting a) mutating strains b) a lack of a coordinated response to distribution of vaccines. I hope that the Biden administration offers hope on two important fronts, lacking in 2020: 1.Following science and scientists and 2. Cooperation with such bodies as WHO on the world stage."
2021-01-29 14:54:51,"""The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease, regardless of what variant caused it, the company said. ""

That's the best news about this whole thing."
2021-01-29 14:38:28,"Sign me up (in fact, I tried to join the US trial for this vaccine, but it filled up)! -- a one-shot vaccine that can be stored in regular hospital freezers and can be delivered this year in massive quantities should be welcome news, even with numbers that appear less effective than the others. At 85% effective at preventing severe disease (INCLUDING the variants) it must not be dismissed. After all, we do not yet know how the currently approved vaccines will work against the new variants. We will not defeat this pandemic if people refuse available vaccines."
2021-01-29 14:43:15,"This is fantastic news. Before all the Debbie Downers chime in about weaker efficacy, consider this: ""The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease, regardless of what variant caused it, the company said."""
2021-01-29 15:19:38,"The levels of cognitive dissonance I see in some of the comments here are astonishing. A year ago, we had nothing to prevent this disease - zip, zero, nada. Within a year, in addition to two other very powerful vaccines we now have a shot that:

1) Only requires one dose;

2) Can be stored at normal refrigeration;

3) Is more effective at preventing infection than your typical flu shot (72 percent vs. 40-60 percent), and 

4)  Is highly effective against preventing severe or deadly cases of nearly all strains and variants.

This is miraculous. We should be rejoicing. And yet I see people grousing in comments about ""Why should I take a 72 percent shot when there's 90 percent ones out there?"" By all means, wait for your platinum designer boutique Covid vaccines. In the meantime, I'll gladly accept your dose of this ""inferior"" one.

As has been the case from the outside, the biggest obstacle to tackling the pandemic remains human foolishness."
2021-01-29 14:30:58,"Good enough, probably. Britain has ordered 30 million doses of Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen vaccine, with an option for 22 million more, I understand."
2021-01-29 15:25:36,"The percent effectiveness number has become too much of the headline, when obviously there’s so much more to the story. And the big question wasn’t even asked — could it be more effective as a two-dose vaccine?"
2021-01-29 14:41:15,"Sadly, many people in society have been primed by the media on expectations in many aspects of life that appear to be “revolving” rather than evolving, which in the contexts of this COVID-19 pandemic, there aren’t any exceptions, even with vaccinations."
2021-01-29 15:06:00,"I enjoy the NYT’s comment sections but question including one with this article.  How many readers have the expertise to offer a meaningful comment on what should or should not be done regarding vaccinations?  I do not.  

A person’s opinion regarding vaccination is not useful information.  Let science, and those with the expertise  to understand the science, determine what is done."
2021-01-29 15:49:26,"More cheerleading for a brand new, barely tested vaccine that we should be cautious about. Considering Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are about 95% effective, 72% effectiveness isn't strong at all. And we should not be comparing this virus to the flu in any way, not its symptoms, death rates, or vaccines. The efficacy of the flu vaccine has nothing to do with the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. Effectiveness of COVID vaccines should only be compared to one another."
2021-01-29 15:50:18,I think it is important to realize all these studies involved participants take the vaccine and use masks/social distancing and it is the combination that made them effective. Vaccine alone will not end the pandemic. Incidentally we have seen the first case of vaccine failure already so it imperative that we not abandon masks and NOT implement vaccine passports any time in the near future.
2021-01-29 15:54:05,"This is a marathon against the evolving virus, not a sprint.  It is naive to think we can get an effective vaccine first time and we are done.  To win this race over time, we need to ensure that the first vaccine shot lessens the risk of serious illness which the J&J vaccine appears to as do others. We also need to have it applied as quickly as possible to as many people as possible so that there are fewer targets for the virus as it mutates.  The mutations disproportionately occur in folks who get seriously sick and for a while so to reduce that number is really important.  This is war we are engaged in with a formidable microscopic enemy.  Time we act as a country and as a globe like we have to fight hard and long to win.  We have no other choice."
2021-01-29 15:54:40,"If the JJ vaccine had come out before Moderna and Pfizer it would be the preferred vaccine ! It is effective, has few if any side effects, it takes one dose and is effective after 14 days.

Compare it to Moderna vaccine. The Moderna is stronger and it’s 95 percent efficacy speaks for itself , but that extra power comes at a cost .Moderna takes 2 shots to be effective, it can take up to a month ( after first dose) to be fully protected . There are considerable side effects, especially after the second shot. Allergic reactions, and scientists are studying the cases of a few people who have died mysteriously a few days after the shot, it’s very rare but it’s something to think about and to worry about.

The JJ is also much easier to transport and store 

I am no Nostradamus but it’s pretty obvious that the JJ is going to be the vaccine everyone is going to want . I know this customer wants it and as soon as possible."
2021-01-29 15:55:30,"The J&J announcement is good news.  However, the US continues to fail in our preventative response relative to other nations.

As of January 26, the State Dept implemented mandatory testing for re-entry into the US within 3 days of travel.  That sounds like a step forward but it is not as reassuring as it may first appear.

The task has been left to the airline industry to validate testing.  All tests are not created equally and airline ticket agents are not in the best position to discern the credibility of the myriad COVID tests.  There are a number of different COVID tests on the market and the sensitivity (ability to detect true positives) and specificity (ability to detect true negatives) varies widely depending on the test.  

Additionally, a 3-day window does not guarantee COVID-free status at the time of travel.  

The State Dept still relies on a self-quarantining advisory after international travel.  A strong, mandatory, monitored quarantining period at traveler's expense is what other countries have implemented at great success. Until we do this, we will continue to seed the virus and the cycle of infection will continue longer than it needs to be.  Likely with more variants."
2021-01-29 15:58:31,"""The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease, regardless of what variant caused it, the company said."" This needs clarification... a person without vaccine already has about an 85% chance of having only mild or moderate symptoms. Earlier this morning there was a line saying none of the trial participants had to be admitted to the hospital - wouldn't that make the vaccine 100% effective against preventing severe disease?"
2021-01-29 15:58:46,These results were observed 28 after vaccination in the trial. The J&J vaccine may offer stronger protection beyond 28 days. Perhaps the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are more effective shortly after the second dose than the J&J vaccine shortly after the first and only dose.
2021-01-29 15:48:20,"These vaccines, all of them, have been rushed to market and are unproven.

I simply don’t understand the rush to get vaccinated with some Frankenstein vaccine when the chances of you dying from this virus is close to nothing.

I know for a fact I’ve been exposed to this virus several times, never got it, I’m not taking this vaccine or any other.￼￼￼"
2021-01-29 15:51:30,"So who wants to get in line for a less-effective vaccine? An 85% effective vaccine means you are THREE times as likely to develop COVID-19 (original strain) than for a 95% effective vaccine. There are way too many frightened people out there who won't accept the J&J vaccine. With 57% effectivity on the South African variant (Moderna & Pfizer/BnT haven't presented  
 numbers officially), J&J is a slightly better than 50/50 proposition, hardly a confidence builder. COVID, like all the other coronavirus flu strains is evolving. We're looking at probably 3 vaccination strains through 2023 to get this under control."
2021-01-29 15:54:06,My question is how long will any of the vaccines remain effective?  I guess we won't know for some time.
2021-01-29 16:08:50,"We still don't know if a vaccine will prevent the other damage (heart, kidney, brain) that comes from a mild infection. J and J's vaccine does allow mild infections in some. This is a big question for all vaccines, particularly this one. Mild infection without hospitalization has been proven to cause this other-than-lung-damage . This is the next question to be answered."
2021-01-29 14:24:26,"Your subtitle can be misleading. ""drops to just 57%"" implies 57% is terrible. At 57%, it is at par with flu vaccines over the years (50-60% efficacy).

More importantly, as a single shot vaccine without onerous cold chain requirements, this could be a game changer for all of us. That is not even mentioned in your title or subtitle!"
2021-01-29 14:35:23,"The mRNA vaccines area also about 60% effective after one dose.  I think the time has come to offer a single dose of the J&J vaccine to those willing to take it, and start working on booster vaccine doses covering the dangerous new variants.  I like the idea of over 90% effectiveness in preventing any illness from COVID-19, but what I am really concerned about is not being killed by the illness.

2021-01-29 16:06:27,Way less effective than other too apparently.  License J&J to make Moderna and/or Pfizer. That would be a lot more helpful/
2021-01-29 16:04:38,Kudo's to J&J's vaccine teams for producing their vaccine. America's pharmaceutical industry has pulled out all the stops in producing their vaccines in record time. And Joe Biden is putting all resources of the government towards ensuring that the rollout and distribution of the vaccines to Americans will happen ASAP when the vaccines are available. Super job!
2021-01-29 16:08:45,"These results my confirm that the mRNA vaccines with about 95% efficacy from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech provide a better vaccine technology going forward.

The South African variant may foreshadow a period in which we need booster shots for several years to continue to fight COVID.

Thus I view the J&J results as a disappointment.

Biden was wise to order extra doses of the mRNA vaccines."

it comparable to Moderna's or Pfizer's."

I know that when my number comes up months from now and I'm eligible to get a vaccine I'm going to pray it's not this one that's available for me.  I'd rather the government spend our money on the ones that have been over 90% effective."
2021-01-29 17:13:14,"Right now any safe and effective Covid vaccine is useful. We're still struggling to get to 2 million shots a day. And 85% efficacy in preventing serious disease is fabulous. Ask any doctor or nurse if they'd like to see only 1/6 the hospitalizations, deaths, and morbidity. They'd all jump at that."
2021-01-29 17:13:15,"This presents an ethical dilemma. Pfizer and Moderna are available and they are more effective. Who gets the less effective vaccines? Younger people? That assumes they don't care about their health, which is an ageist attitude. People in rural areas? Then they are then punished for not living in cities. People taking the vaccine care about their health. I don't see many people volunteering to take a less effective vaccine and whoever gets assigned the one shot dose will not be as protected."
2021-01-29 17:20:55,"I believe, as another commenter suggested, that the federal government should incentivize Pfizer and Moderna to produce and distribute their 95% effective vaccine, rather than approving a vaccine that is only 66% effective in preventing Covid."

2021-01-29 17:24:25,"Trouble is we are fighting a rear guard battle. Once the virus has widely spread, we are attempting to tamp it down. Certainly a necessity. But, as long as there is a widespread host of infected individuals, it is the nature of the virus to mutate putting into jeopardy our one tool of vaccination.

The only rational immediate step is a quarantine. Long ago we passed the point where local containment is effective. We face a far greater challenge. 

Governors (responding to pressure) have been torn between opening and the increased spread of the virus. As a result, our yo-yo approach has made both the viral pandemic and our economy worse. 

The cure is painful and simple. The virus has a life cycle. An individual becomes infected and sick. If they live, after a certain period of time they are no longer infectious. During that interval, for the virus to remain pandemic, that individual must spread the virus to others.  Whatever amount of time that life cycle takes, as a country, we must enter a near total quarantine. I would suggest for 3 life cycles of the virus. If we adhere to the quarantine, when we come out of it the virus will not have spread and it should be virtually eliminated. Planning needs to be in place to support individuals during a total quarantine.

That along with good public health measures was how China defeated the virus in Wuhan. An authoritarian enforcement was necessary but it worked."

2021-01-29 17:41:06,"Many people are writing their comments before thinking it through.  Unfortunately the headline of J&J 72% effective vs. 90% + for Pfizer and Moderna is not the whole story.  This is  tricky trial to run and comparisons of the vaccines is not that simple.   First, if we compare one dose of J&J vs. one dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine the effective rate of J&J is comparable.  Second, the results of the trials being compared are at a certain point in time where the rate of infection and increased contagiousness of the virus variants differ, that can skew the results toward less efficacy.  Third the key rate for the J&J vaccine is that of preventing severe illness (85%) and death (apparently 100%).  While we have not seen long term results it is thought that the long term ill effects (e.g. fatigue, organ compromise etc.) could be helped by the reduction of severe disease, certainly the reduction of hospital utilization by vaccinated patients is a real benefit.
I worked in the Pharmaceutical industry for many years, I am now 64 and in decent health, I would take the J&J vaccine today if available."
2021-01-29 17:52:10,"Even with its comparatively low efficacy rate, there are other advantages to the J&J vaccine. It may not be quite as effective, but it only requires a single dose and it doesn't require extreme refrigeration.

For the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, they have a narrow window for the second dose to achieve maximum efficacy. Many people will miss that window due to many possible factors. That can significantly impact efficacy.

I am not a medical professional, but I work for a healthcare organization in some of the logistics for the vaccination program. A single dose vaccine that can be kept in the refrigerator would make things far easier to manage, and ultimately a more successful vaccination program.

There is a large risk of spoiling and wasting the current vaccines getting them to rural areas without the health infrastructure needed. That includes places in the US but also around the world. Getting a slightly less effective vaccine to those areas is better than failing to get the current ones there.

We also have to consider the global approach, otherwise we deploy a vaccine in the US while the virus continues to spread and mutate around the world and just comes back to us in a form that our vaccines don't work against. We are already seeing that now.

That international effort is also why it's important to have a body like the WHO, even if it isn't perfect. It will be good to get the US back into a global leadership role."
2021-01-29 17:59:18,"All efforts should be focused on minimizing the spread rather than the death rate. That's unfortunate but is the only way to stay on top of the new mutants. 
Luckily the mutation rate is rather slow for the spike protein. But if the virus is replicating sufficiently fast, even with that mutation rate it can become resilient to the new vaccines faster than we can develop them. The higher the number of active cases, 
the more vaccine-resistant mutants will evolve.
 Stop all the rigid prioritization schemes or at the very least allow for the stand-by lines. Otherwise we'll never stop the pandemic and the total death rate will be much higher, not to mention permanent brain damage and other horrible symptoms."
2021-01-29 18:05:32,"Well, I read an article in NZ that said the Royal NZ and Australia College of Gynaecologists and Physicians does not recommend the Pfizer Vaccine for pregnant women. 
Also, this is the only vaccine I'd take as it is protein based and safer, and has about the same rate of efficiency as the flu vaccine. The Janssen and Novavax vaccine are the only ones I'd take as their foundations are based on previous proven, safer vaccines as they are protein based.
The Pfizer vaccine is in new territory and they don't know what the long term side effects might be; you might have the vaccine then this vaccine might cause liver damage and other worse stuff that could kill you.
I'll be telling my doctor what vaccine I want and will wait until government buys enough so I can get my shot. Probably won't need an annual winter flu shot and will have this one instead."
2021-01-29 18:10:03,I'm a little confused.  The efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were only about 50% after 1 shot.  The efficacy of the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines are better than that after just 1 shot.  What would happen to the efficacy if a booster was given to those with the  J&J and Astrazeneca vaccines?
2021-01-29 18:11:11,"Read the link in the article about ""efficacy rate"" and how that is not the same as ""effective"".  Efficacy rate means the vaccine's reduction in symptomatic people who test positive against the rate of same in people with placebo.  To me, a one shot vaccine that is 85% ""effective in preventing severe disease"", regardless of variant, is worth having in the distribution arsenal.  Defining ""severe disease"" is something that needs more clarity, which I assume will be provided in the report to the FDA.  At this early point in the info flow, it seems the J&J would be more appropriate for mass vaccination of younger folks, and use the Pfizer and Moderna with older, more risky folks."

China/Hong Kong/UAE have been using Sinopharm-CoronaVac (an inactivated vaccine) with similar results to that of Johnson and Johnson and the refrigeration process is standard meaning it doesn't need the intense refrigeration of Moderna/Pfizer. The NYT Times did a piece on Sinopharm January 4th 2021. Instead of keeping certain vaccines for certain countries why not share with everyone? This would help curtail covid 19 as a world instead of just putting out fires.

2021-01-29 17:58:14,A significant potential problem with adenoviral vaccines is N=1. You personally may have an immune system which wipes out the adenovirus resulting in no SARS-CoV-2 immunity-- and not know there is no immunity.   I await the data showing how much this effect results in the lesser protection by the various live adenoviral vaccines which rely on active infection vs. mRNA (SputnikV being dual adenoviral may be less subject to N=1).
2021-01-29 18:26:30,"For a single dose vaccine that requires no special storage 72% overall efficiency and 85% efficiency in severe cases is extremely good.  We really shouldn't be comparing this to 90+% efficiency for two dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  A proper comparison would with a single dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.  Also, perhaps two doses of J&J vaccine or a single dose of J&J vaccine followed by a single dose of Pfizer/Moderna vaccine would have >90% efficiency.  Something worth looking into.  If J&J vaccine was available to me I would take it in a heartbeat instead of waiting months for Pfizer/Moderna vaccine."
2021-01-29 18:28:02,"But at 72% effectiveness, even for the mainstream version of COVID, the J&J vaccine is far less effective than Pfizer or Moderna.

With the bar now fundamentally raised, results for traditional vaccines seem to be getting slightly gamed – all showing efficacies of “70%*”…

That is, some sort of footnote about a sub-cohort or other selectivity behind the still-uncompetitive efficacy…

Latest being 50-60% efficacy against some mutant strain…

1500 looms – so will cut to the chase…

If these traditional vaccines are showing the typical ~50% efficacy – and rolloff from there, for over-65’s – why are we still smearing around the peanut butter…

Said different, find the mayor or governor who’d be willing to go back to normal (except for mask-wearing in some close quarters) for a 50% effective vaccine…

Being single-dose doesn’t close the efficacy gap…"
2021-01-29 15:31:51,"Well, who wants the J&J version when Pfizer’s is so much more effective...? I’d feel cheated at this point, after staying at home for a year."
2021-01-29 14:45:24,The J&J vaccine is a game changer. Low efficacy in the South African is still high and on par with flu shots. The big advantage is that it is a one-shot and am does not require all the refrigeration stuff. NYT should not fearmonger about vaccines being less effective; but frame it on a positive light to help drive vaccination numbers to get immunity to a high degree before the South African strain gets here in larger numbers.
2021-01-29 15:08:13,"The NY Times articles on the vaccines by  Carl Zimmer, Noah Weiland and Sharon LaFraniere have become almost daily must read writing first thing each day. For me it gives the skinny on hope and eventually freedom from the worst event in my lifetime and of my parents. These three writers should be cheered and rewarded for the fine job they have done providing a beacon of truth during the most despicable stifling during Trumps lie sessions. Their parents should be proud of them."
2021-01-29 15:48:44,"The NYTimes needs to have critical scientists reporting on these vaccines, instead of just parroting press releases.   There has been a lot of interest in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because it is cheap, just one shot, and easy to store.BUT In Europe 20% of people  and in sub Saharan Africa, over 80% of the people have immunity to the ADvector they are using, AD26. This will cause a very poor covid-19 antibody production because the vector will be attacked as soon as it is injected, greatly lowering the dose getting delivered to the cells. <a href=""https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/vector-based-vaccines-come-to-the-fore-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-67915"" target=""_blank"">https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/vector-based-vaccines-come-to-the-fore-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-67915</a>
On Jan 13,  J&J released the preliminary results from phase two (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034201?query=featured_home"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034201?query=featured_home</a>; see Figure 2 therein). It shows that the immune response is not as good as Moderna's at the same point in their trial, after phase two.The Moderna response level is much more uniform, at higher levels, across all age groups compared to the J&J data. This may reflect pre immunity to Ad26. Notice  that the J&J vaccine also shows benefits from a two dose regimen compared to single dose. If you look to the far right in Figure 2, you will see the comparison graphs to plasma taken from people who have recovered from Covid-19. The levels of antibody in the vaccinated elderly are WORSE than in Covid-19 recovered patients, while Moderna's vaccinated are all at the 25% highest levels of recovered."
2021-01-29 16:38:47,"Why are all these companies producing varied vaccine types, like different brands of supermarket-shelf laundry detergent where one says “Brighter!”, another once “Cleanest!” or “Freshest”!.....? Why aren’t they all working across the board at this very crucial point in order to team together to mass-produce the most efficient version of the vaccine known to date?? Very frustrating to understand."
2021-01-29 14:37:02,"Why does nobody explain WHY these ""varients"" happen? Logic tells me that asymptomatics and mild symptomatics who don't wear masks, shed virus to others, some who succumb more easily, some do not, thus forcing the virus to evolve to succeed reproducing in more immune hosts. Isn't it possible then that these variants are evolving on their own in the US? WHY does no one in the news explain how these varients happen? Perhaps they evolve sooner and more quickly in countries where people are in closer, unprotected conditions. The virus, given the opportunity to spread uncontrolled, will create stronger and stronger varients. Logical to me, why isn't it more widely explained?"
2021-01-29 18:38:14,"What is the point of approving a vaccine that at best is only 72 percent effective, and is just 57 percent effective for the new more contagious variant that will likely take over in the U.S. soon?"
2021-01-29 18:40:33,"My wife and I got our first shots a week ago.  Lots of people got shots here last week but they've run out and are expecting more vaccine on Monday and will start again vaccinating on Tuesday.  It seems to be lining out.

According to the Seattle Times, only about 37% of people in the state respond ""definitely"" when asked if they intend to get vaccinated.  It's probably a lower number here in the rural east.  Many know or believe they've had the disease so they're not excited to get vaccinated.  Many are young and not worried.  Many don't like shots and don't normally get a flu shot and won't get this one either."
2021-01-29 18:28:39,"WHAT CONCERNS?  It keeps 100% of people out of the hospital.  Give the most vulnerable populations Pfizer/Moderna, give everyone else JnJ.   Approve this vaccine and let’s go!"
2021-01-29 18:34:56,"Why hasn’t the FDA approved Oxford-AstraZeneca ?  If this is war, lets get on with it!"
2021-01-29 18:29:44,"The J&J announcement is concerning because of what it does not include, which is information on the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing transmission/infection.

Yes, it is great that the vaccine prevents serious cases since that can help alleviate suffering and death in the short term.

The problem, however, is that unless the vaccine also significantly reduces ALL infections/transmissions, then it essentially allows the virus to go on spreading, and thus mutating, unchecked.  To break the cycle of this raging pandemic, a vaccine must prevent infections.  If the virus is allowed to transmit freely, even if it only causes mild illnesses, then it is only a matter of time before more variants (in addition the existing British, South African, Brazilian, and Californian ones) emerge.  The next variant could well be both more contagious and more deadly.

The J&J vaccine will also usher in a serious moral question for the Trump Administration.  Who will be assigned to receive the less effective J&J vaccine and who will be given the more effective Pfizer and Moderna versions?  Experience thus far in the vaccine roll-out suggest that wealth, power, and political connections rather than equity will emerge as the key factors in determining who gets which vaccine.  Avoiding this pitfall will be a difficult challenge for the new Biden Administration."
2021-01-29 18:32:03,"Hmmmm... Let's see... Should I get the vaccine that is 95% effective against Covid or the one that's 65-72% effective?
For me there is no question. 

J&J needs to go back to the drawing board. Their vaccine should not be approved."
2021-01-29 18:55:49,"Reading through these comments, the only thing that's clear is that there's a lot of confusion out there. The big question for me is, if I get any of these vaccines, what are the chances it will keep me out of the hospital if I get infected, and does that change with the variant? In other words, does the 70% keep me out of the hospital as well as the 90%? If so, I'm happy to take the less ""protective"" vaccine. And, really, the 70% seems to be equivalent to getting only one dose of the more protective, two-dose mRNA vaccines. Bottom line: if you can get any one of these vaccines, go for it. You're helping yourself and everyone else beat this virus."
2021-01-29 19:06:19,"If one has to compare Covid19 vaccines with flu vaccines, the game is lost. Flu vaccines are developed based on guesses of which flu strains will be present in the next flu season. Guesses are frequently wrong. A vaccine at the 75% level is too dangerous for vulnerable persons."
2021-01-29 19:06:34,"Beggars cannot be choosers.  We need all hands--and vaccines--on deck at this point to fight the new variants that seem to be now circulating in the United State is.  As I read the comments, I see a lot of confusion, and no wonder.  These are complicated issues and we are dealing with a moving target, in fact many moving targets.  Our knowledge tends to be provisional, dependent on the data that is constantly coming in. We do have the miracle of the two highly effective m-RNA vaccines but we cannot dismiss the importance of the J&J vaccine that has been tested on the variants with a 85% effectiveness rate for preventing severe illness, regardless of what variant caused it.  Moderna is working on a booster shot to address the new variants, and this would be the third shot in the series if it comes to fruition.  We profited hugely from having the FDA give Emergency Use Authorization to the two mRNA vaccines rather waiting for all the data usually required for approval.  But this means that the vaccines are still being ""tested"" as they are used on a bigger and bigger population.  I say, when the opportunity comes up, get vaccinated."
2021-01-29 19:06:59,I see the main purpose of getting vaccinated is to lower the transmission rate down to below 1.0 so that the pandemic does out.  The vaccine is not a guarantee that you don't get sick.  You still need to wear a mask etc.  I think I read that an efficacy 70% means 70% of those vaccinated do not get sick AND have severe symptoms. Which I take to mean needing to think about going to the hospital or worst.
2021-01-29 18:59:33,"I received my first Pfizer shot yesterday and the second is due in a few weeks. I hope and pray this vaccine protects me from Covid and it’s variants! I’m so tired of being isolated. I’m so tired of worrying if I’m going to get Covid and die. I haven’t seen family in too long, nor friends either. When will this long nightmare end? Thank God the nightmare of Trump is gone! Let’s hope that 2021 will go much better! Wear a mask!"
2021-01-29 19:08:59,"When The Butantan Institute publicized its first results for the Coronavac it came like that, with 78% efficacy against moderate and higher seriousness of the disease, 100% against hospitalization. Later they published the full data, those tow figures are not statistically significant, and the primary efficacy was 50.4%. The JJ PR is pretty vague about actual figures, let's wait for the FDA report."
2021-01-29 18:54:46,"There is great news today about both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from Israel, which has vaccination close to half of its population by now.

The original number of the human trial phase was only 75000 total, including the placebo group.

Their health department did the numbers and found out that over 715 thousand who received both doses of the 2 vaccines,  only 317 (0.04%) were infected by the virus and of that group only 16 had to be hospitalized."
2021-01-29 19:03:18,"I really hope that the NYT is reading all these comments that say this vaccine is trash. It’s unfortunate, but predictable that people don’t understand the science and math behind how vaccinations work. 

I do hope that they are able to write and promote articles that show why getting everyone vaccinated as quickly as possible is much better than waiting to “max” the efficacy rate."
2021-01-29 19:14:41,"Great news that this would only require a single shot, but I wonder if the lower efficacy of the J&J vaccine relative to the Moderna/Pfizer vaccines could be due to pre-existing antibodies against the adenovirus 26 vector used. Such antibodies may also make a prime-boost strategy less likely to improve efficacy, as noted at the end of the article. Still, this is a fantastic development."
2021-01-29 19:16:03,"Several reports have come out about the efficacy of Pfizer and Moderna after only one shot.  Remarkably, it seem, the first shot of Moderna provides some 80-90% protection.  One report has one dose of Pfizer at about the same, but another at 52%  Either way, the power of that first shot seems to have been generally overlooked.  Why isn't the media reporting more about it?"
2021-01-29 19:16:20,"It is dog -eat -dog world for actually getting a vaccine. In Pennsylvania, vaccines haven't made their way to doctors' offices.

Currently, seniors are in a casino game for spots at local pharmacies, as they wait breathlessly online at a pharmacy that advertises appointments--- but no one gets one.

We will be treating our seniors for increased anxiety and depression with the lack of vaccine availability. 

In Pennsylvania, smokers were added to the 1A list for those over 65. Seniors no doubt must prove their age; smokers do not have to prove COPD.
This was unfair."
2021-01-29 19:22:51,"We should be encouraged by the Phase III-1 results.  An apples to apples comparison of J&J with Pfizer with just a single-shot shows J&J to be more effective (72 for J&J vs 52% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after the first dose).  The J&J Phase III-2 trial tests 2 shots separated by 57 days (using logic similar to Pfizer) and ""Dr. Fauci was optimistic that people who get a so-called prime boost may enjoy even more protection"".  Moreover, the J&J Phase III-1 clinical trial included the B.1.351 variant (not as likely for Pfizer).  J&J's DNA-based version is more stable (not needing a deep freeze), which will make it a game changer in rural parts of the world.

That said, we will likely need booster shots with any of the vaccines in the coming years..."
2021-01-29 19:25:22,Can people who get the far less effective vaccine(s) now receive the more efficacious ones like Pfizer later when those are available? Or will the earlier vaccination cause them to be excluded?
2021-01-29 14:27:13,"Why are companies like J&J still wasting time and resources trying to develop a vaccine?  We've got a vaccine and we've got a shortage!  Why aren't we paying Pfizer and Moderna to share the recipe and leveraging J&J's  manufacturing pipeline to scale-up production?  The race is over, no more clinical trials or applying for emergency approval.  J&J lost but they haven't missed the opportunity to recoup costs and play a role in the manufacturing and delivery process (that would benefit them financially).  The US gov't is paying trillion(s) in stimulus to cover everyone while we wait for a vaccine.  What if we could cut that wait time in half?"
2021-01-29 14:49:19,"It’s a one shot vaccine , that works to stop severe disease and death from coronavirus in all its variants . It begins working after 14 days and is safe . Sign me up.

Save the Moderna and Pfizer for healthcare and seniors and those with underlying conditions and begin vaccinating everyone else immediately.

It would be smart to delineate groups anyway , at least for first 3 months to better study the vaccines and their efficacy.

Never let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

And let’s shoot for 100 percent mask wearing, and do a better job quarantining all travelers into the country, and maybe if we listened to the scientists and didn’t host parties in our homes ( the home is where 90 percent of the spread happens) then maybe we could close the door on this virus, close it and lock it away forever."
2021-01-29 18:45:07,"SORRY but I wouldn't want THIS vaccine!  Who wants a vaccine that's efficacy drops to 57% in a changing COVID world when I could take a MODERNA that is over 90%?  In my view, this vaccine, demand notwithstanding, does NOT pass the efficacy test when we know there are others that are more effective.  So who wants this, really?  Given the choice, who would take this over the others and if you take this does it PRECLUDE getting a better one?  Only if a better one would be given as an option down the road would I even begin to consider this as ""better than nothing"" but, frankly, I'm NOT convinced."
2021-01-29 19:38:19,"I think adding a less effective vaccine to the mix will add to the confusion. From talking with many people in my community, there is already a surprising amount of confusion and misinformation about the vaccines even from medical professionals (I have 2 friends pleading with their parents to get vaccinated because their parents don’t want to get the vaccine because their friends who are nurses told them the vaccines aren’t safe). It is an unbelievable yet real problem. 

Also — right or wrong - I think many will refuse the J&J vaccine and will wait to get one of the MRNA vaccines because who really wants a subpar vaccine when a better one is available?  It could be a huge waste of money and resources if our government and health institutions to invests in this vaccine. 

Finally, who gets the less effective vaccines— the poor in our rural and urban communities because they don’t have the power to demand the more effective vaccines? The middle class and wealthy — lets be honest that won’t happen because that population has the ability to stay home until they can get the vaccine they feel must comfort taking. We as a society need to think hard about the implications before we make any decisions about this vaccine."
2021-01-29 15:02:12,"My wife and I, in our seventies, received the Johnson  vaccine in December---the real thing we discovered last week. I had been scheduled for Phizer's, thinking I had had the placebo, but cancelled when I found out. I think I made the right decision. I would have been happier with a higher percentage, but still the protection against a serious infection is comforting.  I hope the booster shot is not too distant. Anyway, we're grateful. So many are scrambling for any protection."
2021-01-29 15:50:18,"Good news!

As with the flu, complete protection is probably not in the cards.  Given the nature of the virus I think that the best we can expect is that various vaccines will significantly reduce or eliminate the chance of serious illness and hospitalization (and hopefully the incidence lingering side effects).  As far as I'm concerned that is good enough and a vast improvement over the current state of affairs."
2021-01-29 20:01:08,"It is clear that there is a ""race"" going on among the different drug companies to create and market a vaccine for COVID19. I am wondering if what we are being delivered is the correct vaccine that will protect people against this complex virus. The guys here created a vaccine which ended up showing false positives for HIV... what a disaster.

Even with the flu vaccine people who get the vaccine still end up with the flu. This is not the flu, it is a horrible thing that causes long term issues in people who get it. 

I am not a biologist, although I studied it in detail long time ago, I am an engineer and I think the biomedical engineers need to do the engineering on this very carefully. We should not give people something that will nullify (""blunt"") other vaccines, rather it should augment the others. We all need to be very very careful with all these fancy vaccines coming out."
2021-01-29 20:03:46,"Despite repeated assurances to the contrary, no one understands any of these vaccines well. There is a maze of conflicting information released every day, even by scientists themselves, and much of it is technical and ill defined. It's not fair to expect Americans to understand and accept advantages (if any) to taking a less effective one shot vaccine than a more effective two shot vaccine. We need a decent vaccine education campaign, because our current mish mash of articles and orders to ""Take the shot"" isn't education."
2021-01-29 20:09:36,"OK, the J&J vaccine is 66% effective with a single shot, based on trials averaged over several countries (72% in the United States). We do not know how effective the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would be with a single shot. Since both of them are about 95% effective with 2 shots, maybe they would be at least 66% effective with only 1 shot. We also don't know how effective the J&J vaccine would be with 2 shots, possibly 3 to 9 weeks apart. Maybe it would be 97% effective with 2 shots and the best approach for using that vaccine would be to employ 2 shots, just like with Pfizer and Moderna and AstraZeneca. It is sad that we lack the data for a truly meaningful comparison between J&J and the two vaccines currently being used in the United States. About all we can say with confidence is that the J&J vaccine is better than AstraZeneca, which was only 70% effective with 2 shots.
Of course, none of this matters if 40% to 50% of the people in the United States are too dumb to get vaccinated when they have a chance. (This also applies to mask wearing, social distancing, and so on.)"
2021-01-29 20:21:00,"I reread the article after making my earlier comment, and I am even now more optimistic about the J&J vaccine. I glossed over a relevant sentence, which was buried in the article: ""After 28 days, none of the vaccinated participants who developed Covid-19 had to be hospitalized."" Wow, that is significant. Kudos to J&J, whose vaccine will be as important as the ones created by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna."
2021-01-29 20:39:02,"I will wait for availabilty of more Pfizer or Moderna. The efficacy of the J&J vaccine is closer to that of a seasonal flu shot, which never seems to stop me from getting the flu."
2021-01-29 20:49:44,"The younger doctors and the 21 million younger people who work for or with them (most not interacting with patients at all) have all received priority vaccination with the best vaccines.  So also millions of younger government people including 4 million younger teachers have received or are receiving priority vaccination with the best vaccines.  All these vaccinations occurred by denying seniors vaccination.

Now that an inferior vaccine is available, the doctors and the politicians may let lowly seniors and other regular Americans get vaccinated with the inferior vaccine.


The doctors and politicians are so compassionate and caring.  Real heroes!!"
2021-01-29 20:52:05,"I think J&J in phase 2 did look at two shots.  They seemed to make a conscious discussions to ride the one shot pony, since it has a lot of benefits in cost, time to vac,  issue in distribution, PR benefits, etc.  

In hindsight, esp with all the variants, it was a poor pony to ride. However as noted, they can probably give a 2nd shot like the other two shots vacs to get the enhanced immune response much higher.

If they had gotten a much higher efficacy in phase 3, they would be on the top of the hill of vacs.  Now they are I guess I will take it , but could I get a 2nd shot too or the MRNA vacs instead."
2021-01-29 20:54:45,"You started with Pfizer-BioNTech and you will have to finish with this one because it's the most widely avalaible, quantity matter.

We're at the heart of winter and the virus feel good, condition are perfect to spread fast, but this trend will reverse soon by the sun as a major ally against the virus."
2021-01-29 20:57:24,"It is important to understand that the purpose of vaccination is not to prevent everyone in the world from contracting Covid but to   keep people out of the hospital. If we can achieve that, most everyone else will recover. 80% of deaths are over 65 so those are our target group."
2021-01-29 21:09:59,"The vaccine is inferior to others on the market. It does not provide enough coverage. It is much lower than the other vaccines.

Although I plan to get vaccinated I will make sure to avoid the inferior J&J product. If they can improve its strength and coverage I might reconsider. Putting this inferior product on the market will create confusion and doubt when people find out that it is not as good as others."
2021-01-29 21:12:19,"I, for one, would be very happy to receive the JNJ vaccine!  I am in my mid-70s, healthy & still working.   Considered an ""essential worker, I go into an office every day that is shared by a number of others, half of whom have daily, multiple contacts with the public.  IMHO the front-line workers, elderly, infirm and  those in group living situations should receive the 90%+ effective vaccines, since they are at greatest risk.  

If it happened, I would be willing to endure a mild case of COVID if protected against serious disease by the JNJ vaccine.  This is a great boon for us healthy over 65s!"
2021-01-29 21:43:34,"Why go to the hassle of getting a vaccination if there's a 28% or greater chance that it doesn't protect you (or those around you)? I hope that the FDA will require proven 90% or greater effectiveness to give final (not emergency use) authorization to a vaccine. Merck saw that their results weren't good enough and discontinued their vaccine development efforts. If J&J can't do better, they should follow Merck's example."
2021-01-29 21:53:38,"As someone who had a mild case of Covid in September, this may be sufficient protection for those who already have antibodies."
2021-01-29 22:03:52,"This is great news for a few reasons. 1: this vaccine is one dose unlike Pfizer, moderna, and novavax 2: it can be stored at much warmer temperatures which will make it easier to distribute in mass 3: JNJ also running a 2nd trial with a two dose regiment. I am confident that efficacy will reach high 80s/low 90s with two doses. I think we can vaccinate people with one dose now and if the trial shows that two doses improves efficacy we can boost people later. 

Take home - If it’s the difference between getting JNJ now or waiting months for moderna and Pfizer - take JNJ now"
2021-01-29 22:22:35,"The J&J vaccine should be our greatest export. Yes, we need to deploy it here first but in the long run this is the type of vaccine huge chunks of the world need. It is cheap and easy to move/store. This is a chance to walk the walk that we are all riding the same planet. The US should accept the fact that someone has to pay to vaccinate the world and we should accept most of the cost for the Americas. Not because it is our responsibility it because we can most easily bear the cost. It may not seem “fair” but it is the right thing to do."
2021-01-29 22:33:51,"Given the circumstance we have wouldn't it make sense to authorize Astrazeneca and possibly Novavax as soon as they show safety (aka right now)? Does it really matter so much that their efficacy is 45%, 70%, or 95%? 

They should be compared to 'no vaccine' not Moderna and Pfizer. 

If there is a question about Astrazeneca's effectiveness with people over 65 why not use it to vaccinate the healthier spreaders? Those under 50. They can get a booster later.

Be transparent and open, but 50% is better than 0%"
2021-01-30 00:13:08,"I'm seeing comments here referring to the JnJ vaccine as ""inferior"" but I think that is an incorrect conclusion. The JnJ results are extremely good, especially considering that this was based on a single dose and using a vector designed with the initial pre-mutant virus. The JnJ trials were conducted more recently and in regions of the world where more of the variants were on the rise, unlike earlier Pfizer and Moderna trials where the % of those more transmissible variants was much lower.  Therefore the JnJ efficacy endpoint was affected by the rise of those variants.  We do not know the overall efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines under the same conditions, but I would be willing to bet it is lower than what they initially reported for the EUA several months ago.  Perhaps Dr. Fauci can clarify this for us.

The vaccines appear to prevent severe COVID disease that result in hospitalization and/or death.  In this regard, the Pfizer, Moderna and JnJ vaccines are all efficacious and I would not hesitate to take any of them."
2021-01-29 23:55:57,A vaccine that will keep me out of the hospital...sounds great to me.
2021-01-29 20:32:14,"Right now the vaccines are being rolled out so slowly in CA that it would take until the summer to vaccinate everybody over 65. I want my shot yesterday. So I would rather take the J&J shot than wait for the ideal candidate and risk severe Covid.

I think a lot of people are having trouble accepting this vaccine because you it introduces a grey area in our lives. It’s confusing. You got the shot, but life isn’t back to normal. What do you think?"
2021-01-29 21:34:35,Are modified mRNA and adenovirus vaccines  the same vaccines as the ones went through trials? Can we compare the mRNA and adenovirus technology to Flu vaccines which are inactive vaccines when dealing new variants?

2021-01-29 22:40:51,"It is disappointing that the US government is not showing the same urgency in approving vaccines as demonstrated by the govt of UK. UK has approved Pfizer, Moderna and Astrazeneca vaccines. Astrazeneca (made by Serum Inst. of India) is the big whale here. Why hasn't this vaccine been approved yet? I understand the 70-90% efficacy controversy but 70% is more than good enough. Given that the virus is outmaneuvering us we need to act with agility."
2021-01-29 22:37:39,"The US has pre purchased 100 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. If it turns out the we will not use it, we should give our supply to Mexico and Central America.

2021-01-29 20:27:43,"I've read a lot comments and the J&J article. I generally agree, who wants a subpar vaccine that is greatly reduced in it's efficacy when faced with a variant mutation? Let's get full on with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine and stop wasting time. Let's get the other companies to manufacture the vaccines that work the best. If this is really a war on the virus, let's get the troops moving! Trump is out of the way for now, let's move!"
2021-01-29 20:02:38,I predict some people may fake an egg allergy in order to get Moderna or Pfizer rather than other less effective brands.
2021-01-29 19:53:01,"Why would someone take this vaccine and it only effective 72%, 66%, & 57% according to a Washington Post article I read today? No thank you!

At 65 years old, I will only get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines when enough becomes available to Washington, D.C. residents. Both vaccines have been proven to be over 90% effective. 

I suspect the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be given to the poor, mostly Blacks and Latinos."
2021-01-29 21:35:43,It’s not all about you. The idea is to collectively reduce the incidence of the virus in order to significantly slow the spread. So that the virus dies out. And that’s accomplished through a mass vaccination program.
2021-01-29 23:16:39,"Happy to see all the people who want to wait for “better” vaccines. Hopefully this means more for me and sooner!

It’s clear we’re not going to get out of this in a herd immunity or otherwise community oriented way. That’s not America, at least not now. So I want my vaccine so I can go back to work and my kids back to school. Everyone else can wait until cows come home."
2021-01-29 19:31:19,The results from this trial are very encouraging. I am disappointed that the headline focuses on efficacy overall. This trial showed no hospitalizations or deaths from COVID-19 in the vaccine group. THAT  is the point that needs to be made to the public. Vaccination can help solve the current crisis in our nation’s hospitals and ICUs.  Everyone needs to get this when their turn comes.
2021-01-29 19:43:36,"72% is better than we get from any annual flu vaccine of the past 10 years and 57% is still better than almost all annual flu vaccines.

Meanwhile, I'm standing in line on my best civic behavior, patiently waiting for my world-renowned HMO to give us some idea when we can get vaccinated.  Our state government has so totally botched the distribution of available vaccines that they've thrown their hands in the air and contracted with a competing HMO to handle statewide distribution.

The tragedy here is that public health agencies across our state had six months to get the plan and the logistics in place and here we are, weeks into this, and barely half of the doses delivered to the state have gotten into people's arms."
2021-01-29 21:24:35,"I think 60% efficacy is far better than none.
It appears that the two methods one requiring super cold temps and one that does not and is more easily transportable. So, considering where we are now doesn’t it make sense to use the Johnson vaccine in regions not equipped to handle the Pfizer “messenger” or RNA vaccine. I think all that get approval will have uses as a more coordinated attack against this virus is presented rather than denial. Doesn’t it make sense to start the vaccinations in those rural areas as opposed to using both in urban areas? Each state is handling this crisis differently but as many have said this virus is not a respecter of political divisions and one states failure bleeds into her neighbors. I live in Maryland and while our governor is a Republican, he was no Trump supporter. I almost mentioned that Maryland Republicans are different but a recent attempt to bring a gun into the House through a metal detector has caused me to reconsider.
This is a tough nut to crack; we have to get people inoculated quickly but the word rationing turns healthcare into an emotional issue for everyone. We need a central command and control, and I am hopeful that Biden will do this rather than use words like “hoax”, “china virus”, and drink bleach."
2021-01-29 20:41:39,"I really wish the headline on this article wasn't so negative - and fear mongering ""Fuels Concern about Variants"" is misleading since the bulk of the article says, ""hey, 57% effective is pretty good. And get vaccinated ASAP"" And so everyone remains scared of the variants, which is somewhat warranted - I get, but some good news is nice to hear in the middle of a pandemic. So how about ""J & J efficacy Proves to be Equal to the Flu Shot against Covid Variants - Great Result Experts Say"""
2021-01-29 20:42:40,"Given that four of the federally approved Covid 19 vaccines are considerably less effective against the B.1.351 variant from S. Africa, why not do the basic epidemiology that was neglected early on. Why not do the rigorous contact tracing of the still very few cases of this variant in the US. I read of three cases identified in S. Carolina. Surely we can handle contact tracing for just three  cases. 

If we had the foresight to contact trace when our Covid 19 cases were still manageable, we could have nipped this pandemic in the bud. With this new viral beast, we have another challenge and chance to get it right this time.

I'm wondering why the press keeps quoting Dr. Fauci. I know he is THE nation's leading expert in infectious diseases, but I'd like to hear from our new pandemic task force which is studded with several stellar scientists. Have they any ideas except to vaccinate more people with our existing vaccines which work best against the circulating covid 19 strains last month, but are considerably less effective against the B.1.351 strain and possibly other new strains to come. I see a need to control this new strain, while continuing to vaccinate our population against the original strains."

Please use hand disinfectant.
Please keep 6 feet from others.
Please get the vaccine when it's offered to you.

Even if you do only the first three things, you could save my life, as well as the lives of those I come in contact with. 

If we're wrong, what have you lost by wearing a mask and following the other suggested steps?

The country my wife's family is from has 70 million people and only 76 deaths from Covid-19. If we followed the basic mask/distance/hand-wash rules, we'd have had fewer than 400 deaths, not over 400,000. 

Half a million Americans will die: do we love each other less than the peoples of other countries? How can we let this happen to us?

And the omnious news just starting to be known, is the lack of maintaining efficacy in the face of the increasing mutations.  Further, it is becoming clear variants are a characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 and the mutations are an intrinsic characteristic, so it will continue to mutate, change its shape to escape detection and or being blocked.   Maybe it's time to be open to newer bio-science than a tweaked 20th Century platform.  What about targeted killer T-cells that go past the cover into the nucleocapsid to defeat the virus v merely attempting to block it?

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines' efficacy rates were seen prior to the new strands, and the new strands have been circulating in the United States - in fact, two of them will be the dominant ones in the country within two to three weeks.

Also, one of my colleagues did not have a good reaction to the second Moderna dosis, which worries me a bit.  He is Latino and my understanding is that neither Pfizer nor Moderna had a diverse controlled pool of test subjects.  On the other hand last I read J&J did control for the sex, ethnicity/race, weight, age...  

My second paragraph should get fact checked, as it is based on memory of articles when the studies were being designed and trials started; this coincided with the rising evidence at the time that the above differences really matter when evaluating all things COVID-19."
2021-01-30 02:05:23,"Readers need to stop inaccurately comparing COVID (and its vaccine) to the flu. Viral pneumonia is another potentially fatal illness that has an available vaccine and it's not COVID either. We need to compare one COVID vaccine to another, not to entirely different vaccines that has been developed differently and slower. One shot immunizations are good news for governments and manufacturers, not so good for recipients who have no choice but to get the less effective shot."
2021-01-30 04:30:15,"For nearly a year, there have been those telling us that COVID-19 is ""just the flu.""  Here's a vaccine that makes that statement true.  Do you think those folks will take it?

Me neither."

2021-01-30 15:03:40,"I see this vaccine as an important option that will help us achieve herd immunity, especially if it is offered as an actual choice.

Some people who refuse vaccination because they feel mistrustful of the new-fangled mRNA vaccine technology might opt for a vaccine billed as more “traditional.”

Elderly and other high risk people at the top of the priority list may opt to stay the course with Moderna & Pfizer.

Younger, low-risk people might jump at the chance of a more quickly available (if Phase 2 people refuse it) lower efficacy vaccine and that would be a huge boost for herd immunity.

There is also the hedge against future mutations that a range of well-studied vaccines can offer."
2021-01-30 15:07:51,"Very good to hear these results. The more vaccines that are made available, the faster we can get large numbers of people immunized. That's our best bet for getting ahead of the pandemic. All the questions about duration of immunity, asymptomatic spread from vaccinated people, and mutants that could escape the vaccines are legitimate and important, and they will be addressed in due course. Right now, let's get people immunized with the vaccines we have. Better yet, let's keep up with all the non-vaccine ways that we all know about to minimize the spread of infection."
2021-01-29 19:52:15,"Allowing Johnson and Johnson to produce ineffective an ineffective vaccine may be fiscally sound thinking for the company bottom line, but would be tragic and perhaps even catastrophic for Americans.

There is a mask mandate here—it’s time to enforce it with stiff fines. Yes, it’s uncomfortable hiking in a mask. But it’s not impossible. If you don’t like it, stay home.

I've also been suffering (on/off) from 'brain fog' for about 10 years. 

I agree with the quote in the piece though - we're certainly going to learn something from this. And there are many of us who have had brain fog - undiagnosed and effectively untreated - who hope maybe the clues we get from studying corona will result in new directions of treatment."
2021-01-28 20:31:59,"The complexity of the immune system is almost too much for humans to comprehend.
The development to auto immune antibodies may occur if the virus shares antigens  similar to human tissue antigens.
Or the virus damages the finely tuned system of immune tolerance in which the body does not destroy itself.
Or the virus causes tissue damage and hidden tissue antigens are released to trigger an auto immune response.
These are just a few speculations but an autoimmune reaction post infection has been known for decades.
Rheumatic Fever with joint and heart inflammation after a local throat Group A streptococcal infection is just one example."
2021-01-28 20:33:23,"Viruses are getting smarter, or are we getting smarter at understanding things?  Excessive immune response to the viruses itself causes major collateral destruction as in Hepatitis and such.

2021-01-28 20:34:12,"I am curious if there is a possibility of a vaccine causing an autoimmune response.  Are there any studies on this?  One item in the article gave me hope in this regard:

Extreme inflammation caused by viral infections can cause cells to burst open, spewing their contents and befuddling the immune system’s ability to distinguish “self” from “other.”

Certainly a vaccine would not cause this to happen.  So hopefully the vaccine would be safe in view of these considerations.

Another question arises as to how safe the vaccine is for people that have pre-existing autoimmune problems.  I would be interesting in seeing follow up articles addressing this potential problem."
2021-01-28 20:48:03,"As someone with rheumatoid arthritis, I am very familiar with the fallout of the body attacking itself. Ramping up vaccine production can't happen soon enough because everyone is a priority.

It would break my heart if my 20 something kids contracted Covid and had to deal with autoimmune disease that thankfully spared me until middle age.

I wish that President Biden could force everyone to wear masks. I know that’s not possible, but since Republican governors won’t do their jobs and force masks, I fear that we are in for a long winter and spring. I’m afraid to go inside the grocery store because no one wears a mask, so I have been driving over an hour away to have access to curbside grocery pickup. I’m so tired of this. My experience is that the rural areas in Alabama and Georgia are full of anti-maskers, many of whom have some of these conditions. Their solution is this: God’s got me. 

Looking at pictures of Marjorie Taylor Greene’s meeting with her constituents in Dalton, for example, no masks in sight but nearly everyone there was obese and therefore possibly diabetic or pre-diabetic. But hey, God’s got ‘em.

I cannot encourage everyone enough to take every precaution you can, because living with autoimmune disorders is no picnic.

I also wonder whether people with auto-immune disorders should avoid the covid vaccine--or be moved to the forefront of people who would benefit and are also more at risk? A study with n=9 isn't something to take all that seriously, though I'd sure hate to be a rheumatologist's nurse today..."

Don't get me wrong. I'm glad people are taking the issue of long-haul Covid seriously. Just wish that all those years people were suffering from long-haul Lyme, journalists and researchers and doctors would've taken in seriously too. In fact, if they had, they might've developed insights -- and treatments -- that would've helped people with long-haul Covid.

Here's the link to Apoorva's article on Lyme: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/well/live/lyme-disease-children-treatment-diagnosis.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/well/live/lyme-disease-children-treatment-diagnosis.html</a>"
2021-01-28 21:56:14,"wow, i hope the vaccine with its ability to create the COVSarV2 spike protein does not contribute to this cascade effect of autoantibody production. Do we have any information on this point? I've received my second dose, so there is no going back, but this information is concerning."
2021-01-28 23:58:19,"This articles adds yet another reason that COVID-19 will have a monumental impact on so many areas of our lives. From mRNA vaccines to how we treat viral infections to how countries think about global supply chains, COVID-19 has been the single-most consequential event in my life (I was born in 1964). 

COVID-19 has already reduced the development time of an effective vaccine by 75 percent (it took four years to develop a vaccine for mumps in 1960s). One wonders what other innovations in biology and health sciences will result from COVID-19. I feel like the human species is getting a new beginning from this truly global crisis that touched every corner of the planet. We should make sure that this new iteration will be better than the last..."
2021-01-29 00:00:05,"I am always amazed at these discussions.

1)  Early on we knew that the virus was stimulating the body to do self harm.  Why is this topic new, it simply gives numbers?

2)  From the start one proposal in the scientific community (please add a PhD behind my name) was that we had never been exposed to a virus like Coronavirus and our bodies, in some cases, were over responding attacking infected and non-infecred cells indiscriminately.  As if the body were screaming, ""Yikes, I better do something about this strange thing I've never seen.""  Presumably, this would include auto immune antibodies.

3)  It is entirely possible that this happens every time we are exposed to a pathogen that has never been seen by humans before.  And yet here we sit, 7 billion strong.

4)  We lack data and perspective on both this infection and past ""new"" infections on which to draw conclusions.  This article makes for nice stress inducing responses, including lots of valuable clicks and comments (value to advertisors) but I'm not sure it really adds to a profitable knowledge of our risk and how we should view this virus."
2021-01-29 00:10:54,"The major point we can take away from this very important article is the individual variance of people's immune systems.

Once people realize age of the immune system is important, - T Cell numbers vary with age, but if the immune system is not built in some people with a quick response to the viral invasion, - the assumption that a younger person is less at risk is shown to be basically incorrect.

All men, and women are NOT necessarily created equal.....

Many of the 14,000 known diseases are DNA based...."
2021-01-29 00:20:31,"The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines boost the potency of antibodies and T-cells. Scientists need to track any correlation between the auto-antibodies and the vaccine induced anti-bodies. In other words, do the vaccines boost the potency of the auto-antibodies?

Antibodies have an important function that is to draw other white cells, such as, T-cells, and inflammatory agents to the targeted tissue. Interleukin-13 is implicated in COVID cytokine storms. Scientists also need to study whether these auto-antibodies stimulate Interleukin-13 causing major inflammation to attack healthy tissue."
2021-01-29 01:17:39,"It’s hopeful that more research will be done on other viruses as scientists learn more about long-haul Covid. 

Yet I keep wondering if some of those folks simply did not get well earlier because they got up too soon -they weren’t truly over COVID. 

This happens quite often with the flu. The first day you feel well you go out with friends or work. You think you’re OK - may feel a bit weak or tired - but there you are out and about. Depending on the flu you could be transmitting it to your friends or your office. 

Unlike COVID though, you may not relapse- you could from the flu - but more likely if you’re system’s weak, you probably would just catch another bug. 

This article brought up a way some bodies heal with Covid. I think we could all use instructions on how to get over viruses in general. None of us are very good at it. And some businesses don’t even offer sick days. 

What would happen if Covid patients rested longer? Once I had strep, mono and pneumonia. It took a lot of up and down before I realized I needed to rest and quit breaking down cells."
2021-01-29 02:13:21,"C'mon, people.  The secondary effects to a virus can in many cases be a form of rheumatoid (or reactive) arthritis.  We should be seeking advice from, and treating with, rheumatologists."

2021-01-29 01:45:49,"Sounds like Myasthenia Gravis.

What causes myasthenia gravis?
MG is a neuromuscular disorder that’s usually caused by an autoimmune problem. Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In this condition, antibodies, which are proteins that normally attack foreign, harmful substances in the body, attack the neuromuscular junction. Damage to the neuromuscular membrane reduces the effect of the neurotransmitter substance acetylcholine, which is a crucial substance for communication between nerve cells and muscles. This results in muscle weakness.

The exact cause of this autoimmune reaction is unclear to scientists. According to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, one theory is that certain viral or bacterial proteins may prompt the body to attack acetylcholine."
2021-01-29 03:03:09,And yet having lupus doesn’t count as an underlying condition to have priority for the vaccine.
2021-01-29 04:20:52,How does vaccination with mRNA vaccines figure into this?  Does immune exposure to a foreign glycoprotein (the spike protein) that has been presented to the vaccinated host’s immune system through a mechanism involving in vivo biosynthesis by the host’s own cells create a risk of autoantibodies to the host’s own cells?
2021-01-29 12:48:10,"This is nothing new. Viruses have been triggering auto-antibodies and the diseases associated with autoantibodies since forever. Molecular mimicry is the similarity of a protein in your body with a protein in the virus. The antibodies that are meant to fight the microbe, then unfortunately attack your own proteins. This is probably what triggers the cytokine storm and clotting of a severe case of COVID. It also may relate to the autoantibodies that may be increased in Long COVID. But, there is something near-endocrine that is being triggered too. Much like the neuro-endocrine changes of PTSD and Overtraining Syndrome. That also needs to be looked into."
2021-01-29 12:49:23,"Thanks for this phenomenal article.  Many of the comments are also interesting, including the personal histories and the vaccine discussions.  While it is true that an unprecedented amount of good science has resulted from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is still a mesh, with great points and strands of insight, and many gaps remaining to be filled in.  

It would be  helpful if someone could compile a list of clinics ready to tackle long haul Covid-19.  In the beginning it made sense to focus primarily on severe acute cases but the long term care networks now need to evolve ASAP.   

Most of the nations on the western edge of the Pacific have clearly dealt with the pandemic better than the US and western Europe.  Not just in East Asia.  But also New Zealand and Australia.  Australia has had no cases for four weeks.  Between the pandemic and current politics, the US has been unmasked.  Lets hope we can pull it together and create a more responsible, healthy and equitable society for all.

Cheers and Be Well"
2021-01-29 13:14:04,"We need to do a science experiment. Let's create a vaccine and inject it in millions upon millions of people; then, we'll see - over time - if there are adverse effects of this vaccine. To make it even more robust, let's inject it in children and young people and others who are low risk. Maybe nothing will happen. Maybe not. Maybe the effects won't show for a year or more; maybe not. But let's try and let's silence anyone who even puts out the slightest question about this methodology because they don't ""follow the science."""
2021-01-29 13:19:28,"What am I missing here? Since February of last year, cytokine storms have been the known cause of most deaths attributed to Covid 19. Do these new insights offer any clue about how to end immune-cell hyperactivation from SARS-CoV-2, or why only some individuals react to the virus this way?"
2021-01-29 15:16:39,"I have a chronic autoimmune disease and medical science can sometimes help with flares but offers nothing in terms of cures.  Over the years I've learned to a certain extent how to avoid triggers and lessen flares.  It's been almost 2 years since I've taken steroids.

In looking back I recall having a terrible virus and spending a few days with a raging fever.  It was after that episode that the inflammation levels in my body stayed high and I began to deal with all sorts of ailments.  Maybe the silver lining to this pandemic will be serious research into the actions of the immune system.  More and more people are living with autoimmune illnesses and better treatments are needed."
2021-01-29 15:27:11,"Sad to say but we are all walking and talking human petri dishes. Bacteria and viruses love us. We represent an excellent and warm place to live with lots of food (our cells and tissues). Of course, there are harmful and helpful bacteria, but viruses usually do not help us. So, what do we do? Of course, we live our lives, but we also must realize that some bacteria and viruses are out to do us great harm. Of course, vetted vaccines are a good thing. Many nasty diseases have been nearly eradicated (e.g., Polio, etc.). A strong immunity (via good health and wellness) is a good thing. However, we also must consider how having a calvaliar attitude towards pathogens (bacteria, viruses) and their infections might invite our doom, especially as the world becomes more over populated and we live closer and  together in dense urban areas. An ounce of precaution is worth a pound of cure."

It is highly unlikely that any respectable medical/ scientific journal with established peer-review would publish this study at this point. And for good reason: There's nothing worse for scientific progress than reports in the literature that are half-baked for the truth of scientific fact. Without sure foundation, science goes nowhere. It’s not likely that the average lay person appreciates this, which would be cause for unnecessary confusion, if not anxiety."

The experimental vaccines have been rushed to market with minimal safety testing (7-months versus the usual 10 years) and with zero consideration of autoreactivity.  

It is possible the vaccines may back-fire in the worst way.  

There have been quite a few Adverse Events (defined as more than a sore arm - from missing work to death).  The AE rate for the vaccines is currently 2.8%, or 1 in 35 people. 

As of Jan. 15, 181 C19 deaths have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, but research finds 99% of Adverse Events are not reported.

Remember Pfizer's 95% efficacy rate, which caused everyone to cheer and throw their hats into the air?  As I previously mentioned, that rate was too good to be true (the Flu vaccine is 10% to 50% efficacy), especially for a rushed to market vaccine.  

95% is a relative risk (a common pharma trick), not the actual 1% absolute risk.  The threshold for FDA approval is 50% but the actual relative risk has now been determined to be only 25%.

What this possible auto-reactivity may portend is the worst case possibly —  antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).  

That means a vaccine increases viral transmission and increases fatality.  ADE, by the way, is known to be common to coronaviruses.

The “weaknesses” of such studies are understood by the scientific community and are clearly acknowledged in any peer-reviewed publication. None of this is apparent in this article aimed at the general public. Second, such —again apparent —alarming news triggers a flight of fancy in the minds of the public, as evidenced by the comments regarding the vaccine.

13 doctors at CDC decided vaccine priority.  Naturally, they deemed themselves to get vaccination first, themselves and 21 million people who work with or for them despite that the vast majority of them are under age 50 and that most of those people are not really medical workers and don't interact with patients (they are administrators, billing clerks, phone operators, even the hospital gardener).

The 13 doctors also gave priority to younger politicians, younger cops, many other younger gov't employees, and 4 million teachers (nearly all aged 22-60).

The result.....seniors have been dying by the thousands while millions of privileged younger people are protected from mild illness.

Pfizer and Moderna have committed a combined 200 million doses by the end of March. This means there is 150 million to go in about 9 weeks, suggesting production averaging over 16 million doses per week. Why are we only distributing just over 10 million weekly?

However, you can spin around all day long and demand we give billions more to companies to make even 'better' vaccines, but that won't stop the virus.  Mortality rates go down usually as a virus mutates, but this one was man made so who knows.

In the end, there is no perfect vaccine, but getting it is the right thing to do.  Paying billions more for the next mutant is a fools game.  Ask scientists, not journalists (or writers)."

Novavax also has a much better safety profile than Pfizer and Moderna, and can be transported and stored at refrigerated temperatures.

Clearly, a $15 minimum wage will reduce federal outlays for SNAP (food stamps) and other federal programs which subsidize companies that pay low wages.  Similarly, higher paid employees will pay more in federal income taxes.

Along the same lines, the PRO-Act (Protect the Right to Organize) should pass via Reconciliation.  It's a fact that unionized workers are paid more in wages and benefits---including healthcare.  As more employees have collective bargaining rights, federal outlays for Medicaid, SNAP, and other programs serving low paid employees (and subsidizing their employers) are reduced.  And higher paid employees pay more in income taxes.

If the shoe were on the other foot, this would have already been enacted. The GOP are nothing if not skilled at using every trick to their advantage. The Democrats would rather hold hands, sing kumbaya and wonder why nothing gets done.

Wake up Schumer and Pelosi, you have an opportunity to make a difference. Time is running out."
2021-01-29 07:40:03,"Republicans have not demonstrated interest in governing or compromising for over a decade now. Their interest is in acquiring or maintaining power, for power’s sake.

2021-01-29 07:56:47,"The ugly truth of bipartisan cooperation with Republicans, particularly in the last decade, is that Democrats always lose, and in the process lose the support of the very people that they are trying to help. Republicans just aren't interested in Democratic goals, but they are very interested in sabotaging whatever legislation that Democrats are pushing for. McConnell has been a master of obstruction, and it's unlikely that he's had a change of heart simply because Trump is no longer President. Democrats have to push through every bill in any way they can without hoping for some miracle of bipartisanship, especially with the new, angry, Trumpistas taking control of the Republican party, because they clearly aren't interested in compromise."
2021-01-29 08:02:06,"“If our Republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them”

I hope Mr Schumer follows through with this, especially having just read in a NYT Opinion piece that despite the Senate’s apparent “50/50” split, Democrats represent 41 million more people than Republicans. If ever anyone could claim a “mandate” it would be now.

It’s time for the Republicans who so appalling bungled the pandemic response with the resultant loss of hundreds and thousands of American lives, to get out of the way and let members of Congress who actually care about other people, do their job and save lives and the economy.

And anyone standing in their way should be administered the kind of punishment meted out to those who try to obstruct the efforts of paramedics attending an accident scene."

2021-01-29 08:29:05,"In their endless striving for bi-partisanship, the Democrats take the high ground and act as though the Republicans are a normal political party with genuine interests in governing. Why?

The Republicans are a party supporting genuine loonies (like Marjorie Taylor Greene) spouting the most outrageous conspiracy theories, presenting a genuine danger to our country. But they're okay with that because anything goes with the Republican ""party"" as long as they win power. 

Democrats must use their power now and make people's lives better. That's the only way to unite anyone."

There is never enough American money, American know-how, and American Ingenuity to fix the world and all it's problems.  So, why not just spend the money at home on our own people? 
The Republicans are all  multi-millionaires. They don't have a clue what it's like to suffer. Their idea of being deprived is having to fly commercial instead of private.  They would lecture the common folk on getting a job and exposing themselves to risk during this pandemic are wealthy beyond all belief.  We give billions of dollars to all these foreign countries who hate us, why not spend the money at home instead?  People wonder where we will get the money to pay for these programs.  Easy.  Just stop wasting all our money on foreign aid.   Make our European Allies pay their fair share to help us support the cost of stationing troops in their countries.  And, last but not least, If we had all the money we wasted in Iraq and Afghanistan. and if we stopped building structures overseas like water treatment plants, that these countries don't want and don't need, there would be plenty of money left over to make the USA  a paradise.

I am not a conservative, but think this would be a more meaningful, productive way of providing help while ensuring the final expenditure is smaller compared to what it would be by sending out checks to every household regardless of what they make and whether or not they need help."
2021-01-29 10:02:03,"I have two thoughts; first people making more than $75,000 or families more than $200,000 should not get stimulus checks, next if Biden and his people can't get the check out in the next 60-days MAX he should resign and let his VP take over."

But does anyone belief that Trump, Cruz, Hawley, McCarthy or Collins , or the many spinelesse followers of the Trump-cult will care? The same people that now refuse to impeach Trump for Jan 6th will play dirty, lie to & deceive voters and claim again the election of 2020 was stolen.

After numerous compromises that gutted the effectiveness of the act, Republicans still refused to vote for it, purely to make political hay.  Their principle goal is to prevent successful governance that may reflect well on Democrats.

The GOP fiscal hawks are quiescent under GOP administrations, which have given us the biggest deficit explosions for 40 years now, due to irresponsible tax cuts.

Bi-partenship is a convenient fairy tale the Joe Biden wants to embrace.  But, at the end of the day, it's up to the Republicans to come and join with them.  
The Democrats would be wise to do what they have to do for the benefit of the country and ignore the Multi-millionaire Republicans who don't have a clue what it's like to suffer.
The American people need money to pay their mortgages, their rent, their car payments, and buy food and medicine.   They should be able to shelter in place and that's cheap at any price.

The nation would have been in a much stronger position to fight Covid if the original Obama economic recovery bills had passed - and if the party had spoken up when Trump claimed he had been responsible for an economy wrecked by the GWB administration, and just come on line again when Obama’s 8 years were up.
What did he do? He slashed taxes for the wealthy and left an empty treasury - as well as an empty medical emergency supply system - handed billions of research dollars to Big Pharma instead of pushing a no-Intellectual-Property world effort to create vaccine creating duplication of efforts including those that were obvious from the start failures - offering money to buy vaccine from any company able to produce the winning designs, with a bonus for winning design teams.
Then he handed off responsibility for stopping the pandemic to 50 governors and a UN stripped of US leadership.

Biden should say that for every Republican who votes yes on the relief bill, he'll give each of us an extra $100. $1,500 for every man, woman and child if we can get McConnell to vote yes. You want to see ""democracy in action""? Try that.

2021-01-29 10:31:11,"We need to correct one oft reported perception in the media, there are no moderates in the Republican Party. They have spent twenty four years primarying moderates from the right, and then conservatives from the right. What is left is a group of Senators and Representatives that include a smattering number of very conservative Republicans that stand out in contrast to the reactionary Republicans they serve with. What moderate Republican Senators stood against the rushed confirmation of an ultra conservative Supreme Court Justice days before the presidential election? Which of them supported the confirmation of the moderate Circuit Court of Appeals judge to the Supreme Court during the Obama administration?

Maybe the first bill through the House and Senate should be admitting the District of Columbia into our union as the 51st state. The second bill could make Puerto Rico the 52nd state. And then they convict Donald John Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors for his giving voice to an insurrection that wanted to hang our Vice President. If Republicans vote against conviction in sufficient numbers to block one single count against him, then there are no conservatives left in the Senate.

The fourth item should be voting rights with the American Recovery Plan coming shortly thereafter. What doomed the Obama recovery plan was it didn’t provide enough assistance to those that were hurt the most. Be bold. Use the bully pulpit to sell the COVID recovery plan to America."
2021-01-29 10:36:57,"From the article: ""When Republicans controlled both chambers and the White House in 2017, they used the process (budget reconciliation) twice.""

Why not remind readers what they did, and tried to do, with those reconciliation measures? The first was passing the $2 trillion tax cuts primarily for people and corporations who don't need them, and the second was trying to kill the ACA - which of course was stopped by a few votes from their own party, including John McCain's.

The GOP damaged the country in the first instance, and tried to take health care away from millions of people in the second. This bill is disaster relief. Ergo, the difference between what the GOP did with reconciliation and what the Dems want to do now is as stark as anything in public life ever."
2021-01-29 10:45:52,These are the most difficult times since the thirties both economic and health wise. I think the hand has been opened to the GOP and refused. The GOP not shy with tax cuts two years ago is not phased by the hunger games of today give them a tin cup and pencils! The privileged have run and dictated policy for too long.

2021-01-29 10:54:46,"Isn't it wonderful that Democrats suddenly discovered at the end of December 2020 that a stimulus package they had been blocking since August was necessary?

2021-01-29 11:07:14,"Ezra Klein, in his recent Times op-ed and in an interview published online in the Atlantic, hit the ""nail on the head"". The Democrats need to go big and pass legislation that will IMMEDIATELY BENEFIT Americans. The relatively ""paltry"" $800 billion relief package passed by Obama in early 2009 mostly contained provisions that had no immediate impact on everyday Americans and was later used by the newly created Tea Party to pillory Democrats for bailing out the banks to the detriment of the common man. The later passage of Obamacare, though ultimately incredibly helpful to many millions of Americans, had no immediate impact either and was used as a weapon to unseat dozens of Democratic reps and senators in Nov. 2010.

The ""lesson"" is to go big and put money in Americans pockets right now. Otherwise a great opportunity will have been squandered."

2021-01-29 11:11:56,"Those who argue that we can't take on any more debt because our children and grandchildren will be paying the bill in the future lose sight of the fact that our children and grandchildren are suffering now: many are hungry, their parents having lost their jobs; some are either homeless or are threatened with homelessness for the same reason (parents have lost their jobs and can't pay the rent/mortgage); their schooling is disrupted.  On top of that, thousands of families with children have suffered the death of a parent, in some cases both parents, and/or a grandparent or two.  The Biden package has provisions that attack these problems: direct payments not only help people who are out of work and unable to buy food or pay rent, but they also enable others who can afford it to pass their own stimulus payments on to food pantries and the like; money for local and state governments will probably prevent layoffs; infrastructure work has proven in the past to benefit both those who need jobs and the country as a whole.

So push/ram through any and all benefits in whatever manner is necessary and do it now!
Note: Those over a certain income level do not need the same relief as others so reduce the package by that amount. 
And insure that the American People know that it is Biden and the Democratic Party that is making this happen. So use the USPS to insure that the public knows who is working for them.  And list the congress people who are blocking the package along with their objections and get that into the hands of the people who are benefiting despite the GOP's tactics. 
There are no moderate Republicans in Congress ... only relative less radical.  True conservatives have left or are leaving the GOP to rot on its own putrid state ... the schism between what is left of conservatives and the Trumpers has now defined the party.

The American people voted for you to help them, to help everyone in our country.  If the Republicans refuse to help or drag their feet and try to delay the aid (like Senator Romney when he said he wants to see what effect the first economic relief package has on our economy), do it without them.

Tying the hands of the Democratic party will create the conditions they so desperately need to gain power in the 2022 midterms, and regain the White House in 2024.

If the Democrats cede control to them this early in the game, then it is obvious that they are back to their decades long incrementalist policies, policies which disenfranchised the poor and middle-class, causing the rise of Trump and the beginning of the end of our Democratic Republic.

The American people have been successfully used, abused, and lied to, by both Republicans and Democrats, for several decades, become pawns in a game designed to beggar the poor and middle-class and reduce them to economic slavery."

It is dangerous and unethical that nurses and doctors regularly work 14 hour and 24+ hour shifts.  

Excessive work hours contributes to medical errors and preventable suffering and death of patients.  Providers are burning out and developing high rates of mental health and substance abuse disorders.  They are being asked to perform both lifesaving roles as well as roles of hospice.  They are being asked to perform their duties while training numerous new reinforcements from nursing schools.

Sure corps will release PR statements that they ""care"" about workers, patients, and the public but words are cheap, much cheaper then treating workers properly.

Currently, Nurses are buried by computer demands, many with inadequate COVId protection (& no voice to correct this), and unsafe patient care ratios, over which they have little impact unless unionized, even pre- COVId.  Thirty years ago, Nurses voices in employment were gaining traction.  The MDs & MBAs put a stop to that in the 1990s, as they wrestled power/influence away. Do not wonder, for one minute, why you have a US Nursing shortage.

Back at the beginning of March the nurses were told not to wear their masks in the hallways on their floor. That would be a bad visual. There was no regard for protecting the staff or the patients. Only PR for the corporation.

At a zoom meeting in the summer hearing harrowing testimonials of the lack of PPE and precautions from the nursing union representatives of the administration had the gall to say, ""I think you think what you're saying is true about what's happening on the unit but you're wrong."" This from pencil pushers who have never set foot on the floor.

So, believe the lying mouths of the hospital administration rather than the eyes of the nurses who work with the sick and dying twelve and a half hours a day.

Federal researchers said Tuesday that they had found “little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission” in places that take safety seriously.” 

Misleading. Schools don’t exist in vacuums. The point left out here is that schools within communities that have high Covid-19 rates have been deemed to be unsafe by the CDC. Plenty of areas that have high infection rates have schools that are open in some form or fashion.

I understand that in-person jobs are necessary, like like grocery stores for instance. However, in jobs where one can work remotely in order to be safe like in offices, financial institutions, call banks and so forth, workers are being protected. Teachers, not so. Teachers are just not a priority. Plain and simple. Expendable. And this poor gentleman is an example.

My guess is that public schools are deemed essential not out of any great concern for the welfare of kids, but to get their parents working in order to keep the market system functional. Let’s face it, if there was a great concern about the education of children then we would have seen real effort being made to improve schools somewhere in the last 40 years."

In fact, they can interfere with circulation, creating pockets of air where the virus can collect.  “Masking, distancing, and sanitizing” is not sufficient without addressing circulation/ventilation/air filtration.  Drs Linsey Marr, Kimberly Prather, Richard Corsi, John Volckens, and many other aerosol scientists daily publicize this well-documented information on social media with links to peer-reviewed studies.  
If an individual is positive and asymptomatic, or presymptomatic, yet still contagious, and sits in a classroom for 3 hours wearing a poorly-fitted mask below or loose around the nose, with windows closed and no air filter, the virus will accumulate within that closed space, and others, also with poorly fitted masks, will inhale that stale air.
Some school policies officials allow students take masks off once in the classroom and only require them when students change classes.  This is ridiculous.
The uninformed nonuniform application of preventative measures is maddening, and I am sad to say that even the Mayo Clinic site, on its vaccination info page, still only refers to masking, distancing, and sanitizing.  This virus is airborne. Scientists have known this for many, many months. Why isn’t this being universally addressed? KN95s and HEPA filters should be available and required for all!"

I was told a negative test result wouldn’t have changed this fact, which is neither here nor there because I’m too close to the exposure for me to be tested anyway. And I’m not the only teacher within my school in this predicament. You can’t get vaccinated in quarantine. When I tried to get a vaccination appointment for a later date I was told by the health dept that there are no more appointments. This could have been avoided if they would have  temporarily shuttered the school just long enough to vaccinate the staff safety, but they are keeping schools open for in-person learning, regardless.

Every day I’m told by the news how safe I am, despite the fact that I’m in a community with high infection rates. There was a study... I have preexisting conditions as well. Same with several of my colleagues. Any of us could be the next article. Thoughts and prayers."

“The lack of contact tracing in most of the country, as well as the rapid spread of the virus throughout much of the United States in recent months, makes it nearly impossible to know where most of those teachers contracted the virus.”

These evidently incompatible statements are good examples of why people don’t trust either the science or the reporting on the science (I’m not sure which). If there is insufficient testing and extremely limited contact tracing, there is no way to say whether schools are or aren’t (would or wouldn’t be) significant sources of transmission — whether that be child-to-staff, staff-to-child or staff-to-staff.

It would be ever so much better if both science and journalism started to use a phrase that’s seemingly anathema to both: WE DON’T KNOW.

One often cannot say for sure where one got it from and so many cases in schools are seen as not picked up at school as the evidence is not watertight i.e. there are huge holes in the don't worry schools are safe! theory.

But the ""answer"" can't be for public schools to just turn off until COVID is completely gone. The US can't do a Chinese style shut down - it won't work here.  But the Federal or State level can dictate a process to open schools and then make that a condition to receive school funding.  

Teachers should get real PPE (not DIY masks), like KN95 masks that are now readily available for under $1 each.  Students should be required to wear at least medical masks if not KN95- and if they don't they are excused back to distance learning for a week on their first offense.

A standard is set for classroom ventilation is set and measured.  But that standard needs to allow windows to be open - not new schools to be built.

Safe Distance in classes is determined - including specs for barriers between desks and layouts are tested and approved. 

We now have the scientific knowledge to determine how to best manage this pandemic.  

There is no reason why we can't join the rest of the rich world and educate our youth.  But someone in government, at either the state or federal level needs to do some real work (and research) to figure this all out.  To date we've all been playing politics - but blaming Trump isn't going to make the situation any better."
2021-01-27 19:51:58,"As educators die from Covid, I feel such sympathy for teachers, their families, and their students. Covid 19 is a deadly infectious disease.  New mutations are considered capable of being more infectious.  There is now a new California variant that some scientists believe is better at evading our antibody protections, and that variant has spread widely in both the SF Bay area and in Los Angeles. Unless school districts take all mitigation efforts seriously, more teachers will die and more of their spouses and children and students will have to deal with the pain of that loss.  Superintendents, school board members, and parents who think children should be in school, no matter the deaths that may result, are heartless."
2021-01-27 20:30:25,"There are two issues here that seem central:

(1) The CDC has said that schools are safe IF safety protocols are followed.  Teachers know that schools are underfunded, parents have varying levels of willingness and ability to follow community safety guidelines,  and that the pressure to return students is immense.   If teachers are hesitant about safety practices, that's very understandable.  

(2) There are things worth risking lives for and things NOT worth risking lives for, and we should all do what we can to keep risks low when things must be done.  Grocery workers provide the food we need to eat.  I do curbside pickup, every time, out of respect for their risk.  Nurses and doctors provide the health care we need to live.  I keep my risk level extremely low, in part, so I can try not to be the COVID patient that pushes them to the brink.  

It seems the subject of this article was exposed so students could take the SAT, not so a disabled student could get early intervention.  And the loudest ""back to school"" agitators in my community drink maskless in bars and have parties with five cars parked outside a house.  

If we want teachers to embrace teaching in person, communities need to fully fund safety practices, demonstrate that they're willing to prioritize according to educational need,  and willing to make other sacrifices to keep their children's teachers safe."
2021-01-27 20:35:10,"The true problem is lack of collective bargaining for teachers and other civil servants.  There is no way for employees to educate & advocate for not only better general working conditions but also for increased salaries and benefits.  

If anything has been learned during this pandemic, by parents and community leaders in regard to education it is the importance of trained teachers.  How this importance is translated into better working conditions for teachers will depend on how much collective pressure (e. g., going to & speaking at board of education meetings) and changing state laws regarding collective bargaining will result after the pandemic has abated."
2021-01-27 20:48:17,"This is heartbreaking. Sending my warmest thoughts and concern to his family.

Reading about this extraordinary man reminds me of something I realized last year. 

I have been blessed with legions of superb teachers, stretching from a pre-school that somehow tolerated and channeled my hyper-activity to PhD advisors who who could not have been more brilliant and supportive.

By the time I retired from my university professorship, I had taught thousands of students, mentored hundreds, and supervised a number of PhD dissertations.

What I realized, though, is that my most profound growth as a thinker and writer and human being occurred in elementary and secondary school. I kept close to the very best of those teachers, those to whom I owed so much, and mourned when they passed away. And I was always keenly aware  that they were the ones who really helped me bake the cake. Later, as an undergrad and beyond, came the many dedicated university professors who helped me pile on layer after layer of frosting.

Which leads me to Mr Erick Ortiz and the tears that are flowing so freely as I write this.

On so many occasions when adolescence threatened to overwhelm, when I doubted my ability in spite of so much encouragement, I was blessed with a Mr Ortiz who kept the faith and encouraged me to be a better person and a more creative and critical thinker. 

I'm going to miss you, Mr Ortiz. So much."
2021-01-27 20:49:17,"There are some important distinctions for public school teachers as compared to other employees -- they are public employees, they are in contact with a population that has a higher rate of asymptomatic infection, as examples -- but there are other jobs that entail roughly equivalent risks, where employees are being given less input as to whether they should continue to be paid for work on different (i.e., ""virtual"") terms. Teachers are a particular case, to be sure, but they do not stand alone in risk profile, nor is their risk profile the highest (especially if mitigation measures are deployed in their schools). The actual infection and death rates in many schools are lower than in many of their school-adjacent general populations. That does not mean we MUST force teachers to work in person, but it's a fact we must deal with."
2021-01-27 20:54:55,We don’t really have a sense of how safe in-person instruction is for teachers. During the fall we learned that masking and social distancing were effective mitigation tactics which prevented schools from being covid hot spots. That doesn’t mean that teachers who provide in-person instruction are not at a greater risk of infection. A recent study out of Cal suggests that teacher assistants experienced excess mortality from March to October of last year on par with bartenders and nurses. I suspect that even greater excess teacher mortality could be established if we were to look at data for winter months in places where schools were open to in-person instruction. Not holding my breath for a CDC press conference on the results.
2021-01-27 21:00:07,"High risk individuals were moved from Phase 1b to 1c. Many at risk patients those with diabetes, Immunencomprised and more would likely be closed being vaccinated. This would allow many of them to free safe returning to work."
2021-01-27 20:37:54,"People complain about not having in school instruction, and then officials drag their feet on vaccinations for teachers. No wonder teachers leave the profession. Low pay, low respect, and even lower consideration for their health and the health of their families. Idiocy."
2021-01-27 20:57:59,so does that mean that if a grocery store clerk dies of Covid we need to close all grocery stores? Nothing shows this teacher got sick because of in person attendance in his school. But of course the unions will weaponize this to continue to hold kids hostages. Sickening.
2021-01-27 20:13:48,"Deepest condolences to the Ortiz family - this is really very sad.  But what a sensationalist headline, especially when it sounds like they really have no idea where Mr. Ortiz contracted the virus. Studies show most working teachers get exposed outside of school, or, if during school, from other teachers."
2021-01-27 19:52:06,"The job of a teacher is to _effectively_ teach our children.  If teaching can’t properly and effectively  be done remotely (and yes, it appears that remote learning does not work well for a large portion of students) , then it must be done in person .... just like nursing or bus-driving or being a cashier at a grocery store.

As the article stated: “ There is no indication that teachers are dying at a higher rate than other professionals, and no evidence that the coronavirus is spreading faster in schools than in communities at large, especially in districts where health precautions are strictly followed.”  

Please get back to doing your job in person, just like the rest of us who have jobs that can’t fully, effectively, and properly be performed from home."
2021-01-27 20:45:45,"And yet in my state and at least a few others - teachers are not in the first groups to get the vaccine 
in my state it's all by age - so someone who is retired and sitting at home watching TV gets it before someone who is out there teaching - 
it's crazy and profoundly unfair - there are many healthy folks in their 70s who can and do limit their interactions 
teachers, folks in retail they deserve the vaccine first"
2021-01-27 20:33:31,"""Federal researchers said Tuesday that they had found “little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission” in places that take safety seriously."" 

Those standards are described in this article 

<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775875"" target=""_blank"">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775875</a>

which is further explained in this NYT article.

The main point is that, unexpectedly, K-12 schools don't seem to promote transmission of covid-19. 

However, that only holds when certain conditions of safety are met. For example: 

""crowded classrooms with insufficient physical distancing (eg, student density in classrooms exceeded recommended values), exemption from face mask use, and continuous air conditioning that recycled interior air in closed rooms during a heat wave."" 

So teachers would be justified in refusing to work in schools like that."
2021-01-27 20:37:42,God Bless Teachers. God Bless the Unions that protect them!
2021-01-27 20:31:38,"Remote learning may not be the best for students, but it won’t kill them. And if the justification for keeping schools open is to provide day care, then a parent should be subsidized to stay at home from work. When there is an alternative, for example, curbside delivery in the case of grocery stores, it should be used instead of exposing workers and the people they serve to the possibility of death. Remote learning is a reasonable alternative. “It’s only 530.” I can’t believe I just read that as a justification for exposure to an avoidable risk of death. It’s not forever. Put on a mask and observe common sense public health standards. There will be an end to the pandemic. I admire greatly teachers who take this risk, but there isn’t enough money in the world that would get me to risk having to change places with Mr. Ortiz."
2021-01-27 20:47:33,"Granted a very different issue, but I remember Christine Todd 
Whitman, reassuring with authority that the 9/11 site  downtown was not toxic and workers need not be overly concerned with cleaning it up. Right. We all know how that went.
It is baffling, that while conceding insufficient data, not knowing where folks are contracting the virus, nor in what proportion, nor having adequate supplies to protect staffs, communities still believe teachers, among other public servants, should go back to work.
How often have we heard updates where numbers or impact were far ""greater than originally thought""?
Let's just stop the Trumpian lies and address, nationwide, the reality."
2021-01-27 21:33:50,"Teachers:  

Don't proctor groups of 20 students for SAT exams in  a classroom setting. Insist on an area such as a cafeteria with more spacing and air flow.   

In my school district, the extra pay at $37.61 per hour is not worth the potential exposure."
2021-01-27 21:42:14,I am so thankful for the nurses and doctors that risk their health everyday. I am thankful for the educators in the schools across the South and Midwest. I am not thankful for the educators that hide behind the unions with zero regard for the impact they are having on their students. The science says it is safe. Follow the science.
2021-01-27 21:42:45,My heart goes out to this family. Heartbreaking to see them lose such a wonderful husband/father and outstanding teacher - when this very possibly could have been prevented.
2021-01-27 21:46:27,"My heart goes out to Mr. Ortiz's family and other families who have lost loved ones to Covid-19. As an American living in Madrid with three children ages 4, 6, and 9 years old who have been attending in-person public school with approx. 900 students since September I can share a little bit of our experiences here. We honestly didn't think schools would be open more than two weeks, but it has gone much better than expected. 
So far, the only cases I am aware of in the school have been children who have tested positive after a family member tested positive. This has happened in two of my children's classes. One child tested positive in the 2nd week, but because she hadn't attended in the days previous to her positive result, the class wasn't quarantined. Coincidentally, a number of children including my own had fevers that same week. All were given PCR tests and there were no positive results. This was in my four year old's class where the kids don't wear masks. All kids age 6+, teachers, and other school staff must wear masks all day, except when eating or drinking. Desks are spaced out, hands are washed frequently. Class groups are kept separate (kids enter through separate school entrances and don't mix at recess and lunch). 
I think the biggest factor, though, in keeping everyone safe is the ventilation. The windows are kept open all day, even during the cold of winter (kids are told to dress in layers). There is no plexiglass. We're so grateful to our children's teachers!"
2021-01-27 22:09:14,"Until states prioritize education over keeping restaurants and bars open, schools will continue to be high risk environments. Schools can only be safe if all other safety precautions (masks, social distancing, hand washing, etc. ) are being followed by the community at large, which they are obviously not. It just goes to show how education is seen in the United States and how our society views teachers."
2021-01-27 22:09:57,my deepest condolences to this family.  I am teary eyed in Canada for your loss.   I read plenty of news about the USA and it's my thought that better education will help you out in the longer term.  thank you teachers.
2021-01-27 21:03:17,"My wife is an elementary school teacher.  We are both approaching retirement age.  She did not return to teach this year and instead took medical leave due to my health issues.  I have bad asthma to the extent I have to use a nebulizer on and off.  She did not want to risk bringing COVID home to me.  We have taken many precautions avoiding any large gatherings, social distancing and always wearing masks when out.  Unfortunately her leave and saved sick days are running out.  We are faced with losing her income or her returning and potentially bringing home COVID.  Her school and the district have done a fairly good job at trying minimize the risk.  As the CDC indicated students should be back at school IF other precautions are taken in the community.  This is the problem especially here in the upstate of South Carolina.  Peoples behavior is such that our county has one of the highest infection rates in the country.  I recently visited a crowded local auto parts store and I was the only one wearing a mask.  While the schools are doing what they can some of the parents are not and thus the risk."
2021-01-27 21:09:06,"Teachers are not being included in class 1B in Texas (unless they have a high risk condition) despite working in classrooms with kids since August. We are emotionally exhausted and frayed with the constant sense of danger, despite kids and teachers almost all wearing masks daily."
2021-01-27 21:40:41,"no evidence that the coronavirus is spreading faster in schools than in communities at large, especially in districts where health precautions are strictly followed.

Yes, well, there is that little caveat, isn't there. Kid says "" My mom says it's all fake and I don't have to wear no mask!""

Now - wat cha gonna do?  Send the kid home? Good luck with that, since all it takes is a spineless principal or board member to make an exception, the first of many.
then there is In Houston, which like all Texas school districts was required by the state to offer an in-person teaching option last fall, the school system has a mask mandate and requires six feet of social distancing “whenever possible.” A district spokesperson said it also set up daily temperature checks at school entrances, plexiglass dividers in classrooms and nasal swab testing on campus — though several teachers disputed the ubiquity of those practices.

"" inadequate dividers... no routine testing despite district policy... students who had coronavirus cases in their families, and even deaths, but came to school with symptoms anyway.""

But hey - gotta get the public day care system back up and running, amirite?"
2021-01-27 21:53:08,"To the teachers and unions opposing even minimal in-person teaching (e.g., 1-2 half-days with 6-10 children), what, exactly, are you doing and will you do in order to ensure that our children are safe from the dire mental health risks many of them face as a result of all-remote teaching?"
2021-01-27 21:54:31,"I feel badly for anyone who has gotten Covid but especially for those who died and their families.  That said, what proof is there that he contracted it in school?  There is much judgment being made by many when someone gets Covid and dies as to the circumstances that led them to get it.  Usually those assumptions have little to no basis with supporting facts but drives people to make sweeping assumptions and knee jerk reactions.  Fear is by far the driving force in decisions now and science is taking a back seat, regardless of the political party in charge. With so many people getting it just from community spread it is unfortunate as to how heavy ""presumption"" is coming into play with no supporting data."
2021-01-27 22:29:58,Trump didn’t do much of anything to help decrease cases - he just acted as though the pandemic was in the process of disappearing - allowed many thousands of additional deaths that could have been prevented - is this unique to him or the Laissez-faire attitude of Republicans￼.
2021-01-27 22:28:00,"As terrible as this is, how many of these individuals caught COVID from the schools they work in, versus other activities? At least up here in Mass, the overwhelming majority of cases of teachers catching the virus have been tied to activities they partook outside of school hours- few outbreaks have been tied to schools.

As usual though, put forward a shock headline to forward a politicized point and omit any inconvenient context. Journalistic irresponsibility at its finest."
2021-01-27 21:20:29,"Apparently, we’re to take away from this piece that the emotional impact on students, teachers, and communities of teachers’ deaths from COVID-19 are driving an irrational response to the pandemic—ie, suspending in-personal instruction. The reporter tells us there’s no indication of increased risk of contagion in classrooms. But absence of evidence is not evidence of lack of risk, given it’s not discussed how much the question has been studied. The CDC may be correct that risk is not especially elevated in schools when proper precautions are instituted, but school administrations aren’t inclined to spend the necessary responses. Further, many students, like their parents, to care to wear masks. And, as anyone who has actually been in a school would notice, a school, with closed up classrooms and crowded halls, is not the same as as a Walmart. Notwithstanding the animus towards teachers’ unions that often appears in Times articles, and in the inevitable comments from teacher-hating readers, the responses from unions is rational and in keeping with their mission of protecting their members."
2021-01-27 21:35:10,"Considering credible reports that newer and emerging  strains of CoVID-19 may be both more contagious to and among children and youth, and more deadly, it would make more sense to re-open in-person general education programs once a community’s children, not just adult teachers, are vaccinated.  

Since currently the vaccines have been approved for use in persons 16 years and older, with testing for 12-15 year-olds just getting started, it behooves us to limit in-person, multi-household schooling; and to press for the development of vaccines that are safe and fully effective for the 5-12 crowd as well."
2021-01-27 21:47:33,"How sad. Losing anybody, especially in a closely knit family, to Covid, must be devastating. Of note, any death to disease instead of old age, may be an affliction we must contend with until we find a better way to control the ravages of being ill or, even better, prevent things to begin with. If only we had a responsible president a year ago...instead of one so indifferent and inept, things might have been so much better. So much for that.  But as a special note now, teachers, along with nurses, remain the noblest professions we can think of, where knowledge meets dedication and mentoring of students, with the hope that  pupils may exceed the teacher's own excellence in talent and eventual service to their community. May we join you in your grief, and trust you'll continue to embrace life in spite of the trials we have to go through. Vaya nuestro sentido pe'same."
2021-01-27 22:22:21,Are all teachers who are eligible for the vaccine actually getting it?  I know in NY they are eligible but not all are signing up to get it.  That's inexcusable.
2021-01-27 22:27:28,"We are so ""out of synch"" with the rest of the world. The UK - after keeping schools open - has closed them now with the new variant/s. Political pressure has now reached the point here where more schools are opening just as new variants pose a great threat to us navigating the virus. Expect more stories of dying teachers in the US in the coming months."
2021-01-27 21:25:21,"Re: the lack of evidence that COVID spreads via schools, please note: an absence of evidence does not constitute evidence of absence. Throughout this pandemic, I have seen magical thinking about children and schools: covid infects humans and many other species but miraculously leaves human children completely safe in all regards. Maybe there isn't specific documented evidence of a specific threat yet, but that doesn't imply safety."
2021-01-27 22:14:42,"Remember, it's not just deaths.  Deaths are important, but many who get Covid have long-term effects.  It's real, it's serious.   Let's get every teacher vaccinated right away.  Then, let's get students vaccinated as soon as the vaccines have been proven safe and effective for those under 16."
2021-01-27 22:03:43,"What is it about parents (especially affluent white parents) that they can't stand their children to the point that they demand others give their lives to get them out of the house a few days a week? Raise children you like to be around, and this will be less of a problem.

2021-01-27 23:00:56,"In today's NYTimes, there is an article about how infection rates are really low in schools and that they can reopen. In North Louisiana, we had an outbreak that involved nearly half the students and teachers. So clearly, it depends on the school. 

No teacher or student should be required to give their lives to keep schools open."
2021-01-27 22:50:35,"Teachers- perpetually underappreciated, vilified, and scorned in the United States. A profession that will probably soon be dying, along with the teachers who died during this plague, when their government abandoned them. 

Shame on the United States, forever, for what they have done to the profession of teaching."
2021-01-27 22:39:41,"I work in a District on Long Island and it seems to me that the staff are every bit as much of the problem as the administers and students.  I walk the halls and everyday see them sitting in offices, eating and talking to colleagues without social distancing.  Everyday I walk by classrooms and see every window closed.  Not even open a crack!  Today, I noticed that the windows I had partially opened in the hallway had been closed?  By who?  Why?  Because it was 39 degrees outside?  People, do you not now there’s a Pandemic?  We are our own worst enemies."

2021-01-27 23:00:46,"My grief reaction to this type of story is one of white hot fury, not sadness.  Teachers are dying because this is a contagious respiratory disease, and most on-the-ground practices in a school building are far from the elaborate safety measures that would keep people safe."

Through contract tracing it is estimated that only one of the COVID cases was based on person to person transmission at the office.  Social distancing and masks work (they are enforced where I work).  I attended classes at the University of Miami.  Same thing there with very little/no COVID spread in classes assessed. I realize that it harder with young children, but social distancing and masks should significantly mitigate risk."
2021-01-27 23:51:12,"As I mentioned in the comments to the ""CDC says schools can be safe"" article, my school returned to fully in-person teaching on Monday.  On Tuesday, the students were pool-tested.  Today, we were advised that there was at least one positive in the pool-test, and the students were all sent home.  Of course, the students (faculty, admin, etc.) have all been in school for two plus days with at least one infected student.  My school is probably doing more than most in terms of mitigation, but as every educator whose comments I've read have stated there are ""ideal"" mitigation protocols and then there is reality of a living, breathing classroom (no pun intended).  Children may not suffer the same effects as adults (although we obviously have no longitudinal information as to latent effects on a developing brain/body), but they certainly can and do transmit the virus as they would any virus.  One needn't be an epidemiologist to know the likelihood of spread - just an actual teacher."

2021-01-27 23:18:41,"Seems to me that those screaming the loudest for teachers to get back in the classroom are the most likely to oppose adequately funding schools to begin with and paying living wages.  It's not bad enough that they could barely pay their bills as it is and *still* scraped up their own money to buy the classroom supplies they weren't being given! They have to risk their lives, too?   

The disrespect this country has for teachers is appalling.  My sister had to resort to teaching in the Middle East to earn a living wage and be able to repay tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt she had to amass to even be qualified to teach.  Overseas, she has been teaching remotely for the better part of a year.  Is it ideal?  Of course not.  But you know what, she's not afraid of catching COVID and dying.  Little Billy and Susie's lives are not worth more than that of the people who teach them.  

If school is as important as we claim, we'd properly fund them, we'd implement effective social distancing measures, *apply them equally and enforce them.*  We'd make sure teachers and students have real PPE (N95 masks, at a minimum).  We'd give hazard pay in high-risk areas.  

If you don't support these measures and you're not on the front lines risking your life, please take a seat.  Kids can catch up on missed school.  They can socialize with others on their own, if it's that important to them.  But unless you have some magic up your sleeve, you can't bring back the dead."
2021-01-27 23:30:29,"This is an anecdote posing as the only truth out there. The headline's only purpose to stoke fear.  It's maddening. There is risk in everything; there always was, there always will be."

People on the outside, those who wouldn't be asked to enter the schools, read that it's safe as long as the necessary precautions are taken and say ""go ahead."" People who work in schools, knowing how dysfunctional most are in the first place, give a grim laugh when they read the words ""as long as necessary precautions are taken, and say ""no way."""
2021-01-27 23:33:26,"Thank you for publicly mentioning the death of Mr. Ortiz.  I know we've had staff members die too, but I don't know who they are.  I think the deaths in HISD and surrounding districts are being kept quiet because to admit death might lead to liability.  The district has not publicly mentioned Mr. Ortiz except when asked by media.  I know there are also a number of staff members that have died, but I don't know who they are because everything is kept very quiet. There is zero transparency. Teachers aren't even supposed to tell each other when they are sick.  The mantra is that you will be told if you need to know, whatever that means. What is even sadder is that, in my opinion, HISD is doing the best job in the area.  Don't think everything is going great in schools where everything is open and no one is getting sick. It simply isn't true.  

And the vulnerable kids everybody wants to be open for? The reason our student numbers are low is because those kids aren't coming to school. Their parents don't have the resources to take the risk of sending their kids back."

2021-01-28 00:24:16,"In our local school system one of the buildings is now closed for 14 days

The reason is out of control student transmission of COVID while in the school. 

The “conditions” for a safe in school experience do not exist yet. Republicans lying and spreading disease for 11 months makes those conditions much harder to achieve, but President Biden and Democrats are moving very swiftly to make it happen.

2021-01-28 00:53:09,"My deepest condolences to Maria Ortiz and to all mourning this loss. ""There is no evidence that"" (x is harmful) is a phrase that we associate with sound evidence based practice here only because we have normalized a culture that makes those most vulnerable into guinea pigs by assuming that we must have decisive proof of harm in order to proceed with strategies for mitigating threats associated with products and policies of various kinds. The bigger picture issue is that teachers feel devalued and dehumanized by the refusal to take basic steps to weigh evidence with attention to variation in levels of ventilation, at risk population, crowding, and community transmission, and refusal to provide adequate safety standards. Opening bars and restaurants then asking teachers to go back is just such a stupid mistake and who should pay for stupid mistakes with their lives? Let us think about what it really means to incorporate the precautionary principle into our policy and public health responses. The burden should not fall to the most vulnerable to prove they are at risk. We should be honest about weighing factors that warrant caution with those that are reassuring instead of using, ""there is no evidence of harm"" to silence real concerns. Commentators must stop mocking those who raise concern by suggesting that they do not understand the science-- of course they did this to the people of Flint as well. We convince people to take science seriously when we are honest about risk."

As a teacher in Austin, TX, my colleagues and I are afraid to go to work every day as our zip code positivity rate is above 20%. It is very hard to be an effective teacher when you fear for student and personal safety. Even our public health officials said clusters in schools will continue because of the high level of community transmission. Teachers in Texas are also not receiving the vaccine, it is reserved for those 65 and over or those with severe comorbidity. The Texas Standard reported that additional vaccines will not be available until May or June. Thanks for this story.

Distancing has worked with me being at least 6 feet away from students as has masking.   I have no more than  a dozen stidents in class at any one time due to some being remote full time and half the alphabet of hybrid students being remote.   While it’s not great all of us are happy that its working with minimal disruption.  I feel reasonably safe(although I will be double masking now for the variants)and the kids are happy for the two days rather than no days in school.

2021-01-28 02:03:31,"For schools to open safely, aside from the PPE, we need to run a double shift - i.e. mornings for some students and late afternoons/evenings for others.  We need to double the amount of teachers and cut class sizes in half.  Remarkably, small class size is a MAJOR contributing factor to student success - it's the one thing private schools do differently than public schools.   Less students mean teachers have more time to help struggling students succeed as well as making sure that the more fortunate/educated/talented students are challenged.

In Wisconsin, bars and restaurants are packed, and just as pressure to reopen all schools is intensifying, the state senate voted to overrule the governor's mask mandate.

This kind, caring and dedicated man, losing his life, that is an actual tragedy. The other 530 teachers and the many healthcare workers ( I believe just under 3000), who have died of covid in the US is the ACTUAL tragedy here. 400,000 dead, and thousands more each day, that is a tragedy.  Many foolish Americans refuse (their freedom!!) to even wear a mask, but teachers and nurses and doctors and others who work in hospitals or schools--we can all die? And that's okay?  Republican wingnuts are destroying this country, and I guess all of us trying to hold this land together are merely collateral damage while they pursue Q or the Rapture or pretend none of this is happening as they plot yet another insurrection.

So, therefore, schools aren't safe! I am still with the small, dwindling group of people trying to protect myself and my mother by limiting contact with others, but the minute you put me around people who aren't, I've effectively wiped out all effort I've made.

2021-01-28 05:06:46,"Anecdotes, no matter how tragic, should not be guiding state or national policies for any subject.  Not matter how many articles the NYT or WaPo writes about how terrible it is for schools to open, they can't change the data collected during the pandemic about in-person classroom attendance and instruction.

There are NO studies or data that show in-person school attendance leads to increased COVID cases or deaths.  The NYT and WaPo knows this because they have access to far better research tools than me.  And I'm reasonably sure if the data did exist, it would be cited here instead of personal anecdotes.

Here are the CDC's figures for deaths from 1/1/20 to 1/16/21 for total deaths of Americans 34 years and younger:
COVID:  2921
Influenza and Pneumonia:  2958
All causes:  133,896
Total population of Americans 34 and under:  149.2 million

This data clearly shows that if it isn't 'safe' enough to open the schools now, it will never be safe enough.  The teachers don't want to go back to work because of their irrational fear stoked by our newspapers of record.  Their cowardice has negatively affected millions of their students in the form of diminished education, increased physical and sexual abuse and hunger from the loss of subsidized school meals.  At the heart of it, they continue to be paid for NOT doing anything, so why would they want to change it.

I used to respect teachers and some of my role models growing up were teachers...not anymore."
2021-01-28 04:21:32,"School should open with masks on, and replace the teachers who don’t want that job.  Hire people that want to do the job at hand, and are dedicated to that task.  

No more coddling of teachers unions.  Every other industry is at work (except restaurants in a few areas of particularly draconian lockdown).  Grocery stores have far more traffic, and therefore exposure, then one static classroom group of 20-25 kids, for instance.  And more and more evidence is that kids don’t even transmit the virus very effectively.

Let the teachers stay home if the want to...but permanently."
2021-01-28 04:13:11,"""Public health experts have largely come to agree that schools, particularly elementary schools, are unlikely to seed transmission of the virus when community spread is low — provided those schools use mitigation strategies.""

That's an awfully big caveat.

I teach in-person right now. It's safe-ish, to the point where I suspect the most of the several cases amongst teachers and students were not contracted at school. 

But the line of thought espoused in the quote above and in far too many other articles pushing this agenda, is not one that can be defensibly extrapolated. I could understand public health experts' not foreseeing certain problems that are more esoteric the experience of working in a school, but some ought to be obvious to anyone not wilfully obtuse. 

Chief among these is the simple problem of space. Currently I rotate between classrooms with 12, 15, and 16 students. In the first of these, the students all sit about six feet from their peers (though they do so in the same room all day, taking their masks off to eat breakfast and lunch). In the other two classes, however, you're lucky if you've got 3-4 feet between students. (And that's before what i like to call ""Migrating Desk Syndrome"" kicks in.)

But at 30-35 students per room? The precondition of ""mitigation strategies"" pretty much goes out the (nonfunctional, like the so many in schools these days) window."
2021-01-28 05:00:48,"It's heartbreaking to read about the death of this dedicated and inspiring teacher, but we have little idea whether his profession is implicated in his illness and death.  Although His wife suspects that he contracted the virus while supervising an SnAT test, the story doesn't say whether he or the students observed masking and distancing precautions. Nor does the story report on the wider presence ofCOVID-19 in the High School itself.
Anecdotal stories  are riveting, but they don't help us understand the dynamics of the pandemic, unless they lead to studies which analyze the true risks. If previous studies have shown teachers are not at higher risk, as long as guidelines are followed, then follow the guidelines and open schools. Anecdotal stories like this one are riveting, but they don't help us understand the dynamics of the pandemic, unless they lead to studies which analyze the true risks. They will never be zero, but nothing in this story demonstrates that Mr Ortiz became ill because of his profession, or that teachers are at higher risk than others, as long as guidelines are followed."

2021-01-28 06:04:47,"There are so many issues being addressed in this article, from the loss of a loved one, to the lack of vaccines available to teachers, to how school districts work, to the reality of how viruses are transmitted.  As a high school teacher, teaching in the classroom since August, and 66 years young I have been extremely vigilant about masks and hygiene in my eight periods over two days. I see over 200 students in those two days and count my luck stars, as I constantly remind my students to wear their masks properly, even after five months. I am saddened to hear, when a teacher who loves their job as Mr. Ortiz did, that the teaching profession has lost another soul. And it goes without saying that these are crazy times, and we are all wading through the unknown together. However I am a strong supporter of schools being opened as there is nothing better than those high school faces regardless of masks. I’m sure Mr. Ortiz felt this way as he stated concern about his sub. We can only hope that teachers get the vaccine sooner than later. Our district was informed we would most likely get the vaccine the end of January, now that thinking has evaporated."
2021-01-28 08:02:22,"As a ""Behavioral Health Associate"" who has already received the vaccine, this story really affected me. I am a 26 year old who works in a long term residential home. This hero was older  and subjected to huge section of the community. Teachers deserve to be treated better than this. I care deeply for the clients I work with in a similar way this gentleman did. Why couldn't he get the vaccine, not to mention everything else people have been protesting and marching for in regards to education in this country."
2021-01-28 08:10:36,"Unlike anecdotal stories, broad test and trace data give us a better idea of how COVID is spreading so we can make informed public policy decision.  
Overwhelmingly, the data shows much lower rates of COVID in schools as compared to their larger communities.  Further where schools have good test and trace systems it has been shown that student to teacher transmission rare.  
It has been shown that where teachers are testing positive, they are many many times more likely to have contracted it outside of the school from doing any other thing (gatherings, family, shopping).  Where transmission to teachers has occurred inside the school, it has been shown that teacher to teacher transmission (while socializing at work essentially) is many times more problematic then the actual teaching part of the job.  
That data is large and solid.  Its worldwide. And its growing.  How long can the teachers union fight the preponderance of data?  How many private schools can open successfully in the same areas?  How many other countries can open and operate a public schools before we are willing make public decisions based on facts instead of feelings."
2021-01-28 08:54:49,"I am heart broken whenever I read of a teacher dying.

But it is important to recognize that Mr. Ortiz was working in only 1 of the several thousand public school districts in the country, and in Texas, a state often associated with few protections or worker safety standards.

This crisis is exposing the vast range that exists in our fragmented approach to public education. Not all school districts are the same. Not all states are the same. The NYT needs to reflect that in their coverage, because the public in tends to latch onto anecdotes to take a position. That is the opposite of trusting science.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, local teacher unions that had the public's support for decades, have been using every tactic to keep delaying reopening despite mitigations, phenomenal weather for outdoors instruction, and more. In March 2020, we voted to tax ourselves to pay for teacher salary increases.

Local ER doctors are even coming out to convince them to return. The teachers union is constantly coming up with their own ""facts"" and criteria that are very different and constantly changing from what the public health officer, doctors, the CDC, and Dr. Fauci have said.

Our teachers have said they don't intend to come back to the class in Sept 2021 even after they have been vaccinated.

In a bizarre twist, teachers have not been in contact with students for over 10 months, but some tested positive, and contact tracing shows they got it outside their work environment."
2021-01-28 08:57:51,"The article cites a Wisconsin study of 17 rural schools. Schools are not required to report Covid cases in Wisconsin. In my area the rural schools don’t report cases to the community. Counties have given up tracing cases because it was too overwhelming to keep up. The Milwaukee Journal started a database of schools with cases with community members doing the reporting because the schools and press aren’t. My local press website only reports cases on days when they can say the number is ""lower"" than a previous day. People don’t wear masks in the community. I really doubt the researchers were in these schools at all, and are relying on self-report data where there is no reporting going on. This will get worse because the state assembly just struck down the mask mandate today."
2021-01-28 11:05:16,"Teachers are not different from parents to so many students who are especially from underprivileged background yet strive to have better and meaningful future.

It is so long overdue - let's do scrap blind and winner-takes-all capitalism and be human again."
2021-01-28 09:39:53,"Last fall when transmission rates were miniscule in many areas and retrospectively including where its indisputable that children should have been in school in Sept, the teachers unions went on an information war against all of the mounting evidence that children were at minimal risk from Covid and shamelessly promoted a patently false narrative about how opening schools was akin to marching children off to death camps coffins in hand for dramatic effect. 
This was a costly error.  There has been no accounting for this or the many other severe errors of judgement over the last year.  And here they are doing a version of that again.  Fear mongering rather than considering real data.  
It cannot be said that US public schools have done well through this crisis. Not compared to public schools all over the world.  Not compared to private schools in the same communities.  A dollar to dollar analysis of either shows that US public schools performed far worse than either.  
And through this the teachers unions are simply unwilling to hear the criticism of the people they serve.  The students are falling behind and near suicidal.  Families are telling teachers they are desperate to get their kids into private schools.  My own family literally left the country to send our kids to school.  
It’s not impossible to run a school better than US public schools have over the last year.  Really. Its not disrespect it’s the hard to hear truth."

They are at the very front of the line to get a vaccine. Yet, they are the ONLY group of essential workers with vaccine priority that believe that they shouldnt have to actually do their jobs. Ive never stopped working because if I did stop working then Id stop making money. Id starve. But teachers get paid to sit at home and teach remote. Meanwhile, poor and POC kids are failing with remote and will be permanently damaged if they cant get back in school. Rich kids will continue to excel because their parents can pay for anything they need. If we want to help socioeconomic and racial equity, we need in person education.

I get frustrated every time I hear how safe schools are because it gives the false impression that they are safe. We had 5 teachers out in my department alone, I was forced to cover their classes and I have lunch duty every other day in a crowded lunch room. About 20% are wearing mask. I know it's only a matter of time until I catch COVID I just hope I get the vaccine in time. It makes no sense to me why schools shouldn't go online until teachers are vaccinated."

Schools are at the forefront of risk. Forget getting the kids back to school and get the vaccine produced and distributed, then everything can open without fear. And why, after nearly a year, can't we get N95 masks? This is insane! The United States is the worst in the world dealing with Covid. Remember when they told us that they were manufacturing the vaccines before approval so they would be ready to rollout? Where are they? My deep condolences to the Ortiz family for this tragic, and totally unnecessary, loss! This is the fault of an uncaring government whose concern has been to get the kids back to school in order to get the parents back to work, in order to get the economy moving.

Then came online learning. She is thriving and not needing therapy. And one boy announced to his mother that he never wanted to go back to school. School is an extroverted place and introverts are at a real disadvantage. So getting kids back to in person teaching is a mixed bag, good for some kids, not good for others. And as an introvert I can relate. In the first grade I just left at lunch and walked home, which caused a panic. But I hated school. It was pure torture. I wasn't bullied, just quiet and shy. And some kids are bullied. School is hell for them. So getting kids back is not always what is best for them. For some online learning is a better choice."

2021-01-25 21:46:35,"It is appropriate to be investigating whether the new mutant viruses might be able to evade the vaccines we currently have. I would be cautious about interpreting the results of preliminary lab studies based on neutralizing antibodies, because we don't know how much of a role they play in actual protection, relative to other facets of the total immune response. I agree that we should be taking a different regulatory approach to approving different versions of the same vaccine, to account for known mutations that might be problematic. If the virus mutates more quickly than was hoped, then we really need to be concerned about mutants escaping the protective immune response. We'll never keep up. It's part of the reason we never got an effective AIDS vaccine after 30 years of effort."
2021-01-25 21:48:22,"Before a virus mutation it can take as much as 7 years, until then we can only talk about variant and the vaccine will always be effective.

Variant is the normal life of any virus, it's the same for seasonal flu so the vaccine composition is reviewed each year and updated, the previous season’s vaccine protects against those viruses, more or less without updates but quite well with updates

But it's the same vaccine, variant is not a mutation."

Obviously we want to get as much of the population vaccinated as quickly as possible to cut down on new infections and death, but in the long game, we are also trying to outrun the virus's ability to keep adapting and mutating to keep itself viable. Hopefully vaccinations will greatly speed up and we can get ahead instead of trying to catch up from behind all this time. Stay well."
2021-01-25 22:01:12,"We should keep in mind that even if the two vaccines currently in use may have less efficacy, it's likely their protection level is still very high -- in the range upwards of 70%. 

Remember that when talk of potential vaccines first surfaced, scientists expressed the hope that potential new medicines would be at least 50% effective. That both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are above 90% -- initially thought to be unheard of -- should provide a continuing sense of security for those eager to receive inoculations."
2021-01-25 22:12:49,"I received the first Moderna vaccine legitimately, and I was thrilled to think that after one more shot, I would be protected from the virus by 94%-95% for 2021. But now that the variant from South Africa may create the need for a third shot at some point, while this is very disappointing, I'm just going to hope for the best. I am beginning to understand the complexity of this vicious virus."
2021-01-25 22:47:40,"Let’s be clear: viruses are not ‘stealthy,’ any more than a pair of dice is. By failing to nip the spread of the virus early on through testing, social distancing, masks, isolation of those who are positive for the virus and similar measures, we’ve given the virus tens of millions of human hosts in which to replicate. 

The virus has had and will continue to have billions of opportunities to roll the dice; with the potential for mutation on every roll. Some mutations may result in enhanced reproductive success for the virus, either in terms of its ability to replicate, or to infect new hosts, or both. 

Those mutations will be favored and are likely to become an increasing proportion of overall covid-19 virus population.

Those who refuse to acknowledge the reality of natural selection and the evolution of species take note: we’re watching the process in action right before our very eyes, with head-spinning speed, in real time. 

That’s how viruses roll."

I was halfway through this article before I saw the word ""evolved"" appear to describe the changing populations of virus around the world. Evolution is the fundamental process at issue here, so use of the word should not be buried below the first five paragraphs. Is it out of fear of a Creationist public that NYT reporters dance around mention of evolution, using instead ""assume new forms"" and ""change"" as evasive substitutes? Science has the words to describe what happens when a mutation increases in frequency in a population: the population is evolving. Use the right words for the job."

2021-01-25 22:17:06,"If you think that the virus is getting stealthier, you ain't seen nothing yet.

These mutations are largely affecting the spike protein because that's the point at which the virus makes contact with the target cells.  A stronger connection means that the virus will be more infective.  That gives the variants a selective advantage so they become the dominant viral form.

The immune system targets those same spike proteins.  By random chance, mutations which improve the ability of those proteins to bind to the target cells can also make it harder for the immune system to recognize.

When the vaccine is widespread, the ability of the virus to escape the immune system will become the primary driver of viral evolutions.  This is why we need a different vaccine for influenza every year.

God help us if SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to quickly make vaccines obsolete."
2021-01-25 22:44:19,The best strategy for the virus would be to mutate so as become harmless to its hosts.  It could then happily reproduce and spread and no human would necessarily be the wiser.  Let us hope that a future mutation takes the virus down this path and does so quickly.
2021-01-25 22:50:11,"Unless a variant can completely escape the current vaccines, getting inoculated should be priority. Most likely, a variant renders a vaccine less effective, but mass inoculation still substantially slows down infections, allowing time to update vaccines. This is how nature and medicine work. We have been living with annual flu shots for a long time."
2021-01-25 22:31:22,If we need a booster shot so be it. What is amazing is the people who think you are violating their rights by asking them to wear a mask. I wonder how do these people react when they get sick and need to be hospitalized. Do they refuse medical attention?

Creating vaccines against viruses is extremely difficult, as confirmed by the fact that after nearly 40 years we still do not have one against HIV.  Having received my first dose, I feel more at ease then I did before taking it and once I get my second dose, I'll be that much more at ease.  Still, world plagues are not so easily defeated, I fear.  My hope is that the world will be able to stave off additional mass loss of life from COVID through these vaccines, but in my heart of hearts I worry that this plague will not be as easily vanquished as we all hope it will be.  How glad I will be if proven wrong!"

Unfortunately, Philadelphia is restricting it to people over 75, with people 65-74 reportedly not eligible for several more months -- if they can find a place to get it then.  Looks like the immunized herd won't hit here for a long, long time."
2021-01-25 23:03:11,"The E484K variant represents a charge reversal within an important antibody recognition domain.  That readily explains why protection by the existing vaccine is reduced.  In layman's terms, the virus has added a repulsive force where the current antibodies ""expect"" the opposite.

I am wondering, however, whether a booster shot may be enough or whether a full course or vaccination is required.  Any high affinity antibody for that altered recognition sequence is unlikely to have been selected during immunization with the original vaccine.

I am concerned that we are going to enter a cycle of whack-a-mole as we will continue to chase new viral variants that escape the previous vaccines with mutations similar to this one. 

We may eventually need a mitigated viral vaccine or live through a natural infection to acquire a robust baseline immunity that will protect us from serious disease, while not necessarily preventing us from getting sick in the first place."
2021-01-25 23:08:13,"Mutation of the virus is not a new phenomenon. Formation of the variants aren't going to end. Today, both conventional 
DNA based as well as m-RNA based vaccine manufacturers are familiar with the original Sars-Covid-2 virus (China) and the variant of B.1.1.7 . Now the variant detected in South Africa has posed a new challenge to the m-RNA based vaccine manufacturers to alter their vaccine to enhance the efficacy .
The missing link in the article is the name of the new variant of the Sars-Covid-2 virus in south Africa and its comparative study with original Sars-Covid-2 virus and the B.1.1.7.

Since the phenotypic impact of any variant depends on the two factors, the expression of  its genetic code (genotype) and the influence of the environmental factor, the formation of variant becomes a continuous process for few a period of  few more months and  gets seized partly with the vaccines and ceased substantially by the ongoing its own natural way  herd immunity.
Did  South Africa confirm the new variant is  501.V2 and more virulent than other variants?"
2021-01-25 23:14:20,"Unfortunately, this is likely just the top of the iceberg. We continue to decimate natural environments. We stress out animal species which have evolved to effectively fight off pathogens they have successfully evolved with. This weakens their immune systems. When we harvest these sick, weakened animals we catch viruses our immune systems are naive to and poor at responding appropriately to. So, we'd either better at preserving out planet, or hope we get really good at reactively chasing our tails and developing and administering new vaccine after vaccine."

With the mRNA platform, used by both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, a vaccine can be updated to take into account new variants, if this becomes necessary. And done in a matter of weeks, it seems. The main thing is for everyone who can to get vaccinated."
2021-01-25 23:36:15,"I get my second Moderna shot in early February, and I'm happy to see that Moderna is already working on a booster for a variant.

However, I'm disappointed in Cuomo and de Blasio, who said at press conferences today that second shots, including mine, will proceed as scheduled, instead of giving more people a first shot. I'm also disappointed that not a single journalist pushed back at this.

Cuomo said that delay in second shots could lead to a ""nightmare scenario"", and de Blasio said, without explaining why, that he ""can't"" delay second shots.

A few days ago, the CDC specifically said that second shots can be delayed up to two weeks. The New England Journal of Medicine says ""there is no biological reason why receiving the second dose late would diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine, provided it’s received before too long an interval”.

The U.K. is vaccinating people at a much higher rate than the U.S. in part because it has decided to give second shots later. While there is debate about whether the U.K. delay is too long, even the critics say that the CDC delay would be acceptable.

Meanwhile, Cuomo and de Blasio say that NY State will get 250K doses this week, 107K for NY City. They both said that they have no idea how many doses NY will get next week.

They had so little of substance to say that Cuomo talked about the Buffalo Bills, and de Blasio devoted part of his press conference to NY Restaurant Week, now NY Restaurant To Go Week. There's leadership for you :)"

Or some combination of all three.
 
Today I visited the ocean where I live at Daytona Beach.  Being a weekday, the beach was not crowded.  Looking as far as one could see up and down the beach (maybe a mile altogether as it was slightly misty out) I guessed there were perhaps 2,000 people in varying group assortments.  Of all the people who were close enough for me to see, not a single one was wearing a mask.

While many would assume that being at an uncrowded beach on a breezy day constitutes acceptable risk, no assumption is necessary to conclude that not one of these people believes they're ever going to get Covid.

I would even venture to state that not one of the over 400,000 Americans who now will never make it to a beach really thought they would ever get Covid - except for those brave and overworked health professionals and caregivers who were afraid they might get it, yet continued to help others while hoping on hopes they would not get it.

My point?  Wear a mask - even two masks! - whenever you are around people. Keep your distance from them.  And when you come home, wash your hands right away. 

Of the 2,000 people I guessed were at the beach today, statistics show that 200 of them are carrying the virus, with or without symptoms, and that 2 of them will die."

The article stipulates 100 million worldwide infections, but it could easily be five times that or more. We are perhaps (?) studying these more recent viral mutations due to the existence of a pandemic, making us perhaps (?) more likely to pick up mutations.

I have received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine and am hoping supplies hold for me to get my second. Nothing will surprise me. I will not run out into crowds when I get the second dose (or two weeks after as greater immunity kicks in). I hope I can see my children and grandchildren by Thanksgiving--or sooner if we all get lucky.

I do wonder about how much longer this pandemic might last? The vaccines will help, but even the 1918 pandemic (no vaccine then) lasted about two years--with a few outbreaks occurring after that--as the virus ran wild. So I hope that by the end of this year the pandemic might start to wind down on its own, helping the vaccines along.

""Covid-19: Germany on the trail of treatment

Research on treatments for Covid-19 continues. Germany has just ordered 400 million euros worth of treatment

The doctor and journalist, Damien Mascret, is present on the 8 p.m. set, Sunday January 24 to clarify this point.
France 2

The track of a treatment against Covid-19 is advancing, Germany has just ordered for 400 million euros of the experimental treatment received by Donald Trump. ""This is a serious lead, explains doctor Damien Mascret on the 8 pm set, Sunday January 24th. When you are attacked by a virus you have to quickly produce antibodies"". The antibodies will attack the surface of the virus, ""they will neutralize the virus (...) and signal them to your body to destroy it.""

The results are promising, but we have to wait for the results of clinical trials. ""In mid-December, French scientists demanded the availability of these molecules"", explains the doctor. The English variant of Covid is progressing in France, ""up to 8% virus in some regions, that means it will go very quickly, decisions must be taken quickly,"" he adds.

The question is, how long will we keep hiding under a rock, hoping a miracle shot will make this go away?  I know my comment won't be popular, as millions of people - really the entire world - are holding their breath, hoping that after they get the shot, life will go back to normal. 

I don't know what normal is anymore, but we have been waiting for influenza to go away since 1918, and we still live with tens of thousands influenzas deaths every year, despite annual re-design and distribution of the flu vaccine."
2021-01-26 03:55:15,"You forgot about the new California mutation. If i remember correctly this mutation may make the current lot of vaccines ineffective.  THIS is the mutation, everyone, including the press should be concerned and focused on, but not much is being reported on it.  Just wait 1-2 months from now we will discover that these vaccines aren't good any more because of this variant and we'll have to wait yet another year for another vaccine ot come out."
2021-01-26 04:32:12,"This is a big part of the reason why the United States should be considering a global vaccination strategy as it starts to complete its own vaccination program. Should we allow the virus to continue to rage unchecked elsewhere, the rest of the world will remain a petri dish for mutations to continue to reinfect populations vaccinated against an outdated variant. Eventually the sickness will peter out, but it will take much longer if we allow the virus to propagate a full spectrum of adaptations against our immune systems. Herd immunity won't be a single number to reach, but a whole slew of partial immunities to a lot of different variations."
2021-01-26 04:54:58,Any reason the technology being used by Moderna and Pfizer can't be licensed to Merck?  We need more doses.  Can we take advantage of unused capacity as was done in WWII when different companies made the same planes and aircraft engines?
2021-01-26 03:11:35,"It appears that if you allow a virus run wild, with the larger number of instances you open yourself up to more potential for mutations while waiting on vaccines. I hadn't thought of that.

And it makes me wonder if this is the kind of thing that also never occcurred to all the sycophant hobbyists who sidled up to Trump, plying him with variations of ""just let it run its course"". What did Scott Atlas think of the potential of mutations when he counseled him to just let the disease go with younger people?"
2021-01-26 03:12:55,One thing DHS/USCIS needs to consider is dropping the requirement that US permanent residents be physically present in the USA to renew reentry permits.  At least during the pandemic.
2021-01-26 04:22:08,"Why isn’t international travel banned, including to/from countries like India?  
There will be more mutations. Why isn’t this taken more seriously?"
2021-01-26 04:29:53,"This virus will mutate to escape the immune response induced by vaccination or prior infection. This is inevitable. No one can predict where this new variant will arise, but we can confidently predict that it will spread rapidly worldwide and cause more misery and death. Why is that so? Because reckless people are still flying around on international holidays right now, and they will continue to do so, regardless of how much death they cause.

Ban all recreational non essential international travel right now. Ban it worldwide and keep it banned for as long as it takes to vaccinate every nation to reach herd immunity. Add strong restrictions on travel within a nation as well, for good measure. Do it now. Or wait and do nothing. Wait helplessly for the new strain and death it will bring. 

When we are dying miserable lonely deaths, we can console ourselves by reminding ourselves that we did this to ourselves. We could have stopped it, but we chose not to. We decided that tourist dollars were more important than our lives. Money will do us a lot of good when we are dead."
2021-01-26 02:37:16,"What can we do to ensure that indigenous peoples have adequate access to the vaccine as the virus continues to mutate? I would like to know how I can help. My grandmother spent her college summers with the Apache in Arizona, and she would absolutely be up in arms over the potential loss of culture and language among the Apache and all the native peoples. It is imperative that we get enough vaccines to the reservations and tribal lands. 

Last night, CNN featured a virus segment with a Muscogee leader, and today we have The Times editorial on the virus’ havoc among the Lakota. Both discuss COVID’s potential for wiping out the language and knowledge of tribal customs, and I would love to see this information more widespread and prominent. These cultures and languages must be protected. 

Our government has done enough damage to indigenous peoples throughout our history. Now, with every new variant of the virus, Native Americans become more vulnerable. 

Please, President Biden and members of Congress, do what’s right and prioritize vaccines for the native population."

My vaccination on Jan 12 was chaotic, the NYS website down most of the time.  All had to be done, again, with  pencil and paper

Cuomo had months to set this  up - and failed

Cuomo's  priority seems to play a leader on TV  - not to getting vaccines to his people"
2021-01-26 05:59:24,"There is so much we have yet to learn.  Why are we so stingy with the research dollar?  We pay businesspersons who are unable to stay open.  We pay workers who can't return to their jobs.  We pay farmers to grow crops that no one will buy.  

Why can't we fund more research?"
2021-01-26 07:33:03,"""Vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech effectively protect recipients. But in a worrying sign, they are slightly less effective against a variant found in South Africa.""

The subtext of ""slightly less effective"" is misleading if vaccine makers are saying current vaccines are not effective enough to protect against this variant.  Will they have to define a booster for each variant?"
2021-01-26 07:47:00,"One of the bad variants is named the ""Brazil""  variant. Now we find there is a confirmed case of this variant in Minnesota.
Lo and behold, he recently traveled to Brazil. Is our whole public health system bonkers? Why exactly are we allowing travel from other continents to the US?  Is it in order to spread the more infectious variants? C'mon lets all use Zoom for business and classes and weddings and funerals. Just for another 4 months and then back to normal travel. C'mon folks, hundreds of thousands of lives at risk here."
2021-01-26 08:04:16,"And why exactly has no one studied whether those already infected need a vaccination now, and if there is a certain titer of anti-spike antibody that marks such people unlikely to get infected before summer and very able to thrive while going to the back of the vaccine line?"
2021-01-26 09:14:16,"This is why we needed to lock down earlier and enforce everyone to wear masks earlier. It seems like the more infected people there are, the higher the probability of mutations occurring. I’m no scientist but it seems like mutations occur within the host body or perhaps during transmission. If we didn’t have so many cases perhaps the virus would have mutated more slowly. I was feeling hopeful this year about getting the vaccine but who knows if it will be ineffective by the time it’s my turn."
2021-01-26 10:16:50,"And although I have lived a life of isolation, and goto the grocery store no more than ten day intervals, the only place I go, have not seen my kids or grandkids for months, and months, and months, nor anyone else, our Wisconsin legislators still for press anti mask wearers.  

This is going to be life, isn’t it?  And people who care more about going bare faced than saving their elderly or any American neighbors?  

What about my rights?"
2021-01-26 10:19:08,"Disturbing. This is why we need, in addition to free and easy testing as is currently available in NYC robust testing of the positive samples so that we could have a better idea of how many, and how quickly the mutated viruses are spreading. At present, only a minuscule portion of the positive tests are studied in the way.  The spread of the variants could be far more widespread than we realize."
2021-01-26 10:55:53,"Efficacy is a generic term and without context does not mean much. The vaccine trials defined efficacy as absence of serious disease or death. These trials curiously did not mention the risk of infection. To put it another way, 95 percent of those inoculated did not get serous disease or die. It would be nice to know if this applies to infection too."
2021-01-26 12:37:28,Has anyone considered mixing vaccines in the two shot protocol to assess whether that provides more protection?  Is there potential that Pfizer followed by Moderna (or vice versa) might be better than two doses of the same vaccine?  Just asking.
2021-01-26 13:30:29,"It's not only survival of the fittest, it is survival of the most patient.  For those of us who are able to isolate of course.  I am deeply aware of all the people who work so hard to keep our economy going.  Bless them.  And this is why the more people who are vaccinated quickly, the less chance the virus will have to mutate."
2021-01-26 13:58:57,What these mutations illustrate is the importance of vaccinating people throughout the world and not just in wealthy countries. Countries producing effective vaccines must make sure that other countries have access to it and receive financial assistance to set up the logistics necessary for vaccinating most of their population. If poor countries are neglected flare ups of this epidemic in future years are inevitable.
2021-01-26 14:23:07,Had Covid last March and planning on vaccine shots.  I wonder if the combination of antibodies will produce a more potent response to the new variants for me and anyone in this situation.

I am getting anxiety just reading this article."
2021-01-26 09:50:26,"This battle is in for a long haul - virus vs human. CDC and the Government needs to say it and admit it. Masks, 6 feet separation etc will be a norm for humans. What virus will climate change bring is anyone's guess."
2021-01-26 09:54:31,"The nature of viruses is to mutate. COVID19 has learned to mutate faster. It is inevitable that COVID20, at best, is a few years away. This is a war, and just like every country is trying to stay steps ahead of its enemy in destructive power, COVID19 is preparing to defeat vaccines we throw at it. It looks like it is winning. It looks like the virus will remain with us and will never fully go away, and we will have to adjust to it as we have adjusted to the flu. 

Effective vaccines are essential, but equally essential, we need to change our eating habits. We have to eat far more healthy. And fortify our bodies with a daily dose of vitamins B-Complex, C, and D. We need to add probiotics and turmeric. Indian pickles are a very high source of probiotics. Our VP Harris is an avid cook. She must make turmeric and Indian pickles an essential household name. 

We must take advantage of the fact that in Pakistan those who drink bottled water are having more problems with the virus than the ones who drink polluted water. Polluted water builds up and strengthens the antibodies and makes the body stronger against the virus. It means our scientists must develop a super vaccine that triggers the development of super antibodies and strengthens the immune system.

There is a debate about if herd immunity is a good option. I think we should shield the old and sick and use the herd immunity for the young and healthy. The economy can's be allowed to grind to a halt. We need to keep it moving."
2021-01-26 10:25:52,"Unfortunately we will suffer through a mediocre response with the vaccine. Biden set a goal of 100 million in 100 days, anything less  with the  resources and money available would be an incompetent response .""Come on man"". Hopefully he will disprove the perception that he is too old, and a typical incompetent government bureaucrat. But we should be use to disappointment 
 and mismanagement, it is too bad lives are depending on them. Can't depend on the government, Get the people vaccinated!"
2021-01-26 05:54:29,"I predict we’ll all need to get booster shots every year just like we need a new flu vaccine every year. Sadly, we’ll never truly wipe out Covid-19. We just need to keep ahead of it."
2021-01-26 10:50:59,"This must be allowed to make its way through the population to an eventual herd immunity. 

We cannot control a virus anymore than we can control the movement of the planets. Open the economy up and let the chips fall where they may. This is futile."
2021-01-26 12:20:31,"My background is not in the sciences, yet I cannot help thinking that anyone with half a brain has some understanding of how viruses sspread - and mute. Additionally, the math is straightforward: the more the infections, the greater the risk for more deadly mutations to arise. And not eveything can be laid at Trump's feet. That our supposedly stellar CDC has not had a vigorous program of testing for mutations as has had Great Britian all along and must now ramp up at the 25th hour is yet one more, major disgrace for the USA. Tragically, it well might be our most deadly mistake yet."
2021-01-26 12:26:52,"I have a question!
Long time ago - we said that coronavirus cases may be 10 times higher than reported. If this is STILL true then we have 250M sick people. Please tell me that this is not true anymore. With all the masks and the social distancing do we control the spread?"
2021-01-26 13:42:49,"Banning flights from South Africa is not likely to prevent the US in the long run as the virus has clearly shown that it mutates with some frequency, so eventually the virus here in the US will mutate also. The point here is that this is looking like the game of Whack-a-Mole we play with the flu which also mutates rapidly. 

I have no idea how this is going to play out but I am not getting a good feeling that even if we get most people in the US vaccinated that our problems with the coronavirus are over."
2021-01-26 11:20:16,"The vaccine stimulates our human immune system to react and respond, hopefully in a timely fashion, to enable target types, levels and qualities of sustainable wellbeing. Health. And associated experienced existential security and safety.
There is no biological vaccine to nurture a societal “ immune” system for those family members, friends, neighbors, etc., who have chosen the processes of rejecting facts, and truths, notwithstanding their inherent flaws.

2021-01-26 06:28:41,It’s unfortunate that we can’t just spray the vaccine.
2021-01-26 10:20:25,"The facts described in this article are frightening; the metaphorical headline even more so.  The virus is described as growing stealthier, implying observation and intent on the part of what the Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as ""nonliving extremely complex molecules, that typically contain a protein coat surrounding an RNA or DNA core of genetic material but no semipermeable membrane, that are capable of growth and multiplication only in living cells.""  These ""nonliving molecules"" are evolving, but they are doing so in the way that all evolution occurs.  They are not ""stealthy,"" which (again according to Merriam-Webster) means  ""slow, deliberate, and secret in action or character; intended to escape observation.""  They are incapable of deliberation or intent.  They are not drawing up battle plans to fight the human race, even if that's the way it seems to us.  It does not help our collective mood to suggest otherwise.  I feel that your reporters should avoid exacerbating our fear by personalizing the virus, even if it makes for a snappy headline.  The New York Times perhaps more than anyone knows that style matters."
2021-01-26 11:01:34,"COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is merely RNA  being evolutionary fit fruitful and multiplying according to it's nature.

COVID-19 currently knows far more about how to infect and exploit the DNA host cells of African primate apes aka people aka humans than we know about how to deter, detect, defeat and diminish it.

But COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign. COVID-19 has no partisan economic nor political agenda.  COVID-19 has no color aka race nor ethnic nor national origin sectarian plan.

COVID-19 has exposed existing health medical inequalities that fall along existing individual and institutional chasms."
2021-01-26 12:19:13,"COVID is like FLU on speed in term of viral reprogramming. Reprogramming is the nature of viruses to survive and proliferate.

2021-01-26 14:41:46,"I was enormously impressed with the scientists who participated in the ""Red Dawn"" emails replicated by the Times at the beginning of the outbreak. <a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.amp.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.amp.html</a>
That was great reporting. 

At the time, I wondered why these caring experts were not recruited to direct our response instead of helplessly watching the virus explode from the sidelines.  They knew their stuff.  Further, as recently reported by Reuters, one of the participants, Dr. Lawler, begged the flatfooted CDC to test for asymptomatic carriers.  They ignored him. <a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29R1"" target=""_blank"">https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29R1</a>

Why isn't Dr. Lawler at the forefront of running things? There has been no discussion about how or why the clearly best at this are in the wings, fighting to get things done. Instead, it is all Fauci, who has made more than one miscalculation.  Nothing lately seems to work.  May we have more reporting on why the scientists who clearly shoukd be in charbe aren't?"
2021-01-26 09:31:17,"Welcome to the world of modern biology, NY Times reporters. You are, as usual, taking the words of scientists and vaccine manufacturers, out of context. All the ""it may be"" this or, it may be that something else, or ""the virus  may be able to hide from human antibodies"" is interesting speculation, it really amounts to arguing about who set the fire as the forest or city burns down-it ain't not helping much putting out the flames. 
There is time and place for everything and , while I know newspapers and media companies do not report trains & planes that arrive safely-without dramatic & deadly crashes:
 as we're All on this particular world plane-all possible victims to the same virus-I think newspaper readers and buyers will be pleased to read ""happy news"" concerning their own fate.
Speculation may be a profitable niche for  media reporters, but I pay to read my bad news-predicting doom & gloom without letup, -to be on the inside pages in small type.
That way I can at least feel better till I die , knowing you are not stirring the pot of bootless panic. Better you should count the number of communists in the state department- it would do wonders for my outlook ."
2021-01-26 03:40:19,"Variants are one of many reasons we should be glad Trump is out of office. An important perspective each of us needs to have is that every one of us who gets infected serve as an evolutionary laboratory for the virus. 

With that in mind, it's going to be critically important to make sure the whole world is vaccinated, not just stopping when we've rolled this out to all Americans. You know, stuff the World Health Organization does. It would be incredibly foolish to leave a few billion people to their own devices and think it wouldn't come back to bite us with a variant that's resistant to our current vaccines.

Trump would easily have stopped vaccinating at America's borders, in addition to defunding the international bodies (like the WHO) that could have stepped into that void. Worse than that, even, as he would likely have not been terribly helpful in vaccinating a lot of communities in the US. And, of course, those are lofty considerations when one considers that his incompetence would have left it so that it would take years to vaccinate every American, anyway.

Point being:  Biden gets that America has an important global leadership role. And I hope Biden does consider ways that America can help vaccinate the world once we've got ourselves in a strong position. It would earn back for us all kinds of goodwill and moral authority that we've lost under Bush and Trump, in addition to saving ourselves from the dangers of leaving other countries to fend for themselves."
2021-01-26 04:55:40,"President Biden cannot perform miracles in the few days he's been in office.    We all know COVID-19 was mishandled horribly by the previous administration.    They sat on their hands ignoring the horrific way it spread.   Now what.   Why can't those who qualify for the vaccine ASAP receive it?   
It's unconscionable that we are sending taxpayers money to other countries while we desperately need help here.   Every day we learn about a new strain coming here.   How many more deaths before the Pandemic(s) are under control.   I've been in self-isolation almost 11 months.   I want to see my family and friends very much.   I more than qualify for the vaccine, but it's no where in sight in my area.    What a sad life."
2021-01-26 07:59:08,"We are in a race folks.

The new rules of the road are becoming clearer.

More new cases, more mutations. More mutations, more chances for variants that are more contagious and more lethal.

The experts have it right, contain the number of cases by vaccinating as quickly as possible while at the same time...

developing vaccine ""boosters"" to counter the new virus variants.

It is a race and we can help by: getting vaccinated, wearing masks, socially distancing and avoiding crowds, all while washing our hands.

If we lose the race...much more sickness and death and no return to ""normal"".

If we win, I predict masks become de rigeur along with yearly COVID/flu shots. 
But is is still largely our call to cooperate or not. I suggest we cooperate, internationally as well."
2021-01-25 22:13:22,"I will be continuing to social distance, mask up, etc. even after receiving my vaccine for this exact reason.

The fact is,  Trump has poisoned the well and made public health a political issue. It is likely to be one of his most enduring and destructive legacies. So it is likely that tens of millions of people will forgo the vaccine and all social distancing / mask recommendations  to support our fallen former President in some misguided show of loyalty or twisted sense of patriotism. 

We're only as strong as out weakest link, and it turns out our weakest link is pretty easily manipulated into working against the common good of this nation. 

I had been holding out hope we would see some form of return to normal over the Summer but I'm rapidly recalibrating my expectations based on the new variants and  the complete apathy of my fellow countrymen. 

Truly an appalling display of lack of collective identify and accountability for (allegedly) the most powerful nation on Earth."
2021-01-25 23:37:33,"If we weren’t all terrified, we’d be celebrating. The fact that we have an effective vaccine in under 12 months and now can reprogram it every six weeks is a  blinkin’ miracle. 

Yes, I’m scared. Yes, it’s tragic. Yes, we are collectively dunderheads for refusing to wear masks, even for a nanosecond. 

But I’m equal parts elated. What a magnificent moment for medicine. A great leap forward indeed."
2021-01-26 17:54:27,"Yesterday, both Cuomo and de Blasio said categorically that vaccine set aside for second shots will not be used to get first shots to more people. Cuomo said that this could lead to a ""nightmare scenario"".

This morning, less than 24 hours later, de Blasio did a 180 degree turn on this question. He is now invoking last week's CDC statement that second doses can be delayed for up to two weeks for the Moderna vaccine, and up to three for the Pfizer vaccine.

He offered no explanation for a change in policy less than 24 hours from yesterday's press conference.

No word on Cuomo's position."

2021-01-25 18:53:33,What a great idea for the people to enjoy a wonderful building and get their vaccination. I remember wandering into the the cathedral twenty years ago around 4PM in the afternoon just as Vespers was beginning. The choir sang and I sat there mesmerized by the sound and space.
2021-01-25 19:29:22,"My husband and I have been to the cathedral in Salisbury a few times and we are NEVER disappointed nor take its grandeur for granted.  Organ music was meant to be played, shared and enjoyed in a place like Salisbury where the music is allowed to resonate with such an immense vivacity of sound which is always arresting, exciting and alive.

I cannot help but share Margaret Drabble's feelings about loving organ music because it IS so beautiful.  I too almost cry every time I hear it played, especially in a place like Salisbury.

I can think of no better nor finer place to sit and wait to receive my vaccine ""jab"" than this magnificent cathedral.  Even if the organist simply played a few bars of the basic scale, I would be enthralled.

Thanks for a such a delightful article and wonderful photos.  Imagine an organist at Salisbury Cathedral taking requests . . . I kind of love this ""new norm"" in some ways."
2021-01-25 19:32:16,Stunning photos of the space by Mr. Jamieson.  A lovely framing of the subjects within the architecture of the cathedral.
2021-01-25 19:45:15,"There is no experience like that of hearing a pipe organ playing in a large space.  It's aural, visceral and visual.  While the people coming to the Salisbury Cathedral for their vaccines get to hear the beauty of organ music, I think it also does well for the instrument itself.  Organs don't like to go for extended spans of time without being played.  I'd call that win-win."
2021-01-25 19:59:12,"“The phrase ‘smooth classics’ was what came to mind,” Halls said. “We didn’t want anything too spiky or unpleasant or anything too fast.”

I think the advise by David Halls, the cathedral's music director is spot on. Some how I just can't picture hearing ""In the Mood"" being played - EVER - in the cathedral in Salisbury, England.

Somehow, I never tire of hearing anything by J.S. Bach, especially his beautiful piece, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring.”  Music played on the organ IS magical."
2021-01-25 20:13:56,"This is one of those ""muddling through"" highpoints where ordinary people doing something kind can produce a result that can far surpass just doing it ""by the book.""

More prosaically perhaps, when I took my (82yo) mother for her jab on New Year's Eve in the car park of a small hospital in a nearby ""county"" town, the local Fire Brigade were not only providing reassuring assistance to the elderly vaccine recipients, but had also fielded their amateur jazz band to accompany the proceedings, which was rather jolly. Not Salisbury Cathedral of course, but still..."

Salisbury Cathedral (with a bit of Winchester thrown in) was also part of the fictional setting for some of Anthony Trollope's novels like ""The Warden"" and ""Barchester Towers.""
You can also see it in a lot of paintings by Constable.  
It is one of the most lovely places on earth."
2021-01-26 00:29:42,"I have been fortunate enough to visit Salisbury twice.  On the second trip, my husband and I took my father who has since passed away.  We were touring locations this WWII vet had been stationed during the war.  As a side trip, I thought he would enjoy this magnificent building which had been under repair when my husband and I visited the first time.  We wandered around, and I showed him things I remembered, including the rods supporting the massive stone pillars.  After a while, my father, a devout lifelong Catholic, asked if this was now a Church of England church.  I told him I was sure it was.  He nodded at me, and then said “Well, you’ve seen one pagan church, you’ve seen them all” and started for the door.  I was flabbergasted, and asked did he not appreciate the beauty of this place?  He laughed, and assured me he was just joking, and agreed it was beautiful.  But never for a moment did I doubt that his first sentiment was what he really believed.  Anglican, pagan or otherwise, it certainly left an impression on me."

The Chapter House, these days being used to display the Magna Carta, has wonderful stained glass - though not as impressive as the smaller Trinity Chapel at the east end where the panels are meant to commemorate modern Prisoners of Conscience. Can’t think of a better place to spend some time waiting for a jab in the arm. Thanks for the story - and the pictures...."

I chuckled aloud when reading the paragraph about the organists receiving requests: George Thalben-Ball is not well known outside a small number of church musicians of a particular stripe, and Messiaen... 

Well, it’s hard to imagine an American church musician in a city the size of Salisbury getting such requests (or have the necessary skill to play them.)

Three cheers on all counts!"
2021-01-26 13:24:32,"This is an inspiring story. Cathedrals are intended to be multi-purpose. British composers have written some of the most beautiful sacred music, so this is a perfect example of coming together to fight the pandemic.

Early in the pandemic, a stonemason at the Washington National Cathedral found a supply of 5,000 face masks stored there, and they were then donated to local hospitals. The cathedral has switched to streaming services only. However, it has opened its vast space to several blood drives."
2021-01-26 13:35:41,"I had the first round of my vaccinations here on Saturday, and the whole process was so very relaxing, efficient, and safe. 

It seems the vaccination roll-out is the only thing that the UK government have managed to competently perform during this whole pandemic. I guess that is what happens when you entrust the National Health Service and Public Health England to do their jobs instead of outsourcing it to your school-friends, and businesspeople with a history of running private companies into the ground."

Salisbury Cathedral is a truly iconic symbol, only having shed decades of scaffolding in recent years so it can be seen in it's true glory once again. It's fitting that this symbol be the feature of a story that helps inspire readers across the US and beyond as we fight a common enemy, the pandemic."

2021-01-25 17:40:02,"This is all well and good, and it is really important to recruit local culture bearers to help with spreading vaccine information. From the beginning, New Orleans has been hit hard by COVID and people of color have been disproportionately hit the hardest. One of the struggles as well has been the effects COVID has had on travel and tourism, and in this regard it is important to call out our mayor. Mayor Cantrell has been encouraging out of town folks to come to New Orleans during the course of the pandemic and for the upcoming Mardi Gras, while punishing establishments that cater to locals. Bourbon Street has been filled while locals stay home and our favorite neighborhood bars, cafes, restaurants, shops, and other business have shuttered. I am all for responsible policies to limit capacity of businesses here in New Orleans and everywhere, but our mayor has not had our backs. The tourist bars on Bourbon Street are expendable but the bars in Black communities and the bars in our neighborhoods are not. There was another NY Times article recently about COVID and New Orleans bars and I think it is important that y’all hear a local voice to add some more nuance to the reporting."

Was this pure cynicism or just the historical-ignorance born of privilege?

Without a doubt, this ""ad"" was conceptualized and financed by ""well-meaning"", ""local"" (but not neccessarily NATIVE) white liberals that persistently objectify others' ethnicity and, here, all too often reduce Afro-New Orleanians to the ""entertainers"" that satisfy their need to consume the exotic.

The manufacturers will have expanded their production capacity to sufficient levels in the next couple of months, and our ability to complete the program of mass vaccination will be proceeding apace, well before any help from these unrelated companies could have any impact.

2021-01-26 18:05:29,Great news! More big companies need to step up. The faster WE get this virus behind US the better!
2021-01-26 18:10:44,Note that there was nary a peep from these companies when the Pfizer vaccine first received EUA but only after the Biden administration was in place.
2021-01-26 19:27:45,"I am glad to see Americans acting this way. 

Please tell Big Pharma to link arms with Moderna, Pfizer and J&J (soon) and offer up their facilities to produce more vaccine. 

If they don't, Pres. Biden can invoke the DPA and force the issue."
2021-01-26 20:38:10,It's all about people without which business cannot function.  Thank you.
2021-01-26 19:01:17,"About time! God knows, businessmen who know how to deploy people and goods and have a command of logistics and record keeping would be an enormous step above the likes of lazy politicos like Bill de Blasio. Even if we had millions of vaccine doses, he'd still be wringing his hands over who should get them first and crooning platitudes about the community. 

As it is, the vaccine centers that family, friends, and neighbors have gone to have been in Canarsie and East New York because there are none in Flatbush, Midwood, Windsor Terrace or Brooklyn Heights, nearer by far, to go to."
2021-01-26 18:25:21,The number one Global company in the distribution field is Amazon. In North America they have warehouses everywhere and deliver packages within twenty-fours. It is hard to understand why our leaders did not utilize this existing and ultra efficient delivery system to place vaccine in every state and province within days of receipt of the first delivery of the vaccine.
2021-01-26 21:01:37,"Yes, that is the way it should be with private industry playing a key role in solving the Covid19 crisis as it is to their advantage. I wish man more companies would take such a stance and help get our problem solved and get on with our economy. A billion dollars to a CEO does not good unless it is applied to our society problems and support those workers that created the profit.  djm"

2021-01-26 21:38:54,They should consider hiring out of work hospitality personnel and event planners. Their industry has been gutted and no one knows how to safely and efficiently move a lot of people and materiel through an event better than they do. We’d all be vaccinated with a cocktail in our hands if they’d been in charge from the get-go.
2021-01-26 21:49:47,"That's a little encouraging  providing the vaccines are available.   Of course then they have to work out the logistics.   A while ago I saw VP Harris get her second shot and very magnanimously recommended everyone get vaccinated.   Great suggestion, however, thousands who not only want, but are more than qualified to receive it can't find where to go. Also many do not have computers.   Remember lots of the elderly cannot stand in a line and wait hours.   They need a drive-through situation.   We know President Biden has the pandemic as his first priority.  He's only been in office a week but so many are terrified to  go out until they get vaccinated.   This is a challenge."
2021-01-26 22:11:31,Encouraging to see this...hope they are quickly put to work so more of our people can receive the vaccination sooner.
2021-01-26 22:17:21,This is good.  These large logisticall organized global corporations can do much to help and I am heartened to read about this.   Where we also need assistance on the front-lines is from those in the Health Policy area at large universities (safe at home but with a lot of expertise) to come out of their safe spaces and GIVE VACCINES.   We read so frequently in NYT Opinion pieces from these content-experts yet I do not read about the University public health people being on the front-lines where we need them now.
2021-01-26 22:20:55,"They pay their workers poverty wages. People are dying every day due to preventable poverty. It's ridiculous that they get any praise when they insist on continuing suffering and death-inducing exploitation.

2021-01-26 22:32:01,"Business people are always talking about how government should be and would be run better as a business. That isn't true across the board, but during war time and emergency situations private sector has stepped up - they have the resources and labor force. They should have stepped up long ago but better now than never. Governors of Washington state and other where Walmart, Starbucks, etc have a huge presence should have reached out to them. Who was that said don't let a crisis go to waste?"
2021-01-26 22:49:34,"All hands on deck! We can do this! With leadership and motivation. And yes the logistical capacities of huge networks of Amazon, Starbucks etc. Why not? War time like effort requires creativity and generosity. Need volunteers?"

2021-01-27 00:12:26,"Mayors, Governors, and other elected politicians don't operationalize or coordinate - they mandate and oversee.  American private enterprise has been the power plant of this country - let's see them all run this venture at full speed, please."
2021-01-27 00:45:17,"Here is a suggestion for Bezos/Amazon. Change your presentation of face masks. List CDC approved masks, they have a list, a long list but names not an easy way to buy.  List American Made as well in separate list. 

Help us out here Jeff you will still make a dollar.

You can still sell the other million styles."
2021-01-27 00:56:00,"Generally, I'm interested in seeing what, in tandem, these private sector champions can offer along with what each state's National Guard can provide. I suspect that together they can create an observable acceleration in the rollout of the vaccines we now have. I suggest the National Guard because logistics capabilities are the bedrock of the military.

It's always possible, of course, that supply will continue to be a major constraint until we have this pandemic behind us."
2021-01-26 23:15:06,"I’m 73, finally scheduled my shot in 2 weeks after weeks of exasperating attempts (and never use the dose will actually be there, fingers crossed). This is not the time to inquire into company motives. No one cares what their motives are. I will shop at any of these companies whenever I want to or can - just let them help, and forget what promotional motives they may have. When I go to Walgreens for my flu shot or my meds, I don’t care what their motive is. I just want my shot and my meds. Forget all this nit-picking. This is war."
2021-01-26 21:38:05,Why didn't these companies offer their services when Trump was president?
2021-01-27 00:50:10,Interesting that all 3 are Seattle area companies...
2021-01-27 01:07:41,"There are convention centers all over the US, the army core of engineers and local IATSE labor could facilitate these sites as vaccination centers.
We just need to hope that the Pharmaceutical Co's producing the vaccines can produce the quantities that are required. 
The economy will open up when we are all vaccinated.
In the mean time, Please: wear a mask, social distance and wash your hands. We are all in this together, Go Team Biden."

Less than a week in office and my wife and I today got our first Pfizer shots after only a single click of the mouse and two days later drive right up to a LA County facility in Downey with hardly any waiting and out after a 15 minute observation to make sure of no bad reactions.  I didn’t even feel the needle.  Thanks, Joe.  Ending systemic racism ought to be a comparative cinch now."
2021-01-26 22:12:15,"Not really a war time effort, is it? Vaccines are available nationwide, reportedly. No infrastructure to deliver them to people.

Sorry state of organized healthcare at this point."
2021-01-26 23:33:48,The govt should consult with the logistics experts at FedEx and UPS on supply chain optimization.
2021-01-27 01:32:29,"While it is encouraging to see mega-corporations step up in this way, there is an ominous aspect to the erosion of the ability of governments to act for the benefit of the people. Instead, the private sector insinuates itself into providing essential services that are normatively the government's purview. With governments the world over in the process of going bankrupt, expect these corporations to be welcome as our new saviours (as Pfizer et al. have already been). I suspect that the end-game of runaway capitalism will not be pretty."
2021-01-27 00:55:23,"I read where if we got Amazon drivers to d give vaccinations, everyone could be vaccinated by next Monday - even Saturday if they are Prime members"

2021-01-22 05:17:35,"Welcome back Dr Fauci.  Thanks for gutting out the relentless attacks on you and science.  Now sir, please put together a coherent policy so ALL of us can work out of this coronavirus mess."
2021-01-22 05:28:17,It's time for Dr. Fauci to partner constructively with the Biden administration and be part of the solution. This administration is capable of listening to science and reason. Blunt language is not the only thing required. Dr. Fauci needs to help the administration restore America to health.
2021-01-22 05:30:54,This is good!  It is refreshing seeing an administration actively seek to place good science at the forefront of health policies.  I hope Dr. Fauci is present at press briefings for a long time.

2021-01-22 05:13:47,"Dr. Fauci is a public health hero on the level of John Snow, Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk, Virginia Apgar, Frances Oldham Kelsey, Israel Weinstein, and William Foege. And if you don’t know all these names, it’s time to learn your public health history."
2021-01-22 05:18:07,"The New York Times has continually called the COVID-19 Pandemic the worst health crisis in the US in over a century. But over 700,000 Americans have died of AIDS since that epidemic started in the 70s. Of course the coronavirus is deadly and needs to be taken seriously, but this language totally discounts the lives lost, many from the most marginalized communities in our nation, to HIV/AIDS."

""The standard tests are diagnosing huge numbers of people who may be carrying relatively insignificant amounts of the virus.""

Dr. Fauci is on record saying that PCR tests using a cycle threshold (CT) of greater than 35 is essentially worthless. But most of the PCR Covid tests currently being performed use a CT of 35 for greater. 

But the WHO, just last week, recommended a lower CT threshold. 

This is ""Science?!"""

2021-01-22 05:32:34,"Thank you, Dr. Fauci for your honesty.  America needs the TRUTH more than ever. Your scientific  expertise and experience will be treasured by President Biden and his administration. So happy to see you on the team! It’s wonderful to have you back!"

2021-01-22 05:40:22,As a vigilant AIDS researcher in the 80s - 90s Dr. Fauci was/is a hero. Here he is in his 70s doing the Good Work again. A pity he was so disrespected by the previous administration. Not to mention the death threats. It was nice to see his smile today.

2021-01-22 05:42:09,"With every piece of news coming from the White House, I feel like I’ve awakened from a 4-year nightmare.
Oh, I’m sure it’s just a few weeks before I’m annoyed at one of our three branches for making a “bad” decision - “bad” meaning, of course, “I would have voted/ruled/acted a different way” - I’ve had those reactions since I became politically aware, quite early in life - and with 2-3 newspapers arriving each day and two politically aware parents - one a second-generation union organizer, government and politics became my major interest by 2nd Grade, and LBJ’s presidency.
Annoyance, and anger - at the slow pace of Civil Rights reform at home and Washington’s continued/escalating involvement in “banana republics”/ Viet Nam and our continued game of nuclear brinksmanship.
I knew the answer - activism within the system - realizing by my distant adulthood, us boomers would control the outcome of elections.
In suburban NYC, it was obvious the Dylan,etc.-influenced majority would rule by ballot and do well for the country.
The world changed when my fellow spoiled suburbanites sold out and decided “greed was good”, the radical right began the resurgence of the 1930s, and despite our best efforts, the majority loved wrong ending with the nightmare of “emperor” Trump that really only ended January 7.
I’ll still hope the Progressives will dominate, some day.
I’ll never get what I want, but, once again we’ll get what we need.
The king is dead, long live democracy!"
2021-01-22 05:56:11,"Dr. Fauci is the model of what service to the community means.  A long career of service over what would almost be guaranteed to be a more financially lucrative career at a huge medical or pharmaceutical conglomerate.  Is it any wonder that Trump couldn't understand his candor?  A great moral comparison of what one should aim to be, and what happens when one loses their their internal moral compass.

Dr. Fauci has been an American institution since the AIDS epidemic, a doctor who Americans can listen to and trust, respected by health professionals around the world.

Like Brad Pitt said, thank you, you are a hero."
2021-01-22 05:58:31,"This is a great development and a wonderful change from what we had under Trump. Thank God for Fauci and for Biden respecting science. 

Having said that... “somewhat of”?? You can do better, Dr. Fauci."
2021-01-22 05:58:31,"It was Bizarro world - where everything was backwards. I knew whatever it was - trump would do exactly the wrong thing, lie, and hire the worst person for the job. You could almost bet on it. So glad science has a seat at the table now. It’s critical."
2021-01-22 06:00:29,It was so nice to see him smile and laugh! You know how hard it must have been dealing with lies and misinformation for a man dedicated to science and ethical responsibility. What a relief for all of us!
2021-01-22 06:02:37,"I caught the last seven minutes or so of Dr. Fauci's prepared remarks (which seemed to be made extemporaneously).  It struck me as a clear and understandable presentation of at least several weeks' worth of material from a 300-level immunology course.  In other words, when he's allowed to do his thing, he's amazingly good.

Then he took questions. The first one was about something having to do with Amazon's involvement in the pandemic response.  Dr. Fauci replied, ""I can't really answer that. I'd be waiving my arms around. And one of the things about this administration is that if you don't know the answer, you don't guess.  You just say, 'I don't know the answer.""

It feels like a lungful of fresh air."
2021-01-22 05:57:12,"Fauci was disputing the Biden administration's claim that there was no distribution strategy as well. Hopefully Biden lets science speak, which also says you need to wear a mask at the Lincoln Memorial even if you're celebrating a historic event like inauguration."
2021-01-22 05:57:20,Thank God. Nobody defeats a natural phenomenon by force of will or trickery. Science and the humility it requires is the only way to understand what is and is not. Then people can use their imaginations and rational capabilities to find solutions. Trump’s efforts to wish away the pandemic was inane and allowed it to spread unimpeded and to mutate. We cannot product how soon better considered efforts will finally reduce it’s sad effects.
2021-01-22 05:57:58,"I keep hearing things lately about our government and it's actions and who they put forward and I think, ""oh, yeah, that's about right"". This is a weird feeling."
2021-01-22 06:06:00,"Imagine being Dr. Fauci this morning, realizing that you can speak your mind without worry of recrimination from your boss.  I’m even a little more interested this morning in hearing what he has to say.  

Now imagine you are one of the other 1,200 employees of the federal government, serving at the pleasure of the White House.  All you have to worry about now is telling the truth and treating people with dignity and respect to avoid being threatened with being fired.

The sigh of relief is being felt everywhere."
2021-01-22 06:11:36,"Dr. Fauci looks like a new man, years younger.  It must have been excruciating for him to watch the former administration's mishandling of the pandemic.  I'm not religious but I am going to start praying every night that Dr. Fauci and President Biden stay well to lead us out of this crisis."
2021-01-22 06:16:27,"Optimism can be fleeting.

I will feel better about COVID when the statistics start to move in a favorable direction.

Ironically, due to the smart way we decided to prioritize vaccine distribution, we should in the next few weeks begin to see a drop in hospitalizations and deaths.

These two statistics, which heretofore had been lagging indicators, will now become leading indicators. This is because we have given a high priority to vaccinating the elderly, living in congregate settings. So even though we have vaccinated only about 6% of our total population, we have hopefully immunized a much greater percentage of the truly vulnerable: Those who get very sick, go to hospitals and die.
The good news is that our reward for this effort will be reduced pressure on our health care professionals and reduced mortality. We could see this in several weeks.

When this happens, Doctor Fauci will have some really good news to deliver."
2021-01-22 06:27:32,"Oh, but of course, in typical narcissistic fashion, Trump always believes he’s the smartest one in the room, even smarter about the virus than an infectious disease specialist...good grief.

Scary thing is: almost 1/2 the population still believes Trump over Dr Fauci."
2021-01-22 06:22:10,"Something that on the surface should feel and appear so normal in everyday governance, yet has taken on such an odd feeling because of the circus atmosphere that we had to endure the past four years. It feels like coming out of a disoriented haze. I didn’t vote for Biden nor am I a Democrat; but two days in, all I can say is; I’ll take it."
2021-01-22 06:23:38,"His asides as to the variant, are concerning. Is our current vaccine in peril of being rendered useless? If I am hearing him, people have taken the vaccine and still contracted it. So is it ineffective or less effective?"
2021-01-22 06:30:28,I'm so glad we still have Dr. Fauci and Trump is gone. Now we can hear him speak without having the president glowering behind him.
2021-01-22 06:29:03,"Decision-making that starts with an outcome and goes looking for facts to justify it never, ever works.

Ever.

This is why we have 400,000 Americans dead of Covid.  So far.

At least we can let the facts inform our decisions going forward and perhaps save the next 100,000."

2021-01-22 06:35:03,"According to CNN the CDC now says it ""...may be okay..."" to mix and match different Covid-19 vaccines. Yeah, right.

You will probably see this on Fox, Newsmax, OANN, Breitbart etc. in a few hours, and it will be the first scandal of the Biden presidency, and for good reason.

Who was so dumb to release that quote? It's a textbook cutout for all the anti-vaxxers out there! ""May be okay"" is the _very last thing_ you want to hear from any doctor or scientist!

And here was I, thinking you were all ""woke"" now, with Biden in office, meaning that you can understand how other people think and feel, and try your best to not scare them. ""May be okay"" ain't woke!

And BTW: this is the same bad stuff that was going on a few weeks back in the UK, when Boris Johnson singlehandedly decided that the time between the first and second shot can be extended to 12 weeks (instead of 3-4). 

We _know_ that you're desperate, we _know_ that you will probably end up a prisoner in the Tower of London, but _please_, BoJo, please don't think that the people are _that_ stupid! I live on the other side of ""the drink"" and I can literally smell your fear. So what do you think Londoners can smell? Some form of rodent?"
2021-01-22 06:36:35,"I've never understood this Fauci fascination. Tony Fauci has done almost nothing to fight this epidemic. There's nothing really for him to do. Public health has always been the responsibility of the states, reserved to them by the Tenth Amendment. 

Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is largely just an advisory body, though they do have some authority and responsibilities. And the Food and Drug Administration has to approve vaccines and drugs. But the National Institute of Health? What do they do for public health? Not much but long-term research. 

Expect that to continue. Yes, Tony Fauci will get more time on television. And he'll make more predictions and give more advice. But his predictions have been wrong and his advice pedestrian. I don't think that will change."
2021-01-22 06:42:52,Have him address the nation and speak directly to the American people. That's what we need right now.
2021-01-22 06:49:12,"I commented to a friend how handsome Fauci looked at the briefing this afternoon - I hadn't noticed before as he always looked frustrated or mortified. It's wonderful to finally see him smile. Freedom, it works wonders."
2021-01-22 06:58:25,"God bless him. He was smart enough to communicate what the American people needed to know while being muzzled and maligned, and he navigated the treacherous waters of Trump’s whims in order to stay in a position to help us. He deserves the highest honor we can give him."
2021-01-22 07:45:29,"My advice is to believe the science: It has worked here in Australia, at times it's been pretty tough on a lot of people but fortunately the vast majority of us have done the right thing and did exactly what we were told to do. Unfortunately sometimes there is not a good or bad choice but bad, really bad and horrendous; lock down is bad but nothing like horrendous. Best wishes and our thoughts are with you and hopefully this too shall pass.
kindest regards,
from South Australia."
2021-01-22 09:15:00,"I wish Dr. Fauci stood up to Trump and spoke the truth earlier.  During a March interview with 60 Minutes, Dr. Fauci said, ""Right now, in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.... There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.""  

Meanwhile China was hording masks in the early months of the pandemic, and nefariously prohibited masks manufacturers like 3M from shipping masks to the US from factories in China. American's watched everyone in China and other Asian nations mask up on the news, meanwhile our government was downplaying the need to wear masks for months. 

I would have rather Dr. Fauci tell us the whole truth from the beginning that masks are actually very effective."
2021-01-22 09:20:35,"YAHOO! I hope we will all remember what it feels like to have knowledge stifled and how damaging it is and how liberating and important  this feels. We must also keep in mind that science does not speak with one voice, and people who seek truth can disagree. But progress comes only through this honest, informed discourse. Ken Burns yesterday talked about lying as one of the three pandemics we need to fight now, with, of course, corona and racial injustice. Remembering this, I also hope that we as a society will make a priority our ability  to educate ourselves and our children about the importance of trust and honesty as central values so that we will both model them and learn to recognize and battle deceit and lying when we encounter them. In keeping with a growth mindset, people are not just born honest. They learn to be or learn to be dishonest. And, as essential as a trustworthy president is to lead us in these efforts, each of these three challenges calls on all of us throughout our society to defeat them."
2021-01-22 08:30:28,Dr Fauci has had and will continue to hold a most unenviable position trying to convince Americans that the long warned day is upon us. And while there is much to admire about this good man's character what strikes me today is the reverence he's held for the office of the President despite the manner in which it's former occupant defiled it's integrity.
2021-01-22 07:02:33,"Dr. Fauci is a world-class expert in his field and it is wonderful to see him speak freely and frankly to inform the American public about the Biden administration's plan to attack the COVID-19 virus.  If only that had been the case over the last year during Trump's administration this country would be in a much better position now.

But even more importantly, there are thousands of scientists and other professionals in the vast federal government who see his example and who will be more able to perform their important work on America's many problems without fear of political interference and retribution."
2021-01-22 07:24:35,"Godspeed, Dr.Fauci! You’ve earned it over a golden lifetime. Your efforts under the previous Administration were valiant. Your character and integrity shone through the leaden times, the dank darkness of the year gone by. Welcome, Dr.Fauci, into the sunshine and warmth of the bright new Biden times. You’ve earned our trust and respect. We’re eager for your guidance. Lead on!"
2021-01-22 09:07:14,"Great! Welcome back Dr Fauci! Science, if given its head, is not just cold mechanical efficiency; its attitude is tolerant, friendly and humane."
2021-01-22 09:50:16,"Dr. Fauci alone is doing the best he can but he will be successful if the President's plan is a plan.
The President has started on a process and not a plan and therefore it is a wrong start, unfortunately. He has talked about the ""process"" of getting 100 million vaccinated in 100 days. Planning precedes processes. The previous general in charge of distributing never saw the risks; risks are not seen but foreseen and to foresee you need planning which comprises of risks and risk mitigation. He needs to assemble a team of a system engineer who has expertise in this field, they can devise a plan, mitigate risks and get the job done. Otherwise, it is a hodgepodge program.
These people can be drawn from BOEING and Lockheed-Martin, after all, it was Rockwell International (now BOEING) who made 2.5 million parts to work together without a hitch and gave America Space Shuttle. Installed 100% security at all 436 airports one year after 9-11."
2021-01-22 09:50:19,"Welcome back, Dr Fauci, to the forefront of our national health spotlight.

But more importantly, welcome back truth, to an atmosphere where it can be broadcast. It truly is ""a liberating feeling."""
2021-01-22 10:16:48,"Welcome back, Dr. Fauci! I’m still pinching myself every morning- I can’t quite believe we have a plan and professionals running the US."
2021-01-22 09:51:00,"As religion declines for many people, science offers an acceptable alternative. Might not be the truth, but good science strives at least to be more or less consistent with reality. Quite a relief after the lies and delusions of recent years."
2021-01-22 10:09:36,"Welcome back Dr. Fauci.
The sad truth is that it didn’t have to be this hard."
2021-01-22 08:42:03,Finally we can learn what the real situation is from the specialists and scientists instead of made up political fairy tales to please the Leader. But damage is done and lives lost. For that Trump and his enablers should pay a meaningful price. When necessary jailed.
2021-01-22 08:54:12,"Good grief, what a relief it is to wake up and realize ""he's gone"" - and that's just me, not someone who tried to work for Trump. Thank god Dr. Fauci had the fortitude to hang in there under assault. We need him now more than ever."
2021-01-22 10:36:18,"The COVID Response and Science (at least in this specific use case) could be where left and right come together. There are already fissures coming to the surface; vaccines will help American families and allow the right to not alienate their constituents who fear 'socialism' (I would think many would find direct checks popular, but maybe owning the liberals is more). 

On that note, kudos to Steve Scalise and Marco Rubio for discussing working together on the COVID response with the media. Like all politicians (left and right), we'll know if they actually follow through on their words -- but given the gridlock (Senators retiring because nothing is getting done) it's a start. 

I also read that Biden was reluctant to set too high of a goal and not meet it. A lot of the risk there can be mitigated by relentless, sharp communication, including shame those who are creating barriers (such as not providing funding asap for vaccine distribution). 

Meanwhile, sharpening the messaging, comparing the wins to predecessors' failures, meta-commentary on setting high standards so that even if numbers are not met we're saving 100,000s of lives, basking in the glory as life returns to normal. 

We can do this America."
2021-01-22 10:22:56,Thank you to Dr. Fauci and other public / civil servant professionals who stayed in your jobs during the Trump reign. It had to be incredibly difficult--but America will turn the corner faster because of your service.
2021-01-22 10:22:27,"Preach, brother! Seeing Dr. Fauci at the podium again gives me hope that science will indeed triumph."
2021-01-22 10:19:13,Am I the only one who thinks that Dr. Fauci looks and sounds 15 years younger? Could it be because NOW the priority is defeating Covid-19 and not making making sure not to contradict now Ex=President Donald Trump?
2021-01-22 10:51:25,"I can breathe again as a 68 year old, I can get through not seeing grandchildren while I follow the mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing and be patient until I get the vaccine. I can hear the song of science helping us to fight this pandemic and we will overcome with patience and grace and care for others and ourselves and families. Thank you Dr. Fauci and President Biden oh it is so sweet to type those words."
2021-01-22 11:15:09,"So refreshing watching Dr.Fauci speak yesterday. I had a feeling of calm wash over me as I listened to him speak

Thank you Dr.Fauci for never wavering, and 
Welcome Back!!!"
2021-01-22 11:29:22,"I’m at a loss for how relieving it is that reason and competence are welcomed once again, instead of subservience and sycophancy. 

I have repeatedly felt gutted for months as I watch the most resource rich nation in the world, possibly history, struggle with a novel pandemic, with hands tied and eyes covered by an aversion to data and facts due to the insecurities, lack of curiosity and seeming indifference to suffering that the last administration, most especially its head, showed guided their callous and deleterious decisions. 

I have no doubt that we have months of continued struggle and suffering as we work to make up for lost time, but also feel a sense of hope that we are now able to honestly acknowledge the gravity of this threat, and open to using all of the tools at our disposal to vanquish it. 

It’s a refreshing moment for pause, before continuing the fight. Thank you to those reporting for providing that spark amidst dark days."
2021-01-22 10:41:30,"I watched Dr. Fauci as he participated in the briefing. I saw this as a beginning of the end of the pandemic. The problem with our response for the last year was there were two very different messages, it's nothing to it's deadly along with 50+ needs and plans. This was the start of one message, it's here and deadly along with a top down plan supported by all, funded and followed. It didn't help much when  Dr. Fauci and team said follow the CDC guidelines while trump held old time rallies! What Biden knows and trump didn't is ""The Truth shall Overcome!"""
2021-01-22 11:08:47,"Fauci.  Finally.  Unfettered.  
What a beautiful sight to behold.  
He looks ten years younger, happier and fresher than ever.  
So do we. 
Ready to cure ourselves with the truth.  
We owe it to all of those who suffered and sacrificed.
Be well.  Be safe.  Be grateful."
2021-01-22 11:15:02,"Thank you Dr. Fauci for weathering the storm with us and for us. What an example of composure and strength you were still able to exert during these four years of destructive ""leadership""."
2021-01-22 11:39:30,"The big question is will governors start letting science inform their emergency actions because so far what we have seen, only a couple have. Mike DeWine of Ohio is the only one that consistently has followed it. On one end, many Republican governors have ignored science and massively underreacted. On the other end, every Democratic governor has ignored science and massively overreacted."
2021-01-22 10:58:57,"Fauci unfettered.  
What a beautiful sight to behold.  He looks ten years younger, happier and fresher than ever.  So do we. 
Ready to cure ourselves with the truth.  We owe it to all of those who suffered and sacrificed.
Be well.  Be safe.  Be grateful."
2021-01-22 11:27:11,"Fauci has consistently told the truth and carefully transmitted the complex science to Americans. Trump can't handle the truth unless it glorifies Trump. Look at the things that Trump rejected: that his inauguration crowd was smaller than Obama's, that Covid was too hard for him, and that Trump lost the election. Fauci rather amazingly kept going through all of the chaos, trying to bring science to our homes.

In the end, Fauci outlasted Trump because the truth will eventually outlast lies. It's that simple, and lies were never going to get us out of Covid."
2021-01-22 11:09:35,"At last, back to the epidemiological playbook:  let the experts speak about these issues rather than the politicians, because more or less automatically half the population will distrust what the politician says.

Notable that there was no politician in the room with Fauci.  The President was off doing his part."
2021-01-22 11:45:16,"Welcome back, Dr. Fauci!  We missed you!"
2021-01-22 10:52:13,"I can't join in with the canonization of Dr. Fauci.   Nobody ever seems to cite the fact that he was an integral person on Trump's ""Task Force.""   True that he differed from Trump on occasion, but he generally gave tepid responses to questions that deserved straight answers.  He tried to straddle the fence with a mixture of optimism and a charitable interpretation of Trump's utterly false and damaging statements that have greatly contributed to our miserable predicament with this virus.  Also, saying that your statement in early March that people did not need to wear masks was only motivated by a shortage of PPE for front line workers is a weak excuse and once again, it shows his reluctance to critisize Trump.  Fauci had a responsibility to the American people over and above any allegiance to Trump.  Like so many others, he failed that test."
2021-01-22 10:54:20,"It is a wonderful thing that Dr. Fauci is back.  

The news is not good these days, but we need to hear it.  Tougher days are ahead, but we will have better information to inform our choices as will the Biden Administration."
2021-01-22 11:07:37,"Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh, what a beautiful day...

Experts given their due recognition and a dignified sane President."
2021-01-22 11:28:39,"Not only was the nation's top infectious disease specialist, he also helped people learn more about Trump's pathological personality.

America and the world will surely be able to learn more about these health issues.

Welcome back!"
2021-01-22 07:02:17,@John Smithson: He deserves and is worth every penny of his salary. Glad to see my tax dollars at work.
2021-01-22 11:32:41,"It is so refreshing to hear as a mantra: ""Fix the problem not the blame""."
2021-01-22 11:52:59,"Aside from being a world respected physician and scientist he is what we all should aspire to be as human beings - a decent, sincere, compassionate, diligent person who has given much and asks little in return. To see him on that podium without the suppressor of truth, honesty and science looming and displaying his bullying presence is so refreshing and comforting. Albeit the truth is a hard pill to swallow but a necessary one and the Trump lies, blatant negligence and attempts to fabricate reality about COVID -19 are tragic testament to his failed leadership. Welcome back Dr. Fauci, truth, real science and integrity prevail."
2021-01-22 09:11:03,"Old Fauci; never seen a microphone he didn’t like.  Is he still advising that it’s ok to hook up via tender and other great ideas?

Part of the problem with the perception of Trump’s mishandling of the Covid problem relates to the inconsistent often contradictory statements of Fauci. Recall, now that masks are the rage, he originally advised against as not really helping in in material way.  Now we see people out in the middle of nowhere wearing a mask as if the Covid bug just flies around everywhere. Masks while skiing in the Rockies. Total ridiculous.

He may know a lot about viruses but he knows little of how to communicate in a consistent, meaningful fashion."
2021-01-22 10:51:27,"Contrary to the common wisdom, Dr. Fauci has done a poor job leading the Covid response. He has provided misleading information, gone back and forth on preventive recommendations, and does not grasp what has been going on at the front lines of the pandemic. 
This is not entirely his fault. He has been an academic for some time now, many years removed from being a treating physician. Like a defense secretary during a war, he needs to rely on his generals on the ground. 
In this war, those physicians and nurses manning the ERs and ICUs, and practicing Infectious disease doctors, have a better idea of what is happening across the country and what’s needed. 
For instance, the ICUs are
full of obese patients, not smokers, yet we are prioritizing smokers with vaccine access. Why isn’t Dr. Fauci aware of this and if he is, why isn’t he speaking out on this reality?
Dr. Fauci is a great researcher and administrator, but he needs to realize his shortcomings and put together a counsel of front line clinicians from around the country who are leaders in their field but still putting on gloves and masks everyday,"
2021-01-22 10:32:32,"So the Democratic strategy is clear: we’re the Party of Truth, not Falsehood.  So why are all the Democratic States performing so poorly on the Covid Vaccine?"
2021-01-22 09:53:20,"If you want to see, the full brilliance of Dr Fauci, watch his press conference yesterday at the WH. 
It took him less than 6 minutes to distilled and explain to Americans, why vaccination is so important against Covid 19, the important characteristics of the new mutations of Covid 19, and how these new mutations affect current treatments and the vaccines.
Dr Fauci is a, National Treasure.
If Trump followed his advise, he would have been reelected as President.
Trump, is now history.
Dr Fauci, is going to make history."
2021-01-22 08:05:55,"Refreshing to read, and a sign of more good things to come...representative of the laser focus of the Biden administration to right the good ship USA after 4 years of being under the  disastrous leadership of one not fit for the role.

Go Joe!!"
2021-01-22 07:26:09,"FINALLY a briefing about the current status of this deadly pandemic led by a straight-talking knowledgeable scientist and which we knew would not be followed by second-guessing, sugar coating and/or downright lies by the former president and his sycophant advisors. An adult was back in the room and it seemed (gulp) normal."
2021-01-22 10:58:27,"Have we ever seen Dr. Fauci look so happy?  The look on his face, his smiles, his eyes twinkling like Santa Claus almost, his relaxed, relieved demeanor, the now ability to just tell the scientific truth to the American people - we’re back on track!  

What a difference January 20, 2021 has made for the American people; not to mention any names."
2021-01-22 12:02:19,"Isn't that wonderful? I have a smile on my face just reading Dr. Fauci's remarks. Things are still bad, but I feel better knowing an expert is in charge again. We have so many skilled, experienced professionals in our government, people who have devoted their lives to their particular area of expertise. I am so grateful for an administration who appreciates those people and will allow them to finally just do their jobs for us."
2021-01-22 12:01:14,This is the same man that last March told the country on 60 minutes that face masks are unnecessary.  Be careful praising him too much.
2021-01-22 09:48:22,It is appalling that this kind of muzzle even existed under the last President. This kind of censorship is reminding me of a starting dictatorship. Relieving that it is finally over!
2021-01-22 08:04:52,What a relief. I saw the press conference. He clearly felt free to speak his heart according to his wishes. These are moments when I might even feel a bit jealous not to be an American. Maybe the US is really making a fresh start now without shameless lies and fact-denying. Hope the 'losers' in your society will experience some lifting-up too.
2021-01-22 11:56:37,"There are likely many less visible examples than Fauci's, career government employees expected to kowtow to Donald.  

Think we've never had a personality cult driven cultural revolution in the USA?   We just lived through one, with all the trimmings, right down to unleashing the masses against the government.   Our megalomaniac replaced the big signs and struggle sessions with a Twitter feed and incessant rallies."
2021-01-22 10:53:39,"What does it say about our ex-President when someone who is uniquely qualified concerning  viral immunopathogenesis, treatment, and public health is  ridiculed, ignored, and belittled while hundreds of thousands  Americans die in a pandemic?"
2021-01-22 12:25:22,"""Dr. Fauci paused, as if to marvel at what he had just said.""

Such a display of humaness is a large part of the good doctor's charm.  One of the reasons Dr. Fauci is so beloved is his bluntness and ability to translate compex scientific principles into easily understandable--and common sense--language.

He looked 20 years younger yesterday with such a great weight lifted off his shoulders.  And like many Americans, watching him, no matter how dire his predictions,  I felt  more relaxed than I""ve been in four years."
2021-01-22 12:21:40,It still astounds me that Trump and the GOP made responding to a pandemic a political red vs blue issue.
2021-01-22 12:28:49,"And Fauci actually proved he could speak truth to the public.  Biden and his team said that there was literally no federal plan to roll out the vaccine, and they would have to create one from basically scratch, a very large undertaking.  After those comments, when given his turn to speak, Fauci said clearly and loudly, for him, that that statement was clearly untrue, there had always been a plan, and that it was well into its execution.   And no one pulled him off stage for speaking truth to lies.  How refreshing.   But of course, the pattern of not covering such lies and open rebuttals appears to continue in the media, how discouraging."
2021-01-22 12:13:45,"Deep State Fauci was apparently one of the government employees working with the Biden campaign before he took office, while sulking and undermining Trump in recent months.    It was previously reported that the Biden campaign received Pfizer vaccine results before Trump.   Fauci was also there when the curious decision to extend the FDA reviews until after the election occurred.    Well, now Fauci can get his TV time and accolades, as though he had zero role in the last twelve months, but is going to fix everything now.    What a guy."
2021-01-22 12:20:29,"“One of the things that was very clear as recently as about 15 minutes ago when I was with the president is that one of the things that we’re going to do is to be completely transparent open and honest,” he said.

Which says it all, doesn't it, about the difference betweeen Trump and Biden."
2021-01-22 12:05:49,"I cried tears of joy after reading this article. At the same time I cried over the destruction of precious life enabled by the Republican administration led by lies, racism and love of power."
2021-01-22 12:30:56,"The scariest thing learned during this pandemic was that the voices of the CDC and Fauci and others were muffled purely for political gain, political gain that infected millions and killed tens or hundreds of thousands. If we can take only one lesson from this deadly debacle, it should be to permanently make the CDC free from any Presidential or Congress “oversight.”"
2021-01-22 12:16:35,"Pleased to see Dr Fauci back and unmuzzled. I would like to hear his views about high-dosage Vitamin D as a cheap and effective Covid-19 infection and death reducer. Hundreds of medical experts have called on governments to promote this. Dr Fauci himself has confirmed that he takes 6,000 international units of it daily. Search on 'Vitamin D for All' to read the experts' letter. Looks like we're missing a trick here."
2021-01-22 12:23:30,"Ok, I get it, The esteemed Dr. Fauci was muffled and fell victim to the Trump sword. Now he’s back telling us how it’s is, really is.

What I can’t understand is how just about every notable individual from every sector of the country failed so miserably in addressing the one core matter that is driving our pandemic solution: vaccine production. 

Just now I read an extensive piece on the matter in the NYT. This a year after the pandemic reared its deadly face.

How could no politician, scientist, think tank member, esteemed talking heads, the media, every senator, every representative, tens of thousands of hours of news coverage, so called investigative reporters and political pundits and lastly a never ending parade of so called experts that were strutted out to lambast the administration day after day. Where was their sanity, intellect and humanity? FAILURE should be stamped prominently on everyone of their resumes and list of accomplishments.

Now we’re getting insights about the production processes, one year into the pandemic. Yet the narrative has always been and continues to be on distribution. Even an elementary child knows that you have to have a supply in order to distribute anything, anywhere, anytime. 

This is not a question of semantics. In the first two days of office we are hearing more of the same except now it’s more transparent and somber.

Please stop telling me that a vaccine shortage exists, that more distribution venues will be open. Tell us the truth."
2021-01-22 12:27:19,"As it should be. Thank God Dr. Fauci had the strength to outlast the Trump administration. He is amazing. Get some sleep, Dr. Fauci!"
2021-01-22 12:03:57,Did Fauci just admitted that he is a politician without a spine and not really a scientist?!?
2021-01-22 12:25:58,"""...let the science speak"".  Well, science says the unborn is a living child which knows its mother's voice, responds to pain, etc.  yet Dr. Fauci said yesterday the Biden administration is committed to funding abortions.  It doesn't appear to me he understands much about science, just the science that supports his narrative."
2021-01-22 12:58:54,"Science can speak, but it can’t make final decisions, which need to be balanced against other considerations such as economic."
2021-01-22 12:58:20,"Anthony Fauci explains the complexities of the coronavirus with simplicity and clarity.  Albert Einstein’s words come to mind: “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”  We need his knowledge, experience, clarity, honesty, and courage.  I am proud of Dr. Fauci, as do a majority of Americans, and proud of President Biden for giving him a prominent and unmuzzled leadership role in these difficult pandemic times."
2021-01-22 13:01:55,"MSNBC Nicolle Wallace put it well: ""Dr Fauci got his groove back."" Wonderful to see. He should have been TIME magazine's Person of the Year just for hanging in there."
2021-01-22 13:17:10,"I listened to this press conference. The press secretary and journalists were excellent. Highly aerobic with response and follow-ups.  Reminded me of a JFK press conference. All are up to the task for what lies ahead.

However, Fauci used his persona to avoid anyone from asking the question: Why Redfield and not you? 

Fauci knows he committed the Cardinal Sin of caving to the ex-president and that he bears some responsibility for the 400k plus deaths. I can say this now that the MAGA folks are no longer an issue. 

The journalists are to be commended to keeping their focus."
2021-01-22 13:12:06,"When I think of the churches that held super spreader events, I know the people attending believe they're being protected by their faith.
This superstition and delusion has been more respected than the advice of an expert like Dr. Fauci, by the religious.
I'll take science over religion every time."
2021-01-22 13:16:12,"He’s the Man.  And I mean that in a very good way.
   Welcome back, Doctor. 
       Thank You."
2021-01-22 13:18:44,"How did this unelected man get so much power in this country?  There are plenty doctors and scientists that are as qualified as he is that disagree with his approach, but they are cancelled or silenced. Why?  Let’s have an open dialog for once. Why are we only getting one side?"
2021-01-22 13:45:33,"It was heartening and even healing to see Dr. Anthony Fauci finally unleashed from Trump's choke hold and be able to speak openly and honestly. He demonstrated his expertise with a mini-lecture on immunology in language that all could understand. And, he provided scientific facts contradicting the false belief that the new Covid-19 virus variants made the current vaccines useless by explaining the ""cushioning"" effect and why it's now more important than ever to get vaccinated."
2021-01-22 13:23:20,"What a difference a day makes. Thank God for the return of Dr. Fauci and science itself, on the health, environmental, and countless other fronts!"
2021-01-22 13:07:19,"I cannot believe that people still hang on to the one comment Fauci made about not wearing face masks back in March, which he corrected a couple of weeks later, as “proof” that he is a quack, or not to be trusted. Does anyone remember the former President’s angry spewage about everything from injecting bleach to the virus magically disappearing, etc.? For a year, Fauci had to walk a fine line between telling us the truth and not making our leader look bad— it was a nightmare, watching every one of those press briefings turn into yet another Trump brag fest, while people were getting sick and dying. I am relieved that we can finally get a grip on what is happening, move forward and solve this problem, so that everybody can get back to work or school and live pandemic-free lives."
2021-01-22 13:19:28,"Can we please hold the applause for this man? He had the opportunity to be honest,and chose not to,when it may have counted. Now he suddenly feels liberated."
2021-01-22 13:20:28,"Yes it is a sigh of relief after the ego maniac demagogue Trump is now gone.

However don't go to the other extreme ie become science cult members ie everything science says is right.

Not only can they be wrong but they are connected to big pharmacy and big HMOs pushing every known useless pill, procedure, test and operation known to man.

Don't do as god tells you (science) do as God as given you the ability to see what is right and wrong."
2021-01-22 14:09:08,"Dr. Fauci is the recipient of many awards and honors, I would like to suggest one more - People's Sexiest Man Alive, there is nothing sexier than a man who cares about our health."
2021-01-22 14:12:52,Dr. Fauci looks more relaxed and confident now that he can speak freely and truthfully and without interruption.
2021-01-22 14:23:26,"I respect Dr.Fauci but feel his response to the Pandemic has a singular focus which has been shared with other expert Epidemiologists.
Dr.Fauci totally ignored the Social and Economic effects of his total Lockdown mandate."
2021-01-22 13:59:14,"Dr. Fauci is a clever bureaucrat who is there for more than 40 years earning more than the President. He misdiagnosed the seriousness of this virus and downplayed it in the beginning, and failed or objected to take precautionary actions like travel ban and mask wearing in the beginning.  Look at the picture, he was not wearing a mask even though he is required one under the new executive order when he is in a federal building. Biden and his press secretary also violated this requirement. Press secretary said when she was asked that president did not wear it as he was celebrating his victory!"
2021-01-22 14:00:13,"The best part of being Dr Fauci is that he’s happy to be Tony the pharmacist’s son who loves science and people in near equal amounts, until he sees human suffering. It’s in his DNA.

Thank you President Biden for recognizing Dr Fauci for his incredible scientific achievements and the charmed skill to make understanding disease science possible for regular folks, like me.

Dr Fauci, as always, thank you and I will comply to honor your lifelong devotion to all of us everywhere as well as my own survival.

Please stay well, Gentlemen."
2021-01-22 14:02:27,"In Japan Dr. Fauci, bless him, would be heralded as a Living National Treasure, venerated for his steadfast devotion to the truth of science serving humanity 'without fear or favor'.
One litmus test of the openness to transparency of the Biden administration will be viewed through Dr. Fauci as a canary in the mine shaft: if he thrives, so will we all. But if he succumbs in his role as scientific truth-teller, we are all in peril.
He is eighty years old, standing tall, unbent, uncompromised.
Long may he stand!"
2021-01-22 14:13:42,I like Dr Fauci but he clearly was wrong on key points and he was unprepared to deal with a pandemic which was his job. I can see why President Trump lost confidence in him. Lock downs caused more harm than good. Our children who were the least affected were the most harmed by Dr. Fauci's in ability to recommend a more nuanced and target strategy from the start.
2021-01-22 13:50:59,"“There is no reason for anyone right now in the United States, with regard to coronavirus, to wear a mask,” – Dr. Fauci on February 14th 

“I was getting calls from people in Sacramento saying, ‘Can I get on an airplane to go to Seattle?’” Fauci told USA Today on February 17. “Like, what? What does that got to do with anything?”

The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. –Dr. Gao Chinese CDC   

""It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,”- Dr. Nancy Messonnier on February 25th  

“No. Right now, at this moment, there’s no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day by day basis. Right now the risk is still low.” – Dr. Fauci on February 29th 

“There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,” Fauci told 60 Minutes on March 8

 “I didn’t get any sense that he was distorting anything. In my discussions with him, they were always straightforward about the concerns that we had,” – Dr. Fauci on if the Reality Show Con Artist downplayed the pandemic. 

Are being cowing into the party line since February, our ""leading expert on pandemics"" finally feels he can tell the truth?   

What about the 400,000 people that have died because he chose to be a politician and not a Doctor?"
2021-01-22 14:25:38,Was it me or did Dr. Fauci look about 10 years younger at the press briefing yesterday?
2021-01-22 14:12:29,"Biden claimed he was going to make a clean break with a start fresh. Yet Fauci is retained and America will reestablish connections with WHO. Both all messed up big time in the beginning, gave bad advice and tried to appease the powers that be. WHO tried to appease China and Fauci tried to appease Trump. I don't trust either and neither do many Americans. 

However, the only person being blamed and forced to resign is the Black guy Adams. This is why it will continue to be a mess when it comes to the pandemic."
2021-01-22 13:29:11,"Imagine the depth of intellectual and moral depravity required to even think about sidelining or muzzling this fine public servant ?

You all had it your way all the time for the past four years and look at the result, 400,000  lives lost, most of them due to incompetence and denial. How about shutting up for a while and letting the other side give it a try? Biden’s administration would have a long way to go before their results were any worse than Trump’s."

The mountains of bills languishing on his desk, his failure to recognize the election while fellow Republicans tried their dirty tricks, Romney of Liz Cheney should be Minority Leader. I was disgusted by Mitch’s feeble attempt to one best Speaker Pelosi during the gift presentation at the Capitol. And exactly was his wife there? Ms. Chao is no longer a member of government and this was not a social occasion."
2021-01-22 13:30:14,"Sorry. It was time for Fauci to go. All he wants is to be on every newscast, magazine, radio station and podcast everyday, and all the time.
Fauci lied to Trump and Pence about the importance of masks at the out set of the virus. Worse, we wouldn't have a vaccine today if the former administration had listened to Fauci.
Get rid of him."
2021-01-22 14:06:54,"Yes, I know we want to put everyone into little boxes of good (Fauci) and evil (Trump), but both have made plenty of mistakes in this pandemic. The news coverage should reflect that not promote liberal hero-worship."
2021-01-22 13:06:07,Welcome back Dr. Fauci!!
2021-01-22 14:27:44,"Fauci has been a total contradiction in terms. His leadership was so off the mark from day 1, telling seniors they could go on cruises, not wanting to close us off from the world, constantly day after day saying masks were unnecessary and then after doing a comp,eye about face with the same saccharine visage. 
We need someone else. I no longer believe him. He made Trump look crazy with these turn arounds. No wonder Trump stopped having him make his comments. He’s also the spokesman who insisted schools needed to be closed. Look at the figures, ptovwte schools are open and functioning and the students and staff are fine. He’s a disaster!"
2021-01-22 13:05:34,Dr Fauci really hung in there and attempted to navigate an impossible terrain.
2021-01-22 14:51:13,"It is true!  THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE!  When you watch people like Dr Fauci and even former “fixer” Michael Cohen, who had both been under the thumb of the Liar in Chief, speak now, their body’s look relaxed.  You can see that previously lies had created a great strain.  The truth is liberation!"
2021-01-22 14:42:03,At last!  A president who backs science.
2021-01-22 14:33:49,"Dr. Fauci looks and sounds like he just had a tractor-trailer removed from his back! It's so refreshing to hear him speak, unencumbered by an authoritarian overseer whose narcissism impeded the truth and, as a result, the vanquishing of this virus.

Kudos to Dr, Fauci for hanging in there though the hellish maelstrom of misery that was Trumpism. His sigh if relief is shared by all of us."
2021-01-22 14:44:45,I like Fauci and I like the fact that science is back but I think Biden would be better served by a different spokes-person. Fauci is a little too prone to saying too much and a little too concerned about burnishing his own image. Biden called Trump's effort to distribute the vaccine etc abysmal and Fauci tried to add all sorts of details.

2021-01-22 15:17:14,"It was interesting to me to see Tony Fauci and Joe Biden appear together. Both men have reached the highest office. Yet neither one has, after many decades in office, accomplished anything of note. 

Tony Fauci is lauded in this article for his words. But what's so impressive about what he says? And what has he done of any note? I can't think of a thing.

And Joe Biden. Remember the Cancer Moonshot Task Force that Barack Obama put him in charge of? Remember the Biden Cancer Initiative that Joe Biden started after he left office? Neither effort did anything but waste money. 

These men are good with talk, and claiming credit. But neither man has shown any ability to get things done. All hat. No cattle."
2021-01-22 14:40:24,"Where was his candor during the Trump regime? Lost some respect for our paisan when he chose his job security over being forthright. Couching his scientific knowledge to appease the emperor did not help anyone.
Perhaps he can reclaim his legacy but had hoped his message to the public and the “chief knucklehead” would be as direct as a NY cabbie’s. It was not."
2021-01-22 14:29:20,I am quite relieved that science is returning to government. Glad that Dr. Fauci is no longer muted.
2021-01-22 15:12:29,So wonderful to see Dr. Fauci back and to have President Biden who believes in medicine and science.  Sanity and facts have returned to the White House!
2021-01-22 14:34:19,"Science spoke during the last administration, science fiction that is.

Trump is the perfect example of why social media needs limits, freedom of speech is great until you walk into a crowded theater and yell fire, which is what Trump did all the time on tweeter.

Hopefully from now on we'll get the real story and not the fake news."
2021-01-22 14:50:05,I know it may be sacrilegious to criticize the great and omnipotent Dr Fauci but perhaps it is time to get a new quarter back in. He’s been so wrong in the past. It’s not such a distant memory when he said masks don’t work and that it would be the fourth quarter of 2021 when a vaccine would be available. Perhaps they could promote him to president of something or other and bring someone in with fresh perspective on this situation.
2021-01-22 14:46:11,"For Dr. Fauci to hold an informational press conference is wonderful in its own right.  However, the glaring and incredible and really key point is that we once again have a president who not only follows science but believes in science to help get us through this horrific nightmare which is evident by giving ""Dr. Fauci and his colleagues in the nation’s leading health agencies far more leeway to operate without specific orders from the White House.""

Finally a president who trusts Dr. Fauci. 

Finally, we will be hearing accurate information on a consistent basis, even if that information continues to focus on the ""still very serious"" health threat from this virus. 
 
Imagine how far ahead of combating COVID we could have been by now if the last guy and his administration had allowed Dr. Fauci to do his job instead of insisting on controlling the narrative and continually giving out false or contradicting information.  I keep thinking of the number of people who died because of such an inept and incompetent prior administration and president."

Joan: Not so well, I fear. We followed all your instructions – I mixed powder of staghorn, gum of arabic with sheep’s urine, and applied it in a poultice to her face.

Theodoric of York: And did you bury her up to her neck in the marsh and leave her overnight?

Joan: Oh, yes. But she still feels as listless as ever, if not more.


 
Theodoric of York: Well, let’s give her another bloodletting. Broom Gilda.

Broom Gilda: Yes, Theodoric.

Theodoric of York: Take two pints.

Broom Gilda: Yes, Theodoric.

Joan: Will she be alright?
 
Theodoric of York: Well, I’ll do everything humanly possible. Unfortunately, we barbers aren’t gods. You know, medicine is not an exact science, but we are learning all the time. Why, just fifty years ago, they thought a disease like your daughter’s was caused by demonic possession or witchcraft.

<a href=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html"" target=""_blank"">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html</a>

Quite possibly, Covid-19 escaped from a Wuhan lab that was conducting gain-of-function research on a coronavirus--deliberately modifying an existing animal cornoavirus to make it more likely to infect humans.  This research was advocated by, and partially funded by, the US NIAID, whose director is Dr. Anthony Fauci.  Makes you wonder why there has been no real investigation into the origins of Covid-19.  Quite possibly, all of this suffering, misery and death is the result of a virus made by humans."
2021-01-22 15:21:11,"As a former military physician I sympathize with Dr. Fauci having to temper science with the ego of the, “ uneducated, non- scientific chain of command.”  As one with education in nuclear, chemical and biological warfare I must say that he and most so called science based leaders did NOT lead in the critical early days. They knew they were dealing with a highly dangerous agent, easily transmissible by aerosol droplets. A combat medic knows this means:  mask, distance, wash and isolation to stop the spread. No waffling was allowable.  Putting the idiots in politics in the position of having to enforce these basics from day one and supporting travel bans even at great personal cost ( to the point of being fired) would have saved lives!  Drs. FAUCI, REDFIELD, AND BIRX you waffled and failed us all. 400,000 families have paid the price of your lack of forcing the science on us!"
2021-01-22 14:39:15,"Finally, rational moves to control a deadly virus..based in science and not corrupted by a most corrupt anti-science brutus ignoramus named Donald J. Trump, so insecure he couldn't allow even the most knowledgeable scientist to counter his dangerous nonsense, a shrewd snake-oil seller of 'miracle drugs'"
2021-01-22 15:01:11,"I must have been impressed by Dr. Fauci with all his hype at first for a few days after he started doing his daily nationally televised coronavirus briefings I was modeling a clay head freestyle and I’ll be a son of a gun it didn’t turn out looking just like Tony.  This was a sign of something, I thought.  But, clay being clay, after time it shrunk and cracked. Listening to him these days I no longer hear the the revered patron saint of disease control, just another guy in a suit spieling off data and waiting to see what’s going to happen just like everybody else."
2021-01-22 16:28:03,"Many of us had said to family and friends that we'd gladly get a vaccine when Dr. Fauci did. The evening before last, we received a phone call from our county health department that we both (ages 71 and 73) could get the first shot if we drove to a closed high school gym exactly at noon.

It took less than ten minutes to fill out a short form; nurses, nursing students, firefighters, and doctors were there. We both received the first of two Moderna shots, which were painless, and then waited on the bleachers for 40 minutes to ensure that we didn't have a bad reaction. It seemed like seniors we hadn't seen in months were there; the feelings of relief were palpable, and the whole experience, which had obviously been well-planned in advance, shows what a community can do when it comes together..."
2021-01-22 15:31:12,"I wish someone would fact check Fauci, who wants science to prevail.  This guy doesn’t have a good track record on Covid19.  From mask to means of transmission, he has been wrong.  As for healthcare workers not wanting to get vaccinated, some figures need to be revealed.  First, what is the age of the people refusing vaccination?  Only 10,O00 people have died from Covid under the age of 45.  Second, what is their health status?  A worker under 45, with no other health  problems drops the number to well below 1,000.  These people can surely get the disease, and spread the disease, but statistically, they could as easily die from the common flu than from Covid19.  They should get vaccinated to protect others.  As for saving their own lives, statistically, it’s not a no brainer."
2021-01-22 15:36:14,Imagine the delusional mindset that would ignore all the experts to espouse nonsense and create mayhem and division in the country.  I am so grateful to have this new administration allowing experts like Dr. Fauci lead the effort in preventing more deaths.  It must feel like a new day.  I watched the press conference with interest.  It's a nice feeling watching Dr. Fauci unfettered by Trump.
2021-01-22 15:28:18,"Science must take its rightful place in any society professing to be civilized. So glad to see Dr. Fauci back again, front and center."
2021-01-22 15:49:10,"It feels like coming up for air. Not quite believing the air won’t turn putrid with another one of DJT’s treacherous acts, I want to swallow in big gulps as much clean air as I can in each breath. 

We were drowning. In filth, in muck, in hatred. No sign of kindness, of empathy; just selfishness. It’s not going away entirely but for now I’m enjoying breathing again. 

It feels almost normal. The lingering anxiety fading fast since January 20th. No more frantically checking the news multiple times a night or not till mid-day knowing that if some calamity struck, decent adults are in charge. 

Most of all, it is fantastic to know Dr. Fauci & science will once again lead the way! 

Thank you!"
2021-01-22 15:58:39,"So when was Dr. Fauci silenced? I thought he spent every single waking minute of his life talking to the media and celebrities, and countless hours interviewing on social media. He rarely offered any scientific insight and mostly repeated the same thing over and over again, and often time repeating things that's already in news weeks back. He repeatedly fails to promote current treatment options with neutralizing antibodies, many of which are approved and can significantly cut down development of severe disease if given early in an infection. He loves sharing his own hypothesis regarding drugs and new strains, and then gets upset when others do the same. He is addicted to the limelight and now he can enjoy hearing himself talk even more!"
2021-01-22 15:23:32,"Those of us who believe in science know that there are NEVER absolute truths until the evidence,i.e. data are in. If one has no data, the scientific method is applied to obtain data. If you want absolute answers which are unquestioned, find a religion where everything is faith and nothing is questioned--and hope you have all the answers you need to stay well."
2021-01-22 15:28:35,"Welcome back, Dr. Fauci! You never disappeared from our hearts."
2021-01-22 15:48:00,"COVID-19 is out of control in the US, due to the incompetence and denial of Donald Trump.

The US has more than 1/3 of the new COVID infections in the entire world, with 1/25 of the world population.  So this is now the Trump plague, which is being spread from the US throughout the world.

More than 400,000 Americans have died, and more than 600,000 will be dead by the time this is over.  Most of this could have been prevented by any normal US President, who would have listened to the advice of experts like Dr. Fauci.

The only way to defeat COVID worldwide is to first defeat it in the US.  That requires vaccinating as many Americans as possible as fast as possible. It matters less exactly which people and in which order.

This should be President Biden’s top priority for 2021.  After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, COVID will just return again next year.

Finally, President Biden should work with our allies and international agencies to promote long-term policies that ensure that the next pandemic never gains a foothold, anywhere in the world.

Listen to the scientists like Dr. Fauci!"
2021-01-22 15:35:41,"Trump would still be President if he not only listened to Fauci, but showed he was following sensible suggestions about wearing a mask himself, encouraging everyone including fellow Republicans to do so, and demonstrating social distancing.

Even after he caught covid himself, he strongly discouraged wearing a mask.  Unlike the rest of us, he got oxygen and care where he lived, he got a helicopter to a great hospital, and an experimental treatment not available to the rest of us.  Then the first thing he did when home, was take off his mask and walk inside.  That didn't beat him, it was all of us who lost jobs, couldn't go to funerals, had to postpone weddings, couldn't visit relatives in nursing homes, while a man of power and privilege didn't have to do anything, except tell lies and undermine people like Fauci."
2021-01-22 16:37:33,"Can we get this straight about hydroxychloroquine? Donald Trump did not read about it in a comic book and badger physicians into wasting time and money into trying it out.

In 2005 study published in the Virology Journal, lab tests of hydroxychloroquine’s near twin chloroquine found ""that this drug had 'strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells,"" and that ""inhibition of virus spread observed when the cells were treated with chloroquine"" prior to or after SARS CoV infection.""

This study was not of thecoronavirus that spreads COVID-19, which was still unknown, but  SARS-CoV was  a coronavirus that acted in a manner similar to SARS-CoV 2, the virus we are dealing with.

Moreover, a group of Chinese scientists last February claimed that in lab tests they had ""tested five drugs in vitro – meaning on cells infected with the virus in a laboratory rather and found promising results for two: remdesivir and chloroquine.

Thus, with medicine desperate to find a drug that could treat COVID, hydroxychloroquine was a very logical drug to try and thousands of physicians around the world were already using the drug before Trump's act.

Further, there was anecdotal evidence. Broadway star Danny Burstein and actress Rita Wilson had both written of their encounter with the disease and both said that they had received hydroxychloroquine just before their cases had turned around.

Thus encouraging use of this drug was not the dumbest thing that Trump ever did."
2021-01-22 16:08:44,"OK, Dr. Fauci is back. Good.

Now get to work and slaughter this pandemic! 

Nothing less than total eradication will suffice.

I’m a bit concerned though, isn’t this the guy who dithered and juked around the real issues under the last administration and their failed policies to combat the pandemic?

I’m all for second chances but lives and the economy are at stake. We need someone that can play hardball, and will to take on anyone, even the President of the United States, that proves to be a hinderance to real progress.

I also trust President Biden and his judgement but as I have said before, what we need now is less political influence and more science and technology. Time to let the experts chart the course to eradicate the virus.

The pandemic is entering new phases with all the new variants that are out there, especially the South African variant that the new vaccines may not have any efficacy against.

All we need the politicians to do is open up the wallets and fund the policies and actions the experts devise. We’ve wasted an entire year with the last administration and their strange, reprehensible approaches to a deadly pandemic. 

If this pandemic is still a topic of conversation in the midterm elections in 2022, then it will be time to make further political changes."
2021-01-22 15:41:01,"Dr. Fauci at the outset of the pandemic claimed the science did not support the wearing of masks.  The ""science"" evidently changed.  Here is what Sweden a much vaunted and lionized  country for those pushing nationalized health care believes about the ""science"" related to Covid 19.  The virus is going to run its course and basically the same  number of people are going to be infected when it is all over whether lock downs occur or not, the only difference is  the duration it takes for the infections to occur and of course the devastation done to the economy. Europe is presently personifying the correctness of this theory as initially their lock down theory was praised, but their Covid death rate when adjusted on a per population basis is very similar  to that of the US.   Heard immunity occurs from only two sources: through mass exposure and vaccination.  Presently we have rapid exposure and vaccination occurring together. It should also be noted that the numbers produced by the CDC of people having been infected are of course based on people who have tested positive, there are millions of people in the US who have been been infected who have not taken a test, thus the actual number of people infected is significantly higher than the 10% that has been thrown out recently.  ""Science"" also does not address the higher suicide rates, the higher substance abuse rates, child abuse not being discovered in school or the trillions in economic damage caused by the lockdowns."
2021-01-22 16:06:19,"The nation is fortunate to have someone like Dr. Fauci and it was a shame that President Trump did not appreciate his knowledge and training.

I believe many of the 400+ thousand deaths might have been avoided if Trump has listened to Fauci early on.

What surprised me was how fragile so many of our government institutions are when faced with a despotic president.  Prior to Trump's election, I assumed governmental norms would be followed and that we could rely upon the efforts and preparation of the many experts working for the government. 

It never occurred to me that a egotistic president would undermine so much of our government.

I appreciate that President Biden has taken the shackles off Fauci but I also hope that Congress joins with Biden to pass legislation that prevents a future despotic leader from following in Trump's footsteps. 

Democracy is fragile and we almost lost it."
2021-01-22 16:57:09,"Fauci is complaining about Trump's refusal to ""follow the science,"" and he is right that Trump simply didn't have the knowledge or the patience for science. However, Fauci ought to also look in the mirror and understand that he spent the last year giving incredibly conflicting advice, conflicting comments (e.g. on herd immunity) and much of our outstanding POLICY recommendations, from mask wearing to social distancing to business closures to quarantines, have consistently failed to disprove the null hypothesis of ""nothing works other than strict lockdown."" I do not anticipate his admitting he and the CDC was repeatedly wrong over the past year after claiming ""good behavior"" would be our savior, but then again who ever does?"
2021-01-22 15:35:54,"The depths to which we had sunk is perfectly reflected in the level of relief, admiration and awe at the return of Dr Fauci. When what should be the normal state of affairs is elevated to something like the Second Coming, you know you've been in a very dark place.

Welcome back, Dr Fauci!"
2021-01-22 15:39:49,"Fauci let the ""science"" speak when he lied to us about wearing masks, not to mention basically making things up as he went along, such as when herd immunity might be achieved.  (A conclusion for which we do not have adequate data to reach with any accuracy, according to actual science.) Fauci's problem is that he thinks that when a reporter asks him a question, he has to come up with an answer.  This is a reflection of his ego, not his science.

Sorry, I no longer have ""faith"" in Fauci's ""science."""
2021-01-22 16:02:19,"Germany, where I live, has a leader who was trained as a physicist: The chancellor Dr Angel Merkel. Since the beginning of the pandemic, she has kept pushing for health policies based on science and evidence. Time and again, she had hard times  convincing the heads of states, the minister presidents, who by law have full control of health policies. Time and again, Dr Merkel humbly accepted her views being rejected. But she never up and kept arguing with science and evidence in meetings and in press conferences explaining in the simple language of a sicentist. The result is that Germany is the safest and most comfortable place in Europe to be during the pandemic. The aptitude to listen to others, a sense for science and a consciousness that, whatever the setbacks, being a leader is not about oneself: It's all it takes to make a good leader and a safe country."
2021-01-22 17:00:09,"It strikes me as I read this, we are on the cusp of a potential 500,000 deaths in the US, an ominous  prediction made by Dr Fauci if we did not follow measures to mitigate spread.  Yet facts and science were silenced and glossed over in misinformation.  There is no greater evidence of failure than this death toll.  Like science,  you can choose to not believe in reality but it does not make it any less true."
2021-01-22 15:40:01,"I always thought Dr. Fauci was wrong to (literally) stand behind the lies told by the trump administration's 'briefings' during the early crucial and devastating weeks of the pandemic evoking the tiresome and counterproductive claim that he could do more good on the inside than on the outside of government. In the end, Dr Fauci proved to be a useless bureaucrat with limited vision into this new strain of virus in which, for example, he stressed hand washing rather than masks when there was intelligence coming out of China that contradicted that approach. But America always seems to need a hero even when there is none, and Dr Fauci, a familiar face who was also initially a counterproductive bureaucrat from the days of HIV, was assigned the role."
2021-01-22 15:48:32,Let the science reign. Just explain the connection to most vulnerable to vaccination priorities. Seems to be a major disconnect to the science we have been hearing about.
2021-01-22 15:58:43,"""I can tell you I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation contradicting the president, so it was really something that you didn’t feel that you could actually say something, and there wouldn’t be any repercussions.""

Anyone who has worked in an organizational structure knows well the consequences of disagreeing with their superiors on some important thing, often it's to be sidelined if not outright fired.

Organizations punish people who don't go along. Dr. Fauci's circumstances were not unique in that regard.

What isn't clear, and may become in time, is what the nation gained by Dr. Fauci's organizational survival skills? It certainly is not seen in the Covid-19 case and death statistics, which has many fathers.

As for the development of the vaccines, Pfizer's in particular, that was not a government led R&D effort. What the government did is to allocate $2billion to Pfizer for large-scale manufacturing and nationwide distribution of a vaccine once it was proven effective. Pfizer used its own funding for R&D. The only government funded R&D was for the J&J vaccine which is still in late clinical trials."
2021-01-22 16:23:45,"Consider that we are celebrating a situation that shouldn’t even need to be celebrated, that shouldn’t even stand out - that’s how abnormally corrupt the previous admonistration was, when it was in everyone’s, including the administration’s, interest to know and tell the truth so we can deal with it together.

As for the criticism levelled at Fauci, many of his early decisions were due to the overall failure in this country to be prepared with sufficient PPE, or be willing to authorize emergency production of PPE - though I wished he would, he couldn’t recommend mask-wearing without setting off a run on them, thereby depriving health professionals who were struggling to find some for themselves.

It’s nice to see Dr Fauci smiling and relaxed, even amid the pandemic. Anyone knows that being relaxed and not having to worry about undue pressure (and being thrown under the bus) other than the task at hand makes for a more productive environment."

How is this exemplified when Fauci supports using all available vaccine for first shots which, according to science, are far less effective than two shots, in circumstances where availability of second shots is uncertain, just a hope and a promise??

Of course, as we now know, there is no reserve of vaccine for second shots. So perhaps Fauci is simply making what already is the case into a decision instead of an apparent lack of foresight?"

Dr. Fauci mislead the entire country both Democrats and Republicans.

It is time to ramp up production, get Johnson and Johnson and Oxford Astrazeneca vaccines Emergency Use clearance from the FDA.

One year ago, while Trump was being tried for impeachment in the Senate, he dropped the ball on leading us out of the pandemic when good management might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Either he was too preoccupied with his impeachment trial, or he was so angry at America for holding him accountable that he decided we could just die for all he cared."

That means we could have had these strategies more than a year ago and many lives would have been saved. Notice that Biden will fully deploy the Defense Production Act whereas Trump had to be prodded and when Trump finally acted, the deployment fell far short of the demand.

My point is simple. Trump deliberately withheld vital services to the health care industry which would have saved lives and restored employment to our workforce. The magnitude of death and the destruction of our economy lie at the feet of DJT and he needs to answer for his decisions. Thru the impeachment process, we will learn all of the ways Trump short changed America so we can better prepare agencies with rules that the next malevolent, misguided narcissist can't stop. And those villains are out there, waiting for Biden to fix the problem and once again seduce America with their lies and false claims.

2021-01-21 14:02:44,"Unlike Biden, Trump did all he could to Minimize perceptions of the virus by not social distancing, discouraging wearing masks and talking about it as a hoax that would just go away.  

He did this all because, like climate change and much more, he perceived this to be a very Inconvenient Truth that while it would cause fantastic levels of damage to the critical public interest he was supposed to serve; it would present challenges to the Image he tried so hard to project.   

After all, Image was indeed everything to him... more than reality (which is why he fared so well in [non]reality tv and his contrived communications of all sorts one plated objects with gold)."
2021-01-21 13:42:37,"The only shortages we are currently facing is vaccines. Fix the vaccine shortage and any other supply shortages solve themselves. Can we, and is it possible to, ramp up vaccine production further. The Federal government has already guaranteed the purchase of billions of doses to give pharmaceutical companies the resources to ramp up. The Defense Procurement  Act is all well and good, but you can't have Ford switch from cars to tanks to vaccines.  Which medicines do we stop making to switch to these modern engineered Vaccines. Build more plants, absolutely, but that is not going to happen in 100 days. Capacity expansion is already in process. We are supposed to be back to normal now. OK NYT where is the critical analysis of the Biden claims."

Big Orange may have done that - kicking and screaming - but he's the figurehead, not (any kind of a) boss in this.  Backhanded, but most probably accurate."
2021-01-21 14:01:26,It is obvious that their sleeves were rolled up even before the inauguration. Has there ever been a more startling contrast? Godspeed to you all in undoing the carnage of these last four years. Right out of the gate we see you rising to the moment.
2021-01-21 14:11:01,"What we do know is that the politicians, young and old, healthy and infirm, pushed their constituents aside last month to get the vaccine.  They asserted their elite status, just like they will again when they manage our healthcare.   They are the ones who demand police protection with guns and wear body armor when they try deny it to you and me.  They surround their homes with walls and leave you and me unprotected."

Once the vaccine starts flowing in an orderly fashion, let’s hope that gives people of all political persuasions a sign that this is a sensible government. It’s a great way to show results of this Democratic administration in every community on the country.  They’ll see the difference from the previous shambles."
2021-01-21 13:56:35,"It is refreshing and a relief to know we now have an administration in place that understands the value of planning, strategic thinking and putting experienced professionals in place to execute. Even more refreshing to see a president who levels with the American people and sets expectations accordingly. Compared to the last administration we are not hearing fantasies involving miracles (e.g., the virus will go away magically on its own) and promises of a pots of gold coming soon (e.g., V-shaped economic recoveries by July). Instead we are getting real leadership."
2021-01-21 14:58:31,"How refreshing to have a coherent, comprehensive national plan to address the problem. The one issue, however, that remains unclear to me is the supply of vaccine. One hundred million doses in 100 days would be wonderful, if we had 100 million doses in a national stockpile. The plan talks about using the DPA to address supplies used in testing, delivering, and injecting vaccine, and it includes funds to hire more people to deliver and inject vaccines, but can the DPA be invoked to actually increase the production of vaccine? Can the US government, which already paid for the Moderna vaccine, appropriate the patent and specifications for the vaccine, and begin to construct production facilities, under the control and supervision of the government, to produce vaccine in greater quantity? That may not solve the immediate problem of vaccine availability, but in the likelihood that we will need annual boosters, we will be assured that every American — and with sufficient scaling, the entire world, including poor nations — will be able to receive vaccinations in a timely way."
2021-01-21 15:02:30,"My fervent hope is that President Biden's plan will prove once and for all that a plan intelligently and appropriately implemented is called Federalism not Socialism and is an improvement on a ""market driven"" approach."
2021-01-21 15:17:23,"I wish Biden success in all of the administration's endeavors.

The plans don't really have much substance, unfortunately,  and don't make substantive changes in almost anything. Ultimately, these soothe and just 'feel good', which makes for good messaging. Some non-soothing information:

- The limitation in vaccines is the supply. As noted by NJ gov Murphy yesterday, the state is utilizing all vaccines and the commercial vendors are reserving their allocations for nursing home residents and personnel, many of the latter refusing. Same dynamic in NY state and other states.

- On the day Biden took office, the US was already vaccinating about 1 million people per day, with a strong upward trend. The desire to vaccinate 100 million people in 100 days is not a stretch.

- Masks are nearly universally worn indoors in almost all of the locations now federally mandated. Not much substantive change.

- Is there a current shortage of PPE? Where and why? Follow-up reporting, again.

- For the record, Republicans wanted to open all schools. Teachers unions and many Democrats did not. Were schools vectors of transmission? Who was right?

The #1 goal is to get as much ""stimulus"" and transfer payments passed as possible, and all messaging is designed around this goal. Critical media reporting is needed, regardless of the party in office.

Everything in politics is political. Perhaps that's the ultimate non-soothing statement."

This country is off to a really good and solid start with this kind of mindset."
2021-01-21 13:03:52,"While I very much appreciate a mask mandate in some places, why not put one in every public place?  Especially where the police don't enforce it, people expect minimum wage employees (who are already putting themselves at risk just by showing up) to be the ones to tell people to wear masks which often leads to a shouting match at best or violence at worst.  If I were making $8 an hour I wouldn't risk my safety to tell someone to mask up (even though by not masking up they are also risking my safety).  

In Turkey, being caught outside the house without a mask is punishable by a considerable fine.  Businesses should know that law enforcement has their back.

We know that masks are one of the best ways to prevent spread.  Why not put some teeth behind that?"

2021-01-21 14:18:28,"As President Biden’s response (I hope) rapidly results in lowering positive test results and bringing a structured approach to this crisis I’m sure the Republicans will jump on it as “too slow”.

We don’t have the visibility that we would hope to have into supply and allocations.”

There’s no other way to say it. The Trump administration committed mass negligent homicide."
2021-01-21 15:32:41,"Joe’s reinstatement of the pandemic office at the NSC, his assignment of dr fauci into a position of prominence, his responsive press secretary’s first press conference, and the order to rejoin WHO are all excellent statements on the highest priority Joe is placing in our battle to reduce the infection rates for the virus. 

We’re off to a great start."
2021-01-21 13:31:29,"21 pages; probably took a couple of campaign advisors a couple of weeks to write, filled with platitudes and generalities.

A national strategy involves an enormous amount of detail; innumerable people and organizations are involved, each doing different but related things.  If written down this would fill thousands of pages, but writing it would take years when delay is what must be avoided.  More important, any fixed strategy would soon become obsolete and a hindrance to effective response.

More important is that people and organizations be competent.  When CDC produces tests that don't work, Surgeon General recommends against masking, FDA gets it wrong on communicability, national strategy doesn't help.  The public health community has long known how to manage communicable diseases; the problem here has been incompetent execution.

The advantage of having 50 state responses, is that can tell us what works and what doesn't.

P.S.: What is a ""community of color"", and why does it require special ""reaching out""?  Aren't they Americans like the rest of us?  Don't they get sick, or avoid sickness, like the rest of us?"
2021-01-21 14:36:30,"Finally something is going to happen at the highest level. So far, the response to COVID did not make a lot of sense and the vaccination plans were non existent, very similar to Trump's health plan (what happened to that thick binder touted at the WH pulpit??).

We are at war against COVID. It spreads like a fire. We did not need young MBA whiz-kids in slim suits a la Jared, we need firefighters like those who battle the forest fires in the West every year, those rugged, practical and scarred warriors. They don't choose which tree should be saved, they go all in and try to save the forests and the towns. 

The strategy here is more ""Shock & Awe"" and ""carpet-vaccinating"", not picking a few among the population. There needs to be a general mobilisation against the pandemic. Get the guys who know how to deal with logistic issues, with millions of orders oa parcels per day. Get the top guys at Amazon, UPS and Fedex together in a task force and conscript them into producing a real plan that goes warehouse-to-arm for good.

Get the top teams at Google, Amazon and IBM to devise an efficient, centralized and working app where all in the country can register for their shots. Add some NSA advice to make it as secure as possible. Requisition all Army medics and nurses (active or retired), private vets and anyone who can safely inoculate, put them in military ambulances and deploy them in clusters, backed-up by the above-mentioned app."
2021-01-21 15:10:05,"That there was no vaccination distribution plan should surprise no one. When was there ever a plan for anything during the last four years?

Remember we were initially told   everything was under control. Then we were told the virus would be gone by Easter. The next prediction was that the pandemic would be over by Memorial Day. That was followed by the prediction the economy would be ""rocketing"" in the fourth quarter. 

With all of those predictions, why have a plan? Not only did the Trump team not have a plan it is now very clear they had no clue."
2021-01-21 15:12:20,"Certainly, the Biden administration gives me hope for the first time in a year that the federal government is serious about dealing with the pandemic.  However, before Trump gets all the blame for the current vaccine mess, it is important to know how many  doses Pfizer and Moderna have actually PRODUCED to date for US use.   The only numbers I can find are how many doses have been promised.  Pfizer has admitted to manufacturing issues in Europe.  What about in the US?  Does anyone know?"
2021-01-21 15:23:13,"My aunt died last week after a month on a ventilator due to COVID-19. She was healthy and in her early sixties, still working at her job at an aerospace corporation until COVID hit her in early December. 

I can’t help but think that, if we’d had a different President, a President Clinton, I wouldn’t know the grief of being part of the growing multitude who’ve lost loved ones to COVID.

2021-01-21 15:36:11,"This clearly shows the difference between Donald Trump & Joseph Biden.

 Biden takes seriously the responsibility of governing. He studies issues, listens to experts, & formulates comprehensive, realistic plans for tackling problems. This might be described as being competent, responsible, & presidential.

 By contrast, Trump never had any interest in governing. He is too lazy & intellectually incurious to study issues, relying only on his unreliable gut instincts. He has contempt for experts because he feels that he knows better than everyone about everything. He has no interest in policy. He sees his presidency primarily as a way to enrich himself,  reward his allies, & punish anyone who he feels has defied or disappointed him. This is gross incompetence, irresponsibility, & absolutely unpresidential.

 After 4 years of Trump's disastrous tenure, it is a welcome change to have an adult in the White House."

“Most critical was the absence of clear leadership, which caused delays in decision-making, lack of clarity in project tasks, and the inability of CMS”—the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services—“to recognize the magnitude of problems as the project deteriorated.”

That’s not a description of the Covid vaccine rollout, but an excerpt from a 2016 federal inspector general’s report on the collapse of the ObamaCare open-enrollment period in 2013.  If you expect the government to magically function perfectly just because Biden is President you are not being realistic."

2021-01-21 16:23:38,"Two hundred pages is already a bad sign, but the article itself is wrong to blame Trump for ceding control to the states. According to the American Bar Association, “Under the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment and U.S. Supreme Court decisions over nearly 200 years, state governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions. The 10th Amendment, which gives states all powers not specifically given to the federal government, allows them the authority to take public health emergency actions, such as setting quarantines and business restrictions.” ABA April 2020.

You wont find this little factoid mentioned in the article, but suddenly the President has free reign which supposedly Trump failed to exercise. What about the hospital ship which he stationed in New York harbor, but it went unused because Cuomo ordered infected nursing home residents to remain in their nursing homes where the disease spread. Was that Trump’s fault?

To Cuomo it was nothing but a turf war: “With New York as the global epicenter of the coronavirus crisis, Cuomo has been the most vocal state governor, often clashing with Trump. These latest comments set up a further power struggle between the states and federal government over how best to respond to the pandemic”

The efforts against the pandemic are nothing less than a war against an invisible enemy; a war that we are loosing and that has claimed over 400,000 deaths and millions of casualties.

We have a weapon though - the vaccine. This weapon was developed using the latest technology and science in record time, but is now bogged down for lack of a logistics and distribution plan.

The country with the greatest logistic systems, technologies and infrastructure in the world cannot seem to produce enough vaccine for the demand and cannot get enough shots in arms.

I sure hope there are a few pages in the Biden plan that address these shortfalls because President Biden is correct; until we slaughter the pandemic there will be no economic recovery, millions will remain unemployed and millions more will suffer, die or get sick."

The vaccine manufacturers are at full production capacity and they are planning to increase capacity as well speak. I think we are already doing what needs to be done.

They say they’re going to be honest. Fauci just said he lied about the percent of the population needed to be vaccinated for herd immunity. So much for that. 

They also admit in the article that invoking DPA won’t speed things up. Maybe they think it could help in the long term. It already has been invoked before during the pandemic. 

The biggest thing they’re committed to is “equitable” vaccine distribution. They know this results in more deaths. There have been numerous stories about how these plans have resulted in discarded vaccine.

The government is completely incompetent. The only hopeful thing that has happened is the speed at which scientists have developed a vaccine."

Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines require two doses. With Johnson and Johnson's single-dose vaccine soon to be approved, the projected 100MM doses could possibly be substantially exceeded.

Assuming Biden activates the Defense Production Act to accelerate vaccine production, it's conceivable that 100MM in 100 days will be far exceeded.  Of course, production isn't the only factor.  Distribution and administering the vaccine are factors that will probably slow progress.

In any case, better to under-promise an acceptable outcome; then if all factors align to enable maximum possible progress in 100 days, everyone will be celebrating an excellent outcome.

And yes! Give the guy a break! Trump excelled at doing virtually nothing for around 350 days. Under Biden's plan, is the media going to be a contributing factor in achieving the 100-day goal? Or just complainers and naysayers?"

It is not clear how Mr. Biden will enforce the new quarantine requirement for foreign travelers. The president has also promised to inject 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days. But that is actually aiming low. Over that period, the number of available doses should be enough for 200 million injections. Beyond the 100-day mark is where the problem lies.""
Good god. Biden has been in the WH for one day and already the NYT needs to parse the inadequacy of his plans.  Is it any wonder that the Republicans eat us alive.  How about a honeymoon week during which the Times merely notes what Biden is trying to do regarding the pandemic in his first week and also notes the total absence of federal action in the preceding 12 months by Trump."

A global pandemic which has killed over 410,000 Americans, 2 million globally and continues killing 4000 a day in the US must be acknowledged as ""extreme circumstances"" which prevent everybody from traveling and to shelter in place."

There’s a difference between making arbitrary ad hoc rules and actually having a proper plan in place. Just because some aspects of the actual plan may include some of those ad hoc rules does not mean the plan echoes the ad hoc behavior. 

I mean, I had the idea of creating a battery powered car where the entire floor of the car was built around the battery. Will Times reporters in articles about Tesla report that some of Tesla’s ideas echo those of Addicted in NYC?"
2021-01-22 04:30:07,"The epic failing of Trump to at least mitigate the spread of the coronavirus comes out of the conservative ideology of the Republican Party against the intrusion of government in the public sector, even in the face of a pandemic.

A huge percentage of Republicans felt that the advice to wear masks in public denied them of their rights to  freedom.

And of course, our Pandemic Expert in Chief saw this as a powerful weapon to secure his base, and set the standard by refusing to wear one. One of the inevitable results being that the White House became a superspreader of the virus, infecting the president and his First Lady. But he still learned nothing from that.

Viruses mutate.  That is the reality.  The 1918 influenza virus was not lethal initially, but it mutated into a lethal form that makes the coronavirus look like a walk in the park.  Then, over about 2+ years, the influenza virus continued to mutate until it was no longer lethal.  This is what will happen with the coronavirus.  In other words, the coronavirus will mutate into variants that are more lethal, and Pharma will be back at the drawing board to produce new vaccines faster than we can say ""South African variant"".  So we can vaccinate and vaccinate (assuming vaccine supplies are available and every American lines up to get vaccinated), but we're simply going to always be playing catch-up with the coronavirus.

The only good news is that eventually the coronavirus will mutate into a non-lethal form (just as the influenza virus did) due to ""regression toward the mean,"" at which point we will once again be able to live our lives with some level of normalcy."

Let's face it, the vaccines were hurriedly cobbled together tweaking antibody platforms of yore, and the underlying bio science may not be applicable to SARS-CoV-2 that undergoes aggressive suppression mode when under attack or just mutates progressively as a characteristic of this particularly lethal, easily spread virus.  I get this make all of us insecure to suspect the efficacy, however, we need to start hearing the truth.  It seems that we need a 21st breakthrough to defeat a 21st Century Pandemic.

NPHS members would meet statewide every quarter to compare stats, and work as a cohesive team nationally when emergencies such as this occur. This NPHS would integrate with CDC to deliver information gained so that prevention programs could then be prioritized and then instituted for major causes of morbidity.

We have had a number of separate individuals discover they were positive (infected from outside the facility), however no cross infection within the building to this date. A small sample of success thus far and hoping the easier transmitted versions of Covid do not break through within the building.  People are growing weary of the practices, so we hope the “last mile” distribution of the vaccine improves.

Leadership means making tough choices, and if you cannot do that, step aside.

Lack of leadership is what we had in spades from the top, starting with not being honest at the beginning about how lethal the virus was and how it was spread.  We could have taken that news and not panicked like Trump  said.  I know they were saving masks for medical personnel,  but just look at the cottage industry now supplying sewn masks.  That could have been encouraged earlier.  I myself sewed for family and friends.

The Trump administration's politicizing of the response doomed us all.  They never seemed to have a clear plan. Just think if they had ever followed through with that ""thirty days to slow the spread"" campaign...

Making governors compete for purchases of PPE, and actually prostrate themselves in DC to get supplies was the worst, making it a show of loyalty.
Trump never cared about us, the people, as much as he cared about his precious economy that he saw as his platform for re-election, and his endless pushes to reopen, despite the facts of the virus...

Yes, I lay the failings and deaths right at Trump's feet.  The buck stops there."
2021-01-18 12:00:40,"I recall, a year ago, reading a story in the New York Times back in February 2020 about a teenager returning to America from his exchange year in China. He had been near Wuhan but managed to return home in time. He removed his mask upon landing in California, breezed through customs and then had lunch with his mom in a crowded Chipotle. 

Being in Vietnam at the time, when covid was already being treated as a serious threat, the level of flippancy that the boy, his mother and customs officials seemed to take was jaw-dropping. 

That unearned sense of invincibility was alarming but somewhat understandable then. But for many Americans, that unearned sense of invincibility never retreated, even as thousand upon thousands died and millions infected. 

America’s failure to protect its most vulnerable during the last year should remain an enduring shame and lesson to be learned, if there even is a will to do better."

But what about personal responsibility? Does anyone honestly need the governor or mayor to mandate a mask when all reputable public health professionals have been saying it for many many months? The simple actions we can all take have been well known and broadly publicized for a long time. So why do people need to be ordered to do what’s in their best interest?

I saw pictures on Twitter before the holidays of maskless people in airports with their luggage, excited to go home for Christmas like normal. Then a few weeks later those same people on Twitter telling their followers “Ohhh, I thought I was being careful, but I got the virus....”(Looking at you, Shaun T, if you’re reading.

Just a few days later the first case of what came to be known as Covid 19 outside of China was reported in Bangkok. Contact tracing had begun in Thailand. Soon everyone was wearing a mask. Meanwhile in the USA, the Federal government denied and vacillated as precious time was lost. Our President Trump continued to give conflicting signals about masks long after aerosols and non-symptomatic infectivity had been scientifically demonstrated as components of the pandemic. Politics were the overarching authority in America, and even now in the twilight of the Trump administration he leaves a legacy of mismanagement with warring factions unable to implement vaccine delivery logistics scenarios despite ample lead time.

Staying away from people is common sense. Letting the virus cases stabilize through a modicum of behavior modification is common sense. But, if everyone chooses immediate gratification over the greater good, common sense goes out the window. We do not need the government to tell us anything. A child who took Health in school could figure it out. Many adults in the US with the intellect to learn better seem to lack the common sense and ability to discipline themselves needed for survival.

Were the trump administration to urge Americans to follow the guidelines of our medical professionals, it would have forced the virus into a position of seeking its hosts and us not feeding it.

And, at this point, we would have found ourselves in a much better position in our efforts to beat the virus and as a nation.

The CDC issuing guidelines on everything?  Governors stepped in only because of Administration inaction.  The only thing delegated to the states was blame.   2.  The Administration deserves no credit for Operation Warp Speed.  It was obvious to anyone that expediting vaccine development was essential.  The success of upfront incentive payments to participants is by no means clear: Pfizer didn't accept upfront payments yet brought the first U.S. vaccine to  market.  Credit for fast vaccine development goes to scientists who this Administration consistently derided, both before coronavirus and during the pandemic.  3.  The President has made clear what a failure his strategies -- open up the country, don't wear masks, use hydroxychloroquine, drink bleach, etc. -- have been.  On March 30 he said: “It’s a horrible number, but ""if we have between 100,000 and 200,000 [deaths], we all together have done a very good job.”""The best case for the country would be for the death rate to peak in about two weeks.""  The death rate is peaking now, nine months later, and likely will continue to increase.  We are now at 400,000 and will at the current pace get to and over 500,000, the worst of any country in the world.  All those extra deaths are directly attributable to Donald Trump."

Why did this happen? Many will point to the capability of the virus to spread, but the single, most important factor was Trump. Many Republican Governors who have responded appropriately to past crises, failed this test because of their fear of Trump and while we may refer to them as cowards who betrayed their oath, they serve at the public's whim and simply succumbed to the demands of the commander in chief who dominated the news spreading lies.

BUT, the portion of the public that lapped them up, knowing all the while that people would die of it, enhanced, enabled, empowered the lethality of this pandemic, and large numbers followed that fraud into the further fraud about the election.

In a nation where the rich and connected can act with impunity and only the rest of us are held accountable, where public education funded by local taxes has been neglected and eroded as a result of that decades long jobs bleeding, I guess we couldn’t have expected a science-literate populace with keen senses of social responsibility."

Why does this matter? The willful ignorance of China's success creates huge blindspots for us. Mere, non-biased acknowledgement of China's effective use of science would have been a powerful tool in educating Americans and supporting public health measures here. As in, ""the steps they took worked great, let's think about how we could make them work here"".

Please think about what I am really saying before dismissing me as a CCP troll. I am not advocating ""authoritarianism"".  But, the only thing that has been clearly shown to work are science based measures to deny the virus paths of infection. This includes social distancing, masking, testing, tracing and quarantine. We are stuck on labeling China's measures as ""authoritarian"" and not suitable for a ""free democratic"" society. But, if we are truly a democratic society, why do we persist in assuming that people cannot choose what is best for themselves? Is that not the strength of a democracy? It would stand to reason that a properly informed people would, democratically, choose the best course of action, that coercion would not be necessary.

When I heard last spring about decisions to re-open, I sked myself, ""Hmm, is there a cure?""  Since I knew there wasn't, I didn't go out to a bar just because it was open.  I read about the man who listened to Trump that everything is OK, attended a karaoke, became infected, and soon died.

If a doctor says you have to wear a cast for several weeks to heal your broken arm, do you tell him he's infringing on your personal liberty, and decide for yourself when you feel like taking the cast off?  If you know that something microscopic can fly into your nose, and kill you within a week, why would you not wear a mask? 

Trump ignored a dozen warnings in January. He shuttered the department that studies pandemics, and ignored the playbook handed to him during his transition. The China ban was not enforced, and we didn't know the virus was coming to us from Europe. The states have cried out for a national plan, to no avail. After a long and distinguished career, Dr. Fauci is dealing with death threats, and had to answer Senator Cruz who told him, well, Doctor, you don't know everything.

Despite our technological advances, we've regressed toward the hallmarks of Trumpism, willful ignorance, incivility, and irrationality. Trumpism is a virus that must be cured.  Respect for scientists and doctors must be restored."

The only reason I knew the vaccine was available there on that day is because I know a retail pharmacist who works for the same grocery store chain in my state. Not a single medical or other health professional in my mother's own county could tell them how to get vaccinated there.

2021-01-18 14:18:18,"The horrible experience with the 1918 flu pandemic was a case of the past being prologue. But this is worse; it was predicted. The 1918 flu hit so quickly during its most deadly phase in the Fall of that year, during a time when science had yet to discover viruses and before drug therapeutics, we might reasonably forgive them. In fact it was the military that motivated science, worldwide. 
Today, no excuse. But the failures were set in place by our acute-care-only approach to medicine. 
We know viruses now (a bit), and we know they never go away. We have a mechanism for annual flu vaccination. We have been warned re: emerging diseases by epidemiologists and virus hunters (Osterholm), and have seen SARS, Ebola, Zika and the various encephalitises hit North America. Even a variant of smallpox come into the upper midwest via a pet store. We had prototype SARS vaccine, published in 2005 by Yale Med and a couple of Fauci's people, but it doesn't appear to have been followed up. 
In our fool's paradise, we rely on acute care docs to save us after we get sick. CDC, NIH document and describe, after the fat. We are short hospital capacity because we rely on a for-profit model where they must run full to pay costs; zero capacity for emergencies. Vaccines, a modern miracle, are developed too late. A for-profit pharma model won't spend money on emerging disease until the enemy is at the gate; no obvious market, no meds. They do a good job on the obvious: ED, skin disorders, diabetes."

National guidances were there always from CDC. If the Federal Govt. had imposed a uniform national strategy, management of the disaster would have been much more difficult. You can have federal and state mandates, but that doesn't mean people will follow it.  Lack of mandate is not the reason why NY has the highest number of deaths and  CA has the highest rate of infection and deaths now. Some mandates like the one imposed by Cuomo on nursing homes led to more deaths. 

If we compare the 675000 deaths during the last pandemic a century ago when American population was much lower,  400,000 deaths in this pandemic is not a failure."

2) We have to improve our health.  The people getting sickest are people with diabetes, obesity and heart disease.  These diseases are largely preventable.  Almost 40% of our population has these illnesses.

3) We have ""socialized"" medicine in the form of private health insurance.  The medical bills are paid by all the customers of an insurance company, whether they are sick or not.  If insurance companies loses profits, they will make it up by raising our premiums.  This private ""socialized"" medicine costs more than government provided insurance (medicaid, medicare, VA)."

Trump’s mistake was exacerbated by his inability to ever admit a mistake. As Covid continued to spread, he continued demagoguing to cover up for his past mistake, in denial of the magnitude of the problem. 

There have been many poor policy decisions since then, but that initial act of political vengeance ensured a robust pandemic in the US."

Biden will now benefit from the vaccines which Trump pushed for, but Trump won’t get credit for that either. The nation is facing a health crisis never known before, but first things first as we speed toward impeachment. But not to worry. Biden is now

She was reassuring in public meetings, she spoke with empathy, and she helped find solutions with the Team. This was not about her need for '15 minutes of fame'. She continued to lead by example in her role as Health Secretary for Governor DeWine. She spoke with concern and a sense of that same team spirit that I had seen some 15 years ago.

Worse than dismal failure, Trump was actually counter-productive. Trump did, however, do 2 things very right.  One was organizing the warp speed vaccine program.  The other was his early embrace of the politically incorrect travel ban of travelers from China (unfortunately he did not follow through and seal the border when Canada and Europe refused to join the travel ban).

But at this moment, it is most important the we focus on the present and immediate future.  Here, too, the federal government and most state governments are acting and plan to continue acting in a counter-productive manner.

Regrettably, despite all of Biden's grand virus plans, Biden plans to continue the primary counter-productive feature of the virus response.  The counter-productive feature is the prioritization of vaccine to people under age 60 according to  social status criteria (their occupations).

Vaccine is being denied to general public over age 65 in order to divert it to 4 million teachers, all of whom are under age 65 and most of whom are under age 50.  Traffic accident death is a greater threat to them than Covid death.

The politicians and the medical professionals are intentionally causing the deaths of many thousands of elderly in order to protect privileged younger people from mild illness.  It is unethical and immoral.  It is evil."

First, we had a deranged person in the WH who was dumber than a rock and had a following of his party members who were afraid of him because they did not want to lose their seats.

Second, people who had at least a high school education followed this deranged person and ignored basic science. I am surprised these people did NOT inject bleach into their bodies.  

If a country like India with 1.2B people can listen to the leader and follow the mandate for everyone's sake where there is NO Fox News, people listen.

There is no political position here only one of naked greed and avarice for power. 
If you think this is a question of politics the propaganda they have been using for over 50 years is working on you. 

The simple fact is that when there is an outbreak of a dangerous like the corona virus you quarantine, you wear a mask, you test and you isolate the positives while still maintaining the quarantine until everyone is tested and all of the positives are isolated. The fact that this was a new (novel) corona virus infecting people should make you try to move faster to do those things. To cast doubt on this proven scientific knowledge is criminal. To do so for profit is depraved. 

Corona virus' are the most dangerous known virus to us."
2021-01-18 14:42:36,"At the very beginning the experts were wrong. If you recall in one of Fauci’s first presentations he said masks don’t work and a vaccine wouldn’t be available until the fall of 2021. It is estimated Cuomo’s action in putting covid patients into nursing homes resulted in the death of 7000 to as much as 11000 elderly. The “experts” laughed at Trump that under warp speed a vaccine would be available early 2021. Each individual state is more familiar in distributing vaccines to its population than a bunch of government officials  sitting in Washington DC. I’m no fan of Trump but if he walked across the Potomac the press would say, see he can’t swim."

2021-01-18 15:13:46,"The real cause of the fragmented responses is the antiquated concept of ""states' rights"".  In virtually all other countries, federal authorities determine which areas are to be subject to which restrictions -- not politicians worried about their standing in their states rather than the national good.

OTOH:  Abolishing states' rights would result in the coastal states governing, almost certainly to the detriment of the rural less populated heartland.

Yet:  California comes close to governing itself, sometimes in direct violation of federal laws -- exemplified by its refusal to follow Title 8 -- and still shows possibly the worst performance re COVID-19 infection percentages and deaths, with no sign of that abating.  That suggests that even being Left rather than Right, with ""self=government"" by states, makes little difference.

In short:  A National mandate, nationally enforced, has been needed. But those states not willing to follow it would have a valid objection that, under the Constitution, the courts must sustain.

Which brings us back to ""states' rights.""  There is no easy answer."
2021-01-18 15:14:08,"To start, the death rate of the United States is on par with the major countries in Western Europe -  see Worldometer -demonstrating that government management by itself could have not stopped the pandemic.  The infection rate is higher in the United States, but the  testing rate is also compared to most European countries.  The socio-economic composition of the United States is also very different than most other developed countries.  Overall the Red states have fared better  than the Blue states, again demonstrating that restrictions can not explain outcome.  In contrast, the vaccination rate in the United States, despite all of the missteps, is substantially higher than all Western countries except the UK - that has used a more simple management structure to vaccinate, demonstrating that the Trump's administration operation warp speed has been relatively effective  Adding in ""essential workers"" and ""educators"" in the mix to compete with those 65+, which Biden appears to support, demonstrates a focus on politics, not science, and could further increase unneeded deaths. I am expecting Biden will impose the same type of dysfunction as California and New York with regards to vaccination, costing many lives"
2021-01-18 15:34:46,"Just as Senator Mitch McConnell made certain that his Senate Republicans would obstruct and nullify most of President Obama’s initiatives to enact legislation to move the country forward, so have two Wisconsin state legislators, Robin Vos and Scott Fitzgerald, succeeded in thwarting Governor Tony Evers’ early efforts to mandate face masks as law.    Many lives have been lost because of their loyalty to the tavern and gun interests in the upper third of the state. Pleading, warning, medical opinion meant nothing to these two and their Republican cohorts. Countless lives in our state have been lost and impacted by their disregard for human life.

Scott Fitzgerald is now a representative in Congress and is a strong supporter of that man(whose name I cannot say) who has rejected the Constitution and our respected electoral system.  Good luck with that."
2021-01-18 15:39:43,"By my rough calculation, the United States COVID death rate is about 15% higher than the European Union. However, our rates of obesity, diabetes and other co-morbidities are dramatically higher than the EU. Also, we may have other significant differences including but not limited to higher proportions of multi-generational households. Academics and public health officials will be studying the pandemic and differing government responses for years to come. There will be many factors that will need to be considered in comparing differing countries. In my view, it is far to early to formulate judgements about the United States response compared to the rest of the world."

Democrats immediately started to weaponized the Corona Virus.  They attacked Trump for banning travel from China and then for not banning enough travel.  They demanded the right to universal mail in voting which could not be monitored in the same way as in person voting and which everyone agreed benefited Joe Biden's campaign.  I think everyone agrees, if there hadn't been mail in voting, Donald Trump would have won the election.

2021-01-18 14:59:31,"I grew up in Missouri, and I am not surprised to see what has happen in that state. The state has gone far right on par with what you would see in Alabama. 

There are multiple reasons why, but there are a couple key areas to why the state has lost it's bellwether way. For one, people who did complete higher education have either concentrated in St. Louis or Kansas City, or left the state for their careers. It isn't spread out with working class blue dog Dems like the 60s through 90s. Ike Skelton's old district where I used to live easily went for Trump by double digits. 

Several people and I from my high school have left the state into the coasts, Chicago, Texas, etc. Therefore, there is a brain drain in Missouri with the people left behind are less educated, older, and less diverse. I see plenty of people back home go with the right wing talking points about Chicago, but never lived in the region, or even visited Chicago to understand the complex issues. 

I digress, but also right wing media and social media. Rush and Hannity is easily on the radio and people listen to them all day. Then add in social media and how they aren't trained or smart enough to think critically beyond their biases. So they are easily influenced, and what we saw happen in Missouri with Covid isn't surprising at all. I don't feel any pity for those who get sick without taking any precautions."
2021-01-18 15:00:10,"The Times has only one strategy for every issue - a massive top down command and control system like China’s; in this case a massive lockdown with associated economic devastation followed by massive money printing, and massive taxation or inflation as the payment mechanism. Yet reputable research from Stanford indicates that Sweden and South Korea obtained good results without draconian lockdowns. And the CDC reports that 60% of US Covid deaths are in those an above age 75, squaring nicely with a life expectancy of 78 or so in those recently born, and well above the initial life expectancy for those who were born over 75 years ago and now are replete with underlying medical conditions. Finally reports from the LA area and elsewhere strongly suggest that the risk to the frail elderly is especially high in multigenerational households. All these suggest that a targeted approach without massive societal disruption would have been, and still could be, more beneficial than the continuing shaming of those who want to work and due to the nature of the work must work face to face. Trump is gone this week - how about reporting all the news, not just that which supports the anti-Trump lockdown narrative?"

When a pharmaceutical company allows its drugs to be produced in a contaminated environment and patients receiving its drug are sickened as a result, the manufacturer may be held liable for its negligent failure to maintain sterile production conditions. 

When hundreds of thousands die and millions are sickened, with long-term medical consequences, and millions of families suffer after a President and state and local officials deny scientific and medical knowledge and expertise during a deadly global pandemic, there must be a mechanism for holding those bad actors liable (beyond mere elections) for the preventable harm to which they cavalierly, callously and negligently contributed."

Cherry picking small, entirely homogeneous islands and countries in the east that have extensive experience with zoonotic disease doesn’t provide much guidance on how the US should have confronted the coronavirus. Take Japan for example, some of the factors behind its success are a milder strain of the virus, cultural habits such as bowing etiquette and wearing face masks, hand washing with sanitizing equipment, a protective genetic trait, and a relative immunity conferred by the mandatory BCG tuberculosis vaccine. Add to these the fact that the US has hundreds of points of entry whereas islands only need to shut down a few airports, the decades long obesity epidemic in the US and these countries become unrealistic comparables for the US."

The implosion of our inadequate, for-profit health care system and/or lack of a public health infrastructure. The failure of the CDC to institute surveillance teasting. The failure of the NIH to conduct surveillance sequencing of the virus to properly track mutants; or to organize a coordinated research effort to find treatments for severe COVID19 and, thus, lower the death rate. The NIH's COVID19 web page is absent any science. Instead it reads like an advertisement for Big Pharma. While public health measures are absolutely essential, they could not alone end the pandemic. That requires a wholesale, coordinated effort including public health, health care, research and more. Trump's failure is legion and history will not be kind to him. But the entrenched corporate and special interests who exploit sick and dying Americans for profit while opposing a true public health system are equally to blame."
2021-01-18 15:42:03,"Yes, the weird beliefs alone can explain where we've landed so far with COVID-19. I've seen little or no questioning around the ""lost vaccine reserve"", except from governors of blue states, Colorado and Oregon specifically.  We know Trump refused an offer of vaccines early on, likely for self-interest reasons, but these people have literally been employed to steal or take a cut of anything that isn't nailed down even when they have something to lose by doing so.  Were those missing vaccines sold out from under us?"
2021-01-18 15:43:30,"The elected leaders of America decided. Money and economy comes first, lives will after those no matter what and at all costs. Lives will be used to sacrifice and preserve wealth and the economy.

2021-01-18 15:43:49,"Frustrates me to no end how lax Missouri’s Covid response has been. You can go into neighboring St. Charles County (which has no mask mandate) and people are allowed to run around maskless, thereby putting everyone at risk. It’s not a matter of personal freedom or any misconstrued interpretation of our Constitution. It’s about common sense and science, which we know R’s have defunded and denigrated for a while now."
2021-01-18 15:43:28,"I’m glad the article mentioned Dr. Atlas, the radiologist who thinks he’s an infectious disease specialist or virologist. Family members of mine teased me for wearing a mask, said the death count was vastly inflated and pretty much ignored all lockdown measures. Why? Well, they listened to Dr. Atlas. When I tried persuading them to take this virus seriously, I was “brainwashed” and spreading fake news, and they strongly recommended I listen to what Dr. Atlas has to say about all this."
2021-01-18 13:58:36,"The national response to the pandemic was politicized by the Democrats who criticized Trump every step of the way beginning with his decision to ban travelers from China and Italy which Nancy Pelosi labeled “xenophobic.” She then mockingly announced her intention to visit “Chinatown,” which she apparently believes is the epicenter of Chinese.civilization. I don’t know if she followed up with a visit to “Little Italy.” He also provided a huge hospital ship for New York, but it went unused because of Cuomo’s order to keep people in nursing homes from leaving their facility where thousands died. Trump was also very supportive of the effort to develop vaccines which are now being rolled out across America. In my own case, my wife and I who are both over seventy-five are scheduled for our first shots on Tuesday. So I say thank you, President Trump!"
2021-01-18 15:17:42,"The United States has shown the world just how vulnerable the country is to the truth. 

A vulnerability that continues to undermine our response to a pandemic, accepting free and fair election results, promoting a fair education for all, and equality amongst our pluralistic population.

As hundreds of thousands die and millions get infected, the inability to accept the truth and act accordingly has hamstrung our nation’s response to the worst pandemic in over 100 years and will ensure hundreds of thousands more will die."
2021-01-18 15:36:17,"Yes, ""the toll points to a colossal failure at every level of government,"" but let's be clear where ultimate responsibility lies. It was Donald Trump who set us on this course. It was Donald Trump who, from the start, was willing to embrace mass casualties as the price of his reelection campaign; who, from day one, dismissed and downplayed the virus in public though he knew better in private. It was Donald Trump who politicized mask wearing and held super-spreader events to publicize his supporters' allegiance to him over science, over common sense, and over common concern for other Americans' health. It was Donald Trump who pushed, publicly and privately, Republican governors, indeed, all governors, not to close and to reopen their states too quickly for fear it would damaged the economy and, thereby, his reelection chances. Donald Trump's name will live in infamy for many reasons, but chief among them over time will be the number of Americans his belligerent narcissism killed."
2021-01-18 15:47:29,"Colorado Gov. Polis also said he believed almost everyone will run into the virus sooner or later, a consideration which gave his mandates the goal of preserving the hospitals’ ability to provide optimal care. He made no promise of long-term freedom from Covid to anyone. This outlook was based on scientific estimates, albeit from the period before the vaccines were authorized. So the question now is whether people will get their shots before the virus reaches them. A seroprevalence survey showing 66% of residents in Manaus, Brazil attacked between March and June suggests they may not. Though US households are less crowded, with significant ongoing public health effort versus almost none in the Manaus epidemic, our spread rates aren’t that much lower.

If true, then inoculating those most likely to develop serious illness or die is imperative, in hopes of getting at least this group protected. And we’re on our way to fiasco here as well. States opening vaccination rolls to the elderly have simply tacked them onto priority groups in line, with no extra supply and no additional personnel to support this expansion of eligibility. They’re blaming the feds, and the feds are denying responsibility—as Mr. Trump did at the very start. I’d say January 20 can’t come soon enough. For Manaus, see

The distribution of power in any confederation of entities serves different purposes in different situations and flexibility rather than dogmatism is what make the system resilient. We have coming in at the national level experts in economics and biological sciences, each with their mathematical modeling methodologies. As this article points out there has been a disconnect between the two. I hope the incoming government overcomes this prejudice and tasks these expert groups with a model that couples economics with the epidemiology. Essentially, cost effectiveness analyses must be done at the societal level and consider long term consequences."

(as clearly shown in this article)

The Isaac Asimov quote in these Comments by Tryman of Louisville, a NYT Pick, is worth looking up. It speaks of the willful arrogance and anti-intellectual history of America. (Isaac Asimov died in 1992; the quote is from, “A Cult of Ignorance,” Newsweek (21 January 1980)). Forty years later this American-Conservative Cult of Ignorance has caused the deaths of about 400,000 U.S. citizens and residents. American-Liberal Cult of Ignorance, though not so strident, can be seen in such notions as the Anti-Vax movement.

At the end of the Second World War, The United States of America was, by far the most powerful nation on Earth. Our technologies and our respect for Science and Education, as well as intelligent, informed discussion promised a golden future for us and the world. How did we come to this? How much lower shall we go?"
2021-01-18 15:03:14,"The 400,000 deaths and a inadequate plan to vaccinate 331 million Americans are both attributable to the incompetent Republican President Trump.

The country should notice that when Trump got COVID and went to the hospital the doctors did not inject him with bleach."
2021-01-18 15:24:30,"President Trump deserves a great deal of the blame for making America First in COVID deaths.

2021-01-18 15:41:25,"This is all interesting, but a complex analysis isn’t required here.  This national public health catastrophe begins and ends with one man - the person in charge - who decided it would be in his political interest to deny the reality of the pandemic and obstruct the response to it, rather than leading an effective national effort.  All these governors, charlatans and cranks took their cue from Trump, whose only instincts are to divide and destroy.  The results were predictable and terrible."
2021-01-18 15:50:11,"Personnel is policy.  Throughout his life Trump has never been able to actually DO very much at all.  If he hadn't been born rich he might have been a used car salesman or maybe a player in some real life Glengarry Glen Ross, working out of a real estate office on Queens Boulevard.  Combine his total lack of implementation skills with his extremely disordered personality and here we are. He was always a fringe guy.  He knew it.  Hence his oft stated desire to get into the big time of real estate by moving from Queens to Manhattan.  Unfortunately, even as the leader of the world's strongest country, he remained a fringe guy; attracting a lot of others from the fringe.  Some of whom he put into positions of authority in the CDC and other vaccine related agencies.  He wanted governors to compete with one another just as he wanted his children to do so when they were young.  He is a sick sick man and we suffer (and sometimes die) because of that."

 My response:  ‘well I wish my sister could have lived another month until after the  election, maybe she would be alive.’ Needless to say I could not buy a car from someone so ignorant.

2021-01-18 16:03:52,"I missed the part in the article that highlighted state governors allowing hospitals to discharge COVID19 patients directly into skilled nursing facilities which are chronically understaffed and were devastatingly ill-prepared to control the spread of the virus within their facilities.  These hospitals and their associated healthcare organizations violated the cardinal rule of infection control which is do not allow it to spread.  They knowingly and willingly broke that rule and there was no turning back after they did that.  Thousands of vulnerable adults that state statutes dictate states are to protect died from those decisions.  If you break out those numbers from the death tolls from the virus you will see the direct correlation with this causative factor as to why the numbers are so high in each state.  
State governors want to blame their citizenry for the spread of the virus in their states but there is not much evidence to support that train of thought.  Mask mandates have been enforce for at least 9 months now providing absolutely no barrier to decreasing the number of cases.  Effective tool for decreasing exposure to the virus?  Maybe, but the data is thin to support it.  The stay at home orders that come and go shut down the little guys but keep the warehouses open and packed again not providing the supportive data that showed the spread of the virus being controlled by those actions.  Not sure the virus picks a certain venue to spread."
2021-01-18 16:13:18,"I am not now, nor ever have been, a supporter of Donald Trump. But I am perplexed by the contention in this story that the Trump Administration “declined to pursue a national strategy” to control the COVID virus spread. I seem to recall Trump’s COVID task force and noted infectious disease expert Dr. Deborah Birx released a detailed federal plan last spring that outlined several stages and listed criteria states must meet before instituting openings or closings to control the spread. When Trump claimed the federal government had the authority to enforce the plan, it was promptly challenged by many governors, who were backed up by constitutional experts. I believe the governors of NY, Delaware, Connecticut and Pennsylvania formed their own regional task force in defiance of the federal plan. It was after this that Trump relented and announced that the governors could follow their own plans. Obviously, this has not worked out well. In blue states and red states, the virus continues."
2021-01-18 15:16:04,"The fundamental problem is that too many politicians, and one in particular, tried to use this pandemic to gain a political advantage, rather than focusing on what was best for the entire populace, even if it was not to their political advantage.￼￼ that fundamental choice of “me first” drove all of the other horrible decisions that brought us to this place.￼"
2021-01-18 16:17:06,"The article makes these astonishing points:   

While the president publicly downplayed the virus, White House officials were privately recommending mask mandates for states with worsening outbreaks. 

The White House balked at a federal plan, but then pressured 26 specific states to do more to stop the spread, and those urgings were ignored.

Publicly, Trump continued to ridicule masks, while privately he knew the spread of the virus was advancing at an unprecedented rate. Trump loyalists opted to do nothing, and he cheered them on to open.  

What this article doesn't mention:  Trump quashed a federal plan that would have issued 5 masks to every American household, a partnership between cotton manufacturers, USPS, and HHS.  The masks were to be branded with the logo from HHS.  Trump was angry with USPS and its affiliation with Jeff Bezos.  His personal anger with reporting of Bezos's Washington Post stood in the way of managing the pandemic at the federal level.  

This article also doesn't mention Trump's tweets to his followers in Michigan, Virginia, and Minnesota, to resist and ""liberate"" the states and defy their Dem governors' stay-at-home orders."
2021-01-18 16:17:33,"So depressing because we all watched this happen and knew what the results would be.

2021-01-18 16:24:21,"It pains me to appear hyperbolic, but I think that at this point, thinking people can agree that Republicans are dangerous. 

They STILL reject the long-ago established science of climate change. They seem not to care one whit about the hundreds of thousands of deaths resulting from Covid. They embrace lies about election fraud. They revel over environmental deregulation that threatens the health of their own children. Many of them (although not all) entertain the most ludicrous and bizarre conspiracy theories about their political opponents. 

How is any of this helpful? How is any of this governance? What exactly is the point of this ignorant and destructive party?"
2021-01-18 16:25:21,"Trump said in April he would decide when to reopen. But Democratic governors from the northeast were already making their own plans for a regional reopening. 

Then there were claims that the president trying to control what the states might be unconstitutional. After a fews days of controversy, he gave-in, both to his own desire to reopen and to many governors' complaints, and handed over the reins to them.

Ever since, the governors, Democrats especially, have been complaining about a lack of clear federal leadership in the pandemic. Too bad they couldn't stop complaining when the Feds were in control."

2021-01-18 11:58:46,"When I visited the US for the first time, one of the (many, many) things that struck me was the apparent value that the community placed on an individual's life. I had never seen defibrillators in office hallways before. Or battleships dispatched to rescue a single sailor lost at sea. Anti-skid strips on every imaginable outdoor surface, doors designed to open outwards easily to facilitiate mass evacuation. Fire escapes, fines for not wearing seat belts or for not putting babies in car seats, and so on.

So, it is unfathomable, unimaginable, to see so many people dying like flies in the US juxtaposed with videos showing crowds thronging to events and laughing in bars like everything was normal. The only way this could have happened was if somehow people were convinced that there was no danger, that they needn't take precautions. Almost as if people believed that heart attacks weren’t real, fire was good for them, that they couldn't drown, or slip and fall, or die in car accidents. Yet, this is exactly what has happened with respect to Covid. What can a government do to protect people who don't believe they need protection?"

Masking and its value was never in doubt to anyone with any medical training. I learned, as a medical student , that you wear a mask always when entering the room of someone with an airborne infectious pathogen. The decision to say otherwise was a conscious one. If doctors and nurses did not have N95 masks and a hoarding public did it was feared the healthcare system would collapse. The seriousness of the virus was downplayed for political reasons by the President.The rollout of the vaccine has been incredibly poor given it was known to be coming and the responsibility is shared at all levels of government. It is a national disgrace. I expect our new administration will handle this as if it were a war which it is."

2021-01-18 19:28:31,"As a nurse I am astounded, saddened and deeply disturbed by this summary. We have allowed politics to kill 400,000 souls, proud mother, fathers, families and friends. Do we need a president to tell us what will save our lives? No not really! We know that wearing a mask, staying distanced from others, and washing our hands are the three simple measures that prevent the spread of an infectious disease such as the flu. This has helped for a century but we ignored it because it is inconvenient. At least half of us were just ignorant and thought if we don’t acknowledge it, COVID would go away. We saw what China did right away and determined their measures were too draconian to get the outbreak under control and we ignored it.  It is a year into the epidemic and 400,000 loved ones are gone and the US is still doubting that COVID is real. I fear for many, no number will be high enough before every American recognizes they need to be a part of the solution. Until this happens the senseless dying will continue until we have enough vaccine in people’s arms. What is frustrating is that the public expects the healthcare system to make up for their own ignorance and safe someone’s life after they ignored their own responsibilities. Believe me they will try to the breaking point. I want everybody to acknowledge that as American we have to do our part for us to have a healthy society."
2021-01-18 12:50:49,"Yes, government from Trump on down has failed.  But the failure is owing to the lack of education, morality, common sense, and generosity on the part of about half of the American population, that part of the population which would not wear masks, would not keep proper distance from others, would avoid family gatherings, and those who demonized those who followed the best medical advice.

We, currently have about 50 implementations without clear requirements ... what could go wrong!

I hope the Biden administration will first state what we are trying to do nationally (the requirements) so that we can design a strategy, implement that strategy, and measure (test) how we are doing.

2021-01-18 14:43:15,"I have studied the Constitution for more than half a century.  I seem somehow to have missed something.  Perhaps someone would direct me to the clause that, in the name of freedom, entitles every person to do anything irrespective of the consequences to others.

Refusing to wear a mask is no different in structure from firing what may be a loaded firearm randomly in the direction of other people.  That is a crime in every state.  Is that criminal law in derogation of “freedom”?  

Because asymptomatic people can spread the virus to others, each of us is a germ weapon that may be loaded.  Not wearing a mask is randomly firing it in the direction of other people.  What’s worse is that for those who contract the virus, especially those who contract it asymptomatically, they become loaded weapons without even knowing it.  The spread of the virus becomes like a chain reaction.

All this in the stolen name of “freedom.”"

So they cited risks of various outcomes, no certainties. The President was a man who refused to admit weakness, nor miscalculations, nor being uncertain. He was also in the habit if ignoring risks that impelled him to forego what he wanted to do. 

The President trivialized the possible bad outcomes with the public and hoped to keep the focus upon his run for re-election. As things turned dire, he could not admit it and would not upset the private businesses who did not want the Federal government telling them what to do.

It takes longer and longer to do things, Why? Because we have way too many ""analysts""  and ""experts"" doing lots and lots of talking and no real work gets done. Everywhere I turn, there is some ""expert"" or ""analyst"" doing useless talking and not the real work.
In the 60s it took 4 years to build the Montreal metro, now it takes 5 years just talking about a single station. What progress!!!
It is the same everywhere you look. There is what you call analysis paralysis and the work simply does not get done. Now, when someone like myself says something it is mocked upon, what do I know. Well, the proof is in front of everyone, getting the job done does not happen and we do a lot of talking, on one app or another, waste all of our time on one social medial or another. A friend shared an article from some Australian guy saying that the caveman sat around did lots of chatting but they did not get to moon with that, it took hard work. I agree.
I rest my case by saying, unless we get rid of these analysts and useless talkers, who by the way get paid way too much money for doing nothing, and get to getting the job done we will suffer, more severely, from future such events."
