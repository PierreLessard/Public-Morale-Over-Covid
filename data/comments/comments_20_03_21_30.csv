2020-03-28 19:24,"Just yesterday, Vice President Pence proudly toutes the over 600,000 tests had been performed.  He seems to have conveniently forgotten that he had promised over 4 million more than two weeks ago.  Maybe not an outright falsehood, but definitely misleading by omission."
2020-03-28 19:26,"Reminds me of the Bush administration before 9/11. The terrorism warnings were ""blinking red"" and the the FBI in Washington was alerted that flight students from the Middle East wanted to learn how to fly large jets but didn't want to learn how to take off or land. Yet nothing was done."
2020-03-28 19:29,"This is what is known in the military as “Dereliction of Duty”

Everything that is occurring now was known then, and like two ships on a collision course, was utterly predictable with frightening certainty.

Let’s hope the nation remembers this lethal and costly mismanagement come November."
2020-03-28 19:36,"""World's richest country"" is extremely misleading. I would not include such a vague statement in a factual article. Wealth distribution and allocation to healthcare and disease prevention / control is far, far more important."
2020-03-28 19:38,"Regardless of agency or person, these all fall under the purview of the executive branch, hence this is the fault of the executive."
2020-03-28 19:42,Perhaps President Trump did not want to have a test readily available because high numbers would undermine his position.
2020-03-28 19:43,"I am 67 years old, came down with gastrointestinal illness and a flu like feeling all over my bod and a temp, my doctor said I qualified for a test, and I will find out the results in eight days. I felt I’ll for one and a half days then suddenly recovered. What shocks me is the nonchalant attitude of Trump and his henchmen while people die. The insidious ness of this journey of a deadly pathogen creeping through our cities while adults in government suppressed testing and argued like middle school children is the most horrific thing I have seen I. This Trump administration. While his henchmen and women are loyal to him, people die and get sick? Who can be criminally prosecuted in the government high ups for negligence?"
2020-03-28 19:46,"Thank you for this article. This is what I've been saying. Once I saw those dead bodies on the street in Wuhan, I knew it was only a matter of time before this started showing up in major US cities. However, I thought we had tests, PPD for medical personnel, and ventilators. How wrong I was. 

A few countries, like Singapore and Vietnam, did contact tracing and enforced two-week quarantines WITH doctor visits and food delivery for those exposed. That was far more efficient and less expensive than collapsing the economy.

This pandemic has exposed that the US is not really a first-world country. We were not prepared to protect the most vulnerable among us. More damningly, those in charge don't seem to care at all."
2020-03-28 19:45,"One of the strategy to be successful in many Asian countries could be wearing masks. Indeed it is true that wearing masks is not the most efficient to way to protect a healthy people from infection, but it is the most effective way to stop the spread from the infected person to the healthy one. In the current circumstance when we don't know who are infected or who are not, wearing masks could be a very effective way. However still there is a culture in America and Europe that wearing masks is considered as a sign of sick people and some Asians wearing masks are attacked or become the target of discrimination. The experts still tell to the general public not to wear masks. One reason could be because of the shortage of the face masks for the medical staffs, but this is not the right way to protect the general public from infection. The administrartions should work hard 1)to speed up the production of the face masks 2) to encourage  people to wear the face masks whenever and wherever."
2020-03-28 19:45,"“Only the best people” trying to work with Federal agencies whose leadership has been decimated with unfilled positions, and acting heads whose prime qualification is loyalty to Trump. Long term professionals are considered the Deep State, trying to undermine Trump, and every warning and piece of bad news is seen as part of the plot.

And above it all, the number one priority is to keep Trump happy, praise him at all times, and make him look good. The biggest threat for the administration is that he won’t get re-elected; everything else is secondary. 

Expect more chaos as long as Trump remains in office and the GOP controls the Senate, giving him cover. At this point, it’s either 25th amendment time or a real impeachment trial. We may not make it to November under Trump. If he can cancel or rig the election, he will.

Meanwhile, a closer look at death rates in Italy suggests the toll from the virus is being under-reported. There’s neither time nor resources to investigate every death to confirm if it was virus related, but the numbers are much higher above normal than the official virus death toll can explain.

This is going to get much worse before it gets better."
2020-03-28 19:45,"This account suggests it was ineptitude, turf battles, poorly qualified appointees, deep cuts in agencies that protect our health, and a failure to appreciate the emergency that led to the lack of testing.  I hope this is true.  A darker possibility is that political appointees dragged their feet to preserve a rosy picture of the virus in hopes of pleasing the president, who at the time was busy denying the seriousness of the threat, and overtly admitting he wanted to keep the numbers low."
2020-03-28 19:48,"Ever more precise tests for more and more Germans enable the early detection of clusters and areas of infection. That explains the high number of infected people in Germany. On the other hand, it enables the infected ""only"" with mild symptoms (the majority) to be recognized in good time and sent home for isolation early enough so that no risk groups are infected. The high test rate and the many infections that were discovered early enough were therefore eliminated as a risk factor for all old people or people with medical risks. This means that there are fewer deaths in precisely these risk groups. Thanks to the measures taken by the government to lockdown, social distances and a health system that has so far worked exemplary, Germany has managed to mourn only 400 dead despite 50,000 infections. I very much hope that other countries will soon work in a similar way. Because an even larger number of victims and a longer waiting time until this crisis is overcome would be unbearable.
And other god News from Europe:
The other aid programs of the EU countries are starting to run slowly. Next week we will take over 5 Italian corona cases that need ventilation on our corona intensive care unit in Bad Hersfeld Hesse. And we are not the only ones in Germany or Hesse. With a lot of work and even more luck, we can hopefully lower the mortality rate together. Solidarity with each other is now all that matters.
We will defeat this pandemic together not ""someone First"""
2020-03-28 19:52,"And, the trail of accountability begins. Nicely done except after the failure of a greater percentage of the public to grasp the Mueller report, the complexities of what will become the corona virus report  may end up in the same heap pile, too. A mad king,  his corrosive impact on our most important institutions, and a political system that allowed it gave us chaos. A supposed legacy of American exceptionalism is that we come together in a crisis and get it done. I’m a child of the 50s and if I had any doubts after Katrina that this had become more myth than reality, now I know with certainty. Myth. In a banana republic, there is only one well coordinated institution and that is the military. What would save me from the depths of this cynicism would be for the many involved with the current administration to publicly reflect and show inner wisdom and the courage to reveal the truth."
2020-03-28 19:54,"When the complete history of this catastrophe is written there will be a chapter on the dismantling of government and it's consequences. The Trump administration, to the extent he ever staffed it, will be known as the test case for the proposition that we don't need a federal government at all, that the country would be  better off  just letting the corporate elite do as they please and the free market have its way.

By disbanding the pandemic unit on the national security council the president set in motion a series of actions that led us here. That he stated that he did not know anything about it, and or accepts no responsibility for that or anything else, is  indicative of the problem. Of course the end of that thinking and his conduct is this catastrophe.

By refusing to use equipment from the WHO at the outset of the pandemic, and a host of other massive blunders the spread of this disease was assured. By downplaying, making lite of, by flatly misrepresenting the facts of the matter, a test for everyone !  he has made a bad situation into a complete fiasco.

His theory of government has not only been found wanting but to be an utter failure and betrayal of the country. He very much bears responsibility, he was elected to be president after all ?

As to motives there will be time enough time to dissect that. Right now the question is can the federal government act in a manner consistent with  one of it's  fundamental  reasons for being, TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE."
2020-03-28 19:55,"After 9/11, we were told that the main function of the newly-created Department of Homeland Security would be to ""connect the dots"" related to threats against the U.S.   Well, there  were a lot of dots in the weeks and months preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and while many blame Trump for a lack of leadership, where was DHS as this crisis loomed on the horizon? Could it be that DHS was silenced or diminished by Trump or were the ""best people"" put in charge clueless?"
2020-03-28 19:58,"Sad, but not totally unexpected considering that we have novices running the show. ""Draining the swamp"" means that no one in the administration is an expert in their field.

It's a little bit like the difference between a medical intern and a seasoned master clinician. The former is learning the ropes, and only reacting to the clinical situation. 
The master clinician, through clinical wisdom, knows what's about to happen before it actually does. As a result, the master clinician can quickly get ahead of the situation and save the patient.

It's just criminal that ego got the best of them and allowed the situation to get out of hand. 

This critical error was indeed an error of commission rather than omission because of misinformation and misdirection.

Trump:  ""Anybody that needs a test gets a test; they're there, they have the tests, and the tests are beautiful"" - Trump

Azar nodded at one point as the president noted that ""they're making millions more [tests] as we speak.""

These words were spoken on March 6th 2020 (3 weeks prior to this story's publication date)."
2020-03-28 20:06,"Thanks for the great reporting. We need to continue to hold those in power accountable, People say, ""don't look back"" and just focus on the virus moving forward. But it's precisely by looking back now and seeing where the administration went wrong that the public can put pressure on Trump and those that surround him to make the right decisions moving ahead."
2020-03-28 20:08,"Actually the federal response was even worse than described here, when you consider that a functioning Covid19 test in Seattle (by the Seattle flu study) was not allowed, by the CDC and FDA, etc, to test for at least 3 weeks (early Feb to Mar 1), despite being ready to go (3-4 weeks before the CDC test worked). Three weeks probably represented six or so doublings of the infections at the time, after which any hope of actually containing the virus was gone, and the only hope for avoiding catastrophe was social distancing for weeks, at huge cost to the economy."
2020-03-28 20:26,"This is a good article, but it is so long it is hard to see the key issues.  I have a research lab where we do PCR (polymerase chain reaction, the core technique in the test), and have been watching the problems with the coronavirus test.  I think there are three main problems:

1.  The CDC was slow in developing its test.
2.  The CDC required testing labs to have a particular combination of very specific equipment and reagents, which few labs did.  Even minor substitutions were initially not allowed.
3.  The equipment and reagents needed in the CDC test, and also in recently-approved variants of the test, are specialized, and only available in limited quantities.

Although the number of tests is increasing, it is still being held back by these problems.  A willingness to use more commonly-available reagents would allow many more tests to be done.  However, work validating the use of these more common reagents would be required.  Also, tests of different kinds that do not use PCR are being developed."
2020-03-28 20:26,"CDC's delay in the deployment of testing is unacceptable. It is more important to have a test running than to ""re-invent the wheel"" in times of emergency. The accuracy of a test is important, however, when compares to the urgency of a test when the virus is spreading fast, the choice is obvious. Let's hope that there will be a congressional inquiry when we are through this COVID-19 pandemic."
2020-03-28 20:28,"Not testing ""those with milder symptoms""  was just a euphemism for not not having tests available.  On March 18 I was an 82 year old who had coughed for 10 days with flu like symptoms and had a 100degree temperature.  A large emergency ward at a major Miami refused to test me until an X-ray showed pneumonia. Lucky I tested negative but was sent home to a family of 8 children and grandchildren after the test and was not notified of the results for 6 days after release.  When I hear of the administrations criminal euphemistic coverup of the shortage I cry for the families of this who have died and/or have had to wait in the rain for 6 hours at NYC hospitals to be told they are not candidates for the test.  No functioning health care system would behave this way."
2020-03-28 20:48,"It is important not only to test for those who have Covid-19, but also to be able to test widely for those who have had the virus infection and recovered. These people are critical, especially in the healthcare profession, as they cut neither catch the virus or transmit it."
2020-03-28 20:52,It's great to have more test kits but you also need laboratories that won't get bogged down when the avalanche of test swabs arrive. Right now my hospital is experiencing 5-7 day turnaround for tests. That means we are using up valuable PPE - gowns gloves masks - on potentially COVID negative patients because we're waiting on test results. We need an immediate point of care test that can quickly rule out non-COVID patients.
2020-03-28 21:01,"Some other thoughts about the failure to test rapidly:

1) Agency leaders set the priorities, and could have prioritized test development instead of other Trump administration priorities.
2) A good leader would have supported parallel evaluation of the WHO test and home grown tests. The Trump administration has promoted a culture of leadership opposed to cooperation with international bodies.
3) Federal agencies are criticized and scrutinized by Congress, GAO, consumer groups, the media. If they do not follow strict laboratory standards and SOPs, they will be punished and attacked, leading to a culture of cautiousness. A lot of time and energy is spent dealing with responses to inquiries, and that shapes what agencies work on."
2020-03-28 21:01,"Death by bureaucracy.  
The most important people to test are the mild or presymptomatic.  The very ill patients can be presumed to have CoVID19 or another infectious virus, and all precautions can be taken.  It is the mild and presymptomatic who are out grocery shopping, serving food for take away,  working at checkout counters, hopping on planes and spreading the virus. If these mild and presymptomatic cases are identified they can be quarantined and their contacts can be identified and quarantined. In Asia there are apps that people can volunteer to have their cell phone GPS data uploaded so anyone in contact with a diagnosed case within two weeks prior to onset can be informed and quarantined. Any software developers out there? We cannot do anything about the monumental failures to test and to supply our medical teams and hospitals in the past. We can start now to do everything humanly possible to support our healthcare professionals and scientists and to contain this virus going forward. Starting now."
2020-03-28 20:15,"This pandemic may just be the Perfect Storm.  Disasters typically require multiple things to go wrong in order to be really bad.  The Titanic sinking is a great example: Construction problems, a captain racing the clock, calm waters, and a sense of invulnerability all come together to create a disaster beyond what would be imagined.

Same thing here maybe.  A virus that is highly contagious, has a high mortality rate and is very stealthy.  A president who downplays the virus for 6 weeks, losing precious time, and then continues to bumble and make mistakes and not take it seriously all in the name of reelection.  A percentage of the populace that isn’t taking it as seriously as it should.  A weakened federal pandemic response machinery.  And initial mistakes in testing by the CDC.  

The Perfect Storm that just may show that, yes, it can happen here and it can happen to us and our generation."
2020-03-28 19:59,"All of this is lapses in leadership. 

Good tests were there to be had.  Not getting them is a leadership failure.  A career ending one in a well run world. 

Regulatory hurdles have exceptions.  Good leadership would have made those exceptions. Not making those exceptions should be a career ending failure. 

And nuts who sneer at science are a leading part of this administrations leadership failure.  Should be a career ending failure.  But the people who brought us the war on false pretenses in Iraq only to make Iran stronger and us weaker and the Great Recession and now the worst outcomes on the pandemic despite the most lead time and chance to get ready are and will do fine. 

But the Times will do its bit to soften the blow of the Trump administration incompetence from top to bottom and eagerly publish the excuses from unnamed white noise sources who continue to muck it up as gospel truth. 

Principles of free market my foot. 

This is the easy pandemic. Easily killed.  Easily avoided. Not as deadly as the bad ones. Not bad on the young.  Medical knowledge so advanced and widespread the solution time is faster than in the history of mankind. We are mucking up the easy one because of those who have been elected leaders.  And Biden hiding and trembling for fear he will say the wrong thing."
2020-03-28 20:08,"“Dr. Stephen Hahn, 60, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, enforced regulations that paradoxically made it tougher for hospitals, private clinics and companies to deploy diagnostic tests in an emergency.”

‘Paradoxically’?  It’s more like ‘criminally’ and ‘tragically,’ seems to me."
2020-03-28 20:27,"And who was pushing the impeachment at that time? Of course Trump was preoccupied with it, as well as the Democrats."
2020-03-28 20:10,"When the president is a low information paranoid conspiracy theorist consumed with how any public issue affects his reelection this should come as no surprise.  It was only after the severity of the pandemic became clear that he put someone in charge because that is when he knew it would affect his reelection. Even then he didn't choose someone based on expertise or effectiveness. He chose the most loyal sycophant at hand. Had he left him in charge and exited the stage we would undoubtedly be in a better place now but that is not in his nature. He continued to downplay the threat while stepping on the effective messaging of the expert doctors and scientists.
He is incurious to anything not related to his personal political aspirations until they are and then he can't get out of his own way or in this deadly occasion ours."
2020-03-28 20:31,"It was all about getting re-elected.  He and his Administration ignored the warning signs coming out of China.  With South Korea on the ball, that country did its duty in protecting its citizens.  Europe is being decimated by this virus and here in our country with the epicenters being in New York, Washington, California and now Louisiana and will be seeing more epicenters other parts of the country.  And he wants to reopen for business by Easter.    The polls show of an approval rating of Trump handling this health and economic crises is incredible.  Who knew you get better approval ratings for failing to do your job."
2020-03-28 20:32,The irony is that if trump handled this well from the get-go he could have contained it and then claimed it a hoax. But he didn’t. And far right people are not immune to the virus. How many of them will die before they take it seriously?
2020-03-28 20:40,"It's not a failure to test - it's a failure of leadership.  When members of the Senate knows enough in January and February to sell stocks (and buy biotech stocks), then those members have the duty to ramp up production of supplies and ventilators while pursuing detailed screenings at airports.  They could have also built up staffing to do contact-tracing.  The fact that Trump had no idea continues the theme of his Presidency: a dereliction of duty so he can devote his time and energy enrich himself through the office of the Presidency.  Violation of the emoluments clause is enough for impeachment!  I'm not going to slowly ""adjust"" my standards downward like I'm in an abusive relationship (Republicans should not be graded on a curve, when Democrats like Bill was impeached for a personal affair!)

Now my attention turns to Republican voters:  You don't need a super high IQ, or even a college degree to know that the man in the White House only cares about himself.  Why still support him?  I suspect it is because they see a lot of themselves in him, only they don't have the power or position to thieve like him or Richard Burr.  ""Greed is good"", so their prosperity gospels say...  Imagine that...the moneychangers and Jesus as buddy-buddies.  Now in the fog of corona-war, the GOP and their true (elite) base are creating slush funds to enrich themselves!  *livid!*  We live in a ""plutocratic socialist"" state.  Heads or tails, they always win."
2020-03-28 20:52,"As noted below “not testing milder symptoms” was basically a direction from government to pressure health professionals to ration testing due to limited capability. It is being repeated around the world, in the UK, Spain, the Australian government active discouragement of testing is playing with fire, this along with misguided and untruthful information that face masks do not help are two of the catastrophic lies that have contributed disaster now unfolding in the west. At least NYT has exposed that face masks are even more effective policy than social distancing, a mild self help policy !"
2020-03-28 21:00,"What can anyone expect of people who have no governmental experience and in many cases do not believe in the mission of government to act for the greater good? Too many only know profit motive and in the end, may have killed the goose that laid the golden egg."
2020-03-28 20:05,"The Administration only has the best and smartest people onboard. And apparently, also those with the shortest attention span."
2020-03-28 20:44,"It was Trump's failure. While the warnings were coming in, he was laughing, calling it a ""Hoax"" and media/Democratic conspiracy.  He also said there were only five cases which would soon be down to one. We need a chronology of Trump's statements."
2020-03-28 20:51,"The predictions by many observers over the three years of Trump's presidency that we've been lucky he's not had to deal with a crisis because if he has to he'd be clueless and the mistakes could hurt everybody and everything.

Well it's here now isn't it and it's on display in every single response of the Trump administration. 
The death tolls overnight in Spain and the climbing toll in France with 2000 deaths so far and the UK over a 1000 deaths. 
Their government responses  haven't been perfect but compared to the US they look a lot better every day as Trump bickers with State governors and goes about the place boasting and preening and lying.

Trump does indeed own this growing disaster in the (un) United States of America."
2020-03-28 20:02,The third world like tragedy of our testing failure is that the decision to seek and only dole out infection information came from and continues to come from on high from the medical community.   From Trump I expected what I got.  From the scientists I am disappointed in the extreme.
2020-03-28 20:11,"Failure of leadership like the NYC mayor refusing to shut down NYC earlier, even when Cuomo was pushing for that?

Or the NYC health commissioner who, on Jan. 26, said: “We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives and suggest practicing everyday precautions that we do through the flu season.” She added that those “who had recently traveled from Wuhan were not being urged to self-quarantine or avoid large public gatherings.”

I read that various NYC officials continued saying that for weeks.'

I don't fault these people, but let's be honest and admit that lots of people/officials were underestimating things early on."
2020-03-28 20:29,"It is becoming more and more obvious with each passing day how Trump bankrupted six businesses.

The only question left is:  With his recent tsunami of catastrophic (and deadly) blunders, how could it have been only six?"
2020-03-28 20:42,"Look, this one is on Trump.  He hired the heads of these departments and he fired the heads of these departments.  The work or non-work of each agency that worked well or failed abominably is on Trump’s watch.  The buck does stop at Trump. He has caused the deaths of hundreds of us so far, and he will cause the deaths of thousands more of us before a vaccine is developed and deployed to put an end to this virus.  We all know that Trump will absolve himself of any blame because he is incapable of leadership, but we all know the truth — that he above all others is to blame."
2020-03-28 20:43,This comedy of errors is stunning and sadly it continues.
2020-03-28 20:45,"Oddly, Putin, may actually be presenting us with the 'data' from Russian to demonstrate the difference from a quick response and the path Trump chose. 

In the coming weeks, need to be aware the political shell game that Trump and the GOP are trying to play with the ""we will reopen in two weeks"" mantra. This is clearly something they know people will not follow but that they can later say would have ""saved the economy if we only listened to Trump."" Its a cheap attempt to pull yet another con. 

Trump's legacy is death to the masses so he can claim some fantasy about his role with the economy. Anyone who follows this madness is a threat to humanity."
2020-03-28 20:48,"we still need to improve our testing capacity! sheltering in place for months is not a solution to this crisis. ventilators are all the rage in the news but we need to increase our testing capacity massively. in california 2/3 of the of the tests are still pending -- results may not be available for another week! this is completely unacceptable. forcing, by law, citizens to waste away, closing parks and outdoor areas, taking away life, liberty can not continue. we need aggressive testing now. this country is such a joke."
2020-03-28 20:11,Retired public health nurse. : why is it I told my son several weeks ago that this would be like the 1918 flu epidemic and the experts were doing nothing?
2020-03-28 20:18,"Anyone else seriously concerned this is a deliberate effort to mask the severity of this pandemic? Greatest country in the history of the world, yet somehow can’t test its own people for a major disease."
2020-03-28 20:49,"The most important thing that could have been done is for the White House to recognize the scope of the threat and the urgency of taking overwhelming and comprehensive action. That would have eliminated the inter-agency squabbles and cut through time wasting protocols as described at the FDA.
This will come out in full eventually and land squarely in the lap of the president. Remember, nobody was more prolific on Twitter in criticizing every buck that should have stopped at Obama's oval office door than Trump."
2020-03-28 20:06,"One issue insufficiently discussed is the manner in which this administration has confiscated the TV networks. Around noon and 6 o'clock, prime news time on most days of the week, they clogged the passage of information by blocking the free press, what President Trump labels ""fake news"". They then transmitted incoherent and scattered bits of information. True, false, or misleading? Let let the viewer decide. Based on what? If a viewer chooses to switch from NBC to CNN? Same press conference. No alternative.

One network for such announcements would be sufficient. Let the news channels select one outlet each day for transmission of any press conference, place that network selection on a chyron, and allow the viewers choose which news source they wish to view."
2020-03-28 20:09,"""At the start of that crucial lost month, when his government could have rallied, the president was distracted by impeachment and dismissive of the threat to the public’s health or the nation’s economy. By the end of the month, Mr. Trump claimed the virus was about to dissipate in the United States, saying: “It’s going to disappear. ""

I was overseas in early January, when the reports started coming in from Wuhan.  I immediately changed my travel plans, gauging the amount of time to get home.  My home is both New York and Canada, I chose to go to Canada, because I know that there is a sound, connected, health care system that could deal with an epidemic.  The first person who was identified with the virus, was identified through a flu study in Seattle in early February. That study was shut down, a cruise ship was denied entry, because Trump like his numbers.  Dr. Faucia, called for more testing, but was apparently brought before the principal and got more in line with his praise and the president's actions of shutting borders...totally irrelevant, since China has already quarantined and restricted travel on many of its residents.  Then there was this curious Dr. Birx, saying that the US demanded more rigorous testing and regulations, to assure there were fewer false positives and negatives.  Really?  There are global health regulations, the EU and Canada's are stricter.  We turned down tests, and the result is we have the most cases.  Trump is responsible for this debacle."
2020-03-28 20:35,"""But he (Mr. Azar) caught Mr. Trump’s attention in part because of other credentials: After law school, Mr. Azar was a clerk for some of the nation’s most conservative judges, including Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court. And for two years, he worked as Ken Starr’s deputy on the Clinton Whitewater investigation.""
Mr. Azar should have never been given the leadership of two major, health related, federal agencies with these credentials. But I am not surprised, given the number of Scaramuccis that Mr. Trump has hired!"
2020-03-28 20:35,"It seem like just yesterday that that first coronavirus of unknown origin happened in Seattle, and then rapidly after, the 2 unknown origins in northern California, one in the same county as Travis Air Force Base where the cruise ship people were being quarantined, surprise surprise. I remember it so well because I was concerned about family members in California. And here we are, just one month later, in a totally changed world. I know Trump apologists who keep saying we have to look forward, not back (that must be something from Fox News, because I saw someone mention it here in the comments). Of course, we have to move forward as quickly as possible, but even now mixed messages coming from Trump continue to cause harm. I’m no expert, but from the very start I’ve been saying, they need to test more people. If we had acted early with stricter social distancing guidelines and more testing, and if we had a mask culture and masks available, we would have been able to take Sweden’s and South Korea’s strategy of keeping the economy open. (I remember the Surgeon General’s press conference on masks where he was close to ridiculing people for trying to get masks. If we have a shortage of masks, whose fault is that?) We had more warning than any other country. Okay, so maybe now isn’t the time for blame, but when this is all over, there will be a detailed post mortem that will show what a total failure Trump was.

 Scientists estimate that 65  % of Americans would need to contract the virus in order for resistance and lack of viable hosts to stop the spread.

Now, when he is seeing a nation angry with his lack of action, he is finally slowly reacting.
Still, after the Care Act measure was passed, he is once again attempting to take power away from a country-equal branch of government and claim power his own.
Under NO circumstances will our country be accepting of Trump taking over oversight of the funds to be issued to any entity.
We all need to voice this to our representatives and senator, say absolutely NOT. NO more power grabbing, and it smacks as bad faith in the middle of a pandemic."
2020-03-28 20:11,"Testing, testing, testing. It's always been about testing. Until anyone can get a test, for any reason, at any time, we aren't testing enough. All the data from all the tests needs to be consolidated, and then ""the numbers"" crunched, until we know what we are facing, and what resources are needed where, when. Until then we are always catching up, always reacting to events rather than being proactive.

Trump slow-walked testing because he didn't want ""the numbers"" to make him look bad. Of course Trump uses ""hunches"" and ""my gut"" to make decisions. No thanks, I think I want my health and safety to be subject to more data-driven decision making.

Ignorance is no way to fight a pandemic. And as we are discovering again, ignorance is no way to lead a country. Remember in November - show up and vote."

     I'm a physics professor who consults with NASA on ""advanced concepts"".  One of the most frustrating problems I have encountered in this work is the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome, the tendency for the NASA Centers (Johnson, Huntsville, JPL, ...) to ignore any ideas and inventions that were not developed in-house.
     It's clear that the NIH and the CDC suffer from exactly the same Syndrome.  The imperative to force the use of a locally-developed test for COVID-19, even after an initial failure, took precedence over speed in getting the testing done to head off the spread of the Corona virus.  Probably the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome by our leading scientists will lead to thousands, perhaps millions, of extra deaths from COVID-19."

How does harping on what wasn't going to help going forward and facing the actual situation today: how to mitigate or slow the spread until better solutions are available? 

There were not millions of tests available to the US, nor the spare medical personnel or administration employees to track people the way they were in South Korea, not to mention privacy laws and culture. 

By the time this hit the US, most other countries were battling for the same finite numbers of tests, equipment, ventilators. Nor did we have the numbers of trained personnel needed...

But no, he kept it under wraps over the coming election & possibly hurting his chances for a 2nd term. 

His contentious relationship with nearly everyone is coming out in very ugly & unhelpful forms.

Up until now, this made-for-television administration has been able to coast on its belief in the hubris of its ill-informed base. FOX News has led the disinformation illusion that Donald Trump is a great president, when in fact, he has absolutely no idea what he's doing. He's a third rate actor miscast in reality, and his time has come and gone. Like all shooting stars, real or metaphoric, he's burned out long before he's ever touched the ground. The Trump administration is now an administration in name only. The governors of the states have taken the lead in this battle, and Trump just stands on the stage at those briefings, looking like a middle-school-student-principal-for-a-day.

The blind desire to blame Trump, and Trump alone, will come back to haunt America.

The instinct of the ""meritocratic"" class to circle the wagons and protect itself once again is outrageous.  (After the derivatives meltdown in 2008, the Iraq War, the decision to admit China to the WTO and ship 5 million American jobs to China, the decision to join NAFTA and ship millions of American jobs to Mexico, the decision to ignore the opioid crisis until millions of working class Americans were dead, virtually all of the ""experts"" have proven themselves unworthy of trust.)"
2020-03-28 20:53,"Trump was focused on ""keeping the numbers low"" and did so by making sure that testing was virtually impossible to get (unless you are/were rich).

Trump routinely denied any problems, and even the virus until the economy was impacted, and suddenly the virus stopped being a Democrat created hoax and he switched to calling the virus a real danger to the country.

There are millions of Americans that are 10,000% sure that this whole thing is a hoax, and are not taking any steps to prevent the spread, and in some cases, are intentionally taking part in gatherings where the virus can spread.

We had a month, a whole glorious month, to prepare.  We didn't.  Well, some did.  However, the average citizens greatest resource - the US Federal Government, did as little as possible.  This is due to the complete disregard for the American public held by Trump.

Trump refused to prepare the government, and he is utterly incapable of handling a real emergency.  He is the ultimate armchair/hindsight quarterback, however when the chips are down and the 3rd most populous nation in the world needs a bold, strong leader...he has utterly failed to perform.

Everyone knew about the epidemic when Trump ordered the travel ban from China. 
If the governors and mayors had taken more personal responsibility instead of spending time ridiculing Trump and turning a blind eye to spring breaks, the U.S would not have been blind sided."

Specifically the defunded a CDC global pandemic response network in 49 countries, used by President Obama to successfully contain and treat Ebola at the source.

Trump and Congressional Republicans disbanded a Bush era program, continued by President Obama, called “Predict,” which had identified over 1000 viruses, including a strain of Ebola.

Trump-Pence and Republicans in Congress focused instead on rushing through a corporate tax cut that increased the structural annual deficits in excess of a trillion dollars to gin up the stock market. 

Didn’t last long, did it.

Trump browbeat the Fed to increase monetary stimulus a year before the Trump Virus Crisis.

As recently as two months ago, Trump wanted to cut the budgets of the CDC and NiH further.

Now the country doesn’t have enough face masks or ventilators, and trump is paralyzed to act. He only acts quickly when money is involved."

But we must learn from this and develop protocols which will proactively address future pandemics. We have the public health and medical expertise to identify and target problems but, as is blatantly obvious, our health care professionals lack essential supplies and resources. According to our president we have the greatest military in the world, the largest cache of arms, planes, etc., etc. but we have a broken and woefully underfunded health care system - CDC, HEW. NIH, all have had their budgets ravaged and cut by the Trump administration and now we see the fruits of their labor. Tragic, unavoidable  and derelict.

All hands should have been on deck immediately rather than telling the American people that everything was under control and it would go away, despite the alarm bells going off among the medical community.  Meanwhile Senator Burr and others (including Trump??) were dumping stock and investing in health care suppliers, saying one thing to the public and another thing privately.  This is a nightmare beyond what anyone could have imagined, notwithstanding the novels that were written describing a pandemic originating in Asia.  We have lost precious time during which we could have immediately ramped up testing, traced contacts, and implemented public health strategies to contain it.  Now we are trying desperately to catch up while our health care workers struggle without adequate equipment and are becoming ill themselves.  There will be many more deaths and suffering.   This is all due to Trump and those who have aided and abetted him.  What has happened to our country???  Despite all of our problems and ills, we always aspired to something better, always found a way to survive the worst.  We will somehow survive this, but only because of all the heroes whose stories will be written, but we will have paid such an unbelievably high price, some of which was preventable."

2020-03-28 21:05,"Although the incompetence and inflexibility of the government bureaucracy with regards to test was a substantial problem, a current more significant issue leading to viral amplification is the awful behavior of large portions of the United States population:   Many are not obeying the shelter in place orders or practicing distancing, and are still maintaining social activities.  They make excuses for theirselfs why they should be exempt.  Not wearing masks further contributes to infection amplification.   Local governments should impose stiff penalties to those that are not conforming similar to those in the Asian countries and Germany."

But they are not as drenched in the Trump meme because they are not in America having the falsehoods so ambient. Right away any Trumpists reading this far, is turned off by the word ambient. That is enough for them to completely dismiss what I am saying... sigh.
Anyway I was talking to a very conservative last friend by phone night and was amazed to hear him criticise Trump at last. What was the tipping point for him? The Down to Zero comment by Trump set against the100,000 COVID19US figure which is the number equal to the capacity of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He can immediately visualise how many people that is and he saw Trump saying zero and his other ridiculous comments denying the reality.
Now even more powerful than that is that his conservative wife is a nurse on an Indigenous community and has already carried out swabs on white people visiting the Aboriginal town she works in.
He is a smart guy and has suddenly started ridiculing Trump. His life is at risk through his wife. True story."

Yes, there aren't enough surgical-style masks to go around. But other countries swear by them, and Taiwan's government is pumping out 10M masks/ day for the general public. Masks clearly work. We should make it a priority to produce them, teach effective wearing to the public, and make it a cultural norm. It will be an essential part of how we manage this virus in the years to come. Our reticence now is foolish, and will be viewed as such very soon. Again, read the studies and ask why scientists, doctors and authorities in the Asian countries that are handling this crisis well, swear by mask public wearing as a key part of their mitigation strategy.

2020-03-28 21:30,"Books will be written and movies will be made about this disastrous period in our history. But, I'm glad that the details are being reported on  now as we are still in the midst of this pandemic.  This story reminds me of the same missteps that led to the 9/11 attacks: territoriality and a lack of communication and trust. Maybe it will change some minds that ""draining the swamp"" of bureaucracy is precisely the wrong action to take. What we need is a bureaucracy that is efficient and coordinated. And having someone in the Oval Office who knows how to do that would help, too."
2020-03-28 21:30,"The only tests discussed in the article involve actively shed virus. Where is an antibody test, so we find folk who are immune and may not be shedding? 

The protocol for releasing the test should be fairly simple: recognize 100% of recoveries while finding a smaller percentage in other folk -- far smaller in rural areas. Is the FDA prepared to act quickly to approve a test? A protocol should be announced and the FDA prepared to do the testing. In preparation the FDA keep track of a suitable sample so they do not have to waste time on verification or complain about a non-representative sample being used."
2020-03-28 21:32,"I work in healthcare and have had symptoms for a week which became noticeably worse on Thursday. I have been trying to reach my doctors who belong to an IvyLeague university practice. After 3 calls and several emails I talked to a nurse practitioner who advised me to stay at home. She mentioned a test would take a week / 10 days to get back with results. No one has recommended me to get tested even after calling the practice a few times. I am unable to reach any of the doctors in the practice. 

Me and my family are anxious and wish I could get tested. We think a test would be crucial for us to implement even more stringent isolation at home than we are doing now. 

CDC guidelines on health care workers using appropriate PPE during surgery are full of holes given the lack of symptoms during 2 - 14 days after infection. Anesthesiologists and other operating room staff lack proper PPE. Some apparently elective surgeries continue to be performed occupying all important ICU beds and ventilators."
2020-03-28 21:37,"I watched the experts that Trump put at the microphone.  While Dr. Fauci and a few are interested in saving lives, some seem interested in covering up the huge mistakes.  

Not testing those in the general public, who exhibit symptoms is a bombshell scandal that has yet to become apparent to many.  We cannot lift the stay-at-home orders without widespread testing of any and all of those with symptoms or who were/will be exposed.  

It is Trump’s fault that this economic setback will take as long as it takes him to accept the need for widespread testing."
2020-03-28 21:39,"As a laboratory scientist, I feel that it's important to acknowledge the years that go into developing and validating laboratory tests. There's no point in rushing a test to the market only to find that it yields too many 'false positives' (a positive result when the person doesn't have the disease) or 'false negatives' (a negative result in a person who doesn't have the disease). Both can be devastating to a patient and misleading for public health investigations. 
This coronavirus is called 'novel' for a reason: we've never encountered it before (though we've seen organisms like it). While there are protocols in place to ramp up test development, these processes don't turn on a dime. They need time to be validated and implemented responsibly. I salute my colleagues as they work behind the scenes to put accurate and valid testing procedures in place."
2020-03-28 21:54,"""Without high-level interest — or demands for action — the testing issue festered""

I think this is misleading.  There was high-level interest--in not doing adequate testing to identify infections.  Trump repeatedly discounted the number of infections publicly, or even the need for concern, all through the period this article covers.  If anyone doubts that the message from the very top was ""if there are infected people I don't want to hear about it,"" just look at his public admission of precisely that point, when he objected to allowing the cruise ship passengers disembark because it would ""make our numbers go up.""

We failed to test, and ensured disaster, because the president consistently and explicitly let it be known that he wanted us to fail.  He should be held to account."

Is there a political and religious group who don't believe they will get sick, or don't believe the pandemic is as bad as it is? What are their chances of passionately showing up at the polls? Who will that benefit.

And people think 45 doesn't have a plan. Seems to me like the gears to re-election are working very well. All the States the won't vote for him are seeing outbreaks rising and lock-downs looming. All the States that will vote for him see outbreaks rising...and don't much believe the news."

Many countries including Australia take their cues from the CDC.

I asked them to provide me with information on any studies which evaluated the use of facemasks, as a google search finds almost no studies in Western literature on the efficacy of facemasks (I think you can search Asian literature with the help of google translate, I havent done this but apparently there is research in Asian journals to show they are effective).

But the fact is our lack of vital supplies at this critical time comes from a fatal error in our strategic planning.  It is the ultimate failure of globalization and everything it stands for.

Critical medical supplies including surgical-grade masks, N95 respirators, gowns, protective eyeware, most pharmaceutical drugs, all PPE in every industry, ventilators, sterile swabs, and a whole bunch more have not been manufactured on American soil for at least two decades now.  Even the basic components needed for the COVID diagnostic assay, the reagents and such, are made abroad, all mostly in China.  When the Chinese cut off supply lines to us to keep these things for themselves in their own crisis, and when we embargoed them as well, we lost our only supply because we somehow had suddenly lost the ability to make these things overnight.  Only it was 20+ years in the making, and we let major multinational corporations talk us all into oh so easily.

""Pray to God and row to shore,"" as my sainted mother used to say.  ""International Trade"" is a fine thing for those who have nothing to keep or protect.

Want of concert in matters where common interest requires it. Authored by James Madison in the ""Vices of the Political System of the United States""

Our mutual assistance and the central coordination of efforts to overcome all adversaries is the strongest part of our ability to self-govern. 

That the current occupant of the office of President can not grasp this simple concept is the main reason he must be removed from office as soon as is possible by the people. 

We are well past the concept of political parties or partisan interests, our ability to self-govern and survive is now threatened by a clear and present danger in the form of blind partisan ignorance exhibited by a man of willful ignorance who would easily fail a basic US history test and has no knowledge of our mutual civic duty."

There were delays, tests that did not prove to be accurate and bureaucratic rules that contributed to the inability to start testing early when the virus was first found in Washington state.

However, I believe that further investigative reporting will reveal that Donald J. Trump gave a “stand down” order loud and clear to the agency heads that as little testing as possible should be done. He made it perfectly clear in the very beginning when he resisted the passengers from cruise ship disembarking because he didn’t want the numbers to go up.

Well, now we’re #1 in the world with coronavirus cases and Trump, the man who loves numbers, doesn’t brag about his accomplishment."

From the article, there were serious professional lapses in judgement from Azar, Redfield, Hahn, Schuchat, and others. In fact, given the evidence, one wonders why most of these people are in charge of anything at this point. The insistence of the US in developing its own screening test and not relying on the WHO test is reminiscent of what happened in France in the 1980s: A test for screening blood for HIV had been developed in the US, but the French refused it, waiting for its own test. As a result, blood transfusions were not screened for HIV for a time and people got infected and died."

How many epidemics must occur before we begin to be proactive rather than reactive in our actions?

Even with everything going on in the world around us, we have intelligent individuals reacting like a deer caught in the highlights - frozen, unprepared, unresponsive and simply in a constant state of denial and/or shock.

I am also reeling after learning that Trump's handling of this crisis is meeting with approval from Americans while his job approval improves.  How can our fellow citizens not see the obvious?
I am feeling abandoned by Democrat Joe Biden who has stepped deeply into the shadows, becoming far less visible than Andrew Cuomo who is not running for any office, unfortunately.

2020-03-28 21:34,"I firmly believe the failure to test for a plethora of unsound reasons coupled with the denial, arrogance and ignorance of the lapses in leadership did not blind the U.S. to Covid-19 but rather allowed the virus to spread at alarming rates to the point where containment seems almost impossible.

Failure to test AND acknowledge the seriousness and ultimate consequences of Covid-19 will continue to lead to more deaths that could have been prevented.

There is rage simmering under the chaos.  This entire crisis has been manufactured and reads like a “what not to do 101” when confronted with a pandemic. 

What’s worse ?  These agencies failed the healthcare system as well. 

We expect our nurses to step up and work without equipment or worse with unsanitary supplies while the CDC flushes its safety standards down the toilet.  

We’re expected to look the other way as we expose our families to a disease which could have very easily been contained if the virus of greed ineptitude hadn’t struck our “leaders” first.

“You can’t stop it,” he warned, “if you can’t see it.”
Dr. Aylward is correct. We need to know if the ones around us  have the virus, or not. Especially in the hospital––we need to know. There is no tele-med for us. The frontline worker is at the bedside. We are in close proximity to our patients. Some of us interact with the most vulnerable, and at risk populations. We want to protect everyone, including ourselves. Currently we check only the temperature of the health care worker prior to their shift. Is this enough? 
How long did Italy and China wait before they tested the staff? Did they not warn us? Am I mistaken? 
I ask these questions not for myself, but for my patients.
The R-naught on this is anywhere between 2.6-4.4. We just don't know the exact rate of transmission yet, but we do know it is high. We also know some of us could be asymptomatic, or have few symptoms. Would it not be prudent to test us? If we did this, we could quarantine the ones that test positive. 
It's hard for me to believe that all of us in the field have negative Covid tests, but that data we cannot study. We aren't testing unless there are symptoms, and even then it is  difficult to get tested. Italy has encouraged us to test our hospital staff. It's a salient point, a gift, and a huge game-changer that we continue to ignore."

The “Deep State” within the federal government is, or was, a corps of highly competent, dedicated public servants well versed in marshaling the resources of the government in fulfillment of public service, and these people were ESSENTIAL to effective government in both its daily activities and in times of crisis like we now face.

Political ideology and loyalty, regardless of whether or not one has  an M.D. after their name or clerked for Anthony Scalia, is no substitute for highly competent administrators who value public service.  I feel for all the Trump appointees mentioned in this piece, but respectfully, they should not have taken those jobs, as much as I know many of them are trying as best they can.  Being an oncologist does not qualify one to run a huge government agency.

2020-03-28 22:37,"Trump had the authority to expedite and extend testing when the virus was clearly likely to become a pandemic during the events in China. He did not do it for whatever reason, by choice to avoid political problems or due to complacency because he failed to anticipate what might happen next. So ultimately Trump is the one who failed."
2020-03-28 22:48,"Failure to test for COVID-19, like the rest of the Trump Team response has always been a political calculation.  It has never been about what it best for the nation.  It has always been what is best for Donald Trump, and this changes hourly.  There have been many historic moments through this pandemic, but for me the most extraordinary moments have been watching the sycophants around Donald Trump praise him during his ""State TV"" press conferences.  Each one feels like we now live in North Korea."
2020-03-28 22:53,"South Korea and the US each confirmed their first COVID 19 patient at the approximately the same time in January. South Korea responded intelligently and aggressively and at this point seem to have successfully contained the crisis. The US dawdled, delayed and denied and, with by far the most COVID 19 cases in the world, is facing an epic crisis. The Trump administration has created the playbook on absolutely the wrong way to confront a pandemic."

2020-03-28 22:12,"Thank you.  This is the detailed report that I have been awaiting.   It looks like the primary failure was in the career employees of the agencies.   The leadership failure by the political appointees was a failure to recognize the obstruction and address it with the force and flexibility that the circumstance called for.  That is what political appointees are for.   

“Dr. Hahn maintained that his agency had moved as quickly as it safely could to ensure that tests would be accurate.”   The problem with that statement is the word “ensure.”     In health care regulation I have have worked with people who love that word and use it a lot.  They are incorrigible obstructionists who refuse to recognize the lethal costs of their perfection.   The perfect is the enemy of the good.   Dr. Hahn’s job was to recognize and defeat that bureaucratic pathology, not echo it.     

In a just nation with accountability, the next question would be where he shall live in exile when expelled from the nation that he did so much to destroy by inaction.  Of course it doesn’t work that way.   He is one of the lumps floating at the top of the tank and they do well no matter what harm they do."
2020-03-28 22:22,"Americans had to have less virus carriers than China; despite the fact, China has a history of intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and human rights violations. Thus, the USA chose not to really know, like China. 

Instead of testing as many people as possible and isolating those specific people (like Iceland), the president, with the body politic's blessing, has assembled an ad hoc response. 

Now that the ""cat is out of the bag"", deaths, due to COVID-19, the Trump administration is confused as to what to do. 

If they test more Americans Trump's team will discover more people who have contracted the virus, if they wait till summer and don't test aggressively, maybe it will ""go away"". However, if they do the latter, it may also get worse. 

Trump's team should be testing more so as to isolate and quarantine, but it's a thing of national pride and saving face now. This will not end well. Especially for those in my beautiful state, Georgia."
2020-03-28 22:23,"Great reporting. The failure started as sson as Trump was elected and they pursued their extreme "" deep- state"" anti-science agenda. 

The failure to fund the restocking of critical PPE (which pre-dates, but was nonetheless exacerbated by Trump's policies),  the failure to appoint experts in key positions, the failure to take the warnings of numerous experts seriously and the tendency to look at individuals through a highly political rather than a competency lens,  the dismantling of the NSC office dedicated to pandemic response , the firing of its competant director, and the rescission of   its funding, are just some of the devastating decisions that have contributed to the U.S. leading the world in having the worst response to date of any country.

At the head of this is a leader that is wholly incompetant, and looks at the crisis soley through the lens of his own personal political interests, a party that refuses to remove him to save the country and, a public that is so misinformed that a majority believe he is doing a good job. 

We already have the most cases ( and the numbers are of course much larger), in a matter of weeks we will have, by a wide-margin, the highest death toll. And our econmy will be in shambles.

As an expert in disaster response, it is unimaginable that we have put ourselves in this position given the resources, the expertise, and the planning that has gone into preparing for such an event. It is wrenching to watch and it did not have to happen."

2020-03-28 22:25,"Unless you have serious symptoms, testing for COVID-19 does not make much sense!  Testing does not prevent or cure the infection.  Social Distancing is a temporary measure."
2020-03-28 23:06,"The key lesson from these - unfortunately still early - dropped balls must be to be open to breaking with established healthcare paradigms in the US. While most of the attention is on diagnostics tests today, there are other paradigms we may have to break with that can be equally or even more significant to get the pandemic under control. Most notably, the concept of asymptomatic cases not being infectious - or, nota bene, cases  undetectable by tests  don't infect others. Inexplicably, our medical professionals still don't think that the general population should wear surgical masks, while Eastern Asian countries where the use of masks is widespread year round, experience no or much less uncontrolled outbreaks (for instance Japan with one of the highest population density in the world, exposed to the virus early on). What this suggests is an efficient transfection by asymptomatic cases that could be well mitigated by the general use of surgical masks."
2020-03-28 23:00,"How blind could we be, to the urgency of recognizing a developing epidemia, and doing something about it? Official rigidity, and the fear of crossing a vulgar bully's ego, unable to hear, and listen, bad news, nor be contradicted, let alone criticized, made for a comedy (tragedy, actually) of errors...that the U.S. population is paying dearly. What is galling is Trump's ongoing braggadoccio about his 'perfect response' to this crisis, against all evidence. Similar to his arrogant demand of being exonerated from a legitimate impeachment for trying to sell the nation's security...with foreign help, to make it easier to re-assault the presidency again. All this with the complicit approval of the sold-out G.O.P.  So, how to explain that something as 'simple' as the idea of early and frequent 'testing', so to know the spread of the coronavirus and it's contagion for lack of social distancing, in such an advanced country, before it was too late...but for the crying?"
2020-03-28 21:52,"This only confirms that career officials in government agencies were largely to blame, and not the Trump appointees.  While Trump should be held accountable, as well as the people he picked to head the agencies, top scientists and administrators failed when the consequences of not doing their jobs well counted most.
Further proof that Trump's incompetence is not the primary cause can be seen by looking at Europe. Not just one country, but nearly every major power has failed spectacularly in a similar manner, with even greater consequences (Italy, Spain, France).
In New York, it was obvious that the governor and mayor, especially in the absence of adequate testing, should have acted sooner, closing the bars and restaurants, schools, enforcing social distancing, and most of all getting the media and public to understand what no testing meant. They didn't, because evidently their top advisers didn't explain the likely consequences, even with Italy already crashing.
Where was the media? Why is the New York Times doing a story on testing now, instead of two months ago, or one month ago, if this was obvious to experts?
Either no one could know, or the New York Times at least should have known it's importance. This paper, with all it's resources, and access to top scientists, did not.

2020-03-28 23:12,"Now that the United States is importing and manufacturing tests, the important question is how we will use them. 

Will we use them to identify infections in individuals at their earliest stages and isolate them before they infect anyone else? This will require aggressive testing through contact tracing and rigorously quarantining those who test positive in an effort to contain the virus. 

Or will we use them only after people show symptoms so we can use the results to plan their treatment? Combined with social distancing, this can flatten the curve. But if we don't aggressively test people and identify those who are positive and asymptomatic, we are going to eventually infect 20 to 40 percent of the population until we presumably acquire herd immunity.

The first strategy will require a massive mobilization of public health workers and volunteers. The second strategy will result in a huge number of deaths (at least 1 percent of 20 percent of the population, or 600,000 people).

The most important task for our national leaders is to pick a strategy, mobilize the nation, and execute it."

Recently I watched “Contagion”, which is quite disturbing since the virus in that movie is much deadlier than coronavirus. Afterwards, I had to calm down by reminding myself that the movie was not real, just fiction. Another evidence that “Contagion“ was fiction: in the movie, the CDC actually did their job."

The cat was out of the bag in the United States by January 20th. What might have helped was China shutting its own borders to air/sea/land traffic in early January, but it was not willing to take that hit alone. Instead, the world got hit.

For instance:
The democrats insisted that there be oversight over the dismemberment of the $ 500 billion in the 3rd bailout bill. At the time trump said he would be the oversight, no oversight  needed, with a straight face!

Now just after the signing of the bill the president has stated via signing statement, he has no intention of being held to the oversight established in the bill. 

Can there be any clearer evidence of who stands for what?

Now all the public has to do is connect the dots. It is true that some horrors are so unbelievable that most will simply not believe their own eyes. Other dictators have made good use of this psychological condition.

Other related observations: some  $750 billions for the so called defense dept. and yet no provisions for the basic needs of a nation facing this sort of pandemic?  Not to mention basic health care for each and every one us. How about we divert half of the defense budget to that end?

This hold true for not only his conduct relative to the CDC and or pandemic committee on the NSC, but also for any other agency that might provide oversight of his administration, in all it's illegality.

2. The time to stand up the testing kits was not after the fact, it was prior to the fact. The administration had prior warning, not only from the events in China, but also from the intelligence warning of a coming tsunami, months before the virus reached the U.S.

What is stunning about persons attempting to defend the president, or shift blame to the federal government regulations, is that they refuse to acknowledge any of the malfeasance of the president, though it is happening every day.

He runs the federal gov. He and his crony in the justice dept. B.Barr, have argued that he has almost unlimited power. Yet when the situation demands it, he is front and center misleading, deceiving, and generally thinking about his poll numbers. At the same unable to act in a coherent manner.

It would have been better in fact if he were completely AWOL, leaving it to the experts to call the shots."
2020-03-28 23:12,"The 'German/WHO test' methodology is published online. All 297 known Covid-19 samples tested +ve. The test discriminated completely against related animal Coronavirus (including bat variant). NO significant false +ve reactions were obtained with control samples containing other common human respiratory viral pathogens. Weak/equivocal false +ve reactions were obtained in 4/297 (1.35%).

Check for yourself. The German paper (Berlin Institute of Virology with British, French, Dutch and Swiss co-authorship) is easily accessible.

Firstly we heard that the WHO test was unacceptably inaccurate. Now the excuse is that the CDC test was 'potentially more accurate'. A smokescreen for inactivity and complacency, I reckon."
2020-03-28 23:23,"The article states that, after Pence was anointed to be the guy in charge, the “testing has ramped up quickly, with nearly 100 labs at hospitals and elsewhere performing it.” What? Right after that sentence, the article continues to explain that not everyone can get a test, at least if one’s symptoms are milder.  i think the authors overstate whether testing has truly “ramped up.” A simple google search would produce many articles that explain that testing still lags behind in certain areas (e.g., Texas). The authors’ own statement that tests aren’t always available undermines the premise that testing has ramped up. With so many authors for this article, one would think that someone would have caught this unsupported characterization of the status of testing."
2020-03-28 23:26,"Spent more than three decades developing  medical tests. I just looked at the CDC's latest protocol for testing COVID-19. IT IS NOT A COMPLICATED TEST and except that the samples are quite hazardous the actual testing could be done by any competent undergraduate student. What I see is that rather than trying to solve a problem, they chose to try to prove that the CDC is the only standard and the public health labs must be incompetent for being unable to get that kit to work. And the FDA left it to the CDC to just go on believing that. Any testing lab given an option would have switched to a method that gave better results. There was a option, the WHO method. Except in the USA. Such arrogance in the CDC and FDA is criminal."

Once the sequence of virus was  publicly available, it was a simple matter of applying well-established quantitative PCR technology.  A first year grad student could have designed the test in a day.  The FDA regulatory issues for laboratory developed tests are a red herring.  Enforcement of the regulations could have been quickly suspended .  All signs point to incompetent management.

If testing was not happening for technical or political reasons, there could be still other ways to delay or address the spread (e.g. early introduction of social distancing, public education, procurement of PPE).

This seems to me to be a backward approach. Those admitted to the hospital ought to be treated presumptively as though they're COVID-19 positive. It's the mildly ill patients who are being discharged back into the community who are the highest risk to the population at large. They are the ones who ought to be tested.

Hospitals arrive at these policies to protect hospital staff. We need to advocate for population-level protection.

We really need to be thinking about case detection, case isolation, and population-level screening and tracking."

The Chinese just started returning health people who were originally quarantined about 2 weeks ago. That is right - if people passed quarantine time without symptoms China still kept them separate in semi-quarantine...because they were then known either NOT to be exposed (or naturally immune)."

This could not be more serious, as people are dying because of the lack of early testing. The White House knew that the virus was coming months before it arrived. Trump's lies were to keep the stock market up to protect his rich friends from financial loss. Trump's response such as it is has been, has been a debacle.

What if we knew that there weren't any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, would we have invaded?

This story reminds me of that, because had Trump not disbanded the Global Health Security office at the National Security Council, I am certain a plan would have been on the shelf for this pandemic. (I am a retired Foreign Service Officer.)

However, in the past few weeks my anger has been leavened with pity, as I see a man totally unable to rise to the occasion flail about, trying to deal with a situation that is totally beyond his capabilities.  Meanwhile, the country that we all love is on the brink.

In other words, the CDC test is STILL not working properly. 

So, the CDC wouldn’t use the WHO test because it only used 2 probes while the CDC test had THREE. In the end, the CDC ended up using only 2 probes anyway because the third one never really worked.

I am concerned that it is the latter, and that there are too points of view in this country over what is a scientific phenomenon is what's truly scary."

In scientific terms we describe this as specificity. However what was needed was not so much specificity but rather, sensitivity, (i.e. the ability to pick up truly positive specimens even if some might not be truly positive) thereby reducing the possibility that positive specimens would be missed. The irony is that the third genomic probe developed by the CDC was determined to be ""inconclusive"" thereby fomenting confusion over the entire test and causing delay in testing at a time when expediency was paramount."

We need  a more robust disease control system which works independent of who are in charge, when such pandemic or epidemic occurs. An emergency plan should be kicked with or without the few top people's permission, like relaxation of regulations testing, voice/power of CDC takes over the role. How come we don't hear any voice/warning publicly from any epidemiologists about the pandemic? We almost thought we were fine. People were not alerted at all, traveling around under risk. The spreading would be a lot less severe if we could be alerted and travel less even with no sufficient tests available.

2020-03-29 1:37,"As a physician on the front line trying to get patients tested, I can assure you the that the availability of testing has been critically limited for the past 6 weeks by something as mundane as a lack of  Dacron swabs and viral transport media. In order to collect a specimen to send to a reference lab (Labcorp, Quest, et al) a sterile plastic (not wood or paper) shaft stick with a synthetic ( Dacron or Nylon) tuft has to be fully inserted into the patient's nostril. The swab is then placed in a solution (viral transport media) in a plastic test tube which is capped and chilled and sent to the reference lab. One month ago, I could find no viral collection swabs or viral transport media to purchase anywhere, all supplies were back ordered at least 2 weeks from all suppliers - this is not ""toilet paper,"" folks. This is how we track this disease. What use is having labs with capacity to test ""X"" number of specimens per day when there is no way to get a specimen to the lab. We are still restricted by these supply deficiencies. We don't have enough testing supplies at this time to re-test someone who tested positive in the oupatient setting to ensure that they no longer test positive. Instead the public health department has had to offer a second alternative - assume they are no longer contagious once they are symptom free for 72 hours, and are at least 7 days past their onset of symptoms. Evidence from China suggests that those with COVID-19 may shed virus for 14 to 37 days...."

This from the mouth  of a man who just a day ago stated that the problems of New York were being overstated by the Governor of New York.

Could it be he is trying to punish, intimidate, and or coerce officials who might criticize his actions as the man in charge but who has not the slightest clue what he is doing? Very likely the case. A pattern of conduct with hundreds of examples.

Another very large problem with bringing up the history and the facts is that his blind followers will become all the more defensive and enraged to the extent he is held responsible for anything.

A kind of mania to be sure. Certainly working against their best interests as has been noted in many places.

Many of Trump’s followers are as dedicated to him as were the followers of those cult leaders.  They will willingly drink the Kool-Aide.  That was often used metaphorically, now it has become a direct threat.  Trump would rather lead them to their death than admit that he is mistaken. 
Trump will continue to blame others, deny responsibility, and issues irrational, often fatal solutions unless someone shuts him down.

That is why I am urging the NYT, the Governors of US states, other politician, judges, the press, anyone and everyone with power to stand-up directly and stop Trump.  The Republicans thus far seem incapable of raising a question or criticism.  They see that he craves “appreciation.”

3. Delay in testing, as mentioned in this article. Please go check how many test kits were being prepared per day in South Korea when they only had 1 case, 10 cases, and 100 cases. 
4. Prejudice against Asian countries due to their political systems and being dismissive of the drastic actions they had taken. How can NYC not have already been under martial law style hard shutdown like Wuhan?

Yet, Trump is not telling Americans the ideal target of new daily cases to flatten the curve, and sacrifices needed to hit the goal. As a result, the nation is not building consensus on our central existential threat and is not being prepared on how we must change to address it. This is beyond irresponsible and inept. It is starting to look like a crime scene."
2020-03-29 0:31,"Call it like it was from the outset - in late January when Democrats were raising concerns Trump called it a ""Democratic hoax"".  And his tweets were even worse denials of the potential threat.  Then he from his podium told, ""everything is under control"".  Don't give him a pass!  ANY other president, democrat or republican would have led with science by his side and martialed forces to have us much better prepared. Failure to call him out or make him accountable for his untruths and false statements only emboldens him to create more of a problem for the nation."

Has no more to do with politics than it does with ethnic heritage, but it does strongly relate to organizational ineffectiveness, for which governments are infamous, with their very rare positive outcomes due to chance, are rare, hence so newsworthy.

2020-03-29 1:14,"Donald J. Trump's words of wisdom on testing: “Interestingly, if you go back—please—if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t do testing like this. And actually, they lost approximately 14,000 people. And they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late,” --(Press briefing on March 13.) Based on this article, failure to test was the original sin in the federal government's response. Looks like many thousands of Americans will die as a result, and the economic loss is not even possible to estimate at this point."
2020-03-28 23:36,It took about 10 days for competent hospitals to set up the PCR test.  This should have been initiated in January when China quarantined. There is simply no excuse for the CDC's failure and the WH failure to recognize this.
2020-03-29 1:47,"When you combine the problem in developing a working test and the refusal to recognize that the virus was already here in February with no testing being done to discover this fact, it almost feels that there was a deliberate desire to validate Trump’s false claims at the time.  Now we read that the CDC released sick cruise ship passengers into the Atlanta airport, because the virus was already out in the community and these people needed to get home.  This is why we are now the country with the most cases of Covid-19."
2020-03-29 2:34,We would be in very different place if CDC scientists hadn't messed up and delivered the number of tests they said could be delivered in time.

2020-03-29 2:30,"This whole article reads like an series of excuses to let President Trump off the hook. 18 months ago Trump and Bolton fired the Epidemic Response Team the previous administration had established to deal with these exact circumstances. Trump refused the WHO test kits, and held  up testing hoping to be able to make a test his son-in-law could patent and profit from, all the while telling the country he thought the virus was a hoax, or a plot by the Democrats to disrupt the election. Anyone who has paid any attention to public health in the 21st century would have told the President the key to controlling this thing is early widespread testing, but Trump hires people on the basis of personal attraction, rather than expertise, and apparently no one left in the administration who could see the writing on the wall had the gumption to speak the truth. Nancy Pelosi forced his hand and out maneuvered Mitch McConnell to get some financial assistance for the out of work people and suffering small businesses, but only at the price of another big pot of money for corporate handouts. As far as I am aware, he still has not triggered that disaster funding, he is refusing to pay for ventilators, and he tried to make himself feel better by calling Governor Whitmer of Michigan ‘that woman’  and telling VP pence not to return her calls, while the hospitals in Detroit are filled beyond their capacity with untested COViD 19 patients. Trump’s failures are killing people."

-Can't get much worse than that in sixty days time .

2020-03-29 2:42,"The virus is the invisible enemy. This is a repeated refrain from our President. Listen to him over and over soliciting our understanding of the monumental task of confronting an invisible enemy (true). But the virus was and is not invisible in Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and other countries that effectively tested and illuminated the enemy. When the President says our enemy is invisible (true) you must know that he was the one who turned off the lights and destroyed our lives."
2020-03-29 2:47,"A test that only answers one question -- ""is this person presently infected? -- isn't very useful when we have little idea of how long a victim has actually been contagious, and whether pneumonia will ensue. In addition, what's the value of testing only those with obvious symptoms, and refusing everyone else? Useless data.
Acquired immunity is another big question mark.
And there are many helpful research findings coming out of China, but no, the Washington take is ""why trust anything they tell us; they're always lying"".

In Germany, as soon as they detected the first case in Bavaria, they identified the source and took immediate action. In the US, we were aware of corona in December but 4 months later, there is still no comprehensive plan of attack. Our response is chaotic.

So what’s the difference? Germany has a functional government whereas the US suffers a circus clown who lives in his own little world, aided and abetted by criminals who would see us die as long as they can hang onto power and ransack the nation’s wealth.

New Orleans is in utter chaos and that chaos is rapidly spreading across America. The only question left is how many people will die before we correct the obvious problem?"
2020-03-29 2:23,"Ineffectual initial government responses  at CDC, FDA and the Trump administration have placed the US population at huge risk from the coronavirus. Lack of a pandemic response team at Homeland security,axed by this administration, contributed as well. The first rule of public health is - prevention, prevention, prevention, and lacking adequate testing, this became impossible in the US. Historians will have their hands full detailing the multiple breakdowns in our agencies that caused this nightmare scenario to progress the way it has. Recent works on the Chernobyl disaster come to mind."
2020-03-29 2:55,"The battle cry of this administration is to tear it all down and have limited government with strong industry ties. It's not just the names in this article, it's the other high ranking federal employees from HHS that left when the administration changed. It was years of sequestration under Obama, and no budget increase with HHS being asked to do more.  Industry is important in the response, but once again if the heads of the agencies are not familiar with policy and the process of enacting a response, then it is too little too late.

 Although the response could have been stronger, this virus would still be spreading, albeit a lower rate. Only countries that had the specter of SARS in their memories and went through this drill with H5N1 and H7N9 were prepared enough."

2020-03-29 2:47,"This was a medical emergency handled by executives and politicians and not by doctors who have experience solving actual problems.  The executive at the top -- where the buck stops -- was Donald Trump.  Trump dictated the approach that would suit his reelection requirements and none of his minions had the courage to openly criticize.

How any realistic scientist, after watching what was going on in China with the superhuman measures to stop the growth of the virus, could possibly not be terrified at the lack of data as an indicator of what is going on is absolutely stunningly awful.

No terror.  No urgency. Those are the telltale signs of inexperienced executives who have either never been in laboratories or have forgotten what they are.  The hunger for data is the mark of a scientist.  Shunning data as our Administration has done and continues to do is the mark of politicians, who ALL need to be removed from their jobs ASAP."
2020-03-29 1:55,"After reading this article - a very thorough one at that - I am infuriated.  The incompetence and ignorance of this complete administration borders on criminal.  

I just read that the first infant has died and now our dead are doubling every two days with no end in sight.  The US could have 6 million dead in one month if everything keeps on going as it is now.   I do not believe we are being told the truth about how  perilous our situation is which is even more infuriating.

By early January it was clear that COVID-19 was destian to become pandemic and will cause major stresses on health care system every and economic disaster. Foe weeks there was no clear leadership in the White House. CDC should have looked to South Korea and Germany for a reliable test rather trying to have an American test.

And we really need to insist that Trump be tested “again” for the coronavirus, this time having the test—including the obtaining of the specimen—documented by a third party. [Why? There is truly no trust in this man Trump and his protecting sycophants.]

Anthony Fauci would be a good choice as the documenting third-party. He personally oversees the swabbing of Trump and the continuous verifying that the specimen is tested and reported accurately.

He has proudly pointed to his ability to cut through red tape, but when the chips were down he failed miserably and the whole country is suffering.

China gave us the tools to create an accurate test by giving us the virus's DNA in January and hospitals quickly created tests, but the arrogant power dynamics at the top made implementing them impossible as personal egos took charge.  But Trump was too busy trumpeting his victory over impeachment and Congress to notice that the country was going down the drain.

There are many figures in this piece, but it is the President  who is ultimately responsible for the key stone cops handling of this crisis."
2020-03-29 3:15,"Excellent article, thank you for your efforts.  My takeaway is that the pandemic was basically due to two factors.  One, a president who didn't want any bad news that might lose him the election, never mind the human costs.  Two, appointees who had neither the political skills not the medical background to handle the problem quickly and efficiently.  Appointees put in their positions by the aforementioned president.  So I guess there is really just one factor.  The same factor that has been trying to destroy this country since January 2017."
2020-03-29 3:07,"The story is very old and simple:  The sentinels hired to keep watch for the pandemic were relived of their duty or demoted.  

When the invader came, there was no one to cry the alarm.  When others cried in alarm who were not sentinels, they were not listened to because they were not sentinels.

Thus, the invader entered freely, and before the population knew it, they were at the invader's mercy."
2020-03-29 3:33,"If you don't test you'll never know the exact numbers and it's easier to deny. There was enough warning this thing was coming, I think it was all over the place starting at the first of the year, and a lot of what we thought were flu deaths were from covid. We should have had mass test kits ordered and being used with the first warnings."
2020-03-29 5:23,"Excellent work.  Thanks for the authentic American journalism.  I was puzzled on understanding what the CDC wanted to achieve using the extra third ""probe"" sequence for increased specificity.  With the third ""probe"", the result was not conclusive then why the WHO method with only first two probes worked fine and eventually adopted by the CDC for testing Americans.  What correlation was missing with the results of the extra probe?  Also, why the initial tests were so narrowly restricted to people who had recently traveled to China or had been in contact with someone who had the virus?  It seems that there are more work ahead."
2020-03-29 6:27,"One day after all this is over someone might finally explain to me what happened with testing. I'm a doctor in Oakland, California. My whole community health center still has only 170 tests. We are still only testing those at high risk. Your article makes it sound like the problem has been solved, but there are still no tests. I'm watching New York really ramp up testing, but no one even talks about it anymore because we know it is not coming. When we do test the results take over a week to come back. Without a result it is very hard to convince people to quarantine away from their families and very quickly families get infected too. Thanks for this article. It is so sad so many people will die because people couldn't get their act together."
2020-03-29 6:42,"Good article. It is the basis for taking corrective action to be prepared for the next one.  After reading this piece, it seems to be the early denial of how virulent and deadly this virus is was a serious mistake.

Now, we have to ride this out and invest in preparedness and researching a vaccine.   I am still thinking this horror story through but I think we should also invest in more research into how the immune system operates and determine if there are therapies or additives to our diet that can strengthen the human immune system.  I hope the N.I.H. is sponsoring research grants to explore why the immune system weakens with age.  Also, I think one Nobel Laureate has explored this issue, sort of making old cells younger."
2020-03-29 6:49,"On March 19 I have read on the NYTimes an article written by Richard Perez Pena:
""Virus Hits Europe Harder Than China. Is That the Price of an Open Society?"". I quote a section of the article that made me think back then, and gives me a bittersweet smile now: ""To some extent, experts say, Europeans are paying a price for living in open, affluent democracies, where people are used to free movement, easy travel and independent decision-making, and where governments worry about public opinion. Governments aren’t used to giving harsh orders, and citizens aren’t used to following them.""
The entire western world ;Europe in the first place, followed by The U.K and The USA, later on, should have realized that is not a matter of how open or how locked a society should be: a raging pandemic doesn't care about boarders, or political compass. The real problem is how a government acts or reacts under an emergency circumstance. 
Both Europe and the USA are dealing with the same issues: lack of tampons and ventilators. It's time to stop the pandemic rather than fight over it."
2020-03-29 6:54,"Because this pandemic involved illness with delayed onset, a large portion of asymptomatic or presymptomatic but contagious victims, and difficult to perform testing with limited specificity, the public health approach required a deep grasp of scientific principles, scrupulous analysis, and sound planning with only regard for the safety and health of the general public.

We do not have such leadership in our government today."
2020-03-29 8:36,"In Germany we are used to criticize our bureaucracy as typical German. Having lived in the US for 17 years I always was surprised  finding bureaucracies everywhere. This analysis about testing is shocking. While in the US 100 people were tested, here already over 10 000 were tested daily. Now it’s 500000 weekly. Why is that possible? Any lab that was technically able to perform tests did so using the WHO test kit. This number will increase further because they work 24/7 and  now also veterinary labs will be involved. 

Though we have a very high number of intensive care beds and even take patients from Italy, Spain, Swiss and France, our  biggest problems now are protective gear and people. China is the Monopolist who decides who gets what and how much. My biggest wish for the future is, when this nightmare is over, that we take  production and jobs back into our countries."
2020-03-29 9:47,"Because of the lack of testing real cases might be twice as much as official figures suggest. Here in Spain we are going through the same situation. Authorities were always a few steps behind and the first measures came tepid and late. The only good news is that, as many cases are not reported, the percentage of deaths is much lower than what official figures show. Oh! And that air pollution sank to the minimum."

And number two, has absolutely no experience holding public office, or trusting anyone other than himself to make all decisions. Mix in extreme narsicism and insecurity assuaged only by the incessant bestowing of bogus praise on him by everyone around him, and we have a formula for disaster. The only thing worse would be if the virus victims became zombies when stricken."
2020-03-29 6:30,"Yes, discouraging words all around about testing that was not done in time to contain those infected, especially not yet showing significant symptoms.

This is the bizarre twinning of the worst and the supposedly best. DJT is the worst president in the history of this country and now a contender in world history. But the more inexplicable failures have been by the so-called experts. 

We're supposed to fawn on Fauci and Birx, and yes, they're appreciably better than DJT, but they aren't on top of this. They've been in place since Jan. 29th and have yet to turn to him and tell him he's categorically wrong. Time, energy, resources and expertise have been squandered on tepid suggestions and ameliorating the president's fatally wrong ""information."" That doesn't even address the flawed and missing tests. 

I've wondered for some time if one of our mistakes is in over-complicating and being too reliant on specialized knowledge. To prepare for this pandemic, all one had to do was read about the 1918 one. I have and called  on these pages for lock down in early Jan. You can't quarantine after the fact, a we are learning in the bitterest way imaginable. Once an pandemic takes hold, it's self-evidently much too late. 

Some governors, again not the medical experts, seemed to grasp this much sooner than Fauci and Birx did. Ohio shut down fast and hard and our numbers are 1/10 of neighboring states.

Coupled with this has been an illogical belief that America is impervious to any threats by way of some divine intercession.  There are far too many people who cannot understand that simply denying uncomfortable truths will not make them go away.

Hubris also plays a major role in the failure to grasp the magnitude of the crisis facing us, as professionals insisted that institutions could not fail in dealing with the situation.  No one wants to admit that the roof leaks, especially when the sun is shining.  This article takes a hard look at the response to a well-defined threat, and some of the ways that response fell short.

Pointing fingers may make us feel better, but it does nothing to remedy the problem.  What is needed more is some self-examination.  Who let things get this bad?"

Scientists have long been studying the microbial threats of zoonotic spillover. The NIH and other civilian and military agencies, as well as private entities, have been developing biodefense strategies to prevent emergence and mitigate impact. Dr. Fauci is the public face science in the service of healthcare. He is the tip of the spear. The Trump administration had a full quiver. Which in its animus towards  science and government, and its arrogant incompetence, it disdained, derided, and dismissed.

It is too easy to say, here was a failure of testing. Here is an unmitigated failure of leadership, in which the entire apparatus of the Republican party is complicit. The frivolous chaos of the Trump White House, the unconscionable inaction it promoted, and the predictable panic it inspired, caused the disastrous humanitarian and economic crises that have overtaken our nation.

It was inevitable that America would be Trump's 7th bankruptcy. Who knew how prescient Trump's boast was, that he could get away with killing people on 5th Ave. It's happening right now.

Science can explain and protect us from pandemics. Who can explain and protect us from the devolution of the Republican party and the cult of personality that has developed around Trump? Seriously."

Of course they provide protection.  The CDC and this administration saying masks aren't needed unless a person is ill is absurd beyond belief. 

And it's caused confusion as well as yet another deep divide in our country.  This time between those who wear masks and those who think only health care workers should wear them.

If everyone wore masks (and gloves) - especially grocery workers and and customers - we would all be so much safer."

Four partners of cotton warehouse shared a cat with each taking care of one leg of the cat and related areas. Once the cat got hurt in a leg and the partner, say P1, put a cloth band aid. Unfortunately the cat got that bandaid in fire and while trying to escape it spread the fire to the whole warehouse and burnt it down. 

Partners 2-4 sued partner P1 for causing the damage because of the leg he took care of. However, the judge asked for reconciliation because the three good legs of those partners were the reason cat could run around and cause the burning down of the warehouse!

The Trump Administration's response to this Crisis has been weak, flip-flopping, and more than empty, to say the least.

So ... now, even though we cannot ""turn back the Clock""  (to pre-Virus days that used-to-be!), can America's EPA at LEAST protect our Nation's clean water quality, so we don't get increasing Virus Diseases like the ""One"" from Wuhan ? That Virus was created from beyond filthy water conditions, coupled with beyond filthy livestock habitat. Does America want to relax EPA standards, and copy that Danger ?

I am NOT anti-Chinese, and it hurts me to hear of Chinese/Americans being treated poorly in their local neighborhoods.  I AM anti- ""the Chinese Government"";  AKA; the Chinese Communist Party.  From what I have read , the Doctor who warned the World of this enormous Crisis was ""detained"" on December 2nd of last Year by the CCP, and results or ""News"" of his findings were delayed, as Xi Jinping wanted to ""save face"" for the CCP., before acting.  And now, he's trying to act like the ""leader & savior"" of the whole thing.   Hogwash .  Heaven help the Ethnic Minorities locked in Prison in Xi's ""Transformation Camps"" in Eastern Tibet.

Obama team handling of Ebola could have had completely different results had they dithered and reacted slowly but since they contained it, even though right wing media including trump himself, second guessed and criticized him constantly, no one noticed because the results were positive. Likewise, the financial crash and recession could easily turned into a worldwide depression but with minimal cooperation from republicans, the problem was contained and the economy back on track.

If he doesn't exactly hold direct responsibility for each and every death, he would certainly, in a court of law, be charged with criminal negligence. 

Even now, if we had already developed and distributed a test for antibodies (revealing how many have had subclinical infections), we could say who was immune, therefore who could take care of patients with confidence, who could go back to work.

But ya, it spread becasue of not enough tests."
2020-03-29 5:11,"I sincerely hope that in due course there will be a reckoning and accountability for this catastrophe. 

The worst thing that could happen is for a 'return to normal' without a deeply focused reassessment of what our priorities really are as a global civilisation ... and the alteration of our course and direction accordingly.  

But before that, what do we think is going to happen in Africa - indeed in any of the countries we like to label as under-developed. 

I don't think their impending plight is what Darwin had in mind when he talked about survival of the fittest."
2020-03-29 6:04,"It is hard to believe that initial reports of the rapid spread of the virus in Wuhan didn't set off alarms among White House officials.  It makes them look obtuse or clueless.  When we needed proactive movers and shakers, the equivocators prevailed, including a leaderless president.  This is what happens when the chief executive is more concerned about optics than hunkering down and solving problems.  Even today, Trump arranged for a photo-op in front of a hospital ship bound for New York and exaggerated its significance.
He is more interested in promoting the image of a leader than actually leading in a positive way."
2020-03-29 11:07,"Ultimately the responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Republican Party and the American electorate in putting a President in the White House who is incapable of providing the leadership required.   There were clear indications of his inadequacies throughout his campaign in  2015 and 2016, yet they did not take heed.  Unfortunately, he is unable to grow and develop as a leader.  As this article highlights, his appointments to posts are not always guided by sagacious decision-making.  I do not know what was on the curriculum in the late 1960s when President Trump was a student at the Wharton School of Business; however a 2019 online article entitled 'Which Leadership Style Is Best for Your Team?' gives  wise advice, including this warning:  'Narcissistic Leadership: The Style to Avoid.'"
2020-03-29 11:10,"The Trump administration negligent response to this crisis brings to full view their deeply rooted incompetence. Their decision making based on hunches rather than facts forged a chain of poor judgements, and reinforced a chaotic and destructive outcome. As a result, not only will ordinary citizens like myself suffer, but some of our country's best people, scientists, doctors, nurses and essential citizens will be harmed the most."
2020-03-29 11:24,"Look no further than your mailbox to see the cravenness of government agencies toward the president. Of course, the CDC published and mailed in big bold letters:  “President Trump's Coronavirus Guidelines for America"", which in reality, was a free campaign mailing for Trump.

If the CDC is willing to stoop to the level of distributing propaganda for the president, it is no surprise that they were not clearly enough sounding the warning bells and forcing Trump into early action- or, simply taking action on their own. Now, they are misleadingly crediting Trump for actions he failed (and is still failing) to put in place. 

As this article makes clear, inexperienced appointees, many with political rather than public health motives, combined with Trump's top-down-fear-based leadership, is now costing lives and livelihoods."
2020-03-29 5:03,"Small note:  The president had no business being distracted by impeachment in February; the senate voted on January 31st.  Afterward, I think it could justify be said it was his job to look out for the country, at least half of it, instead of himself."
2020-03-29 9:48,We are where we are.  We messed up and there will be time for handwringing and finger pointing.  We need home testing kits or Abbott's 5 minute test ramped up and available everywhere.  The approvals are done and now the private sector needs to go whole hog and make it available everywhere.
2020-03-29 10:40,"Negligence at its best. Why is the Department of Health led by a lawyer? They are not good problem solvers, they are experts in complicating problems. His experience in Eli Lilly is irrelevant!"
2020-03-29 5:06,"From the beginning, Trump has treated this pandemic reactively, rather than proactively.

 He diminished it's scale from the outset.  He said COVID-19 was like ""the flu"". 

He trivialized it, calling it ""the China Virus"", in his xenophobic manner. 

He deflected & diverted, talking about ""the economy"" and how it’s ""…over by Easter"".

He delayed, by (1) not renewing the Pandemic preparedness program (sent to him  on June 05, 2019), (2) by not testing  and (3) by his failure to invoke the Defense Production Act, in a timely fashion, to make masks, gloves and ventilators. 

He is even now in complete denial.  He has told Americans ""I am not responsible.""

Now, because he has no leadership skills, all Americans are in reactive mode.   We are simply following in Trump's chaotic footsteps."
2020-03-29 5:50,"One information is missing in the article: German virologists developed a test in mid January and the WHO declared the test a good standard for the virus.  Germany sent out these tests and the formula worldwide to provide it to other countries., so this test was available from mid January and is being used in every country except China and the USA. I don't know why the USA refused to just import the German test. Must be about politics or money.  
(Source for this information is the podcast from Prof.  Drosten, Director of Virology at the Charite Berlin)"
2020-03-29 6:24,"And Trump continues to hamper the states' efforts to combat the pandemic with unconscionable abusive tweets of states' governors and commands to the ""czar"" to not respond to their calls for help.

This is a ""fail"" as Fauci said, in more ways than one."
2020-03-29 8:33,"This article fails to mention one of the key reasons for this failure of leadership at the top.  Under normal  circumstances in a normal administration, CDC leaders  would have a relationship with pandemic response veterans at the WH and at the NSC (including unofficial back channels), and within the office of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Emergency Response (ASPER).  The Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) would then bring all of these groups together with the CDC Director to develop a strategy across all of HHS (including the FDA) and the WH.  

Some of these positions, and even entire offices, were eliminated by Trump.  Most of these positions that remained were filled with people without relevant experience, selected  because they were Trump supporters..  Dr. Redfield, for example, is an HIV researcher but has no real experience as a field epidemiologist and unlike most previous CDC directors was not trained in the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS)."
2020-03-29 3:38,"""By the end of the day, the group agreed that the F.D.A. should loosen regulations so that hospitals and independent labs could move forward quickly with their own tests.""

Why wasn't W.H.O.'s test ever used?  Because Germany produced the test?  Because Trump's base believes W.H.O. is going to take over the world?

Why?"
2020-03-29 3:25,"Your article provides a thorough autopsy of how a lack of leadership at the highest levels of our federal government paralyzed and/or dismantled our best weapons against a deadly stealth virus, SARS-2 Covid 19. We threw away the battle-tested playbook developed by the last administration against Ebola. History will look back at these mistakes that have compromised our National security, and lives and livelihoods hundreds of millions of Americans. 

This virus is here to stay until it is mitigated by an effective vaccine. We must look to the future: testing a large segment of our population not only for viral RNA but for humoral and cellular immunity in individuals with good or untoward outcomes. Thus we will take a step forward in this war."
2020-03-29 6:34,"The failure here seems to be based on the governance system, the combination of knowledge and power behind the decisions.  On the knowledge front, we must safely include incompetence. On the power front, we see the wrong persons were in charge.  The key part of this article is how President Trump, who constantly reminds us how great the USA is (and better than other nations), had to plead with South Korea for tests.  Why doesn't the USA learn from that country about how to organize itself better?  Figure out what they do there and copy it.  If key things they do there are hard to do there because of culture or whatever, change the culture or whatever--but at the very least don't call the culture or whatever ""the greatest."""
2020-03-29 6:56,I work in healthcare and have been in touch w other healthcare workers across the US. We either have barely enough tests to test only the sickest patients or no tests at all. This problem is far from being solved. And then there’s the issue of PPE to wear while administering the tests. Who is ever going to produce enough PPE to protect those on the front lines? This has been a colossal failure of leadership and a public health disaster.
2020-03-29 3:44,"It's shocking to see the average mortality is about 5%. That's at least ten times higher than flu.  Loking at the curve, all curves  for asian countries wearing masks  are flattened in addition to lock down. Asian countries learned their lessons well from SARS, We have leaned nothing and is paying dearly. The worst toll is to yet come in two or three weeks which will shock the US."
2020-03-29 4:27,"The failure of Trump to direct procurement of massive numbers of test kits was nonfeasance.  I suspect that was a political decision.  Just like he said about the Diamond Princess passengers, testing just increases the numbers."
2020-03-29 5:34,"At the very same time that the novel virus was ravaging China in December 2019 and January 2020, the Democrats were totally focused on the impeachment of Trump and the clearly futile attempt to get the Senate to remove the president. This enormous distraction had tragic consequences in that it distract the nation's attention to the very real threat of a new viral plague which had no cure or vaccine defense. The narrative now is that during the intense heat of the impeachment and removal trial in the Senate,
Trump coulda shoulda been focused on the viral threat, while the Democrats were playing the impeachment drama. At no time during time did Pelosi or Schumer try to refocus the nation's attention to the real threat of the viral plague to America. The impeachment drama has had enormously tragic consequences."
2020-03-29 9:37,"First of all, thank you so much for the well organized picture that would help us prepare next waves of unknown yet impending pandemics. When each of my friends told me they had just arrived from South Korea or China while those countries were desperately battling with coronavirus, I asked each of them, ""what kind of screening you had to get through?"" Their responses shocked me. They were so worried about painstaking protocols to detect the virus since the United States has CDC, FDA, and NIH but were so shocked that with just a couple of simple questions, they easily passed through the customs. Even though they were allowed to get on the airplanes after the screenings in the Korean or Chinese airport, they secluded themselves for two weeks, saying ""see you after at least 15 days."" They said ""self quarantine"" had become a social and moral norm for themselves and communities. Without any doubt, I had believed we had more testing kits and masks because we have CDC, FDA, and NIH even though we don't have a president who carries out very basic duty to execute constitutional responsibilities. This dire situation critically challenges how federalism efficiently functions when the country needs urgent actions to save its citizens and land."
2020-03-29 10:05,"Thank you for your thorough analysis of what went wrong in the past leading us into the peril we face immediately. I believe an independent commission should be formed after the crises is contained. Castng blame now is counter productive .
What is the plan moving forward. I hear contradictory statements daily. We Americans deserve to be told of a coherent strategy moving forward. The first tragedy was the pandemic itself which was can not be blamed on anyone. The greater tragedy is the sheer incompetents of our leaders in developing a battle plan. We in America are good at castling blame for the past. The question I have is what are we going to do tomorrow."
2020-03-29 5:30,"I am a doctor. We have still not gotten to robust universal testing. Most people even those with symptoms who present at a hospital cannot be tested. Either because of restrictions around who can be tested (severe enough symptoms) or because they have to ration tests. 

It’s psychotic. The person who is not severely I’ll goes home, infects 3 others, who infect 9 others, who infect 27, 81, 243. 

So because we cannot afford or prioritize testing every potential case (people WITH SYMPTOMS), we risk 200  cases.

Psychotic."
2020-03-29 7:14,"Apparently Mr. Deere's statement quoted in the piece employed the inclusive ""or"", since the United States was demonstrably not prepared.  Then logic dictates that for the suggestion to be false, Mr. Trump did not take the threat of Covid-19 seriously.

The latter is clearly documented in Trump's public statements.

Mr. Deere is truly a White House spokesman, because his regard for the truth matches that of the current occupant."
2020-03-29 3:16,"Everything in this article proves again over and over that the trump administration is incapable of leading the country. To have permitted the CDC and FDA to not function in a unified manner is additional proof. The CDC and FDA are here to protect the people and under the trump administration this did not happen. As an RN of 35 years it is unthinkable that these 2 departments would not have the leadership to function in the protection of the American people. It is also a tragedy of major proportion that many people will die due to inability of this administration to enact the corporations to mass produce personal protective equipment and ventilators again slow walking the PANDEMIC response. I have lost my faith and trust in the CDC and FDA but more than that l have no faith in the trump administration to act in a way to protect the citizens of America. This is a tragedy that will be remembered for many years to come and the review will not be positive. Nothing takes the place of sound leadership who listen to the researchers,epidemiologist, virologist and doctors instead of basing decisions on conspiracy theories."
2020-03-29 10:19,"We are seeing the result of what has become the normal mottis operandi  in terms of response to threats of any sort from this administration.  Basically, don't take measures to prevent the problem, wait until the problem is unmanageable and then try and recover from it."
2020-03-29 3:22,"Governor Whitmer of Michigan, whom Trump refers to as ""that young woman governor,"" called supply companies to see why protective equipment hadn't arrived, and was told by the companies that they were told not to send anything to Michigan. They wouldn't say who told them not to supply Michigan.

Governor Whitmer called the White House but Trump was busy appearing on Fox and belittling her at the same time she was attempting to call. She didn't blame the White House, but indications point to Trump as the one who doesn't want to help Michigan."
2020-03-29 3:47,"The Trump administration, sadly, is still in denial even when the reality and facts would suggest taking a more active role.  The M.O. has never changed: blame the other guy and maybe address other concerns that are less onerous.  But one probable fact can't be ignored. If this were any other administration run by either a democrat or different republican we might still be in this mess, but not to the extent this administration's leadership (or lack of) has caused."
2020-03-29 5:28,"We need to stop pointing fingers during the COVID-19 pandemic in this country immediately. No litmus test is necessary to lay the ultimate responsibility the magnitude of this pandemic belongs to in this country. The answer is simple. It starts at the very top. Initial official statements to inform the public with fact based information about the severity of the virus was never done by Trump. These lapses and missteps in leadership inevitably caused the chain reaction of events further down the ladder, eventually leading us to the dire situation everyone is experiencing. Settled.

The United States of America has some of the most talented doctors, researchers, and scientists in deadly pathogens and infectious diseases at the CDC, several Federal Agencies, public and private Health Care Systems, and private companies in the world. Their experience and knowledge should not be challenged when a serious outbreak occurs, nor have official vital positions throughout the world eliminated or left vacant. Yet this occurred, and official vital positions in several countries were vacant well before the outbreak. The massive hurdles this dedicated and talented group of individuals must overcome depend upon everyone's cooperation and support. Including the many individuals that appear to not take the pandemic seriously.

This pandemic is unlike the others. The distancing guidelines put in place by the CDC and WHO are a doctor's note that everyone should use. Please be safe, and take care!"
2020-03-29 6:20,"Elected officials in NYC and Long Island were telling people to go out and mingle, and enjoy restaurants and movies as little as three weeks ago.
Somehow the warnings from China and Italy were lost on deaf ears here in New York."
2020-03-29 9:25,"It is just on 2 months since the first case outside China and the Chinese were still in denial. Is it really feasible that all the test kits could have been manufactured and distributed in that time when all the world were clamouring for the same kits? OK possibly, but unlikely but testing could have been improved of course. But, one major restriction that has been bought in in many countries is quarantining states and stopping overseas visitors (regrettably our country didn't do that early enough in relation to visitors from the US and now 2 out of 3 cases in Australia result from infected people returning from overseas). But as soon as Cuomo throws a tantrum, all ideas of quarantining NY are thrown out of the window - you will pay heavily for that, unfortunately."
2020-03-29 5:43,"Arguments about who owns this failure aside, how many public health agencies are in the US? How many bodies that plan are there in this nation at the federal, state, and local level? How many committees, institutions, military bodies, think tanks, and state funded universities are there in this country? How many tax dollars have been spent devoted to meetings, planning, creating emergency flowcharts and protocols in the event of such an emergency?  And for how many generations? 

This failure is happening in a nation that loves to refer to itself as the greatest, richest, and most powerful in the world. This is more than just a public health failure. During this amateur hour of US history, we are discovering that this is the empire with no clothes."
2020-03-29 6:44,"""Mr. Obama later created an office of global health security inside the National Security Council to coordinate future crises.""

trump eliminated this office in May 2018, a directorate that had been established because it was not if, but when another pandemic would occur.  

Together with his cuts to the CDC budget, it's clear that trump did not take the threat of a pandemic seriously enough.  And even when it was actually happening, he was in denial for too long.   

One would have expected a known germaphobe to have taken this threat more seriously.  It was only when the markets started crashing that he took real notice.

Thankfully we have many good governors, including Cuomo who have taken the lead in this crisis."

He is even now in complete denial.  He is on record saying ""I am not responsible.""

Now, because of his inaction, all Americans are in reactive mode.   We are following in Trump's chaotic footsteps."
2020-03-29 3:43,"The failure to test early and nationwide is a fatal mistake. Weeks later, we still don't know the extent of the pandemic in the United States and thus we do not know how best to deal with it. I live 120 miles from Seattle in Washington State. It took two weeks for me to get tested after I experienced some Covid-19 symptoms -- low-grade fever, cough, fatigue, chills -- and I am still awaiting a verdict because I was told the test was sent to Oregon and it would take 5-7 days to get a result. Meanwhile the University of Washington in Seattle has a turnaround of only a few hours for test results. My 76-year-old husband with underlying health issues -- former smoker, cancer survivor, A-fib -- has some of the same symptoms but still has not been tested, though he was told if I have the virus he probably has it too. Neither of us knows how long it takes to incubate, how long, mild of severe it will afflict us and when, or if, we may be considered cured or immune we will be if we don't die. At this point in time I wish I were in Denmark, and so does my husband, a former Dane."
2020-03-29 4:25,"Can N-90 masks, critical and in desperately short supply, be quickly disinfected and reused?  I think they can.

1.  Soak the masks for about 20 mins in 99% ethyl alcohol, (which can be bought by the gallon by any lab, if they do not have it already).   Alcohol at this concentration should quickly destroy the virus.
2. Remove the masks and the alcohol will evaporate quickly (has to be done in a well ventilated environment, no flames or sparks).
3.  The now-dry masks (with ventilation they should dry in under 30 mins) should be clean and ready for reuse.  

As good as a new N-90 mask?  Maybe not, but it is better than none."
2020-03-29 4:33,"What is terribly sad is that Germany has had an affordable test it is willing to sell for weeks. I just read that it finally started selling some to the US. But, the newfound willingness to seek outside help is little too late and there was absolutely no need to try and develop a ""better test"" at home. The current administration is an epitome of the problem the US has had for decades though: the idea that the US is somehow unique and somehow more ingenious than the rest of the world. Under past administrations too folks and commentators on both ends of the political spectrum have turned their noses to what other countries have been doing better, from gun control to universal health coverage to retraining workers in lost blue collar jobs. There is always this notion that the US has to reinvent the wheel somehow and it veers on arrogance to the point that it is costing Americans lives everyday. In our now global world there has to be greater realization that we can learn from others the same way they can learn from us. But, I worry that Americans, no matter whether they are on the right or left, don't fully understand what this means."
2020-03-29 4:49,"The best thing we can do is test everyone in the US,  and as soon as possible. The numbers will be through the roof but I contend that will actually calm people when they see the percentage of those who have it versus those who die from it.  It will give us faith that we can beat this, focus on hot spots and make sure those areas get the required equipment to fight it and save lives,  and also allow those who overcame the illness to return to normal lives.  Trump is currently engaged in willful indifference and acting out of political paralysis. If he activated immediate and frequent testing we can move on much quicker."
2020-03-29 6:26,"To an outsider, it would be amazing that the name Pelosi does not appear.   From November on she made the  media and  Administration concentrate solely on impeachment.

Then Trump in the State of the Union called for cooperation  against the virus.  Nancy tore up the speech and sent the House home for two weeks.  That should be the central ad:  his appeal or for coperation, her tearing up of the speech, her recess. and the reminder by the Kentucky representative that constitutionally this kind of bill originates in the House."
2020-03-29 10:19,"I keep thinking - if Hillary were President, there would have been an early, detailed plan and serious marshaling of resources.   And we would not be in such dire straits.

It beggars belief , what have we become?"
2020-03-29 10:20,"I do not understand how the US decided to not use a German-designed test, even though it was distributed by the WHO. You could have tested months earlier on a massivly larger scale. The F.D.A. decided not to approve the test, but rather let the American people go untested for weeks? Is that national pride or hubris?"
2020-03-29 8:27,"Having read this article several times, it's clear that mismanagement and mistakes were made at mutiple levels repeatedly. A knowledgeable take-chsrge person never appaeared and road blocks developed that further slowed the process of getting a good test out radidly and in volume

Leadership was lacking from the top down. As a result, we have a much worse pandemic than we should have  had costing  lives and hardship. I'm sure many books will be written after this is all over documenting the mess and who was responsible. We obviously did not have a first-rate health care  system in place to handle a crisis.There is no excuse.There was time to do something and the time was frittered away. It's all unbelievable. I'm at a loss to say more."
2020-03-29 8:48,"On the topic of the CDC’s overtures being rebuffed, I have heard that the Chinese perspective was that the US did not offer any practical proposal as to how the CDC would help. When you add to that the very combative attitude coming out of the US at every level towards China, it is no wonder that they did not want to take resources away from the crisis to accommodate the CDC. Other countries responded rapidly with assistance, whereas the US was signally unhelpful.

The fact that the Germans were able to get a test working (as were many other countries and even US bodies other than the CDC), shows that the Chinese should not take any blame for the US’ failure to get tests out.

Now in Hong Kong the virus is taking off. This is due to infection coming in from the US and Europe and is much worse than what we received from the mainland which is next door to us. Again this makes it clear that the rest of the world is responsible for the pandemic. China was only responsible for their epidemic and they handled it well after a (probably understandable) rocky start."

Lives. Lost.  

The failure to address the pandemic early has triggered a complete re-evaluation of everything we thought we knew not only about this disease but changes to industries as diverse as restaurants to airlines to neighborhood storefronts and crime.  In the aftermath, life will not be as we knew it.

We aren't prepared for disasters:  Extreme weather, Flood, Fire, Guns, Terrorism, Infrastructure failures and most of all, Health.  Supporting the public need is routinely trounced in Congress as Socialism, and again, we allow it.  All of the movements were correct:  Capitalism rules, Corporations control and money matters.  But as little miracles happen as a result of this disaster, we as a people need to take control of our government, both State and Federal, and make it work for us.  Now is the time to shed our dependence on shoddy healthcare, on fossil fuels, on antiquated technology.

But the scale, the utter in your face consequence of this failure  has made it clear ""the emperor has no clothes""

He should have been taken out of power a long time ago, but we all wanted our tax cuts. Now we all payback with thousands of lives lost and 2 Trillion dollar down payment.

We are reaping the seeds we have sown. Chickens have come home to roost. This is how America crumbles."
2020-03-29 11:23,"I wish the NYT and all other news sources would publish US Coronavirus case numbers with the material fact that the numbers are based on the minimal testing being conducted in the US and that actual numbers are estimated to be significantly higher. 

Perhaps get the mathematician featured recently in the NYT to give us estimates based on the # of positive tests and have him run those “community transmission” algorithms, factor in city density etc. so that more realistic numbers can be arrived at. 

The numbers we read on maps everyday are but a fraction of the real US number. There’re mostly numbers tallied from hospitals and the abysmal testing outposts we have. Why continue to confuse Americans and the world with misleading facts ? Haven’t we had enough already ? 

Germany is doing 500,000 tests a day or a week? I can’t recall but they contain the outbreaks quickly by tracking down all contacts and isolating them, consequently their numbers are more accurate. 

I am constantly sending these maps and updates to twenty-somethings who think things are not that bad yet where they live - and then I have to hammer home why the numbers in their community are likely significantly higher and thus they need to take greater precautions. **I’m tired of telling people what I want the news to report.** I fully expect thousands upon thousands of spring break returnees will not entertain the possibility of significantly higher numbers unless NYT you report projections.

Our reputation and image in the world have plummeted, with serious consequences that will manifest themselves for many years from now.

I loathe Trump, but this goes way beyond him. This particular testing issue, is a failure of our institutions.

Over the last several years the “deep state” has come through to save us time and time again. I’m sure it allows some of us sleep well at night, knowing that even though our beloved institutions are being weakened by this current administration, we have good people in place that are actually doing a lot of the dirty work necessary to run this country. 

Well this disaster was exasperated by good people. Several good people made horrible decisions that led us to where we are. 

When Covid-19 is all said and done, I believe we will be seen as one of the countries that handled it the worst. (Lack of PPE is our other great failing currently).

I have never been more saddened for my country. The trust I’ve lost in my institutions due to this current situation will be a wound that will not heal easily.

Scientists have rung the alarm about pandemics and climate for years; this administration made one of its first order of business to sideline science on every issue, to deny and deny on both until it had no real options to act wisely.

But, more than that, we are living with the consequences here of an administration that, from the top, refused to engage in the normal transition  process after Mr. Trump's election, thereby preventing his assumption of office from being as seamless as possible.  Likewise, the constant turmoil and turnover of personnel, even as we entered the fourth year of this term of office, has prevented this administration from ever ""meshing"" into a fully functioning, coordinated unit.

3. In 2018 Trump fired the NSC pandemic preparedness team and the global health security team even after being briefed about a possible pandemic. 

4. Jan. 2019, Dan Coates, head of DNI released the “worldwide threat assessment of the intelligence community report” which outlined a pandemic threat for Human Security and Global Health in which the US was to take a worldwide lead. Trump was briefed on that. 

5. In 2019 a joint CDC/HHS exercise showed large problems with pandemic preparedness, Trump was briefed on this assessment. 

6. Trump Is stalling the release of the 2020 Intel report which he knows warns that the U.S. isn’t ready for a global pandemic.

7. In Dec 2019/Jan 2020 Trump received intelligence reports about the seriousness of the coronavirus threat, and he continued to downplay its severity in public. 

8. For weeks in March 2020, State officials and hospitals have begged for more supplies using the Defense Production Act. Trump waited weeks, before issuing and appears to be politicizing help based on party affiliations and ties to donors.

It is the direct product of the denigration of professionalism which did not start with, but has found its most virulent expression in, this president* and his acolytes.

According to this article, which explains the needs of testing, there must be not only the first test, but also 2 follow up tests, not more than 2 weeks apart, and that is in the case of the person who tests positive for the virus. For the person who test negative, the test would have to be repeated - within days, at the very least - unless they are completely isolated. Because surviving the illness does not make you immune (so far as I can tell, that is not a given.) So we are talking about each and every American who is not locked away from society and its contagion. In other words, most people. 
That is a lot of tests, people. And you don't just roll them out, in stages, to segments of the population. They have to be there, free to anyone who can't pay, and the results tracked. Records kept, and people identified, probably to local police and certainly hospitals and on databases. We do not even have a national database for patient health information (as, I believe, at least one Scandinavian country has). 
So: how simple is this, exactly? How can or could this have been accomplished? I imagine a test that is as simple as testing your urine for glucose - a strip that turns color (wiith the potential for false negatives and positives, of course). Easily stored, free for everyone, results verified, tracked, etc. And, as explained above, requiring a LOT of strips."

The government machinery is created to keep out fraud in some of these medical testing procedures.

In Colombia, it was reported today that the government has seized kits for home use - attractively priced - for purchase - but totally useless.

There is no telling how many folks have been duped.

Let's not forget that young attractive looking Stanford graduate who fooled the best including ex Secretary Schultz that she had a blood test - that would be one of the cheapest ever.

So, these issues with CDC - and the bureaucratic infighting - not surprised at all.

I spent over 4 decades in the oil patch - and volunteered for clean up efforts post Macondo.

Folks may recall that even Macondo effort - driven by BP - was taken over by the Feds, Cost Guard among many others - largely because Obama wanted ”to put his boots on BP's neck.”

And yet, it was BP that capped the well - after 80 plus days- if I remember right.

Hopefully, Wuhan will teach our scientists some new methods on how to quickly develop tests for the next invasive virus.

The NYT is reporting a story on ventilators where the government's best efforts failed because - well, similar issues as here.

And let's not forget that deaths attributed to H1N1 are an order of magnitude greater than Wuhan fatalities to date - despite widespread testing."

But let's not lose sight of the fact that from the start, with the exception of the travel ban on flights from China, which was at least in part a racist gesture, Trump downplayed this threat in order to preserve the stock market, the economy, and his chances for re-election.

As I watched the signing ceremony starring Donald Trump and his sidekick McConnell I became more angry when I saw that ear to ear grin of McConnell’s knowing he and the rest of his cabal could have attempted to cajole Trump into action.

Now that we are entering a stage in which the virus crisis is full blown, we have Trump threatening governors, blaming Obama, and the Trump supporters irritated by Dr. Fauci as they see him as part of the “deep state” that Trump bleats and brays about.

Just as damaging was Donald Trump's appointing people to be his advisers on the virus based on their politics, instead of their experience. Notably, Alex Azar is a good public speaker best suited to defend an organization for questionable decisions of the past.

Of those persons already in place, Dr. Robert Redfield of C.D.C. had no experience running an entire agency in an emergency mode, and he was too fussy in insisting that a C.D.C. testing method be used instead of another country's, although the Redfield approach probably appealed to the nationalistic Trump. Dr. Redfield let perfect get in the way good, when time was of the essence. Similarly, Dr. Stephen Hahn, the new appointee at the F.D.A., dragged his feet instead of taking bold action.

Donald Trump has been the worst possible leader to deal with this pandemic."

Likewise in Louisiana, the governor and the mayor of New Orleans went forward with Mardi-Gras, ignoring the obvious consequences.

About 160,000 people were arriving every day from overseas at JFK alone. With the other airports, that is millions in a month.  Trump closed off people coming from China, for which he was labeled a racist.  He should have added Italy, but no one realized how bad the situation was there. 
We are talking about an innumerable number of tests for people coming from other countries. The tests were taking days to analyze.  People may not show symptoms, or may be carrying and initially test negative.  
China closed down Wuhan, and people had to have apps which could trace their movements if they left their house.  Imagine trying that in NYC.  What would have happened if, when De Blasio and the head of the health department told people to go out and enjoy themselves, and allowed the Chinese Lunar celebration to take place on Feb.9, Trump had told him to shut the city down?  There would have been one big NY raspberry from the residents and officials. 
After leaving much of the fleet sitting at Pearl Harbor, FDR pulled us through the war (with a lot more mistakes that were censored at the time).

We were told to leave the masks for the health care professionals, well, they still are fighting for masks and they have thousands of sick patients. In Asia they were able to control the outbreak because everyone wears masks, the sick and the not sick. Of course masks and eye protection will stop the spread . It’s never too late to correct a mistake, everyone must now wear a mask when they are going to be out among other people. And if your in state where it hasn’t spread yet, don’t even think of leaving the house without a mask and eye protection . This should just be standard operating procedure from this point on. We already have social distancing which is very good, add a mask on everyone for good measure and we can turn this tide Let’s not talk about mistakes made  let’s talk about the ways to contain the problem. WEAR A MASK AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE."

I’m a physician at major health care system, now in my second day awaiting results.  If I’m negative, I can go back to work.  If I’m positive, in two weeks I can make some real contributions.  It’s all about testing.
My health care system is doing more than it’s best and rolled out an amazing drive thru testing program.  The people at testing center had a mixture of masks, some not ideal.  But did amazing work!
I was told, because I was on front lines, my test would be run ‘in-house’ and completed two days ahead of schedule.
Symptoms? I have cough, low grade fever (100.5), painful red eyes, and some chest tightness.  I’m not scared or even anxious, but my wife is terrified.
              My issue is the governments roll out of testing.  The american people deserve an apology, not excuses.  An apology means we can trust our government and right now we need that trust.

2020-03-29 12:57,"This is excellent in depth reporting which one rarely sees outside of the Times.

The Trump haters will see only what they want to see. It's all Trump's fault.  Which is of course true in the military sense that a commander is responsible for all the actions of his subordinates.

But, in the broader sense, one who actually reads the entire article has to realize that the unfortunate failure to better limit the spread of Coronavirus could have happened under any Presidency.

Bureaucracies will be bureaucratic.  The article demonstrates that the talking points  of Democrats about how the problem stems from budget cuts and Trump's action in ""disbanding"" the department whose mission was to prevent the spread of such pandemics into the U.S. is simply a myth.

True, if Trump had intervened personally earlier to get the bureaucrats to do what needed to be done,thiings would be better. Trump isn't a detail man.  One can imagine Jimmy Carter staying at the CDC headquarters until they got on track.

But it is in the nature of bureaucracies to be bureaucratic. That's why we shouldn't rely on them too much or give them too much power.  The irony is that Trump's strongest critics tend to the those who think that bureaucracies are the key to solving every problem. Just establish a new department with an appropriate title and mission and throw a lot of money at it and problem solved!

It's not that simple."
2020-03-29 12:54,"Without extensive tests, one cannot estimate the number of infected, the spread of the disease, and the actual curvival rate. Once the infected are found, they can be isolated, while the healthy can work. So in slowing the testing, Trump & co have destroyed the economy, increased the unemployment, and endangered Trump's chances of reelection. Don's ""gut feelings"" have once again driven all of us into the ditch."
2020-03-29 13:44,"With all due respect, this wasn't a failure to test, it was a decision to deny that a pandemic was on the way. Why? Because a pandemic would rattle the markets and compromise Trump's reelection.

If only it was a mistake. But no, Trump's every decision or declaration or whatever are always based on how it will make him look, how it will count as a win. Always has been this way and always will.

Now that the pandemic can't be denied anymore, his next bad decision will be to declare victory over the virus too soon. There is nothing this man will not do to get reelected, whatever the consequences. 

Happily, we have this courageous Congress that will protect us all from the calamities that are certain to come by blocking his every move or even removing him from office. Because they care more about the people, than their careers, right?"

We could have done the quantitative version of the test in 2000.  Thousands of labs had the qPCR machines that could test 96 samples every two hours.  Why these labs were not recruited is beyond.  The extraction media in the swab-holding tubes is so potent (think phenol/chloroform) that viruses don't survive.  The lab workers would almost certainly remain safe.  We could have practiced containment and now we're left with mitigation."

Remember all the comments by politicians and others that Chinese restaurants were fine to eat at and we should go to them.  They should have said don't go to any restaurant.  Testing will delay the spread of the virus and give people some time for better treatments or a vaccination.  However it is going to be here until vaccination or herd immunity (1-5 million deaths), also a slight chance for self attenuation which I don't know what the prospects are."

2020-03-29 14:17,"Even the current reported numbers are highly suspect.  Doctors are not sending patients for testing because there’s a shortage of tests and because, even if the test is positive, there is no therapeutic response... only the recommendation of isolation. So unless the patient is clearly in distress no test is even done.  It’s bad enough to triage clinical care, but at this point we’re even triaging diagnosis.

The memory issues may stem from either the sedative medication or insufficient Oxygen, or both; the PTSD arises because patients in the ICU need physical touch, emotional support, human contact and they are denied this due to being in isolation.

It can take weeks or months to recover (and not necessarily fully recover mentally, cognitively, or emotionally) following an ICU and ventilator experience. Just because one has recovered from COVID, doesn't mean one is fully capable and ""up to snuff."""
2020-03-29 14:01,"What a study in contrasts! The Times' article about Sweden remaining mostly open but cautious revolves around trust: in the government, in the system, in experts and in one's fellow citizens.

(Example: when Dr. Fauci attempts to correct Trump's lies and distortions, the hard right comes after him; don't they remember that his widely-revered national public health career began under their ""sainted"" forefather Reagan?)

Since Goldwater and Reagan, Americans have been fed the lie that ""government is the problem."" No, the institution isn't, but bad governance is, and our slow response to this crisis has brought out the worst in our worst administration in living memory. The only route I see to flattening the curve is for Trump to get out of the way and restore trust in actual, not acting, experts. If he won't do that voluntarily, I regretfully propose that his cabinet rise up and remove him from office using the 25th Amendment. His peevishness and petulance cannot be the deciding factor about who lives and who dies. The health of millions and the lives of thousands are at stake, not just in America but all over the world."

Please show the comparative math / graphs of the prior epidemic and COVID-19, and explain the impact of finding a cure or vaccine for earlier outbreaks vs not having them yet for the novel one.

The ""build the wall"" chants at the rallies grew out of trump's ignorance and sloth. While illegal immigration had been on the decline for 20 years, and deportations up under President Obama, trump loved the applause line. He craves adoration, yet is too lazy and shallow to read, listen, question, learn and consider. When congress would not fun his wall, trump began taking funds from the Pentagon not to solve a problem, simply to keep the applause coming.

This preference for bluster and applause over problem-solving is now costing lives. Failure to learn. Failure to listen. Failure to act in a timely manner. Failure to lead.

But assessment and containment are two different things.

In January writers in this outlet and many others protested loudly when the administration propsed a travel ban, which was delayed until February because governors and opposition leaders were busy making political hay of the situation.

The severity was grasped early on.

But people everywhere typically don't act until they see something for themselves.

Well, they're seeing it now.

I feel bad for the emergency responders because they are charged with getting into the face of it all - a mess created by people ignoring the early warnings to wash, and distance, and by failing to restrict travel earlier because of lack of political will.

The good news is that federalism is working and the governors and their staffs are managing things, with the assistance of the federal government institutions put in place for exactly this purpose.

Sadly, early misqueues muddied the waters.

It is a failure of colossal proportions considering the partial success in tackling the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, and the vast swath of knowledge already published by the CDC on pandemic preparedness.

We point fingers at specific individuals at our own peril. There are two main reasons behind this failure:

1) underfunding of the government: just as the number of individuals in a society grows, the size of the government needs to grow to keep up with the increase in complexity. 

Underfunding means that government agencies managed the decreasing funds allocated to them by this administration by using them for short-term goals. 

They were unable to stockpile; add the decreasing funds with the low morale during a Republican administration and it becomes difficult for government agencies to consistently retain their best talent.


2) politicization of the science and of the leaders: if you don't believe in pandemics, then why should you prepare?

Failure to guide rational decision making on science can only lead to irrational actions that lack the power of forecasting, as we see here."
2020-03-29 14:03,"I wonder how the Federal bureaucrats who did not have enough sense of urgency and leadership to mitigate this crisis sleep at night.  Even more, I wonder if they still have their jobs.   Have heads rolled?  This is the kind of thing that causes the right-wing of the government to say we should drown it in the bathtub, even though the real cause is short-funding and (evidentially) unwise hiring.  A sense of urgency has to come from the top.  On many levels, it apparently wasn't there.  I hope we have learned our lesson, but I doubt it."
2020-03-29 13:11,"Many western democracies tested early, but as of today they have significantly worse Total Cases per Population size results than US.   That includes Germany, France, Israel, Norway, Denmark and many others.

If you test, you must trust the testing results.  Dr. Birx pointed out in a briefing a week ago that the early testing regimes like that provided by WHO were not reliable - giving too many false results in FDA submitted data.   

So contrary to the thesis of this article, those western democracy countries that relied upon early testing seem to be doing much worse at present.

As Dr. Birx pointed out, the task force waited to have more reliable testing approved by FDA.

That strategy seems to be paying off when we compare the US numbers to much of Europe and Israel."
2020-03-29 13:19,"The fumbling incompetence, along with false and misleading announcement from government officials, echo the disastrous start of the 1918 pandemic. From the start, alarms had been sounded but officials refused to respond or inform the public. Military preparations for war forced millions of personnel into training camps and crowded ships. Millions of soldiers died in Europe before getting near a battlefield. Wishful thinking and denial of reality caused an avoidable catastrophe then and again now. As Bob Dylan asked, ""When will we ever learn?"""
2020-03-29 13:30,"For years experts have been saying that Trump's failure to attract, recruit and retain good talent would someday come back to burn us. While this article does not explicitly say so: now is that time.  The head of the FDA was only six weeks into his job. There had been two HHS heads in only 3 years. The top federal healthcare agencies had their budgets cut and had hundreds of jobs unfilled. Nobody knew exactly what the president wanted because of his failure to lead during the crisis. Instead he tried to wish it away, blame others, and in typical Trump fashion refused to accept accountability and ownership of a problem that confronted him. This lack of leadership sent mixed messages to FDA, CDC, HHS and other agencies and helped contribute to the uncoordinated and unimpressive response to a virus that had the potential to devastate the public health and economy. 

Harry Truman once said: ""The buck stops here."" And as millions of people who buy used cars know ""you buy it, you own it."" After 3.5 years in office Trump still doesn't understand those two simple facts of life. That's why his companies have failed. And that is why the US response to the Coronavirus has failed, when you boil it all down. Leadership matters. It was absent here."
2020-03-29 13:50,It sounds like the CDC was most at fault. They claimed to be ready to test and were not. To blame that on the administration is a stretch.
2020-03-29 14:05,"The trump administration treated the testing kit debacle as a real estate deal. So what if a party walked away for a while; the building wasn’t going anywhere.  Lots of real estate deals “die” before they get completed.  This time, it wasn’t the deal that had to die, but the American people, whose electoral college elected this man. Trump’s name rarely mentioned in this article, but any administration has to be judged “top to bottom”. So you know that responsibility for this starts with the President."
2020-03-29 13:19,"Truth is, we were not focused or prepared as a nation. The Trump administration seems not to have paid enough attention to what was going on in Wuhan China months ago. Trump probably sticking with his ""us vs them"" campaign theme.  

He has been focused on other things as we have seen from his assassination of an Iranian general to his endless twitter posts about the impeachment process, his campaign rallies etc. The rising global health crisis was never on his mind. It's that simple. 

We already had our first known case early in the year and nothing was done. So March was too late to begin social distancing and other public health measures. We have been way behind and all I see now is confusion and finger pointing."
2020-03-29 13:22,"Reading this article reminds me of the proverb: ""Too many cooks spoil the broth"".
There just seemed to be too many players with no one particular leader directing the whole process. Then there was Trump appointing Mike Pence as overall director without informing the Health officials in advance. (Why Pence anyway?).
One concern in Australia was that our Trump-adoring P.M. Morrison seemed to be following Trump's apparent lack of urgency about the pandemic. Fortunately he has moved away from that now, not without some prodding though. Even as late as Friday 13th March he introduced a 500 person limit on public events, but not to start until monday 16th March. That allowed his favourite church Hillsong to hold a convertion over the weekend with 3500 people attending each of the three days!"
2020-03-29 14:42,"I am convinced that this virus was around well before the end of last year.  My healthy, fit spouse with no underlying health issues came down with a cough in early November,  days after we got back from a two-week long European trip. The cough lasted for nine weeks, subsiding finally in mid-January. In all that time, he had no fever, pretty much of an appetite, but was so fatigued from the coughing (which kept him from sleeping some nights),  that he often skipped his daily bike ride.  
Eventually, he had a chest x-ray which was clear. And now we worry that he could have a recurrence, as no one can say whether contracting Covid-19 renders one immune to it."
2020-03-29 14:43,"Until this latest, I have always been impressed with the CDC, their professionalism, their straight talk, their ability to get things done right, the first time. Sadly it didn’t happen this time. This article explains part of it, but there must be even more reason why a normally first class agency performed so badly. I hope to live through this epidemic long enough to learn the full story."
2020-03-29 14:52,"There are plenty of lessons to be learned, for sure, but trying to reduce it to failure at the top and lack of testing are simplistic views. We know now (but not early on) that (1) it takes about 5.6 days from infection to symptoms; (2) spreading starts two days before symptoms; (3) at least 50% of infected remain asymptomatic or very mild carriers, infecting others for 10 days; (4) virus lives for 8+ hours on plastic, metal and cardboard. With 23,000 passengers landing every day from China after 10 hours on plane, the best decision was to stop those flights... Yes, contact tracing with fast precise tests should be been available sooner, but it would not have prevented the spreading. As such, US is in much better shape than several European countries in per capita peak infections and death rate. In addition, US economy was better to start with, limiting the domino effect we will see in Europe, I am afraid..."
2020-03-29 15:32,"I would have to put a large part of the blame on another government agency, the TSA. I traveled through several airports on March 2nd and March 13th and I never witnessed one agent that was checking IDs, tickets, baggage, etc. change their gloves. They only change their gloves when they go on break. It's hard to believe that there is no link between the 30 TSA agents working at JFK, Newark, and LaGuardia that have tested positive for coronavirus and NYC becoming an epicenter for the pandemic."
2020-03-29 15:32,"The infrastructure for large scale testing has to be in place, always. You can’t suddenly ramp things up when pandemic hits - especially when many of the materials needed are not made in America. For example, Colombia had wide scale testing right away, results back same day. Every city.  How did they do this?  Since they can get mosquito borne illnesses, due to climate, they have a system in place, staffed and ready to begin testing right away. So Covid happens - they are ready to go. Not fumbling looking for materials, getting labs ready, figuring out how to distribute the tests, etc.  US testing was a colossal disaster (I work at a large hospital and know how few and slow the testing was, and still is)."
2020-03-29 15:46,"I wish this story had more fully investigated why the CDC rejected the WHO test.  Were there technical issues, or was it simply the old ""not invented here"" syndrome.  It seems to me that even if they had reservations the U.S. would have much been better off if they had obtained and used the WHO test until such time as the CDC-developed test were readily available.  Germany seems to have done very well the WHO test that was developed in Germany.  Germany also has done much, much better with Merkel's leadership, but that is another story."
2020-03-29 15:50,"I have a question:We are told that wearing a mask does not help prevent the infection and that because not enough masks
are available.What though if everybody wears one?And how about those DIY's with a pocket for inserts (coffee filters,hepa filters,tissue etc.)that can be reused after sanitation?"
2020-03-29 0:16,"The Trump administration has failed at every level on this, in every possible way, and they continue to. This was clearly a major concern back in the early January.

--runs on a system that values only those making money,

--keeps its people informed and educated through a media system built for making money, 
--has a healthcare system with the main goal of making money, 
--measures its progress as a society by stock prices, national output, and other ways of making money.

---elected a president whose is office is used to make money for himself, the easy way,
---voted in by people who cannot tell the difference between real wealth and fake wealth. 

The politics of money has so corrupted our nation that tens of thousands of people, and maybe more, will die unnecessarily; millions will have the their lives ruined; and our nation will face unfathomable destruction and dislocations.

Is there anything else left for us need to learn about this man fin order to come to the certain conclusion that his incompetence and self-delusion are destroying our country and its people at a pace we never imagined?

The only question left for me is what will be left of us if we have to wait for the election to remove him from office."

An inept set of political hacks, stooges and sycophants who thought they'd fallen into the honey pot of self-interested partisan avarice when they first got elected, and now wail in discovery that they actually need to step up to (and do) the job for which they were elected.  

It's completely clear they are abject failures at it, no more capable of true leadership than I am of taking a giant leap over the moon.  So though the damage is done, and we will be paying for it not only in viral deaths but also in the tens of Trillions in debt obligations they have slathered on the backs of all Americans, I vote for their remove (for cause) if not immediately then in November.

Florida's governor, who saw no issue with kids on spring break all over the beaches and said nothing about sending them home, all of a sudden had an epiphany about the dangers of the pandemic on his voting block of senior citizens who now crowed about stopping snowbirds from arriving in the state.

The horse left the barn 3 months ago on the spread of Covid-19.  Our failure to test early when we had a chance is all on Trump."

It is exactly the same test used to detect a number of different pathogens, the only difference is in the sequence of DNA (the primers). To have this fail in such a colossal way should be just unforgivable. Tens of thousands more people will die because of it. If you don't want, or can't take the responsibility, then don't take the big boy jobs."

This fictional president -- along with a thoughtful Congress -- would have reacted immediately to early reports from China and from US expert epidemiologists.  She would have ramped up testing, ordered PPE, had more ventilators manufactured, and -- most importantly -- educated the public from January.   Instead of complying with StayHome orders, citizens would have rallied to comply with the GetTested! campaign.  Even testing 10% of the population would have provided data for a coordinated response.  Some costs upfront.  But not a total shutdown.  Total costs in both lives and economy would be way less.

Where does the buck stop nowadays?"
2020-03-29 8:31,"Screening can be used when the threat is on-board.  Going back further:  It has been variously reported that a test was conducted by the appropriate Federal agencies last year, summer I think, which used a fast-spreading virus originating in China (perhaps Asia, generically, not certain) as the ""incoming"" pandemic scenario.  The results showed many flaws in US preparedness.  The absence of any follow-up by this Misadministration is documented, possibly due to the gutting of the positions on the NSC set up to deal with pandemics, and which was designed by the orange man-child's hated predecessor. 

 Any leader with a quarter of an ounce of brains and integrity would have taken steps to protect those he was sworn to defend and protect.  It is clear the current oval office occupant does not meet even that minimal threshold."

And since then, from this article, all these officials at the top of the FDA/CDC/WH-DHS have been willing to lie about what their agencies have actually done, and this continues, with as always, Mr. Trump acting as the liar-in-chief.

Separately, Trump does not plan to abide by the law as to the transparency--reporting to Congress--as mandated in the new law regarding the $500 billion bailout.  He said as much in the signing statement.  Recall also that originally the law as proposed had no restrictions or checks to keep Trump and the Republicans from spending the funds to aid their reelection or enrich Trump and his family--we can assume that was their intent.  Congress would be foolish to appropriate the money until Trump agrees to abide by the law.  Any Court action might not be resolved until after the election."
2020-03-29 15:10,"If “the world’s richest country — armed with some of the most highly trained scientists and infectious disease specialists — squandered its best chance of containing the virus’s spread,” it’s the inexplicable indifference to it of the man in the White House that is to blame. If Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the top govt. scientists advising the president on this crisis, still wonders why the country was “not able to mobilize on a broader scale” to respond to it, the answer lies in this Trumpian indifference.

When the mainstream media alerted us on the danger stemming from Trump's lack of preparedness, he lambasted at it. His favorite Fox News even characterized the reporting as a continuation of Trump's impeachment, which the House had just completed.

Trump belatedly recognized the threat, but couldn't help boasting about the efforts he started making to fight it: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” If that is so, one may ask, why did he ask the president of South Korea ""to send as many test kits as possible from the 100,000 produced there daily,"" as stated in this report? 

We can bet that Trump will continue to claim, falsely, that the virus ""will disappear” fast, as long as those whose responsibility it is to give him the right advice nod approvingly when he does it. The only health official who had the guts to openly disagree with him whenever he did it is Dr. Fauci. Who knows, his days in the Trump team are numbered."

How come Europe has 45% the cases & 67% of the deaths, they have the world's best public health system and where is their magical planning. They have let each country burn down. This is the most difficult thing the world is trying to manage since World War 2. Please read complex systems theory.  
The only place that has had any success is China and we A) don't know their real numbers. b) they waited a month to let the world know what was happening c) they still never shared the DNA/RNA data of their viral strains c) they are authoritarian state d) they already managed a SARS outbreak in 2002. 
The idea we can nationalize the supply chain is not realistic. We have a real time supply chain that is not nationally integrated. Our medical supply chain is regional, built around the regional demand. The production is global so using the DPA is not going to help that. 
The best we can do is have 2 tracks of testings a) scaling existing testing from 115k a day today, to 350k tests a day by April 15 b) get new tech example Abbott quick test system 650k a day so we get to 1 million tests a day by end of April we can have 100 million tests by end of July"

Remember the expression President Harry Truman had put on a desk sign?  If not, look it up on the InterWebs.  It applies to our inept President Trump.

""The Buck Stops Here""

It means a POTUS (or any leader) takes responsibility for choosing subordinates to carry our her or his delegated actions.  Responsibility.  Full stop.  Let that sink in.

Now recall DJT's March 13th response to a reporter asking if he felt he should bear responsibility for a delayed federal response to the pandemic.

""No, I don't take responsibility.""  

WORST president ever by any metric.  Trump does whatever he thinks is best for Trump always.  He does not have the capacity for empathy.  He regularly throws his own subordinates ""under the bus"", another expression seemingly written for Donald J. Trump. It's doubtful Trump could even spell altruism and certainly doesn't understand the definition of the word. 

VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO

signed,
a growing majority of We The People

P. S. - Make America Smart Again.

2020-03-29 14:17,"S Korea started to manufacture 100,000 kits per day much earlier than it hit them hard, and distributed the kits everywhere. They quickly erected multiple drive-thru test centers. Anyone who was suspected to be exposed was tested. The results were available within 1 hour. This enabled them to quickly detect infected individuals, trace all of their contacts, and test all of the contacts as well. Then they isolated all infected individuals. They didn't even have to shut down cities and companies or shut down their economy! Just quarantining infected individuals. 

Now compare it to what we did:

We didn't and still don't have enough number of test kits. Healthcare workers who get exposed are sent home for self-quarantine without being tested, because there are not enough test kits. This is losing workforce. Our test results take about 7 days to come back. Hence losing workforce for 7 days even if they are tested. This delay in the results also means we lose time in tracking the infected individuals and their contacts. Hence exponential spread of disease. 
If we were smart, we would invest a fraction of the 2 trillion in manufacturing massive number of test kits early on, and started testing every suspected case with taxpayer money. Would have saved billions if not trillions of taxpayer money now that we're paying for the stimulus package."

Second mistake was waiting for the WHO to officially declare this a pandemic before serious action was taken. The Who has been way behind the curve from day 1( I have my own theories on why they were so reluctant to call this a pandemic).
Third mistake was our stable genius of a president ( there’s to much to say here so I’ll just leave it at that).
All in all we’ve been lied to, and  our leaders and international bodies are either corrupt or  incompetent. I hope the nation will count the dead after this is all said and done and see that there’s Republicans, Democrats , rich , poor, black and white among then. We need to close ranks and re-evaluate the policies and procedures that led us to this place. I wish I could say it’s all Trump fault , but the fact that we can’t readily manufacture mask, gowns and ventilators In this country started way before he was elected."

The fact that we see the impending drama unfolding in front of our eyes does not help reinforce our response. Look at 9/11, look at Korea and Viet Nam et al, it was well understood by the people who needed to know what was coming down the pike. But our heads remained in the sand. Trump owns this, yes - but so do we."

2020-03-29 14:35,"The roots of this bungled response to a natural disaster are buried not in the scientific community or in government bureaucracy but in the Republican party.  Without acknowledging it, the Trump administration owes its criminal indifference to effective government to the legacy of  Herbert Hoover, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and their acolytes, voters, legislators, pundits, and think tanks.  The virus is non-partisan, but the Republican party owns the Trump administration's response.  Trump's version of Hoovervilles line the corridors of ICUs nationwide."
2020-03-29 14:49,"If this is a 10 out of 10 performance rating by Trump, makes one shudder to think what a lower score would look like."
2020-03-29 14:50,"Must wonder how Trump’s love of a fight and weird fixation on trade wars related to China’s reticence to share all their information on this virus, instead of just parts of it.  Also, both China’s and our political leaders were and are more interested in political face-saving than actually protecting their populace.  Trump’s puppet government has been highly ineffectual on all fronts except profit-taking and ordering expensive furniture.  How could anyone expect anything different?

If ventilators were necessary for health emergencies and our emergency stockpile needed them, that need should have over ridden private companies’ profits.  Even if one company bought out another, a contract with the Federal government to produce needed equipment should have been enforced.  Did the government officials just shrug their shoulders and walk away when contracted companies were bought out?  Too complicated, too many feathers to ruffle to enforce contractual agreements although millions of dollars had been disbursed?

Regarding masks, I have not believed for one second they are not necessary.  I do believe health officials lied because it was easier than pressing private industry into making them in sufficient quantities.  Plus, they would be a highly visual symbol of the power of a virus over our ego-driven President and cabinet of sycophants and their inability to act responsibly to an emergency."
2020-03-29 15:25,"To sum up, the president did not take it seriously enough as previous presidents have and he did not put the best people in charge of the different agencies."
2020-03-29 15:33,"When the the dust settles, I sure hope the US govt can muster enough sense to establish a highly-professional commission to gather lessons learned and recommendations that will help prevent future buffoonery. Sadly, I think if the current administration is voted back in this Nov we’ll just get a whitewash."
2020-03-29 14:20,"While the focus needs to be on the pandemic, I'm hopeful that at some point in the future, those responsible within the FDA, CDC, HHS and Federal Government are held accountable for their ineptitude that led to preventable deaths.  History should and will be a harsh judge of this cast of negligent officials.  We had a chance.  We blew it."
2020-03-29 14:22,"Why not use the German test? The test was good enough. As Voltaire said, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” We need to follow what the Germans are doing. We do not need to reinvent the wheel."
2020-03-29 14:43,"Somehow I cannot shake the belief that if the nation had a President Andrew Cuomo in the Oval Office we would all be better off today.

Instead, we have a mirage sitting behind the Resolute Desk, a hologram of a president, one ill-equipped to deal with emergencies, a man who is incurious, who believes himself to be a genius, who shoots from the hip and uses his Twitter account to payback anyone who he feels has not treated him nicely.

People have died and are going to die who didn't have to perish because Donald Trump is president.  That is the sad reality and it's only going to get worse before it gets better.

The remedy for the nation?  November 3rd."
2020-03-29 14:45,"When there are so many missteps taken here I blame the person at the top.   Donald is responsible for not assigning a czar to properly get the job done.   He did not want the numbers of infected known because it would hurt his reelection.

Nothing more."
2020-03-29 15:32,"Part of the propaganda machine of the Trump and GOP enablers is to prevent anyone from seeing the mistakes and disasters on the horizon, so that when something does happen, they can try to blame someone else.  Trump engaged in willful ignorance of events and conditions that would predictably lead to people dying as a result.  In the criminal justice system, this is the very definition of Manslaughter.  We have all heard and read AG Bill Barr's opinions spun out to claim that this sitting president can't be criminally investigated, let alone charged for his conduct while in office.  We have heard and seen Trump's legal team - including  washed up legal hack Alan Dershowitz - opine and insist that anything that Trump choses to do as part of his efforts to be reelected can't be even considered a crime.  

Hopefully, the next AG will revert to traditional understandings of the criminal justice system.  File those charges (Manslaughter and Murder have a slightly longer statute of limitations that Grand Larceny and Fraud), include as co-conspirators everyone of the enablers surrounding Trump, including those on his legal team and Bill Barr who were willing to cover this up.  Oh, and BTW, separate charges can be filed by state AG's for deaths occurring state by state.

Time to actually force responsibility on Trump and his enablers, even though he is incapable of accepting it on his own."
2020-03-29 14:37,"Maybe we shouldn't be so hard on the mistaken words emanating from the President at his daily press conferences. It's the source of his information that is the problem, messages that are misleading or down right wrong. But then again, Azar and other bureaucrats that fumbled the ball were appointed by Trump and are continually threatened to lose their jobs if the message doesn't fit with the his perception of the world. This story is reminiscent of the Bush Presidency's attack on Iraq, based on false information and still disrupts much of the middle east."
2020-03-29 14:47,And yet Trump just keeps getting more popular. We suffer under a President who is hostile to the majority of the country. We have Fox News who will never let the content of this article though. We are in so much trouble. My despair is complete.

2020-03-29 15:34,"How many times over the past 3.5 years have we heard Trump say something to the effect that it takes a crisis to bring the US together?  And this was his crisis, made to order.  It just puzzles me why he did not / could not, even a month ago,  pivot and say, on social media, hey everybody!  We've got this problem, and we all can work together and beat it by doing this, this and this.  Maybe the economy would not have been completely shut down, like Sweden and Germany.  Less unemployment.  The stock market back up.  All as a result of his steely eyed, no nonsense,  objective business oriented leadership.  What an incredible opportunity that was:  win the election in a landslide."
2020-03-29 15:36,"Small government, low taxes, private healthcare, and science denial seems to have been the wrong way to go. Who would have thought that 46.1 percent of voters and the electoral college would be wrong."
2020-03-29 15:40,"There was hardly any need to test what was characterized as a ""hoax"".  The virus is not Trump's fault, but calling it a ""hoax"" surely  was, and that bit of nonsense, apparently with a political eye to the upcoming election, is at the core of the early nonresponse, lack of testing, and subsequent excuse making.

The current pandemic is not a ""hoax"", it never was, and Trump is directly responsible for the laggardly response in the US."
2020-03-29 15:06,"American exceptionalism in action:  we can make better tests and don’t need to work with your readily available and ultimately timely and effective test, World.

Combined with Trump’s fear of using the easily available WHO test in early Feb because it would be so sensitive in detecting COVID19 that is would detect a few more false positives, and in Trump’s selfish, myopic perspective, spook the stock market and his re-election chances.  

And now here we are."
2020-03-29 15:15,"The expression we used when I lived in Vermont was that ""The cow is already out of the barn"".
I'm not an epidemiologist, but did study the subject at Penn many years ago. You need to identify the vectors, and isolate them. If you don't, then you have to assume everyone is infected. 
Not being able to test everyone with symptoms, and everyone returning to this country from infected locations has lead us to this universal social isolation and economic disaster. Thank you Donald Trump. Unfortunately, it was not a hoax. Unfortunately, the numbers infected didn't drop to 0 after a week.
God help us!"
2020-03-29 15:45,"The virus is now concentrated in population centers mostly in blue states. It is inevitable that it will arrive in rural america and predominantly red states. These populations already suffer from inadequate access and quality health care. These areas also include vulnerable populations more susceptible to the virus. When it hits and people start dying, will trump supporters change their tune. Whatever the case, trump, and by extension his supporters, own this crisis whether they accept responsibility or not."
2020-03-29 14:18,"Why is is that no one knows how to do anything in this country anymore? Is it that any sort of public service has become so demeaned and politicized that no one worth his salt wants to have any part of it? This is true for politicians as well as for public servants.

2020-03-29 14:26,We will be having trials against these elected officials for years after the full extent of their betrayal is brought out in the open.
2020-03-29 14:32,"To me, this is analogous to the Catholic church priest scandal. The leadership who knew what was happening, but chose to ignore and conceal the facts as to not shine a light on it causing much damage to it's reputation.  It's congregation are the victims having to defend themselves and their beliefs in spite of the offenses from the top. Good people who were deceived, yet remain committed to their faith.  Now we have many good Republican citizens who are carrying out the dangerous and difficult challenge of dealing with this health crisis in spite of their leader's initial denial of facts.  All because he had a ""hunch"" he might be able to dodge this bullet.  Rome did too, for too long."
2020-03-29 14:56,"As I watch Dr. Birx interviewed on Face The Nation it is blindingly clear that she did not answer any questions directly, but pushed the responsibility to states and cities. If her involvement is any indication of what the article documents as a series of poor decisions, I have little confidence that the Federal government will do anything but impede the resolution of the spread of the virus. She evades all questions and hides behind her position that data is insufficient to make any conclusions, rather than being an advocate for widespread testing, much less the timely delivery of equipment to treat the virus. 

What is unsaid, but probably at the center of the failure to test in early February or even early March is Trump's dismissal of the virus threat. That is probably why he has deemed deliberations as confidential. When the truth comes out I suspect that we will learn that Trump was the reason we did not actually test thousands of people in February to acknowledge the severity of the virus. He did not want the ""numbers"" to be known. Sounds vey cynical, but what else can I conclude from Trump who has not expressed the humanity that would have allowed him to grasp the seriousness of the pandemic. That he still has supporters attacking scientists and doctors without denouncing them is every thing that we have to know about Trump. And, oh yes, he does denounce ANY responsibility for the spread of the virus."
2020-03-29 14:30,"Misinformation or disinformation spread by commentators particularly by Fox who dismissed a woman commentator after outcry who suggested the left was using this to demean Trump but allowed Sean Hannity free rein who continues to dismiss science,  accusing the left or Democrats of weaponizing coronavirus to score points and victimize Trump.  He's not muzzled. Yet, Hannity's treatment of science, using this outbreak to foster hate against democrats, downplaying the the virus's impact. Individuals claimed this was like the flu or a bad cold because of what they heard on Fox until large numbers began to at least make them question safety.    Social media has attempted to curate some of the comments but still propagate distribution of incomplete, distorted information. The number of people sharing someone's uncle/friend/neuroscientist/MD/I'm a nurse/theory and what to do to protect yourself as if this is what everyone needs instead of posts from recognized Medical Centers of Excellence/CDC. Propagating erroneous cures that have led to death by allowing posts on those topics. If they can tract breastfeeding images and delete them, don't suggest they can't  delete/remove that propaganda.Yes a failure to test, demand tests, recognize that Trump's efforts to distort the truth now continues to obscure reality all vitally important but so is responsible dissemination of information. Disasters get worse because of multiple failures; let's hold all the major players responsible."
2020-03-29 15:24,"This whole testing thing is really beside the point. I live in Zhengzhou, China. We had 2 cases. 9 weeks ago we locked down. Not long there occasional lockdown - like you are boiling water so you can drink it lock down. 

Isolation was the key in defeating this virus in China. NOT TESTING. Sure we got temp scans and QR checks. But it was isolation and determination that beat it. It's hard to stay at home for 9 weeks and sit on the same couch. BUT YOU DO IT."

2020-03-29 15:07,"Open your windows.  Don’t open your windows.  Wearing a mask won’t make a difference.  People should consider wearing a mask.  The government should enforce a travel ban of people leaving NY, NJ and Connecticut; the government should not compel a travel ban.

This may be the only positive coming out of this historic event; it’s been three generations past since the last pandemic and on a practical basis, we’re not very well versed on what to do.   Fortunately we’ll have most of that part figured out by the time this comes back around in the 2021 flu season."
2020-03-29 15:14,"""Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a top government scientist involved in the fight against the virus, told members of Congress that the early inability to test was “a failing” of the administration’s response to a deadly, global pandemic"".

An uncharacteristically imprecise statement from Dr. Fauci. A more precise response would have called out a failing of the CDC. Their epic failure make a widely available, ACCURATE test in timely fashion is well documented in this article. Worse yet, they prevented state and local agencies from administering their own tests.

That problem appears to have been solved but postulating that successful early testing would have made a difference in the virus spread is likely no more accurate than the early projections of 2 million plus deaths in the US. Anyone who has been to a grocery store (a.k.a petri dishes) in the last month has likely been exposed. The horse so to speak, long ago left the barn. What accurate testing will do is provide the metrics needed to determine those vulnerable to it as well as its lethality. Hopefully both will be less than our worst fears."
2020-03-29 15:23,"The CDC needs an overhaul, especially in its leadership. The CDC's raison d'être is to protect the US from a pandemic; they have failed the American public in a time of its greatest need. The agency needs leadership that can stand up to a bombastic President and take the lead in a health crisis. The CDC director should be sharing the podium every day with Tony Fauci, giving the public much needed facts in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 - as opposed to a President who spews misinformation in hopes of helping his political future. The CDC also needs to be able to move more nimbly during an outbreak, rather than moving at its usual glacial pace."
2020-03-29 15:44,"The WHO already approved a test. Had Mr. Trump or any family member of these agency leaders thought they were infected, I doubt they would’ve waited weeks for the US to develop its own test. 

The authority to cut the red tape lay in the hands of the White House. When the agencies proposed developing their own test, the administration could have easily said let’s use the WHO test until we have our own."
2020-03-29 14:39,This is great reporting. Thanks to all involved.
2020-03-29 15:16,"The latest data out of China is that the difference of the spreading of coronavirus between people with symptoms and without symptoms is very marginal at the most. We can blame others as we like, whether it's the Chinese or the President Trump. The bottomline is no one expected how quickly this virus spreads. Experts were all wrong about it. The narratives of ""the spreading of coronavirus in America remains low"" were almost like yesterday."
2020-03-29 14:17,"The German test could have been employed months ago.  But American medicine has long been hobbled by thinking, ""We have the best medical care in the world.""  We insist that medical advances in other parts of the world have to be retested here.  That attitude is what failed us so badly."
2020-03-29 14:18,"There aren’t enough tests. In Chicago proper, there are just two testing sites, one of which is only for first responders. You need a doctor’s note for the second location. If you lived on the south or west side of the city, it would take 2 buses and the train to reach the second site on the north side—that’s assuming that your doctor gave you note. With testing being that difficult, it’s no wonder cases are increasing everyday."
2020-03-29 14:24,"One lesson to be learned from all this is that lack of preparation kills. From the number of lifeboats on the Titanic to the number of hospital beds in Manhattan it is a mistake to assume that the worst case scenario will never happen and « Just In Time «  inventory will cover all contingencies. 

We must make changes in how we manage our businesses, our governments and our lives.

« Murphy’s Law » is real. While we have sadly messed up the response to a pandemic we should have been more prepared for, we should be resolved to make sure that this does not happen again no matter who is in charge. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best, bite the bullet, buy a new horse and lock the barn door before next time happens."
2020-03-29 14:34,"This article reminds us that the top federal official in charge of public health is not a doctor or public health expert, but a political appointee lawyer who made his name as deputy to Ken Starr on the Whitewater investigation. This is what we get when we vote in the party that wants government to fail."
2020-03-29 15:37,"In the U.S., the CDC projects about 43,000 deaths from influenza this season.  That's a rate of 131 deaths per million people.  The current deaths for COVID-19 per million in Italy is 16, Spain is also 16 per million and the U.S. is less than 1 per million.  And, we don't even test for influenza unless hospitalized.  If we could test everyone at the exact same time, we could isolate the virus.  But, we can't.  If we test people that have been exposed or those with symptoms, it's too late.  They've already already exposed others.  The article says, ""aggressive screening might have helped..."".  Might, but probably not.  Just as effective is to self-isolate if you've been exposed to someone who is known to have the virus or if you feel any symptoms.  If you're tested positive, you'll be told to do that anyway.  But, from less than 1 per million for this virus we have a long way to go to get anywhere near the severity of influenza at 131 per million."
2020-03-29 15:49,"This is simply a fundamental failure of leadership, management and culture.  Unfortunately, those things cannot be fixed in the short-term and we will continue to bear the consequences of those failures for the duration of this pandemic."
2020-03-29 14:56,"What I find striking in many of the comments is the focus on the history and on allocating blame. 
AFAIK the United States is far, far away from getting control of the situation both in reducing the number of new cases and in treating existing cases; there will be plenty of time to find fault (and there is a lot of fault to go around) once the virus is contained and people aren't dying.
The FACT that so little testing is still being done in this country is an absolute tragedy. Unless/until we understand where/who folks are carrying/transmitting the virus the situation will simply get worse and worse. We should be testing hundreds of thousands daily and not just those who turn up at the ER."
2020-03-29 15:04,"We're a data-driven society and see Covid-19 information in numbers and graphs...counting, counting, and making decisions based on these numbers.  Are any of the numbers real?"
2020-03-29 15:10,"If we look at this issue with a honest eye, we see that isolation is the key, testing may be to late to prevent spread. But when first proposed against China, there was lots of racial name calling and outcry from the left, go back and play the tape. When it came to lock downs in urban areas, more resistance. Now of course the finger pointing starts, play the tape of Governors and Mayors, not just the federal government."
2020-03-29 15:07,"And yet every day the powers that be declaim smugly that we are an exceptional country, the best country on the face of the earth.

Over my lifetime America experienced its apex with the successful moon landing and numerous medical and scientific and technological post-war breakthroughs.

But it's been downhill for the last several decades.  We are no longer a country able to address and solve problems: gun violence, under-employment, prescription drug abuse, homelessness, under-insurance or no insurance, a ripped and torn safety net, poor health outcomes, massive inequality and all the rest.

Instead of bragging about how we are not--the greatest--why not be honest about what we really are: a system just muddling along and undershooting our ideals by a whopping and heartbreaking record shortfalling toll."
2020-03-29 16:08,"This piece is a comprehensive list of factors contributing to our lack of awareness.

I could add one more: the myth of American Exceptionalism. Some politician (was it the governor of Mississippi) said We're not China. He could have added ""or Italy,"" which was in the throes of their apex at the time that statement was made. What was he thinking. Is our biology different or our government so much wiser. Could he not see we have a shared humanity?

On a personal level, I will hold in abeyance my nearly life long praise of the CDC. It was our premier institute for public health data and research; as an MD with a MPH in Epidemiology, the CDC was my mecca. Whatever the cause of its current weakness (was it the drying up of funding?), a strong, national public health institution would have been a tremendous asset in the disaster unfolding before us.

As highly respected as he is, Dr. Fauci seems a solitary voice of medical expertise on the federal scene and he does not carry the weight of the CDC behind him. I wonder if his task should be only to re-interpret and make more acceptable the words of his boss, standing over him. That, actually, is not leadership; it is babysitting."

The final slap in the face to Americans is the daily ""briefing"" led by Trump, bloviator in chief, whose only goal is to insist that he is doing an incredible job. Pence sings his praises.

2020-03-29 2:04,"We need to stop pointing fingers during the COVID-19 pandemic immediately. The answer is simple. It starts at the very top. No test is necessary as to whose ultimate responsibility it was to take preventative measures to mitigate the yet to be determined spread of the virus and the overall loss of life. They are way in over their head for this type of scenario. COVID-19 certainly is not an impeachment trial that they can claim as a witch hunt, deflect, deny, and be acquitted from. Settled.

There is no doubt the United States of America has some of the most talented doctors, researchers, and scientists in infectious diseases and deadly pathogens at the CDC, other Federal Agencies, Health Care Systems, and private companies in the world. The expertise and knowledge they have in this area should always be taken seriously at White House meetings. The vital official positions throughout the world, never left empty. Yet, that is exactly what occurred well before the outbreak. Having no one at the top who cares fully enough to understand the complexities of deadly pandemics, the terrifying catastrophes they can unleash upon society-this group of dedicated and talented individuals often face massive hurdles at the onset of an outbreak. Hurdles that exponentially increase, due to an absent stable genius at the top.

This pandemic is extremely serious. The distancing guidelines put in place by the CDC and WHO are a doctor's note that everyone should use. Please be safe, and take care!"

Obama’s National Security Counsel briefed Trump, about the task force it had created to specifically investigate and PREPARE for exactly THIS situation!

Agencies concern can issue all denial PR and clarification they want but this story captures amazing failure of leadership and foresight at every level of government. It’s appalling failure in judgement that makes the so called “third world” countries come across as superb. The only person, in this story, who comes across as a reasonable and thoughtful leader is Dr. Fauci. What strikes me as odd is the FDA and the CDC insistence on holding endless and useless meetings on whether or not to approve private sector testing kits whilst on the other hand, South Korea, basically gave its private sector matching orders to produce testing kits. Yeah, I know, FDA is concerned about safety issues but how’s that going with the failed testing kits from the CDC.

How did we end up being forced to shut down communities and the entire economy?

2020-03-29 5:35,"I suspect that Trump and his cronies were attempting to reap great profits from the virus testing kits. That is why they refused to accept the W. H. O. kits and also why they did not collaborate more closely early on  with South Korea and China to obtain test kits from them.  So at least a month was wasted during which time Trump dismissed the true threat that the virus posed even as the virus infected people in every State of the Union. By the time Trump was willing to publicly acknowledge the serious threat, it was too late to implement a preventative strategy except for comprehensive national quarantine and shelter in place. We still have limited means to identify who is infected or recovered from the virus.  The blame for the current national paralysis of our society and economy can be placed at Trump’s feet. Trump’s narcissistic greed, malevolent character, and incompetence turned a manageable epidemic into a full fledged American pandemic with a worst case scenario that millions will die."

As he said when he wouldn't allow a cruise ship to disembark which had active COVID 19 cases, ""I don't want to increase our numbers.""
Trump didn't want testing so he could hide the extent of the disease and his incompetence. While at the same time trumpeting his ""never been seen before response and efforts to contain it.""
Our officials, including healthcare, etc. are afraid of Trump so didn't stand up and push him to the side and protect our nation.

It’s pathetic that we couldn’t do what South Korea and Norway and Singapore did. Tell someone to stay inside during a pandemic, and risk getting sued by that person. Top to bottom - irresponsible and ineffective government, as well as many citizens."
2020-03-29 13:48,"Trump did not want a pandemic because it would impact the 2020 election.

2020-03-29 16:03,"Trump had openly declared “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters, okay? It’s like incredible.""  

This proves that Trump has an uncanny understanding of his base that he can say or do anything his loyal base will be rock solid behind him.

You can argue with solid evidence till the cows come home, of his repeated failure as POTUS,  but it will all be in vain. 

His base suffers from a strong “motivated reasoning”. It is the ""tendency to find arguments in favor of conclusions we want to believe to be stronger than arguments for conclusions we do not want to believe"". It can lead to forming and clinging to false beliefs despite substantial evidence to the contrary. The desired outcome acts as a filter that affects evaluation of scientific evidence and of other people”. 

Recall his triumphant tweet from Warsaw “THE WEST WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. Our values will PREVAIL. Our people will THRIVE and our civilization will TRIUMPH! Evidently he has self-appointed himself the status as defender of the West.

One could indeed perceive Donald Trump as the symbolic end point of Western civilization"
2020-03-29 15:54,"It is difficult to say we should have followed the model of 'pick a country' because every country is different. Americans are not used to blindly following government orders and cherish their freedoms more than people in many other countries.  So they are less likely to self isolate just because the government tells them to. 

However, that is precisely why, had we had much more testing early on, a lot more Americans would have realized that they had Coronavirus and all Americans would have self isolated much earlier than they did."
2020-03-29 15:54,"Excellent article in respect to exactly what steps failed us. It is also fodder for the Trump supporters as they immediately will conclude ""See? This isn't pResident Trump's fault."" 

I also have to wonder about the regulations that were put in place long before the detection of CV. While certain regulation is a necessity to protect a society against tainted foods, medicine, even regulation to keep the wealthy, wealthy, when crisis like this arrive, common sense would dictate that regulation needs to be set aside to combat the crisis. It appears that so much rule and regulation was at the core of this response to this pandemic. 

I tend to believe that we as Americans are also part of the issue. A litigious society as much as ours is was a cause for so much regulation. One has to wonder what will be the repercussions of this pandemic once it becomes controlled. Lawyers will be busy practicing law which is good. Better they practice law than what they are doing now which is practicing medicine. I mean come on! A lawyer as head of HHS? Only the best sycophants for this administration."

Just as Governor Cuomo must be asking himself if he did the right thing in closing down so many hospital beds to get more Medicaid for people.

Far better to use our energy to fight the virus."
2020-03-29 16:08,"A primary challenge facing any leader is that of discerning how important each of the issues facing the public are and then calibrating an appropriate response. No president can do that alone. That is the job of civil servants.

The presidents job is to assemble a high level team to guide the civil service in this process; a high level team that can competently assess emerging issues and marshall appropriate action.

How on earth can that be done with this President? The world learned very early on that President Trump didn't like his prepared morning briefings and in fact preferred Fox & Friends!

A few days ago Trump stated that the Spanish Flu killed 1 of every 2 who were infected. Not so. While statistics on the Spanish Flu aren't that reliable, it seems clear that the Spanish Flu and Covid 19 have similar mortality rates.

Americas biggest challenge for this pandemic is that of inducing Trump to use the powers of the presidency in ways that will reduce the death toll. 

That's hard to do when Trump is who he is, and his inner circle consists of sycophants. The public needs to step up."
2020-03-29 15:57,"As aptly described in The Atlantic, the lack of testing is the “original sin” of this crisis. And it sits at the feet of Trump and his inept leaders of the relevant agencies that could have handled this with the urgency and certitude it demanded."
2020-03-29 0:44,"Could it be as simple as this, that Trump wants to limit testing because high infection numbers make him look bad?  That we got started late because Trump just wanted it to go away.  A nuisance. That the  trillions for the economy and individuals is just buying votes?   So many will die because Trump didn’t want to look bad during election year."
2020-03-29 16:19,"This failure on Trump's part and his chosen people to lead governmental agencies was predictable. The stable genius came in to the presidency with a Rico action (both civil and criminal) pending against him. He managed to settle the civil part for $25M, and somehow got out of the criminal part at the same time. When will we admit, whether democrat or republican, that this man was unfit to be president from the day he descended the escalator at Trump Tower? 
Trump is incompetent, irrational and makes schoolboy slurs against anyone who opposes or disagrees with him. It's a calamity that this great country could not have forced him to produce his tax returns, which may have shown his Russian connections that helped him to win the election. Lacking leadership, he bends to authoritative leaders with dictatorial powers.
Trump's incompetence caused him to seek out incompetent people to surround him and admire him. I will bet that his motive for not attacking this virus early was his fear that the stock market would fall, and that he would no longer claim the illusion that his presidency brought the market to its heights. He relies on perception to Trump reality -- no pun intended."

Azar also downplayed the numbers. I was in my car yelling ""LIAR!"" at the radio. Altogether I find it impossible to believe any information that comes out of this administration except for Dr. Fauci. My state is ill-prepared if the virus accelerates here (as expected to shortly) because Gov. Ducey is as dishonest and inept as the rest of Trump's supporters."

It is easy to place blame on others, especially the President for this challenging but largely avoidable mess (as other countries, superior to us, have proven).  However, instead of pointing fingers at individuals it is time for Americans to look themselves in the mirror and recognize that this is our country, this is who we are and we are all responsible for this mess.  Americans elected Trump and far too many (unimaginably) continue to worship at his altar.  
To this day, far too many people, and not just Trump supporters, have proven unable to shelter in place and socially isolate, and insist on exposing themselves and others to transmission and infection. this society is incapable of adhering to this most basic requirement to control our destiny.
 This pandemic will have a long tail and cause much avoidable suffering.  When Trump was elected, Americans broke the system.  ""You break it, you buy it."""

Both refused to test, only people on death's door are sick enough for a test. My department of health said the same thing. This administration is keeping infection numbers artificially low by directing states and doctors to not test. Instead of slowing the spread and saving American lives, it's more important to keep moneyed interests happy about how rich they are. They told us sacrificing our vulnerable loved ones is better than the rich being slightly less rich. Dragging their feet at every step not to spook the market and hurt approval ratings. It's so bad that Governor Jay Inslee turned his back on the feds and acted independently to prevent their greed from killing his people. Mild cases are just as infectious as the severe cases, but without a clear positive the mild and asymptomatic are less likely to alter their behavior to avoid infecting others. Their friends and family are less likely to alter their behavior to prevent infection. My employer wouldn't give me a break because I hadn't been tested (I stayed home anyway). My 60 year old mom didn't believe me when I told her to stay away, she let herself in. She's sick now. The US pandemic just started and thousands are dead. There will be many thousands more.

Under the Obama Administration, By April 28th, the FDA had approved a CDC-developed test. On May 1st, the CDC began shipping these diagnostic test kits to over one thousand public health laboratories. (Each test kit contained reagents to test 1,000 clinical specimens). From May 1 through September 1, 2009, more than 1,000 kits were shipped to 120 domestic laboratories.

Compare Obama's performance to that of the Trump Administration."

I got a postcard today marked in large letters ""President Trump's Coronavirus Recommendations.""  About to toss it as garbage I saw in small letters in the corner ""CDC.""  Frankly, it makes me doubt the CDC when it is used as a re-election ploy to show Trump as a man of action.....when he has lied repeatedly about the Coronavirus."

I was only a small boy but I remember her voice on the wireless as she lifted our spirits and encouraged people to work for the common good. We won that war because of her tireless efforts and the leadership and wisdom of her husband.

Compare that American history to the present where our president decides which states get ventilators based on whether their governors were “nice to him” and “showed their appreciation”. 

Compare Roosevelt’s generous Lend Lease program to Trump whose threatened to ignore recent legislation and dole out the $500 billion allocated to fight corona to whoever he chooses with no oversight.

My home state of Louisiana is being decimated by corona but all we get out of Trump is nonsense and campaign rhetoric. Where are the Americans who won WW II? Where is the modern day George Patton and Dwight D Eisenhower? Why does our once proud nation ""cower"" in front of one sociopathic schoolyard bully?"

This virus was going to land here no matter what, but it in no way had to turn the entire country upside down the way it has, and the fault for that lays entirely with the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. The adjective fake has been woefully overused by now, but it perfectly describes that occupant.  The irony."
2020-03-29 2:30,"As I sit with the virus in Detroit amid many other friends and relatives threatened, I want to urge the NYT not to confuse the issue.  Not ""the Administration,"" Trump himself.

2020-03-29 3:38,"TBT Group Inc., based in Bellmawr, NJ, has been quietly creating groundbreaking point of care diagnostics based on unique ceramic materials it has produced over the past ten years. The Company has developed a biosensor that has the potential to be used at airports, hospitals, and other places where rapid onsite screening for the Covid 19 is desired. The Company’s test is rapid, easy to use, and can give a result in minutes instead of hours. This technology is based upon the unique properties of piezoelectric ceramics.T his material vibrates when electrified and produces a weak electric signal when stressed.When the coronavirus, binds to the surface it generates a weak electric signal that a handheld reader can pick up and alert the user. This simple reaction gives the test a very high degree of certainty that it’s detection (or lack thereof) of the target virus is accurate.TBT has successfully deployed this technology in a laboratory environment against other pathogens and is currently seeking federal assistance to validate its technology against the COVID-19 virus. Rapidly understanding who has COVID-19, and quickly isolating those people who test positive is key to ensuring that it is not passed to others. A fast test means that more people can be tested with the least amount of disruption to their lives and, if positive, the more quickly they can be isolated to reduce the risk of interactions with non-infected people, to slow the spread of the virus.

Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the lapse enabled “exponential growth of cases.” Ms. Nuzzo wins the prize for the understatement of the year.  The Trump administration is not only ""incredibly limited"" it is inept to the point of criminal negligence or possibly criminal culpability. Left out of this article is the fact that Trump and Senators were warned by intelligence agencies at least two months before the big wave of infections hit that this pandemic would create a world wide crisis.  In response, Trump did worse than nothing, he intentionally misled.  Now we know why the man went bankrupt six times, failed at multiple businesses, and bilked thousands out of money, through his failures and outright fraudulent actions.

Walter White would not be proud of us, or so I believe. The timing of the cook matters, take measurements (test) as it progresses which allows you to adjust as needed. Otherwise stop the cook and salvage some of the ingredients.

We got this wrong, we did not follow the known formula about the proper balance of life. Leading to the inequities established within the challenge of population growth, so of course we are in a crisis. On a global scale. 

Many of us feel that there is something that can be salvaged. Please join me in committing to using science as the basis for decisions that are now needed at the global scale."
2020-03-28 23:15,"From the beginning this was a numbers game for the President. He didn’t want to know the true scale of the problem. He didn’t want people disembarking from the cruise ship because it would increase the cases here. The more we diagnose, the more the stocks will plummet....numbers! You live by the numbers, you die by the numbers since at the current infection and death rate jobless numbers and unemployment rate will sky rocket before the next election.

2020-03-29 11:35,"There are 584 comments out now, which means 584 people are going to have stated the obvious, just as I am.

The government disbanded the Pandemic Response Team. That is the group that would have had a plan in place already, identified key organizations tasked to help; identified and communicated key tasks that each organization would have been charged with. It is the group that would have created communications for state departments of health; for medical practices and hospitals. 

It is the group that would have sent out directives for early community spread including highlighting, counting and monitoring respiratory illnesses,even untested. 

It would have supervised the roll out of testing, and determined alternative paths when tests did not meet the schedule.

It would have coordinated the whole response, rapidly, because a coordinated plan would have already been in place, ready to be modified and updated to suit the situation.

This was a failure of Trump. This was a failure of GOP philosophy in which **only** tax breaks and federal courts have precedence. This was a failure of Reaganite conservatism, Grover whathisname's bathtub and the Tea Party ideology, and a failure of everyone out there who voted on a single issue like guns or abortion and dismissed the damage that incompetence will bring to reality.

This was a failure of half of America, and all of the country will pay for it."

Of course there are small cities across the country that haven't been hit as heavily as NYC, but consider the population.   Putting a shelter-in-place order for a specific time would only help and not hurt.  We can only hope it's not too little too late, considering he (trump) was so cavalier and  flippant at the outset.

This is a case of national security. He who is not responsible, is also buddies with Putin, and any number of other dictators. He is also not buddies with our previous Allies. 

All it takes is the leader of a nation to be ""not responsible"", and a national security problem gets out of control. As the saying goes, ""a company will never rise above the level of its leader""."
2020-03-28 21:09,"The US has a pandemic playbook and planning for this exact scenario, yet we all know what happened with that.  Also, Taiwan though very close to China and stifled from early involvement in Wuhan for investigation began implementing an advanced strategy with detailed lessons learned from SARS in late December early January screening travelers and restricting travel from China, activating an emergency central command and using data to fight a potential pandemic.  They have effectively controlled the contagion. Though there are of course differences intelligent action and leadership can save lives if enacted quickly. Stanford has hailed this as a model for success, so it is possible it can be done, just a tragedy for us that we have weakened and highly politicized federal leadership."

One of them was bringing two prominent Republicans into his Cabinet in 1940.

All of this occurred in the face of virulent impediments thrown up by isolationists in both parties.

Notably in the aftermath of the presidential election of 1940 the defeated Republican nominee offered his services to President Roosevelt.  A so Wendell Willkie became FDR’s roving ambassador to the allied nations.

Specialized hen teams—gone. The established ways of the hens, developed over centuries—gone. Really hens were just props. Over time, the henhouse stopped functioning like a henhouse and fell into a shammy state. A sleep state. Only the roosters who crowed with gusto about the fox’s greatness remained. 

One day, about three months ago, in a faraway land (a rival henhouse)—a huge natural disease struck. While hens of the world had seen diseases before, this one was new. Big. Scary. The fox secretly smiled. It made a competing fox’s numbers look bad. And all was “beautiful” said the fox. In fact the fox was gleeful. He got more and more time in front of the national mirror. Mirror, mirror on the wall—who’s the most beautiful of them all? “You,” said the only remaining hens and roosters. You. You. You they crowed dozens of times. 

The fox smiled. Yes, he noticed a few hens were dying. But that paled in comparison to This Great Moment of reality TV.

The sky is falling, said one hen. And she was correct. She was banished. 

Across the land roosters, hens, chicks and eggs were dying. 

Small henhouses thrummed day and night to save the hens. Efforts of remarkable proportion and selfless love.

Jan was crucial, but February was critical, and the Senate rendered its verdict February 5. Did the bumbling White House team spring into action? No, they continued to ""see no evil, hear no evil"" until March.

The 9/11 commission put a heavy weight on a ""failure of imagination"" to detect the signs of the coming disaster. In this disaster I'm guessing history will add ""a USA great hubris"" that refused to learn lessons from other countries and an insular culture that discounted and declined to inquire of previous administrations on how to combat pandemics (remember Ebola and H1B1) that can be entitled a ""lack of curiosity.""

Feb 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” 
Feb 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this.  But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.” 
Mar 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it ... Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

Instead of making our country great, trump is causing us to fall ill and stumble as a national disgrace. It will hopefully be up to the Democrats to clean up the mess, as usual. Thank goodness Obama was president during Ebola in’14, we sent our military in to do battle with that virus and they beat back that pathogen so it would not reach us here. I traveled to West Africa in early’15 where there were serious health checks at every border we crossed and when here when I returned. As of 3 weeks ago, I know people were flying into JFK from Milan with no temperature or health checks.

What a genius, Trump knew all along he was contributing to a pandemic. Just three weeks ago, he threw a giant ""family"" party at Mar-A-Lago and dragged along the President of Brazil to make sure we paid $ multi-million taxpayer dollars for his junket. Trump and his guests were all exposed to Covid19, but not all admitted they are infected. He took along the VP, this was not prudent.

Why in particular would Obama allow consolidation within the medical field, inimical to reduced costs in healthcare, a primary focus of his administration? Why would Obama allow hospital systems to also consoldiate as highlighted too in the article? There was eight years for Obama to get this done and he didn't. Substitute 'US government' for Obama if you'd like.

The richest country in the world became a failed state in less than four years. Maybe the virus will wake people up: if you elect officials who shun public service and hate government, don't be surprised when there isn't one when you really need it.

Inside the store, it feels creepy.  Where 80-100 people might be shopping, only 30 at a time.  A woman sneezes.

I think that will be the memory I will always carry from this pandemic.  People stop and stare.  The look on her face is...  Embarrassment?  Fear?  Terror?  Where can she get tested?  Where can any of us get tested?  

Another morning standing in line again, we ask one another: how did it come to this?

Can someone ask Governor Cuomo who is being tested in New York, how many tests are being done per day and what is the criteria to be tested? If I don't fit the criteria to be tested, who does? NBA players?"

And just how clueless is he? Well, he doesn’t know when he should let the experts take center stage. And worse, he can’t help injecting himself and his nonsensical ideas into the conversation sending mixed messages that his clueless followers will believe.

This is leadership, Trump style. In this crisis he has made mistake after mistake … every day that he did not mobilize against the virus, did not ramp up testing, and did not release Federal stockpiles of masks and ventilators was a mistake, a deadly mistake that likely cost many lives as the plague was allowed to proliferate unchecked. He handles most issues similarly and with his characteristic “gut” decisions.

It's insane that we're doing this blind. Every person should be tested so we have a baseline. Tests should be widely available. You can't tell me that the US isn't rich enough or smart enough to figure out how to have enough tests. This lack of testing is intentional.

The slant on your home testing coverage that it is simply a “for profit” play or “not accurate” is too reductive.

After three years, the dysfunction, chaos and egregiously idiotic choices made by Trump and his handlers to ignore scientific evidence and even the most minimal reliance on rational thought, it was inevitable that a disaster was on the horizon. The only thing we didn't know was when it would happen and what it would be. It is now clear, it would be an epic pandemic that would wreck havoc, fear, and in many instances, misery on our citizenry and expose every neglected, ineptly run and hollowed out government agency and institution under attack since the beginning of this administration, by its own leaders.

The authors lay it all out for us. How and why it happened. There was the willful ignorance that characterized the pack of lies the president told the nation every minute, every hour he stood before us to shape his false narrative that all was under control, that the virus would ""disappear"" or it was a Democratic ""hoax""  when in reality,  nothing was being done because no one knew what to do.

The government had ceased to function when crisis struck. It is run by a bunch of amateurs who were shockingly uninformed and unqualified and whose only credential was blind allegiance to a president who is totally clueless about the most basic functions of the federal government. To say that he alone is responsible for this complete and total dereliction of duty is understatement."

Perhaps the biggest fault was hubris. Thinking we are the smartest nation on earth, we failed to learn immediately what China and South Korea already knew from painful experience. The pandeic team was disbanded. Second best is not wotking.

As we now understand this virus, with a lack of symptoms for many days, we have no clue who the carriers are. Our only defense is compliance with distancing. We fail to remind Americans up to 10 times the numbers of known infections are out there undetected. Our biggest defense now is judgment, both official and personal. And empathy where it exists.

The sad truth is disease doesn't kill the shortsighted and stupid. It kills the vulnerable. It's the shortsighted and stupid that are the delivery system. And in our case, that started at the top, propelled by a party that saw government and expertise as too expensive. To the point that we no longer appoint the best people, but those connected who echo what the disdainful want to hear. An institutional failure that can now be measured in lost lives and the prospect that we cannot even see what incompetence has unleashed that will inevitably still play out.

While there is some risk that the presence of the antigens does not guarantee immunity, it identifies people whose immune systems successfully fought off the virus. Put them back to work now, focusing on health and food supply chains.

We live in such a data driven society, and the data from these tests will drive our recovery, both economic and health-wise, moving forward. The fact that we didn't have this data soon is just that, a fact. We need to focus on how we best move forward from the present moment. We must include knowledge of past mistakes as we decide so that we don't repeat those mistakes. To err is human; to not learn from our errors is unconscionable. One mistake I hope we learn soon is that our President is not fit for the job of moving us forward from here. He is ""perfect"", which means he is incapable of learning.

I wish to God we had a Parliamentary system now that allowed for a vote of no confidence. Being unfit for office is not a high crime or misdemeanor, so impeachment won't work.

Ok President Trump we in the states will handle the issue. Give States the authority to issue municipal bonds which bear the full faith and crediit  of the US Government.  If states default on these general obligation bonds  the US Government will provide the backing.

Demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of an authoritarian regime (or as some claim a totalitarian one) and a democracy/republic. It will take years or decades to get a final assessment of the fallout.

In the People's Republic of China, fear of being the messenger who brings bad news resulted in the provincial authorities covering up the emerging viral threat. At least one ministry in Beijing contributed to the cover up. 
Once it became a pandemic though, Beijing stepped up to the plate and mobilized its resources to contain and suppress it. They've also mobilized industry to produce what they need and have turned China into a literal fortress to prevent a new wave of infections from overseas.

Here in the United States, the failure was due to inflexible regulations, overconfidence in our abilities, and a White House that for various reasons refused to do what was necessary in the first two months. Now we have a disease that has spread from coast to coast, border to border, and city to the countryside.

Unfortunately, given the acute shortage of COVID-19 test kits, testing crew members before they commence assignments working in close proximity with one another aboard a ship is probably not a realistic option."

It makes sense to minimize the introduction of new personnel to uninfected ships, as any infection would be shared.  Seafarers absolutely understand this.

That said, orderly arrangements for repatriation and  safe crew changes must be made.  It remains the ship manager's obligation to observe the labor contracts agreed, the terms as mandated by national and international laws.  Bad actors are out there, and they will take advantage of the situation.  But the industry has worked quite hard to weed them out through procedures, laws and regulations that are enforced globally.

As soon as quarantine and travel bans are lifted that will allow the landing, transport and repatriation of seafarers, the crew changes will continue with all dispatch.  Everyone wants to be with and protect our families in time of danger.

Yes, it's not Home but it could offer some down-time. Get off, rest a week or three, pick up a new gig. Not offering real break is a key element of Disaster Waiting to Happen. 

New crew members could wait up to 14 days in the Sailors' House, too, to ensure they are virus-free before going aboard a new ship. 

Seems like there would be a way to have a safe compromise if the companies had a will to find it.

I agree with this quote from the article very much, although the situation sounds more like slavery than prison: “These are guys being made to do a prison term even though they haven’t been convicted,” said Frank Coles, chief executive officer of the Wallem Group, which provides crews for ships. “I know that sounds dramatic, but that’s essentially what’s going on.”"

Each of these professionals has an elevated stature in our societies because they have taken on a role that has an obligation of duty. They are obligated to do more, sometimes a lot more, than are others. In health care some of those professionals may lose their lives in the course of discharging that obligation.

Yes this is a tricky situation but continuing to operate with worn-out crews can have serious consequences. There is a direct correlation between fatigue and increased possibility of an accident￼. Groundings, spills, collisions￼, equipment damage, injuries, etc...it is a long list. Governments and maritime authorities need to step in and allow for reliefs of crew members that are due off.

Individuals that choose to go to sea for a living is voluntary not required. That being said, an abundance of merchant mariners lost their lives during WWII. They too were there voluntarily. However, some individuals that took to the high seas were not the best citizens and were given a choice; go to sea or go to jail! There are work hour/rest period requirements on vessels.

So let them off. However, how will they be replaced? That, it seems to me, is the problem. Even if replacements can be flown to where the ship is (may be difficult due to travel restrcitions), there is then the possibility someone may take the virus on board. Then we have an even worse problem for the rest of the crew. Maybe the best solution is to give them a big bonus when it's all over."

However, if they were to be repatriated, and a new crew come to replace them, you then run into the global travel nightmare.  None of these ships are starting, or returning to the crews home port in all likelyhood, so they cant bank on the ship sailing back home for them to get off.   

These are wildly unusual times, but they are better off staying on board, and lengthening their scheduled work period by a few extra months until we get to the other side.  As the article noted - they are getting paid.

My far greater fear is that cargo ships start getting turned away, cruiseship style, from ports, and then global commerce rapidly grinds to a halt completely, adding to all the other economic complications we already have."

2020-03-25 19:21,"I was a mariner for 40 years, all of it on US flag ships, and retired in 2009.  I follow the Facebook group of my former shipmates.  This shutdown is one thing for those confined to their own homes but it is causing enormous stress and anxiety for mariners whose ""stay at home"" involves being separated from their families.  My experience is that mariners mentally and emotionally prepare themselves to be away for a certain period of time.  Going much beyond that drives many mariners into exhaustion, and I have seen complete shipmates suffer greatly.

I see a strong parallel between the plight of mariners today and our desperate shortage of medical equipment.  Both are caused by the demand of consumers for the cheapest possible product.  When I started sailing in 1969, the crew joined the ship in a US port, made a voyage of 2 or 3 or 4 months, and was discharged upon returning to a US port.  Those were The Articles*.

So I found this line in the article somewhat quaint:  ""Mr. Coles has been outspoken in his calls for governments to do more to protect their workers.""  Which government, Mr. Coles?  The government of a ship is the nation whose flag it sails under.  When that flag is a flag of convenience, the ship may never touch a port of the nation whose flag it flies.  Flagging ships is a business, and business has been very good the past 50 years.

They were not concerned about what would happen when they reached their port; they genuinely feared that they might not even reach that port at all. And in a North Atlantic patrolled by U-boats that fear was very real. Even ships travelling along the US east coast were sunk.

The governments of the rich are looking out for the rich, workers are being made to pay in every way.  We must demand safe, humane working conditions.

The idea of not providing testing and care to another human, anywhere on the planet, for any reason, is revealed as absurd.

America needs to introduce a universal basic income (UBI) at a good level. $2,500 to even $3,000 wouldn’t be over-the-top. That payment, of course, would be over and above Social Security insurance, because that is something that Americans have paid into and deserve anyway.

Good! The Democrats Stop the Heist!

I’d rather see vital national industries nationalized and their corporate management jailed than give in to the extortion we are witnessing.  No way should our tax dollars be used to bail out the irresponsible behavior of airlines, cruise ship companies and others who got great big tax breaks and immense profits only to buy their own stock.  Some of these corporations didn’t even pay any of the taxes that they now want to tap to cover their own incompetence.

Let’s hold these corporations responsible for messing up the American economy with their own shortsighted self-interest.  Let’s ban stock buy-backs and require that some profits be held in reserve for a rainy day.

Meanwhile, I hope the Democrats hold tough. Give the relief to those who paid those tax dollars … the working stiffs of America."

I hate to break it to them, but there are people who work and don't qualify for unemployment out there who could also use the help. Given that Republicans beat them to the proposal (yes, even if 1200 dollars isn't enough it would beat 0, but I can't underscore how bizarre it is they were the ones to propose this enough), wouldn't it stand to reason the thing they would compromise on here is maybe expanding that aspect of the bill?"

In recent decades, and most spectacularly under the McConnell Trump regime, Republicans stoke racial discord to sow division, while perpetrating tax schemes which set the wealthy far above everyone else. This ill prepares us for a unified response to disruptions.

Collective solutions to shared problems are decried as socialism. This iteration of the golden rule is treated as a demonic plot. While GOP wedge issues are enshrined as gospel truth. Poor whites voluntarily embraced ideas which exploit them. People of color do not have that luxury of choice.

First, go big.  The earlier recovery would have been YEARS faster, and less painful, if congressional conservatives hadn’t limited Obama’s options and budget (as Krugman frequently reminds us).

Second, make sure consumers and workers, not just businesses, are protected.  The financial bailout of banks never extended to borrowers, causing needless bankruptcies and home losses.  And it further entrenched resentment against Wall Street for unilateral benefiting from a rigged system.

That’s just a start.  Congressional Democrats remember this history and this is what they’re fighting to avoid – another bailout whose primary benefits go to businesses, not to people most in need."

We have a president who is a self proclaimed stable genius.  We have a senate majority leader who is more interested in helping the GOPs richest donors than he is in the rest of America's citizens.  The trade war Trump started with China isn't helping either.  Nor is his attempt to ""cheer"" us up by saying the economy will rebound and be better than ever.

What about the people who clean your offices, run the data you need to plan budgets and allocate resources, teach your children, nurse your elderly parents at home, answer the phone when you call for help?  Don't we deserve a bailout/ decent replacement of our wages?  We need to eat, take medicine, care for our families, pay our bills, and plan for the future just like you Senator McConnell, and you Senator Collins, and you Senator Rand Paul.

Bernie Sanders and progressives are correct. There is a structural rot within the American economic system that needs a complete overhaul and this is just another example in which the moment disruption occurs, the entire system essentially ""seizes up"" and without government help, can barely function.

The private sector, specifically engineering firms, have been tasked with building thousands of ventilators paid for by HM Gov. There's even talk of penalising virus profiteers, you know the ones?

Today I learned that he was in critical condition in the I.C.U. I also was informed that my 36-year old son, a physician, will soon be asked to help with the Covid-19 patients at his hospital despite the lack of protective equipment. Needless to say, I and my wife are also in shock as we, like so many, are drawn into the dark web of this plague as it engulfs our family.  It's simply traumatizing.  And as much as we are in shock, we are also angry at what appears to be what I call the ""malign neglect"" of Donald Trump who seems to care more about the economy and helping save the wealthy corporations, including his own, than helping those who are sick and those who are charged to care for them without the equipment he could so easily provide to them.

Educators are supposed to be informed of facts, not religious zealots who are in-fact political hacks.  I hope some of these students and their families will not be so blinded by faith that they fail to file a civil lawsuit.

If you are a member at a white ""evangelical christian"" church of this kind I hope you will finally see it is largely your denomination that has become politicised, and is driving further politicization of faith groups of all kinds.

He's also learned what other Republicans haven't: how to buy off the masses - in this case, the citizens of Lynchburg, VA. COVID will be over soon enough and Trump will fall, but the tide of climate disasters will continue anon, leaving Joe Biden the only thing standing between us and the Jerry Falwell Jr.'s of the world."
2020-03-30 13:59,"I can’t imagine an institution of higher learning acting so irresponsibly in the face of a national crisis. If I were a student at Liberty, I would ask for my money back and demand Liberty pay any medical expenses incurred by me or individuals who interacted with me who got Covid-19. All federal and state aid to that institution should be stopped, and all higher education accreditation for that institution should be ended. Unbelievable."

2020-03-30 13:58,I think It is ridiculous to compare 'Mr. Falwell’s interpretation of the COVID-19 virus similar to Trump’s view with both men calling it the flu. President Trump only called it this initially when the symptoms and recovery rate seemed to mirror the flu and until it was shown through more intel and data to spread faster than the flu as well as exhibit other differences.i have listened to almost every press conference along the way. It is amazing how the media distorts what was said at various times or takes statements out of context.

Pitting religion against a virus.  Providing no protection.  Indeed, it was an experiment - I suppose - to see if prayer was stronger than a virus.

There have been many experiments to see if prayer works.  It turns out that praying for a specific outcome is less effective than simply praying without expecting an outcome.

So beneficent prayer is the way to go.  If you choose to pray.  But as the old saying goes:  “God helps those who help themselves.”

2. If Democrats were powerful enough to bring about an pandemic simply to bring Trump's downfall, they'd have used their power to win the election

3. If Liberty is worried about people criticizing it every time they sneeze, perhaps they could base decisions on science, common sense, compassion, and judgement rather than o ideology, hubris, and ego.

""Persons are spiritual, rational, moral, social, and physical, created in the image of God. They are, therefore, able to know and to value themselves and other persons, the universe, and God.  [We] Encourage a commitment to the Christian life, one of personal integrity, sensitivity to the needs of others, social responsibility.""

Most colleges around the country took this kind of mission seriously, and were among the first large gathering places and workplaces to close.

Falwell's irresponsible decisions and impulsive actions contravene the principles of higher education.

But what's even more troubling is the way Falwell has behaved since then: denying and lying about fact-based evidence; politicizing his own mistakes (and bragging about them to a national audience), and lashing out at his own students and employees in vicious personal attacks.  

That's not appropriate behavior for a president of a college, and it belies the stated mission of his college.

He needs the money and is hoping the pandemic passes without wiping out a meaningful portion of his student body.

This makes me proud of the university in my city. The administration was proactive in planning to not have students return after break and in transitioning to online teaching. They made the adaptions needed for staff to work remotely, temporarily transitioned some staff to new roles as student/university needs changed, and began to make a plan for appropriate refunds for unused room and board. The faculty and staff are giving 100% to try and make this unanticipated mid-semester transition happen as smoothly as possible. Through all of this the university has been transparent with our community. As difficult as it is economically to not have the students here supporting local businesses (not that many are open), the actions of the university have likely been one of the reasons we have only 7 known cases of covid-19 in our city of ~111,000 people and only 15 in our tri-county area. I am certain this difficult but appropriate response to covid-19 is being played out in a similarly responsible manner in thousands of university communities across the nation. How tragic this is not so in Lynchburg."

I doubt Falwell himself was on campus pressing palms, sitting in lecture rooms, breathing in droplets of Covid19 coughed out by sick students. No, he will have been far away, protected to the hilt.

The students who returned, and the parents who let them, are also to blame for the new infections - what part of ‘stay at home’ don’t they understand? This is not a drill. It is not a hoax. It is a deadly pandemic that picks off the most vulnerable in our society in the most horrific way. Drowning in your own body fluid, lungs so overwhelmed that patients can’t breathe.

Young, healthy students may get over it, but it’s the height of selfishness to pass this virus around the community. I thought (stupidly) that being a Christian meant protecting the weak - what was all that about The Lamb of God? 

It’s despicable to have even suggested the campus should run as normal, it is even more despicable that people are so utterly stupid they don’t even trust their own common sense.

This poisonous rebranding of faith has catastrophic results without any concept as to how or why these ideas started. Their staunch Pro-Life stance is actually just a relic of political unification with Catholics in the 1970s (even the Dallas Theological Seminary was Pro-Choice before 1974), their viewpoints on Environmental health are firmly rooted in rural expansion and local government vs Federal government issues. Their dismissal of science goes all the way back to court cases permitting evolution to be taught in schools. Evangelicalism is one giant contradiction to all we now hold logical, and it does not even realize that historical origins of its opinions are entirely based in other issues. 

Now that fear of science (which brought my 8th grade science teacher to inform us that Lucy was a hoax by secularists and had already been proven as such but that secularists were hiding the truth) is resulting in illness. Why? Because Falwell cannot follow the advice of scientists and liberals who, in his paranoid mind, must have a secret agenda to destroy the word of God through safe health practices. 

This insanity permeates as much as 25% of our nation's identified Christians."

God, please let enough people see, so that they send Trump and the current national GOP into the dustbin of history. Let a new political climate open in this country, so that the thoughts and horrible opinions and attitudes of the Christian Right have no political power and mean absolutely nothing to those who we elect to lead, guide and protect our country, and we move forward as a nation with a government dedicated to improving the lives of the many, not enriching the few."

Jesus replies, ""Thou shalt not tempt The Lord Thy God,"" quoting Deuteronomy 6:16.
Jesus is saying, ""just because you know that God cares about your safety and well-being does NOT mean that you should do stupid stuff, thinking all will be well.""
A foundational Scripture is ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" also stated by Jesus. Ergo, don't bring students back in the midst of a pandemic - it's bad for them and it's bad for you.
As an evangelical, I assure you that there are many of us who use the brains that God gave us.  I grieve when so-called ""leaders"" of Christianity give us a bad name.  I am sure that God does too."

2. “…As…required by law.”  How is this different than the  Pharisees’s legalism? In so, it shows an approach completely void of grace.

3. Just like the Pharisees, Jr. speaks and acts as if they are an enlightened group there to help the sick, the needy, and the lost. They are sure to keep their “White Messiah Complex” in view for the press and media. Or maybe it would be more accurate to call it a “White House Messiah Complex.”"

My bet is that he didn't want to have to refund the tuition paid by these kids when schools were shut down around the country so he decided to re-open the school so he could say ""well, you could have returned to school and you didn't, no refund.""

2020-03-30 16:27,What would COVID-19 Czar Mike Pence say? This is a test of their Christianity? Students with symptoms may not be praying enough. Those testing positive for the virus may be gay or planning to vote Democrat.
2020-03-30 16:31,"The Hubris of Mr Falwell following the advice of Donald Trump shows how the Evangelical Community is being misled by false prophets. Christians will die because they are following leaders who really have no clue that what they believe is purely what they ""believe"" and not what is really the ""Truth"". Ye shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free.  Well we all know that the Truth is really never what comes from Donald Trump. Hope no innocents die due to the hubris of Trump and Falwell. They will answer to their Maker when that time comes."
2020-03-30 16:12,Nothing more dangerous then a leader that is a true believer in his own dogma.
2020-03-30 16:28,"When the tide goes out, the naked are revealed.' Mr. Falwell's actions do, in fact, reveal his naked priorities: 1. politics and ideology; 2. politics and ideology; 3. politics and ideology. I don't think this is about money, as some folks have suggested. His motivations, pure and simple, are ideological; how else to explain the immorality of his actions? Geez, Mr. Falwell considers himself a man of Christ. How can he square that w/ his actions?"
2020-03-30 16:23,"Of the 1100 students who chose to remain, the four seen in the picture saw no reason to stay six feet from each other."
2020-03-30 16:07,"Just like in the Bible. God sent down a plague open the University. One might see this as a sign that bigotry and intolerance are anathema to a true Christian. However, I suspect, the opposite conclusions will be draw."
2020-03-30 16:35,Fallwell just doesn't want to have to consider (gasp!) refunds and losing all that divine...money.  His greed is on blatant display at the risk of kids and community lives.
2020-03-30 16:11,"My husband, a missionary kid raised in the church, told me a story about his father and the president of a Houston Bible College who ""graduated"" to become part of Liberty University.  The father, occupying a position below the president, objected to a pending action on the part of the president as being immoral and not ""following in the footsteps of Christ.""  Prez did it anyway.  Father quit and we moved quickly into the lower social economic class.   No problem there, though, there's physical poverty and emotional poverty.  We had a lot of the former but none of the latter.

Back to Liberty, dare I paraphrase and say ""Giver me Liberty and give me Death"",  the moral virus that infected that Houston Bible School prez evidently made its way to Liberty."
2020-03-30 16:19,This action is criminal and they should put Mr. Falwell in jail and permanently remove him from his job as president of the university. All federal and state funds that this school may be receiving should be immediately canceled.  The governor should immediately close the school
2020-03-30 16:20,perhaps this will wake up the constituents who blindly adhere to their so-called leaders in any arena.
2020-03-30 16:11,"This is an institution centered on intolerance, exclusion of the other, and irrational belief in its self-righteousness. 
Their chosen course of action should not surprise those of us based in the real world."
2020-03-30 16:17,"Liberty University was never established to provide a college education based upon Christian beliefs. It was started as a business enterprise intended to reap millions in profits while avoiding paying taxes that traditional businesses are required to pay. Falwell's actions are anything but Christian as this news article points out.

You can't run a business empire if you turn way your customers, so of course Falwell welcomed them back and refused to provide refunds. This is a very lucrative business empire.

What would Jesus do in this time of a world-wide pandemic? He would protect his flock and not lead them to unnecessary slaughter."
2020-03-30 16:31,"Let's get REAL.  We are all in the same boat.  Rich, poor and everything inbetween.  Countries without boundaries, religions or no, genders, and ages and politics - none of that is important.  Each of us who distances and works or does not work from home has a role to play.  If we walk our dog around the block we wave at a stranger looking out their window.  We clean out our garage and set out items someone may need with a Help Yourself Sign.  Most of all we do not travel, we hunker down.  Share your wealth if you are so lucky.  For most of us who are not in essential jobs our focus is to make sure we do all we can to NOT take up a ventilator that someone else needs.  Stay at home."
2020-03-30 16:33,"“We’re conservative, we’re Christian, and therefore we’re being attacked,” he said."" 

Baylor University is not being attacked.  They've gone to online classes.  University of Notre Dame, Hope College, Wheaten College, and Pepperdine University are all Christian Colleges and Universities, all went to online classes.  All not being attacked.

The only reason there is criticism of Liberty, is that Liberty put students in harm's way by asking them to come back to college during a pandemic."
2020-03-30 16:13,"I suspect that the longer the  students are away from the propaganda machine of the Evangelical Right, the more students might hear different voices or perspectives.  This is about mind control.  They control the messages their student's receive and they control what students are taught.  I would be wary of any research that comes out of that organization.  

Trump and his allies have managed to gain control over millions of minds through selectively controlling where people get their messages and tightly controlling those messages.  Do you honestly think these people will admit that they were wrong and all these ""fake"" news organizations were right?  They can't. They will lose control. They rationalize, blame, twist, and outright lie-which is what Trump does.  Who will people believe?  

And people wonder why Christianity is dying?  What it says and what it does are contradictory.  They do not see it. They live with blinders on.

I have seen organizations that push their people to be ""warriors for Christ.""  Their training is closer to the religious radicalism seen in Christianity's early years.  Christianity was never designed to be a terrorist organization.  Those people do not understand Jesus.  They are blinded by their prejudice and bias."
2020-03-30 16:31,"I hope those young people who were urged to return and who did sue both Dr. Eppes, who presumably is paid to prescribe a course of action when it domes to preserving the health and welfare of people, and Falwell, whose greed is boundless. Not refunding tuition is one thing, but to deliberately endanger the lives of susceptible students is, in my view criminal negligence."
2020-03-30 16:57,"My son goes to Penn State.  They are teaching online and it is working well.  The university will prorate a credit for on campus room and board to return those funds to students.  Why can’t Liberty do the same?
They are both non profits

The only difference is that penn state puts student and educators first and making money second and I say that as a full freight paying out of state parent of a student."
2020-03-30 17:06,"Me thinks there is some type of financial incentive to remain open. Federal Student loan money? Not having to refund tuition monies already spent?  Regardless of what biblical rationale may be offered, it typically comes down to money with the far right."
2020-03-30 13:52,"Who could have predicted this??

When you deny the reality of science and risk the lives of others due to your ideological religious dogma non-sense... if there is a hell - you'll surely be at the front of the line."
2020-03-30 14:02,"So, another well known champion of anti-science, anti-intellectualism, and anti-reason ""goes with his gut"" putting at risk his uninformred *gamble on the lives and the future health of the ENTIRE surrounding community."
2020-03-30 14:28,I hope the parents and families of these students sue the hell out of this university that is run by a christianist fundamentist charlatan.
2020-03-30 15:05,when are we going to outlaw religious idiots?
2020-03-30 16:31,Truly idiotic. You can see why Falwell and his ilk like trump.
2020-03-30 16:51,"Name calling? ""Baggett Lady""? ""Dummy""? How Christian is that? Shame on you, Jerry Falwell!"
2020-03-30 14:08,"""Separate church from state"" - Jesus paraphrased

Here we have a clear cut case of Darwinism taking place. The Virus is a recently evolved new natural phenomenon. So it's evidence of evolution. Some of the poor students and religious right, some of whom refuse to acknowledge any aspect of Darwinism, are failing to adapt their behavior to the new situation and so some may die from the infection. If they have not already procreated, they will be taking their DNA out of the chain of life. Another example of Darwinianism.

The current events has science firmly subordinating  religions (shutting down religious services indefinitely). The fallout from this in the near and medium term future will be interesting to see. 

Falwell may well have blood on his hands. I imagine a difficult conversation between him and Jesus when the time comes. How could he ignore Jesus command to separate church from state, and so harm the children that have been put under his charge. 

Back on Earth Falwell may face civil wrongful death charges (See Judge Learned Hands formula for determining negligence - by that formula he is most damned, and I imagine some families will be angry, especially those victimized by exposure to students after they traveled home). I'm less sure about criminal law (its been a while, and I've never studied Virginia's)."
2020-03-30 15:20,"As if we needed further evidence that these people are charlatans and money grubbers in the mold of Elmer Gantry. 

Science denialism in the name of biblical absolutism is at the heart of places and decisions like this. Falwell quite literally believes in ""end times prophecies."" He does not care if people die because he attributes it all to a ""god"" who is sorting out the ""heaven bound"" from the ""hell bound."" 

... And people complain about Islamic sharia law."
2020-03-30 14:43,"Jerry Falwell is as much of an idiot as Trump. Neither one has the smarts to run an institution of higher learning, evangelical or otherwise, and Liberty may end up like Trump University because of Falwell's stupidity."

2020-03-30 16:30,"Stupid is as stupid does. Mr. Falwell's call to have students return to Liberty U. was not just unwise, it was plain, out-and-out stupid. 

Falwell is one of a number of right-wing religious and political leaders who embraced President Trump's early claims that the Coronavirus pandemic was a hoax... a conspiracy by Democrats to unseat him. These leaders have allowed their partisan rage to override their better judgment. 

Any religious or political leader who ignores public health warnings out of misplaced political loyalty to President Trump should be removed immediately. And if, because of their carelessness, these leaders end up causing mass illness and deaths, they should be arrested and prosecuted for manslaughter."

2020-03-30 14:47,"Yes, it all follows. Falwell's god happily had his minions kill all that lived, even the cattle, when the Hebrews entered Canaan.You could kiss you tusch good-bye if you were a priest of Baal in a prophetic prayer contest. Jr.'s Jesus accepted slavery as a matter of course. I see nothing strange about these folks believing their so-called god killing Chinese, Italians, Spaniards, New Yorkers, Michiganders, and other ""blue staters"" just to expose how vile libruls in this country and the rest of the un-saved world are trying to bring down the man that they have the historical ignorance dare to compare with Cyrus.

2020-03-30 14:49,"Falwell is a idiot. But the doctor who offered no advice to him committed malpractice. The students should pack up an leave. Now. For those who have no where to go, the university (if it can even be called that) should provide care for them until it is safe for them to leave. Further, as the school is not prepared to offer online classes tuitions should be refunded. Falwell claims to be a Christian. But he is not. He is nothing more than a con man. A sheep in wolfs clothing. A snake oil salesman. He sells morality which he does not live by. Hopefully this will bring about his demise and the demise of the institution and the students there will realize they have been sold a bill of goods. Clearly Falwell cares little about them and only for himself."
2020-03-30 15:01,"Seems we should be addressing this Falwell Jr. guy as dear leader too!  Seems he requires that same level of constant praise and deference as dear leader trump.

But it doesn't matter when it's someone else's life in the balance. And in his prayer-addled mind, what's the worst that can happen? The student dies and goes to that better place just slightly before the happy day of the rapture. They will thank him ""at"" the end. This is why we don't want uber-religious people in government.

To open his tweet with “I’m as right wing as they get” is his attempt to elevate his credibility with Falwell before he criticizes him. It didn’t work because credibility doesn’t persuade cult leaders.

Will Brittain ever be able to understand that he and his three children are members of a cult? Will this brief moment of disagreement with Falwell lead to further evaluation of the spell he is under? Most likely not. 

Falwell and Trump are cult leaders. They continue to weave narratives that appeal to their followers. Their narratives are not for the rest of us. They are only for the purpose of giving followers reasons to ‘keep the faith’. Thus we hear from both Falwell and Trump that criticism of them is for the purpose of discrediting Liberty University and/or to persuade people to not vote for Trump. 

These are cult leaders, not empathetic human beings. The purpose of cult leaders is to maintain followers, not to save lives. The sooner we accept that, the better off we will be because we can then stop turning to these men expecting them to help the rest of us or make decisions in others’ best interests. They simply do not have the capacity to do so and never will.

For a situation like this, even a qualified leader from the Republican camp would understand their limitations and listen to their advisers.   This quality is distinctly lacking with the current administration's leadership, and ripples with the legislators who are worried about trying to carve an opportunity with this crisis and with tone-deaf governors.

This will have major consequences to the every-day people, but will the affected people in the Republican camp remember to punish those who deliberately chose to do nothing?"

The first risks spreading the virus while the second risks overloading the local health care facilities, which is a risk he previously told officials that they would not face.

Certain hands-on classes like science labs are available for graduating seniors who need them this semester - and they are maintaining social distance requirements. A very few people remain on campus - most are unable to travel home and the campus is keeping a skeleton staff to keep them fed with take-out food only. 
Much of the Falwell quotes are from early in the month when NYC officials were still telling people to go out to restaurants & movie theaters. Taking quotes out of context is fake news.

There should not have been any consideration, be it religious, financial, or self service (keep my job), that took precedence over keeping those students safe, healthy and over mitigation of this virus.

They like the prestige that comes with positions of celebrity but lack experience and a code of ethics—and don't seem to care. Neither is a true leader. Both like the limelight, but don’t know how to react when faced with a big problem. Neither has problem-solving capability, nor will either accept advice.

Trump has few expert advisors to consult and distrusts those he does have. Dr Fauci has become the acknowledged expert, and, thus, is undermining Trump's prestige. Uh-oh.

Far be it from me to question the infallibility of Falwell's expert advisor, but his communication with an all-knowing, all-powerful counselor seems to be a bit fuzzy. So he looks to Trump who listens to his gut—and we know what's in there. Uh-oh X 2.

We can only hope that when this pandemic has run its course, Americans will understand that all that glitters is not gold, and value is not found in gold alone. Puffed-up charlatans should never be put into positions of power, no matter how enticing their claims. Our president was buddies with Jeff Epstein, and Falwell still trusts his judgement. That should be all we need to know about them. Republicans in Congress stood in the way of allowing the nation to discover the truth about Trump. We're living with the results of their wisdom.

The alarm is ringing.

I hate to think of these tragic deaths.  But death is one fact that can't be just shouted into oblivion on right-wing TV.  It is so sad that the deaths of these students (and others they have contact with) might be what it takes so convince some people that facts are facts.

Yet the prototypical image of today's 18-year-old college student is an adolescent with a drinking habit on a 4-year journey of ""self-discovery"" who is financing the fiasco on a public policy of cheap deferred interest debt.  The thing that needs to happen is that mold needs to be broken up to bits so we can start minting mature adults rather than man- and women- babies.  But instead, the government response to this crisis has been to extend that magical pixie-dust ""deferred payment"" line of credit to governors who are afraid to preside over what is an inevitable NATURAL disaster... and instead keep engaging the power of the state in questionable (from not just a Constitutional standpoint, but also a public health standpoint) actions designed to kick the can down the road.  If we can get a vaccine or a reliable respiratory drug then they will look like geniuses for stalling, but otherwise they look like peace-nick's who are unfit to lead in time of war.  Demonizing a university for allowing students to return is nothing more than a different form of passing the buck.  The sad fact is that structurally, our democracy encourages that by denying college students a voice in electing local mayors, sheriff's, etc. instead content to treat them like disenfranchised serfs."

Trump's re-election and four more year of gutted regulations (many of which protect workers and society) and business friendly judges are too tempting for those devoted to riches and power in this life.

But the fervor with which religious conservatives would sell their souls seems mystifying. Do they doubt the science? Do they feel they're on the right side of god and safely in his good graces? Plagues as retribution were a feature of biblical times, but hundreds of years of scientific and medical accomplishments after the enlightenment should have tempered such outdated thinking. 

No, I think conservative religious leaders aligned with J Falwell, Jr. are willing to make the same sacrifices among their followers (as well as collateral damage among those near about) for a greater goal.

They currently have an ""in"" with the President of the United States, who curries their political support and nominates conservative judges they hope will repeal Roe vs Wade. No one forces them to have abortions, but they won't acknowledge that there are moral people whose consciences permit abortion. They want to force their world view on the rest of us while simultaneously presenting themselves as ""the"" defenders of liberty. I was taught that  ""Love God and love your neighbor as yourself"" is one of the basic tenets of Christianity, and my neighbor is everyone in the world, not just the people who believe what I do.

One doesn't have to connect the dots much to figure out that Falwell Jr. is beholden to Trump. It would easily explain why Falwell so willingly sells his soul to President Caligula to buy his silence.

Our domestic students have been encouraged to go home but our international students who are in residence have been allowed to stay in residence. This is understandable - while they're encouraged to return home, they are worried about how online studying from their home country might impact their student visa status, and we cannot tell them definitively if their next semester (which we run from May to August) will be affected.  Some of them have only been here since January and they're still experiencing adjustment shocks to being in a different country with a very different culture. Besides all of this, I think it's inhumane to evict these foreign students from residence and onto the streets if they have nowhere else to go and no one here in this country to rely on. 

We shifted from classroom-based learning to online learning starting on March 16th. Earlier this afternoon, an email was sent from administration - we now have our first presumptive positive case on our campus, a student in residence. I imagine more cases will emerge.

Good for Mr. Pareles, as I'm sure the Times would have been just as happy to leave this attribution out of the report, and 2) The article does not mention how much the concert raised for its cause, surely a matter of interest to readers.

However, I found Elton's comment linking the current crisis to the HIV/AIDS pandemic to be wholly inappropriate, and a little disingenuous.  I don't mean to minimize the tragedy of the HIV/AIDS tragedy - it was terrible - but we understood fairly early on how HIV was transmitted, and how to prevent its transmission (with far less serious social and economic consequences than with the current coronavirus).

We all already give a huge part of our income away. It's called taxes. How about diverting some of those monies away from military spending (which, depending on where you look, is as high as 24% or out total taxes) and move that towards helping those individuals who are being crushed by this virus (and, yes, the foodbank).

2020-03-30 18:38,"It is a horror come to pass that the federal government is not trustworthy during a pandemic. Only Dr. Fauci and the CDC are trustworthy at the federal level. But Dr. Fauci is on a leash and the CDC is muzzled.

It's one thing to be outraged by this total failure of federal emergency management. But it is another matter to figure out what to do about it. The power is in our hands, not the feds.

You should have confidence that state and local governments are handling this emergency as well as is possible. I say that as someone with advanced certificates in emergency management.

Most state leaders have figured out how to deal with Trump's lies and posturing. You are empowered to protect yourself. Stay in your home as much as possible (only essential shopping or isolated walks). Do NOT allow any visitors in your home.

This is a marathon against a deadly and powerful pandemic. You should be planning to isolate for two months. In the final analysis, only you can protect yourself. At this stage of the pandemic, please ignore the clown show in Washington.

I never imagined in all my emergency management training that I would ever ever write something like this. But, before Trump was elected, I could have never imagined that the federal emergency response could be so utterly incompetent."
2020-03-30 18:11,"Responsible news media must stop airing these events live.  We can wait a couple of hours for highlights coverage.

I'm convinced these events are being thoroughly stage managed, just as campaign rallies are.  I believe Trump is getting his right wing media reporters' soft ball questions ahead of time and prepped for them.  I believe other main stream media journalists, like Alcindor of NPR, Acosta and Diamond of CNN, are included precisely to provide opportunities for Trump's inveterate bashing of our professional journalists and the news media outlets for which they work.  

Please stop giving Trump free air time to campaign shamelessly. He's using this public health crisis as a vehicle for self promotion, which is obscene."
2020-03-30 18:19,Free MAGA rallies.  I can't watch him anymore for anything.  He has destroyed his credibility for everything his office stands for.  Lord knows the rest of the world turned him off long ago.
2020-03-30 18:05,"I look forward to this ""prime-time star"" and his newest ""reality TV show/press conferences"" to be permanently cancelled come November 3rd."
2020-03-30 18:12,Networks and NPR should stop airing these Trump briefings live and simply report on any important updates.  Deny Trump the media spotlight.
2020-03-30 18:47,I prefer the 11am Andrew Cuomo briefing. Much better with a grown up hosting the show.
2020-03-30 19:05,"Until just a few weeks ago, I was one of those who joined the herd of ‘trump haters’ without knowing the facts. I wept when Clinton lost in 2016 
 I watch his news conference daily. The article is spot on! It is quite entertaining to hear Trump , and his aids speak. Dr Fauci is the star of the show!  As a sensible person , I have come to conclude that  Trump is overly optimistic and that strikes the cord for someone like me . I am voting for him come November"
2020-03-30 19:09,Good article. This just shows that the “wartime president “ views the pandemic as a public relations crisis not a public health crisis. Tv can solve the first but not the second.
2020-03-30 19:10,My disappointment of the Trump shows are only exceeded by my extreme lack of enthusiasm and dismay of the Biden show.
2020-03-30 19:25,Isn't this what reality TV is all about? Everyday is a new episode. Americans love it. They deserve Donald Trump.
2020-03-30 19:27,Please stop showing his briefings as long as Trump presents.  The major networks need to just let Fox news show his briefings.  His misinformation is causing more deaths and all he is focused on is ratings.

2020-03-30 19:23,"As an unwilling Trump watcher for the last 40 years￼ I can safely say that trump’s playbook is amazingly easy to follow. It is simply to create conflict and competition. He has done this in all corners of the government, judiciary, military, and legislative branches of our government. If, as he has done in the past,￼ walks into a room where he is not the most powerful person he simple gloms onto whom ever is and swears allegiance￼￼. Therefore his￼toadying to Putin no surprise. If he is the “executive“ in the situation he sets up ￼ a battle and happily watches from the sideline￼ until there is a victor and take him or her under his tutelage. Omarosa is a perfect example. He learned this method from his father who set up￼ the same battle royal between him and his brother who was the “loser” and died an alcoholic and broke. And tragically he has set up this game between us as a nation. ￼
And when he realizes there’s nothing more to be gained he will simply walk away￼ as he has done￼ in everyone of his cons and leave it to someone else to clean up the mess. ￼￼"
2020-03-30 19:09,"When will a majority of us get it through our thick skulls?!?
Donald J. Trump is not a president or a leader, he simply plays one on television.
He is the emperor with no clothes; a malevolent, calculating, narcissistic Chauncey Gardner; a snake oil salesman, patent medicine pusher and used car huckster all rolled into one toxic brew.
Of course Dana Bash wants to believe;  we all do.  Well wake up, my fellow Americans: Trump's great 2016 win is our American Tragedy a debacle in so many ways, and his abject failure to take this crisis seriously already make him complicit in uncountable needless misery.
There are only two possible routes for a deus ex machina during this terrible drama:
Trump could either succumb himself to the virus he once called a hoax ( this would be regrettable, an irony worthy of Shakespeare, the Bible, or Greek tragedy), or he must be defeated at the ballot box in November.  
Trump has proven himself:  we cannot have him remain in office for another 4 years, pretending that climate change is fake news; or that he is will keep us out of war with Iran or North Korea; or that he can stop this American carnage; or that he is anything other than a fake of epic proportion."

If this were done, Trump would be forced to resign because of public pressure."

If networks are looking to showcase leaders in a time of crisis, carry governor news conferences, not just Governor Cuomo's but also Republican Governor Charlie Baker and Democratic and Republican governors across the nation (north of Florida, at least) making up for the dearth of leadership in the White House."
2020-03-30 19:03,The daily media briefings are a form of reality  television. The survivors in real time.And the master of ceremonies is none other than the Donald. And he is enjoying every minute of it. Not ashamed to brag about his ratings during the worsts crisis facing America since WW2. We have always known that Trump was shameless. These sham daily briefings reconfirm that image. How about some real life television featuring a REAL leader?  Andrew Cuomo the Governor of New York State.

Dr. Fauci is the only one that I trust and he doesn't get the time he needs to get the real message across. What I have seen on social media in recent clips of these ""briefings"" are a bunch of various corporate types being paraded out on the podium and Trump still saying everything is ""just great."""
2020-03-30 19:35,"The media has got to stop airing these propaganda sessions live; the networks can broadcast clips later, with fact checking text on a split screen. Trump is using these as a substitute for his rallies, and there is very little — if any — actual news value in them, only fountains of misinformation and conspiracy theories that are putting the public in danger. Stop broadcasting him, period."
2020-03-30 19:38,"In lieu of rallies, this is what Trump lives for---his ratings (see Jennifer Rubin in today's Post commentary). These briefings have become ad hoc election platforms, full of the usual lies, exaggerations, and preening; in other words, a total waste of taxpayer dollars and time."
2020-03-30 19:57,"Trump was coached by Roger Ailes on how to use TV to promote his image and he never misses a chance.  To him it is all about optics.  I get the impression that Trump and his advisers sit in the White House meeting rooms planning the next photo-op, like posing in front of a hospital ship as it prepared to sail to New York.  He knows that many voters not very well informed make their decisions based on impressions, not facts.  To Trump, it is much more important to appear as a leader than to actually lead, even if he were capable. So far, it has worked for him but I think the bumbling way he has handled the pandemic might reveal to the public that his behavior is merely illusory."
2020-03-30 20:01,"He also uses his reality show -- and it really is _his_ reality -- to tell the nation what a great job he is doing.  How everything is under control.  And how he has shipped millions of masks and tens of thousands of masks to states nationwide.

Most recently, and most disturbing, is that he has assured us that if we only have 100-200,000 deaths in the US, that will be a sign of what a great job he and his administration are doing.  And, of course, why we should have four more years of his show."
2020-03-30 20:02,My thanks to the networks who have chosen not to air these disinformation sessions. If only more would follow suit.
2020-03-30 20:04,"Why wouldn't he love an entire hour of TV coverage for free? Most companies have to pay for that kind of time. He also thinks he's Johnny Carson - he's got Pence filling in for Ed McMahon. He just needs a band.

He turns every story into a positive PR one in which he is the greatest, the best, the smartest guy in the room.

Shut down the coverage, report simply the facts, and hopefully his only outlet will be Fox and Friends.

Just a suggestion.  

Sincere apologies if my remarks offended anyone."
2020-03-30 19:35,"He's already made the Democrat's most effective ad for this Fall:  ""I take no responsibility.""

This quote should be on billboards across the country, especially in every red state, county, and parish. Paint it on every outhouse, hen house, and barn. If you live in Trump country you should not be able to go 20 minutes from your house without seeing this quote in your face a dozen times.

He may be on TV every night, but he's a stone-cold fool, and a transparent liar"
2020-03-30 19:40,"Best live stand up comedy show on. Just wish  it would start at a set hour to make recording it easier. If  it's a 6pm conference the monologue should start no later  the 6:05. Do not need the talking heads on every show filling inn the time leading to 6 with any goes information, then have the real curtain go up at 630.

Cannot run a news conference on time but we expect him to run a country.  His Chief of Staff should just write in the schedule ""6pm tee off in the Rose Garden"". He will show up for that."

2020-03-30 20:03,"Since the start of the Trump presidency, the media has been aiding and abetting Trump's misinformation and falsehoods. This time is no different. Remove the camera and the mic, and Trump is nothing. It's that simple. Afraid to try it as you think you are only doing your duty as the media? Try it and you might be surprised. He'll be begging to be covered by the press."
2020-03-30 20:08,"I watched these little dramas for about a week. Filled with misinformation, grandstanding, bravado and unprovoked rants at perceived enemies, they made me angry, depressed and fearful. It was not so much of fear of the virus as it was for the incompetence and instability  displayed by the supposed leader of the country. After a while I realized that he was just gaslighting us. 
I’ve since turned him off and opted to let the press filter out the lies, misrepresentations and obfuscations and let them give me any facts should there have been any actually offered. I can always count on the press to also report in detail any facts offered by the only truth teller on the podium, Dr Fauci."

2020-03-30 19:51,"Thank you for writing this.  I now have the opportunity to beg all reputable news outlets from sending reporters who ask questions.  We all know Trump has no idea as to the answer to anything about this horrific pandemic.  Each question gives him the opportunity to be on camera--apparently just enough for some viewers to believe any answer is valid because it's on TV.  His shameful, racist and ignorant bungling of this crisis has life and death consequences.  Reporters should not give him the deference traditionally accorded the U.S. president.  All these reporters are doing is giving him a platform for disinformation, divisiveness, and narcissistic petulance.  Please stop!"

He makes random pronouncements in the morning with equal parts bluster and idiocy, only to take them back later in the day ... every other day.  In between, he pats himself on the back for the superb thoughts and actions that his delusions inform him of.  The more he shows up on TV, the more he demonstrates his utter thoughtlessness and lack of common sense and interest in the welfare of the nation.  He is worse than the pandemic he has aided and abetted."

2020-03-30 18:27,"So, the media's complaint before was that Trump didn't have enough press conferences.  Now that he's having them daily they complain about that too, and don't want to air them.   And the coverage has been abysmal.  How many times are we going to hear that the U.S. has the ""most cases"" in the world, without taking into account population.  Or how many times are we going to hear about how great China's response has been compared to ours, when we have no idea what the numbers are in China.   Or. look at the way the media refuses to even criticize China for its responsibility for the outbreak. The mainstream media just loves to denounce Trump and the country as a whole.  Note how when one of Trump's advisers challenges something Trump has said, the media treats them as heroes; when they support Trump, however, they are portrayed as being ""loyal"" and almost brainwashed by him.  It's just ridiculous and will lead to Trump winning reelection in another electoral landslide.  I didn't vote for Trump, but the coverage of him is absurdly biased; the mainstream media would never treat Obama this way."
2020-03-30 20:30,"It was really only a matter of time before the country saw a crisis that needed actual leadership, He failed of course, because he was too busy twittering and playing golf. So now here we are with a daily reality show while our country sees a health crisis, and ensuing economic depression. I'm sure the big wigs are all ok with it as they got their tax break and got richer than ever. Once said and done the country will have lost countless lives and be thrown in a depression that I predict will be worse than the Great Depression. All of this so the GOP can sit fat and happy. Thanks guys, you really outdid yourselves this time."
2020-03-30 20:31,"“I want them to be appreciative,” said our President of the governors of states requesting assistance. 

“I want them to be appreciative.”

Here’s the thing. This President has yet to appreciate that he, as the elected leader of our country, is the country’s first servant. His job is to act for us, on our behalf. He is to put our needs before his own. 

He needs to appreciate that trust and loyalty have to be earned. Some Americans gave him their blind trust and loyalty. Others, like me, tried, again and again, to keep an open mind, give him a chance to shine. All he has done is ask us, again and again, to appreciate him, failing to understand that we don’t owe him our trust, especially in the face of incessant lies and distraction. He owes us. 

He needs to appreciate that he owes us for the position bestowed upon him, and he needs to repay the entire country, not just his base, by unfailing effort to serve us all, especially in this time of global peril. 

We don’t need to be appreciative, Mr. President. You do."
2020-03-30 20:32,"Thankfully, our local TV evening news has stopped broadcasting this made-for-TV show. The other night, the anchor said something along the lines of: ""The President's evening briefing is going on. We will interrupt our broadcast if he says anything important.""  It was fabulous."
2020-03-30 20:34,"It’s time to pull the plug on the Trump show. Trump’s message is mainly political. If someone wants fact, watch Gov. Cuomo.

It’s time to invoke the equal time rule. He’s a candidate. It’s time to assert control.

BTW, I found a moment of solace Sunday watching the 2010 Duke-Butler tourney game. Then, bang, CBS cuts to a Special Report and there’s Trump in the Rose Garden. Pull the plug."
2020-03-30 20:50,"Rachel Madow had an epic rant on this last week.  Not only are the briefings just a reality show, they are dangerous because some people believe the things he claims and take action on them.  It's just a matter of time before some knuckle-dragger OD's on chloroquine because Trump said it was a cure.  His sycophants believe his rosy, ""back-to-normal-by-Easter"" story and ignore the advice about social distancing.  As Rachel said, stop airing the ""news conferences"" live and ""if the president says something that's true, run the tape later.""  Amen."
2020-03-30 21:03,"I would love for someone to keep track of and write about which reporters he calls on and what their outlets are. He rarely seems to call on women anymore--quite a few times when a woman starts to ask a questions he says, ""Not you, you"" and a man starts talking, for example.)  And some of the questions seem like softballs or set ups for his talking points. Am I wrong or did the cameras used to turn towards reporters when they asked a question in the past?"
2020-03-30 21:33,"""You can go a long way, in TV and politics, producing a successful reality show. A virus, ultimately, produces its own reality.""

Well, not entirely. The virus certainly frames the TV show's outer limits but there still exists lots of room for interpretation, speculation and spin.

And, of course, the corporate media is not obligated to run each daily dog-and-pony show its entirety. Given that these affairs are about 90% fluff, from a strict news perspective it would suffice to provide each evening a short summary of the substantive points. But, hey, the daily conferences are still producing big viewership numbers, so there is money to be made in broadcasting the whole meandering event.

Trump and the media share one value in common:  both ostentatiously pretend to be serving the public good but both are in fact driven by bottom line calculations.

Still, it would be nice if the media moguls could make it clear to Trump that the price of continued wall-to-wall coverage is keeping Fauci on board. That would give him additional security in telling things like they are. Would that be too much to ask?"
2020-03-30 21:34,"The media will never learn.  In 2016, they gave Trump billions of dollars worth of free air time.  I remember watching CNN one day and they showed Trump’s plane landing for a campaign rally.  Wow, that was important news.  And, now the media is doing it again.  And, Trump plays the media like a fiddle.  There is no reason, as Rachel Maddow said, to cover these briefings live.  All the pertinent information can be gathered and relayed a few minutes later.  And, why these journalists sit there and let him insult them (unless, of course, they are praising him) is beyond me.  All he wants are for them to be “nice.”  As if that is their prime function."
2020-03-30 20:20,"Ok, this is getting personal.  John Prine is no w on a ventilator! So here’s an emotionally driven suggestion.  What if all of the media he is accused of being fake boycotts these propaganda sessions and calls them what they are. The real news about covid comes from elsewhere anyway. There are many agencies and business that would step up and provide needed updates, and leadership is coming from governors and mayors anyway.  Let’s give them the air time."
2020-03-30 20:21,Is it just me or does it feel like we're collectively trapped in a reality show staring Donald Trump?
2020-03-30 20:22,Let him babble.  Eventually he will say something that will snap his supporters out of their spell and bust the trust bubble.
2020-03-30 20:57,"“by this pandemic, by this disease, this — whatever they want to call it, you can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know, you can call it many different names, I’m not sure anybody even knows what it is.” 

He definitely has an affinity for science; 13th Century science. He probably thinks that malaria really is caused by bad air."
2020-03-30 21:11,"First, the virus was a hoax until Trump realized that he could have free airtime to spout his lies and court his voters. Why spend money on a rally, when he can grandstand for free? He still spouts his unscientific view one week and then denies what he said the next week. He is back to insulting the media if they are not groveling at his feet. 

Trump's secret wish is for this to last for months so he can campaign under the guise of giving information. The president is not an expert on anything. He should allow scientists and doctors to speak, but he seethes with jealousy when someone else has the spotlight. He wants voters to see his name on the checks the government is sending out when someone else should sign them.  Trump denied coronavirus was a real threat until he realized it was a publicity goldmine."
2020-03-30 21:40,"If people stop tuning in, it will go away."
2020-03-30 20:32,"The press needs to level the playing field. When the Tantrum-In-Chief goes after one of them with rude accusations, they should all rise out of their seats and turn their backs and refuse to ask further questions. Anything else enables Trump's worst inappropriate interactions with a free press."
2020-03-30 20:43,"This is how Trump is conning the press into giving him hundreds of millions in free coverage again. 
He is campaigning, you can see his ridiculous impossible pronouncements are the same sort of thing he would be saying at one of his rallies. 
He is also setting up the excuse for his efforts to suppress votes in November. I am pretty sure his unusually bad handling of the pandemic has been calculated for that purpose. 

I hope you all know that not giving him free press is a choice you can make."
2020-03-30 20:55,His behavior on his nightly press events is appalling.
2020-03-30 21:04,"Now WAPO reports “Trump moves the coronavirus goal posts, pre-spinning 100,000 deaths as ‘a very good job’.”

Note the Art of the Con

1. Fauci correctly concludes 100,000-200,000 casualties.
2. Trump finally realizes his blundering inaction will cost him the election.
3. Trumps grabs (he’s good at that) the initially accurate figure 2.2 million casualties, and here’s the important point, if we did nothing to mitigate the spread.
4. Claim the 2.2 million will be THE actual casualty count now.
5. Trumps claims success, if only 100,000 die when it (falsely) was going to be 2.1 million.

I’m just saying. The con only works if the mark doesn’t know they are the mark."
2020-03-30 21:16,"The best thing every network can do - EVERY network, even the ones that support him - is record it, edit the true sections, eliminate the lies and the repetitions, and then hold his feet to the fire to carry through on his real promises. Lose the name-calling, the ""fake news,"" the ""it could be"" and the  ""I've heard people say....""  I've heard people say things, too; some are lies - many of those come from Trump.

This is not a reality show; it's actual reality, and it's being mishandled like a badly written reality show by the incompetent individual in the White House and his sycophants.

2020-03-30 21:06,"These semi-rallies by Trump should be: ""Trash-Talk with Big-Don,"" a take on Massive-Ego!"
2020-03-30 21:07,"Knowing his IQ is less than his weight - MEDIA:  PLEASE do NOT let ""Pinocchio of the Potomac"" continue to make us listen to HIS self-praise when ""informing"" citizens of our Country about HOW to protect themselves from the Virus.  He can barely read the 'breaking news scripts' correctly.  WHO wants to go down the TRUMP road to the disasters in which he is leading our Country?"
2020-03-30 21:21,Maybe we should turn the cameras off and stop reading pieces like this.
2020-03-30 21:30,"This creature is reprehensible. For instance, his reveling in his description of the ""refrigerator trucks, full of body bags"" yesterday was absolutely nauseating. He's so tasteless and stupid that I thought for moment he might get his stories mixed up and insert ""they died like dogs"". And then there is (or was), his imaginary, overweight ""friend"" who, in a heart beat, fell into a coma, poof !, just like that! Vicious! Wasn't there an imaginary friend ""Jim"" he introduced a couple of years ago? I wonder if it's the same guy? I keep waiting for something untoward to happen -please, live- that will bring this cringe-inducing propaganda exercise to an abrupt end. Fat chance - this organism is immortal."

2020-03-30 21:37,"To the media: Take some responsibility and stop covering this sickening clown show. You're only enabling him and helping disseminate his nonsense. If ever there was a time to say ""Gee, maybe we don't have to follow the standard playbook and pretend this is a competent administration,"" this is it. Plenty of us quit listening a long time ago anyway. Just. Stop."
2020-03-30 21:32,"These briefings start out like that awful Cabinet Meeting in 2018, when Trump went around the table and each person lauded Trump first before giving any information, kow-towing before the chief.  Nauseating.  Today, Dr. Hahn of the FDA, who is more responsible than anyone for lengthening the response time to the emergency in approving tests for the population, started off by lauding the President, and then going on about supplies and testing.  I cannot tolerate his sing-song approach to reading a teleprompter, citing numbers as if they were the greatest numbers in play when in reality they are a drop in the bucket in helping defeat this epidemic.  His aggressive attitude toward women and especially black women is disgusting:  he cannot be interrupted when he is misspeaks and is particularly nasty in response to anyone who naysays him.  Enough.  Why are we sending supplies abroad now when we cannot stock our own hospitals and medical facilities?"

2020-03-30 20:58,"The day this creep got a national platform, along with the immense power of his current position, will go down as one of the darkest days in history. What will it take for him to shut up and go away? It will be all I can do to get to that day, assuming the virus doesn't get me first."
2020-03-30 21:21,Then why covers Trump's lies live?  This is nothing but free campaign rally.
2020-03-30 21:20,"The press, including the reporters present at these FAKE press conferences, and TV anchors, journalists, etc., have to take off their gloves once and for all and call out this bronzer-streaked meringue-tufted man for being our grossly corrupt, ignorant, incompetent, racist, vulgar Caligula from Queens. He is the worst and most dangerous president in American history, a castrophe that was knowingly inflicted on the US by the Republican party, which only cares about pleasing its corporate masters, tax cuts and Neanderthal judges whose rulings will keep the evangelicals happy. The press has been way to polite and demential to this ghastly fraud of a man, and now it needs to come out swinging."
2020-03-30 21:52,"I do wish all channels would go by the idea that whatever Trump says may be news, but it doesn’t need to be broadcast live. If I am watching, I have it on mute until Dr. Fauci speaks and perhaps when Dr. Birx speaks. Sometimes I just can’t bear to turn on the Trump Show. Like today."
2020-03-30 21:54,"I have not been able to watch any of the press conferences all the way to the conclusion. I never watched a single minute of ""The Apprentice"". Whenever The Donald is speaking on any show, I might be watching, I will mute the volume. This president doesn't speak for me, he doesn't speak to me. I'd rather do anything at all then listen to DJ trump, tell lie after lie, and expect to be believed. The man simply cannot be considered as truthful."
2020-03-30 21:57,"To my knowledge there is just one Public Radio station that has declined from airing these daily, misinformed, political messages from Trump.  The station is in Washington State. If only the rest of the news media would be as  brave. I choose to watch none of it - the important parts are reported later in the evening and I don't mind waiting."
2020-03-30 22:01,"This was one of Donald Trump's ""Greatest tweets of All time."" Talking about his TV ratings when Americans are dying in a pandemic, laid bare that for Donald Trump, America is about HIM and the public exists to serve HIM.  Donald Trump is using his position as president to benefit himself and even Americans who do not believe in science, mathematics or evolution should be able to understand this.  The world needs to see the back of Donald Trump."
2020-03-30 22:01,"My husband and I play ""Trump Bingo."" We have a list of items that we check off when Trump says them. We don't really care what he is actually saying because it's boring and repetitive and worthless. Here are some of the items:
1. We'll see what happens.
2. Fake news.
3. He's a good friend of mine.
4. No one's ever seen anything like this before.
5. It'a another hoax.
6. We're working on that.
7. I inherited a mess.
8. That's what I was told.
9. Hidden enemy.
10. I'll find out about that."

Criminal negligence occurs when someone acts in a way that is an extreme departure from the way that a “reasonable” person would have acted in the same or similar situation. Criminal negligence generally involves an indifference or disregard for human life or for the safety of other individuals."""
2020-03-30 22:02,"The briefings are important news regardless of what is said each day.  The networks should absolutely broadcast the news - and not decide if its what people really should hear or not.  That is not their role.

Also, during the briefings you can see the entirety of what Dr Fouci and Dre Birx are saying - not an edited version...not an out of context version...but what they actually said and how they said it.  

Both of these Doctors are going to be remembered for their ability to steer this administration in the right direction.  It hasn't been perfect, but we may never fully know the Herculean job they've done.  Imagine what they've been dealing with as they try to protect the country."
2020-03-30 21:56,"Trump has shrewdly seized the opportunity for extended air time knowing that being seen an hour each day on prime time matters more than his blathering cringeworthy utterances, while Biden is in TV oblivion. No matter that I or others like me are revolted by the daily press briefings. Right now looks like Trump is going to ride the pandemic to a landslide in November. Who would have thought!"

2020-03-30 22:17,"This has to stop.  A friend of mine who immigrated here from Europe believes that CNN and MSNBC must love Trump.  Why else, he asks me, do they give this proven liar screen time everyday to babble a stream of unconsciousness with a touch of hate, pettiness, distraction, and deception?  They have to stop doing that.  I agree.

There isn't enough time in the day for the fact-checking required to counter the damage Trump does.  Any other administration would be expected to produce detailed plans - in writing - for addressing the shortages, rather than random anecdotes and promises of very very soon.   It is important for the experts to inform the American public, but what a burden on them to do it with an unrepentant clown stomping on their messages. 

CNN and MSNBC:  Pease stop broadcasting Trump.   We will get the message from smart public health officials a number of other ways.  

If I want to watch Trump, I'll turn on Fox."
2020-03-30 22:29,"Only one solution. Turn off the TV or change the channel when he appears. The American public should not be treated as a campaign rally, and lies matter."

I had imagined that things were changing for real in the US with Obama's election, but I was wrong.

If I live to 100, the NYT can have a story about how I avoided dying at the hands of The GOP. 

Just like those two women profiled today who avoided the Spanish Flu, the Holocaust, and other 20th century nightmares."
2020-03-30 22:26,My 8 year old granddaughter said to me the other day ... “I can do a better job than Trump is doing”. I asked her “why did you say that” .... she responded “he is so nasty to people”. I gave her a big kiss .....
2020-03-30 22:30,"As with much of Trumpism, many things are shocking but not surprising.  Obviously, many people are so scared that they will convince themselves that what Trump is spewing has just got to be the truth and that he has the competence his position calls for.  This is a very strange kind of deference:  Reject the qualified and embrace the reassuring but incompetent buffoon."
2020-03-30 22:17,"Just watched a little of today's installment, now with corporate sponsorship no less. (The ""My Pillow"" ad was priceless.) This is how you win elections folks."

A lot of blood is on his hands, and much of it was avoidable if he'd acted quicker."
2020-03-30 22:27,"The media should immediately cease coverage of Trump’s daily disinformation briefings. Now that Trump can’t do his clown show rallies, he is using the briefings to feed his racist, anti science, anti press, anti liberal, blame Obama for everything  garbage to his base. He is also using the briefings to have captive government employees and industry leaders provide testimonials for his great leadership. What is really appalling is that he is conducting his political campaign at taxpayer expense and at no cost to his campaign.
There is no doubt that Trump early on chose the health and safety of his political life over the  health and safety of the American people. In this he was aided by Fox News and other right wing media.As a result of his craven  choice,  more Americans unnecessarily have lost and will lose their lives and livelihoods.
Trump is still placing his political interests ahead of the health and safety of the American people. By giving him this free daily platform, the media is aiding and abetting his continuing criminal political activities."
2020-03-30 22:29,"Here's a riddle that had me stymied for a while:

Q: As the master of image, why does Mr. Trump allow the microphone to be placed so high that it obscures the bottom of his chin when he speaks?

A: So that it obscures the entire face of most other speakers, Dr. Fauci in particular.  Dukakis in a tank, anyone? Or Doogie Howser, M.D.?

This daily ""briefing"" may be the most shameless and despicable thing Mr. Trump has done on camera since his mocking of the disabled reporter. And tragically, it is precisely the thing that will get him re-elected."
2020-03-30 22:42,I can't help but feeling that the call to not carry President Trump's briefings conveniently coincides with an uptick in his approval ratings.
2020-03-30 22:46,"There can be two viewpoints about Trump’s increased public exposure in this pandemic. First, he can burnish his reputation for the better. Second, he exposes himself as the incompetent leader that he is. So far, the latter option is in strong play. People are seeing first hand his gross inconsistencies and less than stellar leadership in our battle with Covid-19."
2020-03-30 22:45,You just described propaganda under a dictatorship.
2020-03-30 22:54,"Excellent column. An idea... can't the media simply focus on what he DOES and DOESN'T DO instead of what he SAYS? Sure, you may write need to what about what he says, but keep that to the very end of stories, not the lede, if they're mere words. He will -- and does -- say anything to dominate a news cycle, and that allows him to dominate almost every one. He hardly ever turns his words into actions. For example, one day he's thinking of a blockade of NY, the next day he's not, but the media covers the utterance breathlessly for two days. He knows this will work and keeps saying whatever he thinks will dominate the media. (Also, be sure to write about what he HASN'T done, too.) An odd comparison to make, but think of how media covers mass shooters. They don't use the shooter names much. They don't publish the manifestos much. Do the same with the president please -- focus only on ACTUAL ACTIONS (if he does any) or NON ACTIONS, not his words. His words are a fake out to get media attention. Don't keep falling for it."
2020-03-30 22:56,"I haven't heard/listened to any Trump or Cuomo briefings.  I am too busy playing the piano, reading books, listening to operas on the Met and walking with my dog in the park.  I go to the supermarket off and on, everything else is closed.  I miss going out to lunch in a local restaurant.  Trump is probably doing the best that he can.  I'm sure that he will win by a landslide in November against senile/scary Joe Biden."
2020-03-30 22:46,"CNN, MSNBC, NyTimes, WaPost, they must all have a death wish. By covering his daily COVID-19 briefings, they are playing into Trump's hands, helping his re-elected prospects.  At the same time, they are hastening the end of their relevancy. They will be fake news and Fox will be the real news.

Those of us critically thinking types can simply turn it off but many in the middle are still listening and lack the skills to determine truth from lie. And, the fact that CNN et al broadcast these briefings could be seen as a tacit endorsement of Trump."
2020-03-30 22:40,"He's following Mexico's president's lead, who holds daily conferences since he started office.  At least with Trump the excuse is the Covid-19 emergency, our president began once he was elected just because he loves to live like he is on a permanent campaign.  This allows both presidents to dominate the news cycle.  In both cases, they have blatantly contradicted and undermined the doctors in charge of efforts against the virus.  These two and Bolsonaro are going to kill many people due to their hubris."
2020-03-30 22:50,"Why do you continue to cover these briefings? They are filled with speculation, half-truths and poor information that confuses an already weary audience. Please hold the WH accountable for these awful publicity stunts and stop the coverage."

2020-03-30 22:54,Trump has his own show again. On CNN and MSNBC. He does not need sponsors with these two networks. Sad. And he will then try to shut them down. How not to shoot yourself in the foot should be a topic the network’s management should talk about.
2020-03-30 23:34,"""I have watched NBC Nighty News for about 50 years. Over the last three years NBC Night News has drifted from journalism to basically ""both siderism"".

When I heard ABC News would no longer carry Trump's live news conferences, I switched to ABC News tonight. ABC News dedicated the entire program to Covid9 coverage and contradicted Trump comments with his past comments...I recommend ABC News."""

2020-03-30 22:31,"Unbelievable, surreal question and answer with Trump. Trump rakes Jim Acosta over coals for starters and then finishes with PBS Yamiche Alcindor-the reporter he loves to hate. She asked why testing isn't on par per capita for USA as is in SKorea. Trump not really sure what per capita means-goes into long drawn out explanation of how dense Seoul is and how vast farmland is in USA. Trump confuses density per capita with just per capita and does his daily refrain of ""USA is doing more testing than anybody"" like saying it makes it factual. A Hoot today-almost on par with Seinfeld. He than hightails it out before anyone realizes how confused he was--too late--we know...."

Trump manipulates the media over and over and over again. He has been doing it his whole life - lies and deception. And, the media falls for it every time. It is like they are caught off guard but something they know is going to happen.

I don't think Americans realize he is being inspired by the power that autocrats have, like the press conferences by Putin and Kim Jong-Un's control over the media, the old Chavez Sunday radio shows where he brain washed Venezuelans or in Cuba where Fidel spoke his own version of the truth. Even Saddam Hussein knew how to create his own reality show. 

And the fact that business people step up and blindly give praise to this ignorant despot is proof that Americans have lost their way and democracy is in deep trouble."

The onset of COVID-19 'you know the  nasty little  pandemic he knew was coming our way  all along  , but none the less  did nothing about has not  changed my viewing habits . Trump is persona non grata  on my smart TV and will remain so. 
'Though ' to use one of his favorite words ,  I may not watch him I still see and hear the commentary on the daily Time With Donald Show on the cable news shows . 
 I hear about how he lays into reporters who dare ask a question  that may cast him in a poor light. 
How his minions in the  White House control the mic, so that  reporters can not ask follow up questions. 
How he boasts  about his ratings 'ignoring the fact 'thanks to him'   half the country are locked in their homes' . 
I hear how he constantly fixes his hair, fearful no doubt  something might slip. 
Today's fiasco apparently featured no real news on Covid-19, but a slew of corporate types basking in their own and Trumps glory . Including apparently the 'My Pillow Guy ' who advised America to take the opportunity to read the Bible since we are all stuck indoors .
This all been said I pose the question  why do the Networks continue to cover this stupidity. I see NPR has  had enough 'of it'.  Perhaps it is  time for   those of us who have no desire to further increase our anxiety to petition ABC,CBS,NBC, to give us a well deserved break  from  Mr Trump. 
 If Dr Fauci has something to say fine have news briefing ."
2020-03-31 1:20,"The problem with the Trump reality show is that people are dying. Viewers are clamoring for a take-charge leader, but all they get is “dear leader” homages from his sycophants and frightening statistics from Dr. Fauci and Ambassador Birx. Trump may think he’s starring, but viewers will soon turn it off (if they haven’t already) because they realize that Trump’s empathy is non-existent. The fact that networks are still broadcasting it is a sign of the fear of antagonizing the bully-in-chief."

2020-03-31 2:40,"Please reporters keep asking the questions, even if you have to take some heat.  It is simply infuriating that Trump thinks he can pay no consequence for his former words and delayed actions regarding Covid-19.  More people are dying because he said ‘Anyone who wants a test can get tested.’  That was a lie.  It still isn’t true weeks later.  He said the states should be able to get the supplies they need, the federal government is NOT a shipping clerk.  They could NOT.  They still can’t and people are going to die in the next month because our hospitals don’t have what they needed.  God does NOT look on those who would sacrifice human lives to protect their ego, as honoring Him in any way.  Justice will be served.  The day of reckoning will come.  Woe to those who call themselves righteous but their actions are anything but godly."
2020-03-31 2:44,"""when the president speaks during an emergency, that is by definition news"".  However,  that presumption is based on previous notions of Presidential behavior.

Then the government ran a test pandemic experiment JUST THIS SUMMER and discovered we we ill prepared.

Instead of claiming he can “shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and still have supporters“...he now will be able to claim that the unnecessary deaths of up to 300,000 Americans will be on his watch due to his incompetence and negligence early on, and still have supporters."

2020-03-31 5:59,"Yeah, our household caught onto this new White House dog-and-pony show by the second prime time “reality rally”. Evidently no tax-payer funded cross-country campaign rallies right now?

Locally, our tv stations now air these faux announcements on sister channels, and offer viewers a choice between switching over, or staying on the main news channel for the local news and weather. Guess what the popular choice is?

In contrast, we in Michigan are lucky to have Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who treats us with honesty, keeps us well informed, stays positive that we can do this, and stands up for our state. As our COVID numbers started to climb, she enacted StayHomeStaySafe— first through April 6; then extended through April 13. When she tells me what’s next, I listen.

I believe Dr. Anthony Fauci and I listen to what he has to say. I believe the WHO, CDC, science and history and research and data and straight talk and no lies. How wonderful if that became the norm."

By the way, everybody, can we stop calling them 'briefings?' They ain't."
2020-03-31 11:20,Most people have the good sense to read articles in reputable newspapers about the virus.  No one needs to tune in to trump's news briefings to hear him call out those who do not agree with him and rant and rave.  We gave up watching any TV 10 months ago - it can be done.  Cable news is no longer news it is entertainment and most other shows are disgusting.
2020-03-31 10:38,"Pro-tip: Turn the Trump rally off. Trump politicized the pandemic. Everything is a soulless transaction. No fact is safe. The agenda is blatant, the virus is secondary. National morale is attacked. The scent of corruption is rising. Turn it off."
2020-03-31 9:41,"Huckster, snake oil salesman, used car salesman, reality show actor, you name it  but as he said:
""I’m not sure anybody even knows what it is.”"
2020-03-31 10:08,"If the content on his ""briefings"" were edited for factual or new information by all the responsible news outlets, it would starve him from the adulation-laced oxygen he needs to survive against so many foes."
2020-03-31 10:15,"Trump’s press conferences are in reality a campaign and public relations show. They reveal the essential Trump- rambling, digressive, petty, vindictive, and above all self aggrandizing. They feature his distinctive verbiage praising himself as extraordinary, 
incredible, and denying the history of his negligence, mismanagement, incompetence, and science denying ignorance. To those susceptible to this malarkey, he remains their eccentric hero, the victim of persecution by the liberal media with their fake news. By this method he hopes to win re-election since his great economy has locked down and unemployment has surged and death and suffering
are everywhere. It is hard to believe people will buy this commercial which I feel is as despicable and odious as Trump himself."
2020-03-31 11:53,"Networks and cable tv, please stop carrying these press conferences. They are inflammatory, filled with misinformation and downright lies, and provide Trump with a free bully pulpit. Report on the content, sure, but no more broadcasts."
2020-03-31 12:01,"If the networks had an ounce of dignity (and wouldn't stand to gain themselves from letting Trump lambast their journalists), they'd stop providing him a stage by asking him questions. Actually, if the networks weren't after ratings themselves, they'd quit broadcasting this entire farce altogether.
Let the right wing cover his 'briefings'. A summary will do for the rest of us."
2020-03-31 12:14,The answer is simple: ignore him. Don't turn up. He needs these things more than any member of the media or the public at large. Just tune him out.
2020-03-31 12:15,"The media falls for every shiny object Trump tosses out, the latest being accusations of black market PPE activity by NYC hospitals. Oooh, let’s play that Trump statement. Oooh, let’s get a reaction statement from NY officials. Thus setting up yet another false equivalency. In part this is a baked-in deference based on coverage of past presidents who were actually presidential and unwritten rules of discourse that “official” White House statements have an element of gravitas. Trump broke thst contract long ago."
2020-03-31 13:19,"Journalists, including television reporters, can cover the White House just fine without video footage of the president saying things that are demonstrably and dangerously untrue, are blatant campaign speeches in the setting of news briefings and promote his own and his family's personal business interests. There is no real news coming out of Trump's daily briefings. Shutting off the television cameras would provide an important service to the nation."
2020-03-31 13:36,"As someone who has lived within trump’s media market most of my life, I knew to hit mute whenever his face showed up onscreen and to skip over his mendacious and exhibitionist performances in print. Basically, I saw him as a toxic substance and still do. 

The difference is that once he slithered into the presidency, the scope of his dangerous influence multiplied geometrically but like the wiliest of contagious diseases has managed to evade numerous attempts to contain it. 

The term reality tv is an oxymoron and very little that this host says comports with anything resembling the truth that constitutes objective reality. It is simply the free associative, solipsistic and self serving, often incoherent reports from the worshipful Greek chorus inside his head.

It’s time for responsible media outlets to filter the torrent, stop airing his unedited spew, pick a few sound bites, clips from experts and that’s it. Time to starve the beast."
2020-03-31 11:55,"Articles/columns such as this show the nation just cant resist Mr. Trump. Did you deliver any new insights, any real news here? None. There is one solution. Report on the substance of his briefings. That would take a paragraph or less. But he's the President you say. Therein lies the problem. It is not his problem it is the nation's problem. Why don't you report on the media's obsession with this man. Why don't you report on the need to keep reporting at length on his lies? It is no longer news that he lies and it isn't particularly important to repeat his lies."
2020-03-31 12:17,"Strongly believe the press conferences should not be broadcast live with all of Trump’s lies, obfuscations, insults to women, deliberate amnesia about what he has said or done, etc.  Just tape and then edit the highlights for transmission.  Presumably this would include information from the top health officials we trust plus anything substantive that Trump announces.  This man is so non-human he gloats about ratings while people are dying ... cut off his source of narcissistic supply now!"
2020-03-31 12:28,"The media should demand all press briefings be held in the East Room or another larger venue that allows for real social distancing.  Fauci and Birx should refuse to stand so close to Trump, too."
2020-03-31 13:43,"As a reader based in Canada, I can tell you that we look forward to Trump's daily briefing strictly for its entertaibment value. The contrast between his subjective ramblings and the thoughtful, science-based leadership of our country's national and provincial leaders is quite astonishing. We watch to see Dr  Fauci's strained reactions to his most outlandish pronouncements. We watch to hear if the day's self-serving sound bite will be more boastful than that of the one before. We watch to see which journalist's question will outrage him most. We listen for every irresponsible statement that puts the health of your citizens at greater risk than is necessary. We share a long border, so we cannot afford to be dispationate or cavalier about your situation. The briefings are amusing, yes, but mostly disheartening to watch the erosion of America's moral authority under Trump's failed leadership during this crisis."
2020-03-31 14:12,"Since Trump claims that the efforts to fight the disease are mainly the responsibility of state and local governments, then TV air time should be apportioned accordingly. Each of the governors and local officials on the front lines should be given at least as much air time as the president. Since that is where he says the real responsibility lies, it is also where the real news is."
2020-03-31 14:42,"This is an interesting column that goes with Paul Krugman's column of 3/31, ""This Land of Denial and Death"".  In that column Krugman asks the question, ""Is there a link between the uniquely American prevalence of science denial and America’s uniquely high mortality? To be honest, I’m still trying to figure this out."" 
Part of America prefers reality TV over actual reality.  Science is strictly reality based, no matter how much the pseudo post modernist Republicans try to paint it otherwise.  The narrative put forth by the right is based on a combination of lies and magical thinking based in pseudo Christian mythology, which includes the return of Christ, the Rapture to be experienced by believers and so on.  For them, death is not the end, simply the beginning of heaven.  All the rest of the rationalizations about ""small government"" and scapegoating of immigrants, blacks, Hispanics, and so on are to support this narrative.  In the meantime, there is big money to be made until the end times come.

Trump is a star in the reality TV world.  It is why he is president.  He has lived in it naturally all his life. While these press conferences are an extension of that world, they are also a danger to the natural world we actually live in.  The networks should not be part of this ."
2020-03-31 15:20,"It ‘s all about the money. That’s why trump was on TV in 2015,2016 and now. The executives are only interested in ratings because that equals money"
2020-03-31 15:57,"I refuse to watch or listen to him and COVID-19 has not changed that.
However I would like to see an end to the networks covering this daily  ' dumpster fire' they call a  news briefing .  
Collectively we need to start a campaign lobbying the networks to put an end to their coverage."
2020-03-31 14:25,"If trump’s new “campaign rallies” are thinly disguised as covid19 press briefings, then Biden and Sanders should be demanding equal time."
2020-03-31 14:24,"Count the number of times he uses his favorite words like ""incredible"" or ""fantastic"". That makes it more like the Trump game show."
2020-03-31 14:11,"Trump   uses his press conferences to brow beat the press and bully the entire country. He  has always been a bully and has always had people and power behind him to protect him, to enable him to bully. What is extraordinary is that this one man is able to bully this entire nation with little or no pushback because people are afraid of him and the power that he can wield, the power that we have given him. We are forced to listen via the media to his lies, to his efforts to gaslight-create realities that conflict, to praise himself, above all to campaign for more power. He uses the allocation of emergency resources of this country to control dissent; criticize him and you risk the safety of your constituents. Praise him and you will be rewarded.   Like all bullies he will not be stopped until someone stands up to him and  confronts him in a way that reveals what a coward he really is. Cuomo is the closest to being that person that I have seen, there must be others. Protect our election for 2020"

2. Do not believe a single word that comes out of Mike Pence's mouth.

That is all."
2020-03-31 14:57,"This president is all about ego and self gratification. He is clueless about reality and suffering, except when it impacts his economic welfare. All around him are people doing damage control and working to do the right thing despite their boss's ridiculous posturing. We are so unfortunate to have a big clumsy baby at the helm of this nation during a crisis of monumental proportions. trump should just get out of the way, stay inside his office, and let real people do the job right. I cannot fathom how 48% of those polled think he is doing a good job. It's the people behind this bully who are doing work."

2020-03-31 16:45,"Putin will do fine. The Russian people are like red state republicans. Their loyalty to the exalted leader goes beyond the rational. It is the reason that Russia remains weak and has been shrinking in influence, with the exception of their Psy-ops work on the internet.

We shall join them in perpetual stagnation of world political and economic influence because while the citizens of the US are not all red state republicans most do not live in the real world and are incapable of electing capable leaders. Republican or democrat the thing that unites Americans is their gullibility at election time. Always choosing those who speak of hope or making us great again, rather than detailed oriented, fact based, politicians. Heck, even Bernie needs to appeal to emotion in order to get the attention of the great mass of dullards known as US citizens. So, look at Russia, that is what we are going to be, a shrinking authoritarian oligarchy where to succeed even in small measure one will have to pledge loyalty to the fearless leader, be it Trump or the next charlatan."

Putin wants everybody to think he is such a big tough guy, who like to ride horses without his shirt.  But when times get tough ... 

But we have our own ""dear leader"" who seems to read from the same playbook ... never actually fires anyone face-to-face (only by tweet, or by letter), has no willingness to level with the American public, and never takes the blame for anything.

We The People need to fire our incompetent reality tv apprentice POTUS on November 3, 2020.

From the beginning of Russiagate, the Russian authorities have claimed that there may be private actors in their country who are responsible for cyber attacks in the US.  

While hardly conclusive, the above Times report adds a layer of credibility to the Russian allegation."

By hiding out away from the coronavirus he's also making himself more vulnerable to being overthrown.

Russia cannot survive economically the dual-threat of a crashing oil and gas industry and a massively deadly coronavirus pandemic.

He might arrive at the belief that he has to somehow stop Saudi Arabia from flooding the world's oil market with cheap oil.

How would he go about doing that?"

2020-03-31 18:45,"It is interesting to see that Putin and Trump have gotten to the same place by different routes.  Putin avoids responsibility by putting his subordinates out in front.  Trump is temperamentally incapable of staying out of the public eye.  After all, attention and adoration is why he wanted to be President.  He avoids responsibility by going on television and saying it's all a problem of the complaining, ungrateful states."

2020-03-31 20:07,"Seeing himself as “father” of the nation, bringing only good news to the people, Putin has been largely and conspicuously silent on Russia’s response to COVID-19 – a strict lockdown in most regions – while letting his minions announcing the measures. 
But there is little doubt that he has the final say behind the scenes. If the coronavirus pandemic turns catastrophic, Putin will not be able to shift blame solely to Moscow’s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. 
In a televised speech last week, Putin addressed the country for the first time, postponing a vote on constitutional amendments and offering citizens a week-long paid vacation. But he stopped short of imposing mandatory commercial closures or stay-at-home orders, prompting many Russians to book travel to the Black Sea resort, Sochi. 
This misleading message led to several clarifications from various officials. Sobyanin ordered all parks, restaurants, spas and other nonessential businesses closed for the week. Mishustin then extended  the restriction to the entire country, while Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russians should work or study from home rather than treat the week as a holiday.
A day later Peskov declared, “We have no epidemic” in Russia, undermining Sobyanin’s tough talk. In a televised meeting with his envoys, Putin backed Sobyanin in his first public comments about the lockdown.
No wonder only 16% Russians say they trust the country’s official data on COVID-19."
2020-03-31 20:33,"You'd think after 50 years of republican propaganda we'd be as smart as the Russians and ignore the hype that drove people to hoarding and at least one couple to take poison thinking it was the same stuff Trump told them to take. 

It is absolutely hilarious that Putin was shaking hands with that bald doctor in the picture who later tested positive. He and the Trump are alike after all."
2020-04-01 0:41,"I forgot to mention in my previous comment that Stalin put my grandfather in one of his countless prisons and my mom basically liberated him when she travelled to Moscow to beg Lavrentiy Beria to free him.
She was very young and beautiful maybe in her 20's when Beria who lived near by, was actually following her in his car, he had a thing for beautiful young women.
Beria was evil, just like Rasputin...
Many people died in these Russian concentration camps.
When after a year my grandfather was free, he came back to Tbilisi, but he never was the same and soon after that he died in his early 50's.
Hard to imagine all these malicious, heinous characters came from Georgia that I love so much and where I spent all my memorable summer vacations.
Life is so fleeting, but we always remember the best of these moments.

That is why he controls all the media in Russia. That is why he tortures, murders and poisons his opponents, with every such atrocity proving how weak he is.
The truth is that Putin is a little bully who has slaughtered thousands of women and children through his bombing campaign in Syria.

2020-03-31 20:11,"I don't know the various nuances of Putin's choice to stay out of the limelight during this pandemic, but I do want to mention that the generally well-liked President Moon of South Korea, has  wisely left all the public handling of the nation's responses to trusted experts. None speaks from the official Seoul platforms with self-serving, ignorant and abuse-laced mumbo-jumbo like the loathsome Trump.

 Since the egomaniacal Trump always wants to be seen in the lead regardless of his ineptitude, maybe experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and others who appear with Trump at press briefings, should abandon him and hold separate news conferences with their exclusive expert, calm, and focused remarks. If Trump fires them, they will still be winners with all true patriots  in the annals of history while at the same time giving us the unvarnished truth and  trustworthy guidance during the present crisis."

PS- Those of you who are not complying with social distancing and the law- please adhere! I’ve seen plenty of people still playing basketball in groups, kids hanging out in groups, people having parties down the street, etc. 
Remember- no one is immune from this virus!
We can get through this, but we must try our very best to follow the shelter in place order set out by Gov Whitmer ."
2020-03-30 14:14,"So, while the Washington Republicans take our tax money and give it to rich capitalists and corporations to buy back their own stock and juice the stock market to unsustainable heights, the poor people of Detroit and other American cities -- like Flint -- are left to suffer.  The Republicans are guilty of crimes against humanity -- and they will get away with it, as usual.  

Just think of what all those trillions of dollars in tax breaks would have meant to our inner cities.  Just think of how much poverty these dollars could have ameliorated.

And, now that we finally realize that our health care is totally broken, far beyond repair, we have a paranoid delusional moronic president complaining that this pandemic might affect his re-election.  And, we have an equally delusional governor of the State of Florida who is determined to keep the beaches open and help send super-spreaders out beyond his borders -- and then has the nerve to place roadblocks preventing people from other states from entering.

Total morons.  And the sad part is that they will get re-elected.  Because they were put in office by people who are equally moronic.

America is truly in its declining years."

Elsewhere there is—normally—bustling bright life—hip businesses, hotels, art galleries and sports stadiums. New construction is everywhere. People are strolling everywhere, excited. You made very little mention of how incredibly far our city has come since the bankruptcy because it doesn’t fit tidily in your narrative."
2020-03-30 14:09,"The poor African-Americans of Detroit have been crushed for generations with systemic racism and lack of opportunity to change their plight.

I don’t know Of a solution. It’s hard to break a cycle of generations of malice.

2020-03-30 13:53,In Michigan like other places in the country we are only testing people that are truly sick. The people that went on trips aren’t showing up in these tests because they are healthy and have good healthcare. It’s the folks that work at the airport or took people’s bags and brought it back to Detroit that a sick and dying. This is the story of America. The story of who has and who has not. It should makes us all weep. We are killing people because we have two Americas always.

Also worth noting is that due to decades of strong unions, we have robust hospitals with a deep bench of talented nurses and docs. So we know when a local nurse makes a video that Providence Southfield Hospital ran out of Tylenol and PPE, it's about to go down. God help our frontline."

It is what used to the top hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana. Mothballed a few years ago, it is still maintained by a small staff. So why hasn;t it been opened? Louisiana has an enourmously high amount of people exposed. The total is more than 9 nearby states. Last Friday, New Orleans had more case than all of Los Angeles County. 30 times as many people live there, and this was only 1/3 of the totol in New Orleans.

It's not pretty. A metaphor, perhaps: our president, unclothed."
2020-03-30 14:39,"Shockingly, we found that we have some things in common with third world countries. Only the aristocrats and well connected can get tested and treated in the early stages of this virus.  The rest of us will receive rationed care, if that.  Many who did not need to, will die.

I hate to say this, but every US city and state is under equipped for this pandemic.  We are reacting worse than the poorest countries on this earth.  We lost valuable time in February and March for testing and isolation of people with this infection.  Our state death tolls will probably surpass whole nations. The US will suffer great losses.  The pain has only begun for us."
2020-03-30 14:51,"This will devastate Detroit, and most likely wipe Flint from the map. A good majority of the population there doesn't have easy access to quality healthcare.

My fear is that it will get much worse before it gets better. 
We have a very competent Governor here in Michigan- Gov Gretchen Whitmer. I truly believe she is doing all she can to help fight this pandemic.
Trump, on the other hand, put us all behind with regard to testing, PPE, ventilators, etc.

2020-03-30 13:22,"Michigan public officials tell people to stay at home.  If a person suspects they have the virus, only go to to the ER if they can't breath. The ER rooms in Detroit are seeing many patients in advanced need, who need immediate intubation.  The public health response needs to communicate better triage options.  A place to be tested.  A way to be monitored at home each day.  A way to maybe get oxygen treatments without heading to ER intensive care.

It would be helpful if people were not informed to seek help only when in perilous condition.  Better outcomes will only result if testing is widespread, care is managed on some active continuum, and more people receive some direct care while their need is serious but not critical.

By all appearance, Korea and Germany model this approach on a macro level."
2020-03-30 14:15,"My heart is breaking for my home town. 

Michigan is one of the states that did expand Medicaid after the ACA was passed. Our current Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was the minority leader and worked with our former GOP Governor, Rick Snyder, to get it passed in Michigan. 

Not sure how many Detroit residents are using the ACA Medicaid expansion, but I know state-wide it's about 700,000. But I think it is imperative that the Democratic party run ads saying that the Trump administration is trying to take away the healthcare that was granted with the ACA at the Supreme Court. 

Because they had no great, beautiful health care plan that would cover everyone, as Trump said he'd pass."
2020-03-30 16:03,"Haven't seen much evidence of contact tracing of those exposed to the virus. Is it because of lack of funds, technology, and a system in place or something else? Secondly, it is still a mystery about the origins of the virus.

2020-03-30 16:43,"I hear in a Detroit Hospital there is a protocol that Doctors will prioritize critical patients who have the best chance of survival .

2020-03-30 16:24,"There are over 400 police officers in Detroit in quarantine so that doesn't help matters. The biggest issue Detroit faces is mentality. To the young lady's point who went to the house party, people aren't taking it seriously. Those who actually live in the sprawling neighborhoods live with a level of risk every day of their lives. The virus is just another risk added to many others that threatens daily existence."
2020-03-30 16:21,"Anyone who has been to visit in the past ten years has seen the apocalyptic destruction.  Anyone who has been there in the past five years has seen evidence of a rebirth.  My wife wanted to spend our 30th anniversary there two years ago, and we had an amazing time never venturing past 7 Mile.  But through all of the decline a level of poverty previously unimaginable has manifested itself, and apparently with that has developed a nonchalance about government edicts.  The woman reporting she attended a house party with 100 people tells me all I need to know about why the virus is spreading.  The people arriving at the emergency room in late stages, presumably because they have no way to pay for medical care, tells me why deaths will outpace the rest of the nation (except similarly poor places like New Orleans).  It is a vast social failure, an indictment of our winner-take-all economic regime.  Once the richest city in the world, Detroit can only await the swarms of locusts."
2020-03-30 16:20,"“But there have been many signs of recovery of late, including a rush of new construction and some bustling neighborhoods amid the city’s vast, 139 square miles.”

Sadly, this is misleading. Yes, there’s been investment, but only in the Downtown, Midtown (home to a university) and Corktown areas (Corktown being mostly a “real” comeback from the ground up, rather than from a few billionaires buying up dozens of storefronts and buildings).

The “progress” that Detroit has seen is really just gentrification. Few people who work downtown (including myself) actually live in the city, as it’s a city crisscrossed by freeways leading out to the suburbs. 

Detroit is still plagued by environmental racism, crime, awful public transit, a broken school system, and few to zero opportunities for its residents (most jobs in the city are held by suburbanites). My heart breaks for Detroit, but sadly it’s not surprising to see the virus take its toll there."
2020-03-30 16:52,"We lived in Detroit in the City close to Belle Isle in 1975 and worked in Southfield. We paid an extra tax to live in Detroit.  Forty-five years ago there were also blocks of abandoned houses in the City built in the days of prosperity now unfit to occupy.

Although not born in Detroit or a long-time resident, I still care that one of the USA's majestic cities was allowed to sink into poverty and crime taking with it so many talented and persistent people who were willing to contribute to the USA despite barriers erected to stop their progress.

The new vitality brought to Detroit's center and extending into some neighborhoods was welcomed by people across the USA who had once lived in Detroit.  The coronavirus pandemic may be just one more obstacle for the people of Detroit to overcome.  Or it may be the final blow which turns Detroit into urban farms."
2020-03-30 14:50,"I strongly believe Detroit will pull through, but its skyrocketing numbers could be a harbinger of things to come for other cities with large numbers of residents living near the poverty line and limited state resources to provide assistance."
2020-03-30 14:56,"It is truly heroic work that is being done in medical centers everywhere right now. To know Detroit, really know it, is to love it. When there is general distrust in government or institutions that have left people behind, it is harder for the population to heed warnings when the time comes. Survival is the goal. My hope for Detroit and the rest of the world is that we survive and rebuild what might be lost."
2020-03-30 14:56,"Poverty in Detroit isn't a month-to-month thing, or paycheck-to-paycheck, or even week-to-week.  It's a daily hustle, even in ""normal"" times.  It's doing the neighbor's hair and watching their kids in their homes, or trying to nail down a minimum wage warehouse job.  It's making partial payments to DTE to keep the lights on, and struggling to put together exorbitant rent for one of the last barely habitable single-family houses that's not boarded up on your street.  Poor people can't use credit cards to keep the household going during social distancing.  A lot of people have been struggling on a daily basis even before everything closed."
2020-03-30 14:26,I know from friends in Chicago that the police are reluctant to enforce restrictions in black areas and also that the restrictions have been ignored entirely in those areas. It is from those areas that most cases are arising. If the governor is going to impose crazy restrictions then she should provide the City with enough support to  impose those restrictions everywhere.
2020-03-30 17:10,"It is not surprising to me that Detroit is seeing so many cases. It has been a long-neglected city, which had experienced some great urban ""renewal""and popularity among tourists in the past 10 years. It has been ""on the map"" with creative, artists and supporters of urban renewal from all of the country and beyond for quite some time. I visited last year, hanging out in bars and restaurants, and it felt like we were in downtown SF or in Brooklyn.  But as with all gentrifying places, there is a vast vulnerable population that is largely ignored and continue to live there in less-than-ideal situations."
2020-03-30 16:44,"Michigan's best weapons are Governor Whittmer, Senators Peters and Stabenow, Mayor Duggan of Detroit, and all of the highly dedicated federal/state/local officials that are working diligently to obtain the PPEs, medicines, and other resources that Michigan so desperately needs to persevere and beat COVID-19. 

Make no mistake, Michigan will both survive and thrive during this pandemic because that's how it's done in Motown. We are not known as the ""arsenal of democracy"" without reason and carry ourselves with dignity and honor in the face of adversity. We will follow the CDC guidelines; tend to our sick, elderly, and disenfranchised; mourn and bury our dead. Saint Paul's advice to the Philippians rings true for Michigan: ""I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.""

2020-03-30 18:02,"I’m not sure how to reconcile the comments, or the article, with what I have seen, living as I do in an “affluent” suburb that borders Detroit. Here, too, people disregard the social distancing orders. Just last week I saw a large group of children and parents gathering for a kiddie party on the front lawn of a million dollar home. I also see groups of people who live in town congregating near the lake, regularly. It would seem that something beyond economics or demographics explains the disregard for this mandate."
2020-03-30 17:58,"This has a long way to go.

""No one is sure why the Detroit region is seeing a flood of cases in the weeks since officials announced the state’s first known case on March 10.

It was March 15 when hundreds of people were crowded into O'Hare airport for hours. And they then spread across the country.

Illinois alone is adding 1,000 cases and 50 deaths a day, and the curve is accelerating.

Luckily we have room for 3,000 beds at McCormick Place."
2020-03-30 17:34,"Some six-thousand health care workers regularly cross the border from neighbouring Canada to work in Detroit hospitals. Frequently, CBP ‘enforcement’ actions have sought to block their ability to work which, if successful, would effectively shut these hospitals down. Accordingly, the hospitals have become adept in navigating through Trump ‘open border’ and ‘America First’ animus to ensure their continued access to dedicated, highly skilled workers. The difficulty attracting healthcare workers from the suburbs into Detroit drives the need for this transnational workforce. Ironically, given the nature of the Trump pandemic response, these same healthcare workers now represent a Covid spread risk in Canada."
2020-03-30 17:52,"Now a retired RN, I worked at institutions in the City of Detroit and State of Michigan for over 30 years.  
The COVID19 pandemic will test City and State resources to the limit, impeded as in past decades by political maneuvering and corruption.
The ones who will suffer for it the most include children who can no longer go to school and do not have Internet resources for a pretense of home schooling,
residents who are suddenly unemployed, the elderly, disabled, and chronically ill. It is like a test case of what could happen in the rest of the country.
Residents of Detroit and Michigan will not forget the actions of President Trump in our time of greatest need."
2020-03-30 17:29,"This ongoing tragedy has deep roots in the American economy and in the irresponsible public policies of past administrations, primarily those of the GOP.  The number of hospitals and clinics that have closed in the past two decades is astonishing, especially for rural and small communities, but also in major cities.  This is the result of the commodification of medicine, rather than in the sense that medicine and health are human rights.  It is also a result of the pressures exerted by the health insurance industries, nearly all of which are businesses in it for the profits for themselves and their stockholders. The same pressures come into play in the case of for-profit hospitals.  We are also in this crisis because of the excessive political influence of the pharmaceutical companies, the medical equipment companies, the insurance companies, and the hospital industries, all of which spend millions of dollars annually to lobby Congress, advertise their wares (think of the drug ads now all over television), to generate profits.

Maybe--but it's doubtful--this massive crisis will wake people up to absurdity of the American health care and insurance systems."
2020-03-30 17:26,"This suffering could have been prevented with a comprehensive strategy by our government initially, and war time orders to make more protective equipment. The whole country should shelter in place,  to quicken the virus's peak, and protect the people who have not yet seen the virus.  There should be masks and equipment constantly flowing into hospitals.  We are supposed to be a wealthy country.  Has all that wealth gone to the already wealthy, and left everyone else high and dry?"

Against those shocking numbers, I sadly recall the photos of Detroit voters lined up for hours in cramped voting places in the recent Michigan Democratic presidential primary and wonder if the DNC and Michigan party officials decided that putting the lives of Michigan voters at risk, was worth their rush to push their candidate Joe Biden to the top of the heap, even at the risk of voters' lives.  And for all that,  Joe Biden is almost nowhere to be found and with nothing to say. Sad."

Mr. Stoudamire passed away less than three weeks after apparently being exposed on March 6th.

This individual was not in the high risk group.  He was only 43.  This virus is a vicious and non-discriminating killer.

What continues to occur in Detroit and New York have lead to extremely proactive actions in Chicago.  Various convention centers are being converted into temporary medical field hospitals in case the city and outlining areas get hit hard with this virus.  Chicago's major and the Illinois governor also enacted the ""shelter-in-place"" order.

I have to be honest.  At first I thought they both were being overly cautious.  But in hindsight, their aggressive and quick actions probably is saving many lives.

I sincere wish all residents of Detroit and of Michigan good health.  I love you guys!!  Us Midwesterners must support each other and stick together."

In California, it is abominable that countries like Alameda County don’t want to report the number of cases by city because of a concern that the media might misinterpret data for a city like Oakland. This is irresponsible because Oakland has over 15,0000 homeless people who are likely infected and to keep the healthy, uninflected Oakland residents in the dark is irresponsible. I understand this is happening in other counties."

Caregivers can ensure that patients have enough water and oxygen and nutrients flowing into their bodies. Caregivers can bring a patient up to the brink of getting well but they can't force that next step. Either people get better or they don't. It's out of the caregiver's control at that point.

Your medical care providers are human beings too. There are limits to what they can do. They will make mistakes, and yes, people will die as a result of these mistakes, but these mistakes will be made by people that are overworked and understaffed and doing all of this without adequate equipment or protection.

Please find it in your heart to love them and forgive them for any mistakes they make because these people are truly trying their absolute best."
2020-03-30 19:44,"Detroit's public schools have been described as an absolute disaster for decades. As its citizens fail to understand how to do the basics of surviving an epidemic, we are all discovering that allowing public schools to simply serve teachers' unions instead of the children gets people killed even after they graduate.

2020-03-30 20:08,"Rather shocking to me that comments praising Gov Gretchen Whitmor rather than accurately pointing out that she should have stopped the water being turned off in Detroit the minute she was sworn in. Or raised taxes on the wealthy in the state to start changing the conditions that lead to generational poverty in the state. She's a shameful public leader; another person who refused to help those too poor and broken by the system to help themselves. That's not only a shame, it's stupid; because it's a waste of human potential."

It’s so hard reading about, what seems, endless human suffering with no end in sight that seems to grapple Detroit over and over.  I feel for people of Detroit, especially the most vulnerable ones with no safety nets or a fall back.  I am humbled by those who are so far less fortunate than I am, and who despite all the odds seem to manage to carry-on.  It’s commendable."

But a large portion of people in the city rely on public buses to go anywhere and I worry about all the elderly people who are putting themselves at risk to get the basic things they need which is already a pain when there's not a virus going around. Not to mention the steel mills and trash burning facilities in the city gave us have some of the highest rates of asthma in the country. Our water has had lead problems depending where you live in the city too. It's fairly common to meet young people (people my age in their 20s, young kids, 30 year olds, 40 year olds) in Detroit with major underlying conditions that other cities don't have to deal with because of environmental regulations. You already feel living in the city your life expectancy is lower than the rest of the country in normal times. New York has it bad but its a healthier city than Detroit and with this virus coming it just feels like a really dark storm on the horizon that there's not much we can do about due to 50 years of economic abandonment."

2020-03-30 21:47,"I grew up in a city that was kind of a mini Detroit, minus the abandoned houses. The factories closed and people stayed because they had nowhere else to go.

One thing that gets overlooked in this communities that is a HUGE risk factor: multigenerational, crowded households with at least one elderly person, at least one person with serious health problems, and at least one person with a low-wage ""essential"" job that puts them at higher risk of catching COVID-19.

It's pretty much why parts of Queens are struggling so much. 

I worry about my parents and the families I grew up with. Three generations under one tiny roof, so many people with less than stellar health, and no ability for social distancing due to work -- as a low-level caregiver in a nursing home, a grocery store clerk, a fire fighter, a nurse, a cook at an assisted living facility."

2020-03-30 21:36,"We all appreciate the additional challenges Detroit now faces from the growing impact of the pandemic.

There's a Canadian aspect to those challenges given the close relationship between Detroit & Windsor, Ontario.  There's much traffic both ways given the many people that live in one city & work in the other & other special features of the traditional commingling between these 2 communities.

Here's a report from The Windsor Star describing the current impact:

2020-03-30 22:20,"I live in the metro Detroit area and the main reasons cases are going up so quickly here in my opinion are:

1.  We are JUST getting widespread access to tests.
2.  Industries here stayed open longer (including the auto industry) because closing meant economic hardship and in some cases devastation.

The auto industry is currently cutting the pay of salaried workers even as I type this, and the recession is going to hit us hard here.  That being said, life still is more important than money.

Both Detroit suburbs and the city of Detroit are in this together, and we will pull through like we always do."

Maybe, just maybe this country will wake up and realize that being healthy is the first step in health care.."
2020-03-30 22:33,There is another connection between Detroit's extended hard times and this pandemic:  Both were made much worse by the actions of a small number of wealthy and ignorant people who cared more about their own power and money than about the hard-working people of Detroit.

3) lack the ability to self isolate because they must work

Days After a Funeral in a Georgia Town, Coronavirus ‘Hit Like a Bomb’
A mourner came to Albany, Ga., to attend the funeral of a retired janitor. After a pause while the infections incubated, the virus swept through the community.

The problem with this statement is that Federal law is well behind the curve when it comes to IT security and privacy.

With any new company I expect them to move fast and fail and recover.  It's called being ""agile"" and to win they'll release MVP products (minimal viable products) and continually iterate.  In this case, the founders of Zoom were former Webex employees, and knew which Webex features were useless, and what users cared about is ease of use and smooth audio/video.  Now Zoom is learning their customers also care a lot about privacy and security, maybe more than they expected.  It's not like there was no consideration for privacy and security, but as with any software it's a continuous process of fixing vulnerabilities.  Check any update for your phones or computers - ""fixes for bugs and security"".   Users also need to be ""agile"", and when software isn't being updated and continues to have issues, they stop using it...and the company will fail and you won't have a choice to use it - democratic destruction of companies that don't deliver what customers demand.

First off, thank you Marc Tracy for writing this article.  I for one had never heard of ""Stat"" but beginning immediately, I will be a loyal subscriber despite the hefty monthly subscription fee.

I am impressed with the various individuals who make up the stellar team of reporters and researchers.  I find great relief in knowing that a group of intelligent and science based professionals are reporting what they read and review from various sources of information throughout the world.

I recall a conversation I had with our family physician when my mother was diagnosed with cancer.  I explained to him that I didn't need nor want a sugar-coated prognosis.  I needed to know the truth.  I could deal with the truth.  He then proceeded to tell me she had only months to live.  I could now prepare for what was to come.  He was correct in his prognosis within a two-week window.

Thank you again for this sober, somber article.  It's the kind of intel that is necessary.  At least it is in my world."

2020-03-31 19:17,"The statistical models that are the basis of predictions around this pandemic or other pandemics are pretty straightforward - well covered ground. The details may be new, e.g., when does a person become infectious with this particular virus, how rapidly does it spread in different populations. But the underlying statistics are not new - and the predictions based on a few very reasonable assumptions related to human behaviour would have made it abundantly clear that to epidemiologists that what we are seeing was going to happen. 

Water under the bridge.  The question for me is: what are these same people saying about the next 6 or 12 months - when people start to resume more usual patterns of social interaction.  If we didn't listen to the epidemiologists back then, have we reflected upon the possibility that there is something they are telling us today that we aren't listening to.  E.g., if in 6 months we are not relying on social isolation and instead are employing contact tracing and testing - do we have testing capacity - even if we have enough to manage the current pandemic (which I do not think is the case).

Managing this outbreak - and the next infection after COVID-19 -- via a combination of ignoring the results of robust statistical models based on realistic assumptions, followed by acts of desperation - not a good way to manage outbreaks.  

So again- the past has passed. What are we ignoring today? And who should be listening - and are they?"

2020-03-31 21:12,"Glad to hear Mr Henry puts his money to wise public benefit. I followed some of these reporters in their prior professional homes. It is very good to know they landed in a well funded health sciences’ news organization. And there are some innocent reasons to not widely publish some aspects of the pandemic. The public overall is not well equipped to understand the science and to  react to facts with emotional distance. Avoidance of public panic is a high priority which requires measuring the audience’s tolerance for frightening facts. Next topic to be researched is how best to deal with mass mourning. Within the next ~2-18 weeks many to most American and global households will be grieving the suffering and deaths of family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, commuter companions, and familiar faces in shops, services, and local jaunts. What is the preparation for nations, states, provinces, districts, cities, towns, villages, and neighborhoods in mourning? Professional consideration must be given on how to approach this collective grief. It needs accessible public valves to release and express the emotion at the finality of loss, the fear of the future. There will likely be anger, anxiety, and hostility blended into the emotional global stew. We will all need help as survivors as certainly as those who succumb need breath."
2020-03-31 21:45,"It's impressive that Stat saw the coronavirus pandemic coming months ago.  But it's irrelevant.  The unfortunate fact remains that many if not most people are not willing to take drastic steps, like staying home and not going to work, to prevent the spread of a virus, unless death hits close to home first.  Of course the government, months ago, should have taken the preventive measures it is only now taking.  But let's not kid ourselves.  There would have been huge howls of protest and the government would have been forced to back off no matter what the experts warned.  That's just the way we are."

How often and how hard did Stat work to get its stories into wider distribution, or to get its reporters on cable news outlets? Did Stat post anything on Twitter or elsewhere to counteract the disinformation coming out of Washington and many states? 

It seems strange that with a resource like Stat, owned by someone with immense influence and reach, and cousin to a major newspaper, more of its reporting was not more widely distributed when it could have done some real good."

Last week, for instance, the main county hospital here in San Jose said they'd actually seen a decrease in ER utilization. Next day, Stanford said the same.  But in the next couple weeks that's likely to change.

There obviously is, or will be, a big impact on health workers and emergency responders as they encounter the virus and have to stay home.  But that aspect of the problem should turn around eventually as they gain immunity and are able to return to work."

Cuomo has failed NYC by not shutting everything down earlier. That’s why NYC has 30,000 cases. In comparison, Hong Kong, which faced this earlier with a similar population that shares a land border with China has only 300 cases. 

Results matter. Cuomo is 100X worse.

Cuomo needs to take this seriously. I don’t care if he gives nice press conferences. His performance has been abysmal.

PS - Trump being even worse doesn't excuse Cuomo, who had the ability to shut NYC down.  It was pretty obvious.  He had Wuhan, Korea, Italy as examples.  He knew NYC has 3 airports with several dozen direct flights to China, Korea, and Italy daily.  It was obvious, and he failed to act."

Do note that he immediately tried to undermine the rules of the stimulus law with a signing statement arguing that the president should have unregulated oversight over the $500 billion fund. Again, priorities for a narcissist and kleptocrat. 

Fortunately, Andrew Cuomo seems to know Trump better than Trump knows himself and so the New York governor will handle well the Twitter attacks and other nonsense surely coming his way. There are benefits to having a hereditary politician as governor. I'm sure Mario Cuomo had more than a few stories about Trump to tell his son(s)."

He's an ICU physician in a Chicago area hospital:

1. On average, he puts about 4 to 5 patients daily on ventilators.

2. The mortality rate in his hospital is from 60 to 80%!

3. On average a patient stays 10 to 14 days on a ventilator.

These are very sobering numbers..."
2020-03-29 18:18,Is there an an epidemiological benefit to the quarantining of the NYC metropolitan area that we refuse to consider because we can’t ethically conceive of doing so?  Serious question.
2020-03-29 17:13,"Trump takes great joy in scaring the public with outrageous comments off the top of his head as he did on Saturday, and then backtracks shortly after to make himself look like the rescuer. In the meantime he puts a scare in an already frightened public, particularly in the tri-state area. It is nothing short of emotional abuse of the people he has sworn to protect."
2020-03-29 17:15,"Trump initially said that COVID-19 was ""a hoax.""  He then said there were ""only 12 cases and they would be gone in a few days."" How well are he and his republican diehards doing so far?

How did Trump respond when his administration was told last year of the federal study that showed massive lack of preparedness for just such a pandemic?  He dismissed the study and closed down the agency that conducted it.  How has that turned out for our country?  Just a month into this pandemic and we are already out of key medical supplies like masks and gowns for our first responders and ER staff.

America the Great deserves better, far better."
2020-03-29 17:37,"As a president, Trump has failed and endangered the American people every step of the way. He has many, many enablers who are complicit and equally at fault. 

But the problem most on display is the rot beneath the veneer. There is not one problem. “The problem” is systemic; it has to do with the juxtaposition of “rugged individualism” and 330 million people. 

The federal response to COVID, coupled with a good two thirds of the country’s disregard for social distancing, science, things they can’t see, and their fellow citizens, is a trail of breadcrumbs that leads directly to the spread of, and colonization of, COVID-19. 

This can be a lesson, should we choose to make it one."
2020-03-29 17:22,"Why aren't all states enforcing shelter at home?  It's clear the federal gov't won't, but what exactly are states waiting for?  It's frustrating because as more and more states in the US and, countries around the world, see the number of cases rise, you see a lot of the same mistakes being made.  With the exception of a handful of countries, mostly in Asia, every country has responded the same way: do nothing when numbers are low, then enforce mandatory shutdowns when numbers start to rise.  This may have been acceptable a month or two ago, but at this point it's pretty clear that's a bad strategy.  And yet, everyone is following this playbook.  Why?  If your numbers are low, you have to shut it down now.  It's not an easy decision, but it's the only smart decision.  Sometimes complex probelms don't require a complex solution, just a little common sense will do."
2020-03-29 18:23,"I don't think officials are  doing enough to stop the spread of the illness. One suggestion: NYS should require supermarkets, big box stores, pharmacies to take temperature of employees and shoppers entering the stores that are open. No one with temperature should be allowed in. Require people to wear masks, gloves when they are in the stores. Limit number of people in the stores.
Public golf courses in Westchester County are open to all --they should be closed. A few days ago I received an e mail from a resident of Greenburgh who lives near a golf course that is open---she saw golfer's not practicing social distancing. One careless person who is infected can spread the illness to many. 
NY is doing a good job persuading many people to be careful. But many others are not careful and more people are dying as a result."
2020-03-29 18:23,"Hey folks, One of reasons that Colorado’s numbers are so low is that we are very short of test kits. My county’s Dept. of Health and Environment reports today that “We don’t have kits, and we don’t know when we’re going to get kits.” 
   This is our situation, despite the fact that a large university here (in this county, where most staff and students live) is developing a vaccine, a disinfectant, and a process for disinfecting masks.

This is what is needed so we can shelter in place for several weeks and then slowly and safely re-start the economy with proper protection. Next bill for Congress should halt most if not all debt payments and push for a WWII level of effort to produce tests, PPE’s, ventilators. We need it now. Not next week or next month."
2020-03-29 18:25,"Using the CDC's average projection for deaths in the U.S. from influenza, the death rate is 131 people per million.  So far, there is less than 1 death per million from COVID-19. Based on that, the government seems to be doing a very good job of handling the epidemic.  Pelosi is getting boring with her only platform of Blame Trump.  I haven't heard a single idea from her about how she would have handled the crises any better.  And Cuomo can cite all the cases he wants, but he has no idea how many there are and neither does anyone else.  At least 80% of those inflected don't even call their doctors because of mild or no symptoms.  Death rate is more meaningful but only if stated in deaths per capita.  Sure, we have more cases than Italy, a fact Cuomo repeats often.  But we have 1/9th the number of deaths.  And per capita, Italy has 16 deaths per million while we have less than 1.  But, it must be Trump's fault that we don't have more!"

2020-03-29 18:13,"President Trump would like to live in a world where no one criticizes him and everyone sees him as an unqualified success. Unfortunately, that is a delusion that does not serve the country nor himself well.  There should be an opposition that evaluates and criticizes the actions of the ruling party. Criticism is the appropriate action especially in this time of crises when everything is going so poorly. The appropriate response for the President is not to attack those who criticize as enemies. It is to listen and respond to the needs of the country in the best possible ways. Perhaps for the first time ever for him, he needs to further national unity in the effort to fight Covid and not further national division."

I know that I'm not optimistic with Pelosi or Schumer as our leadership.  Neither of them are bold or compelling leaders.  Who has the power to influence Trump?  Sounds crazy... but perhaps the best way to get to Trump is through Ivanka?  There is no one in the world he trusts more than her."

Please report on how we will get the capacity to make more face masks.  I've seen multiple reports of fashion houses, ""My Pillow"" company, Haynes, mobilizing to make face masks.  Will they be able to meet demand?"

2020-03-29 18:46,"There is no doubt that the federal response to this pandemic has been terribly slow.  But also note how horribly unprepared the states and local jurisdictions have been.  Additionally, states have not kept up funding for medical care, and hospitals have gone to a low inventory approach to save money (or, in the case of for-profit hospitals, to make money).  I can only hope that when this passes, the voters remember the need to increase spending on medical care."

If this is true  then all the finger pointing and Monday morning quarterbacking rings hollow. 

The 24 hour news cycles are getting disgusting to watch. Behind every report on Covid19 is a political agenda, behind every statement by our politicians is a political agenda, and I mean all of them. Covid19 caught the entire world of guard. No one was anywhere near prepared for this. Now our job as a society is to deal with this and get our country back to health and to work. 

I will take this one step further....As I read the comments written to this article it gives me great pause. To think that there is such hatred in our society for elected officials and their decisions ,... based on what? What happened yesterday...that is called hindsight which is always 100% correct. 

I am waiting for one media outlet to stop the sniping and second guessing and help to solve this unfortunate event. I am hoping that someone in a position of authority, perhaps at the NY Times, to step up and tell all of it's reporters , columnists, and editorials to put aside their political agendas and help America solve this pandemic.

Anything is possible where a mad, desperate president is concerned.
The Republicans had an opportunity to stop this travesty. They could have helped remove him from office. They just couldn't quit him.
People speak about the dissatisfaction some Republican politicians have voiced, mainly in whispers, about Trump. You would think if they cared more about their families, their constituents, their country, they would get up on their feet and demand action from their leadership.

Dr. Birx, in spite of her years of service and experience, seems afraid to stray from Trump's narrative and tell the truth instead. Dr. Fauci has had death threats because of Trump cultists  don't want to see their beloved Leader's fantasies undercut.  Determined to still tell the truth, Fauci has evoked every ounce of diplomacy he can muster to counter Trump's lies and inform the public.  When a reporter asks what Trump would say to all the Americans who are very afraid at this moment, Trump scolds him and says he is a bad reporter.  We are scared, Trump--scared of the virus and of how your unimaginable ineptitude and crippling narcissism has cost and will cost the lives of thousands of Americans."

2020-03-29 18:49,"Our American culture, ethos, and economics is uniquely ill equipped (literally) to deal with such a nature disaster. The over inflated importance we've given to a patchwork of rules (i.e. 'states rights') and the individual in their 'free expression' of baseless lies and propaganda for their own enrichment broadcast and amplified by digital platforms does not serve the common good. We've allowed what once was a thriving middle class to be hollowed out for the sake of corporate and executive wealth. We allowed ourselves to be conned into spending trillions on senseless wars in the Middle East.

There are going to be a lot of hard lessons ahead if you've gullible enough to be conned some more. Recent cons: masks don't really help, POTUS saying we have every thing under control, that there are plenty of tests for everyone, let's have a corporate slush fund of bailout money, let's bailout companies that try their hardest to avoid paying taxes, that it will be business as usual by Easter. 

There is apparently nothing more American than being conned. It's what we've trained ourselves to think is smart business-like behavior to 'get ahead' and 'return shareholder value'.  A tiger doesn't just change their stripes. 

Watch for a tsunami of company bankruptcies this summer so they can 're-structure', shirk paying contractors for work they are doing right now, and pawn off any pension liabilities to the Feds (that would be you) for pennies on the dollar."

""There seems to be significant parts of our country not greatly affected by the virus.""

Most cases are in 2 states, New York (especially New York City) and New Jersey. The rest of the US, especially the vast center, has been lightly touched. 

As many others have pointed out, the coronavirus cases and deaths are significantly outnumbered by the seasonal flu, yet roughly half of Americans don't bother to get an annual flu vaccination (I'll bet they will next flu season, though). 

What scares Americans most about the coronavirus is the much-higher death rate: nearly 2% in the US, versus 0.1% for the seasonal flu. To me, that's a huge difference."

Hospitals have responded by placing masks, gloves, cleansing supplies are under lock and key. THis should be reported because this crisis can be best solved by working together and optimizing our limited resources for those on the front line who need these resources the most to take care of the sickest patients.

How can the city/state not have any medical supplies to care for New Yorkers in a week? If this is truly the case, why is the local health department not taking immediate action to mitigate risk by offsetting other practices such as social distancing? Are we not ""NYer's""?

Both Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio have been demonstrating some active leadership, but why are we still pandering to the ""American Freedom"" mantra and letting people go out to parks, or recklessly traveling to and frou ground zero, and grocery shopping, etc on their own 'will.'

It is probably unbelievable for me because when I think American, I think of educated or logical Americans who perhaps are reading this news. I do not think of a large number of Americans who are unable to receive adequate education due to its high costs and who barely make ends meet-- for whom it is easier to believe conspiracy theories rather than appreciate science recommendations and values needed in a political leadership. You cannot blame those Americans when their real college education is replaced by unfactual propaganda, sometimes propagated by the religious heads. It has been found in many reports that percentage of college-educated Americans who approve of Trump is much less than the percentage of non-college-educated Americans for the same. If people really want change for long-term, then a push or support for universal college education or donations towards financial aid to state schools will go a long way instead of verbal attacks on Trump and Trump supporters.

Further, it is appalling when you consider that most of the readers of the NYT's likely fall in to the highly educated cohort. It goes to show that education does not go along with common sense. 

The OpEd on 3/20/2020 by Dr.David L. Katz, founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, and his discussion this morning on CNN were so spot on. Basically:

1. The horse is already out of the barn. Hundreds of thousand, perhaps millions, are already carriers of COVID-19. Based on that, thousands will die.
2. Sheltering in place is of limited efficacy now. We need to start returning to normalcy for the social and economic good of ALL people. Look to Sweden as an example. 
2. +90% will show none to mild symptoms of the virus. These people should be returning to work and normalcy in the next two to eight weeks.
3. The at risk, over 60 and/or those with underlying health issues,  should continue to shelter in place until there is little to no cause of contagion. 

Thousands will still die, but 1% or less.

Yes, President Trump has some blame. But, it is vastly due to the inept bungling by NYS and NYC we are here. They did not contain and trace in the first instances from New Rochelle. Thus, the virus grew exponentially in the NYC metro area.

Jon Bel Edwards, the Democrat Governor of Louisiana has been asking for ventilators from the feds and gotten zero. Louisiana doesn’t have the kind of money New York does, and couldn’t pay for 4,000 ventilators, much less 16,000, like New York. Yes, Louisiana has fewer people, but their per capita attack rate is right up there with New York. Cuomo is becoming a whiner who could have bought his way out of the desperate situation he’s in.

And, so, it seems, the innocent crewmen suffered for the misdeeds of their leader.

There something in the grim numbers that deserves comments. The USA has about 20% of the caseload of the world, but only 7% of the deaths. It seems, then, that American healthcare has saved many lives. Another factor in the death load is many who have died had pre-existing conditions.

Last week Dr Birx implies that Cuomo is overstating NY’s need, and she said there’s no evidence it’s necessary yet to make impossible choices to prioritize care.  And Trump amplified it loudly. 

This back is infuriating, because it obvious disinformation. This is simple math. Take ventilators:

Federal and state governments have world class logistics and epidemiology. They must know the vent supply in NY: how many are there, are coming soon, are in use, are newly occupied every day, and how many become available because patients come off or die. 

They must have models of demand for vents: how many patients will newly need a vent each day, given a set of assumptions about how the disease will spread. 

And they must have an estimate of when demand will outstrip supply. Yes, it does take some arithmetic, which been doable instantly on a home pc since the 80’s. 

Same logic applies to PPE. 

We are being kept in the dark, presumably to “prevent panic”. Instead of data and real information, we get from the WH imprecise blather (“trust us, Jared is on it”).

What is also painful to read is that the Federal Government was so ill prepared for this pandemic, in all areas of planning from ventilators to PPE. The  writing was on the wall in December 2019, with the report, that the now tragically deceased Dr Li in China, had tried to alert his colleagues to a new dangerous virus, which was totally repressed by the Chinese regime.
In the UK, the Johnson Government entirely failed to step up to this crisis and seemed to think lectures about hand washing, with nothing else was sufficient. There is now a lockdown with non-essential businesses forced to shut down, with people advised to stay at home, but not legally forced to do so.
Meanwhile, the Government is not yet testing routinely even NHS workers and the numbers of deaths each day is rapidly increasing to over 1,000 today, with an NHS Consultant, a surgeon and a GP having now died of this virus.
When this trauma passes, our leaders need to  be held accountable for their failure to act and utter failure to recognise the devastating, danger to life posed by this virus. We all need to be able to see through the inevitable propaganda  which will be deployed."

2020-03-29 20:00,"This is a President totally distracted by the selfish and narcissistic desire to preserve an image of himself. That is why he lies. That is why he tweets daily and lies. That is why he refuses to accept responsibility using lies. America is getting what it sowed, a President lurching from crisis to crisis whether it is immigration, the Wall, less taxes for the rich, tariffs, impeachment and now Covid 19. Trump is so focused on his image, he is unable to deal with the substance of a problem. America had gone from a great country to a chaotic destabilized democracy! Why - because Trump has a narcissistic personality disorder and his only focus is on his own image."

Talk about projection!  What a gross lie, the media has been the only truth to power messenger of the severity of the outbreak, and if anyone pooh-poohed the initial few cases, it was Trump himself.

It would be nice if we all shared the same reality, but unfortunately, we don't.  

But it was welcoming news to hear that Jared Kushner actually got something done in terms of deliveries of critical supplies from, of all places, China.   Maybe that's why Trump has dropped ""the Chinese virus"" from his news conferences, as it seems a bit much to keep attacking the much needed help the US on its own has not been able to supply, largely because pandemic readiness hasn't been a priority of the Trump administration."
2020-03-29 19:59,"I mean, it's not like Trump would intentionally withhold life-saving resources from states, just to make democratic governors look bad... right?"
2020-03-29 20:00,"So basically Nancy tied the Government in knots for months pursuing her impeachment efforts that, from the very briefing, it was clear would never go anywhere. At the same time, the virus was taking root in China. The Country had our eyes focused unnecessarily on partisan politics instead of open and clear and on alert for a pandemic. Now, she has the audacity to accuse the President of not acting quickly enough?  The irony is delicious."
2020-03-29 20:03,"It amazes me that 'third world' countries like Vietnam have been able to control the spread better than the US has, despite being way more densely populated AND closer to China, with less time to prepare before their first cases. 
The US has almost 2 months to do something, anything! But Trump was literally playing golf after his CDC meeting up to March 8th, waiting for the virus to spread to all 50 states before finally addressing it. 
Its too late. We'll be dealing with this longer than we needed to, and thousands more lives will be lost because of one man's stubborn denial of data, science, and facts. This whole administration should be tried for criminal negligence and endangerment."

The human condition is always of our own making, can this one event make us more than what we have been: a more compassionate creature for the planet?"
2020-03-29 20:11,"President Trump backtracked on floating the possibility of imposing an “enforceable” travel quarantine on the New York region.
Mr. Trump had come under intense criticism from Gov.  Cuomo of New York, who assailed the idea as “a declaration of war on states.”
My question to Governor Cuomo is the following: If Long Island which comprises Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau  & Suffolk Counties, has a rampant Corona virus outbreak, would he impose an enforceable travel quarantine on Long Island?"
2020-03-29 20:07,"How could Trump have not consulted the affected governors before floating his proposed shelter in place edict, which probably wasn’t either enforceable or constitutional?

2020-03-29 20:13,"This is insanity. Front line medical workers should not have to interrupt the crucial work they are doing to beg for life-saving medical supplies. POTUS continuously vaunts the US as the greatest nation on earth – God save us all if this is the standard by which we measure ourselves. Chinese medical supplies – including masks – are arriving in New York, but European nations have found that Chinese made masks do not fit well, the filters do not function properly, and rapid test kits are unreliable. The biggest problem, as I see it, is that Trump’s administration has bungled its response to this crisis from day one, even going back to April of 2018 when John Bolton began dismantling the team in charge of pandemic response. He fired its leadership and disbanded the team; to say that in light of previous pandemics such as H1N1 this was short-sighted is an understatement. These cuts, coupled with the administration’s calls to cut the CDC’s budget as well as that of other public health agencies, shows where this Republican administration’s priorities lie - certainly not with the citizens of your nation."
2020-03-29 20:16,"I am for quarantine. But we all need to adhere to strict quarantine. It is painful but in the long run, we will all get through this.

2020-03-29 20:22,"If there is a governmental outcry at the state level today at a proposal to quarantine NY, NJ, and CT, imagine what it would have been in late January. Trump was screwed no matter what he did. Thank god he closed our airspace to China, over Democratic objections. His big foul up was the lack of testing kits. Not because it would have told us to quarantine the unquarantine-able, but because it would have told us that so many were asymptomatically and minorly infected that death rates for those under 80 might be so low that the country could have continued to work, while those 70+ isolated themselves with community help."
2020-03-29 20:22,"Reading some of the comments from Trump apologists angers me! Just like Trump they refuse to acknowledge that Trump’s incompetence is killing Americans! It’s the awful truth! But it’s Truth! 

Trump was told of about on January 14th 2020. That same week WHO offered test kits to all countries, the CDC which is being run by a Trump appointee with NO experience in Public Health refused the test kits. Trump said and tweeted “it’s a hoax, folks.” And he even said, “New Democratic witch hunt!” There are videos. 

No matter how Trump and his Trumpistas spin it, Truth is Truth. We’ve wasted three weeks while Trump lies, misinformed and refused to take the counsel of experts! Americans are dying!

2020-03-29 20:29,"Many here have already commented on the ineptitude of the current inmate of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and rightly so.
One of the steps I like to see my home state of New York take is to make it illegal for any individual or entity other than one providing intensive care to all who need it to own a ventilator, except if that ventilator is currently used for life support, such as for end-stage lung disease or ALS .  We have already read stories of some of the 1% and especially the 0.1% trying to hoard these life-saving devices in case they become infected.  Similarly, private clinics and hospitals that only serve the rich and famous have no business keeping those devices from those whose life depends on them.  If there ever was a case for eminent domain, this is one."

2020-03-29 20:42,"The greatest tragedy of the situation is, of course, the lives lost and families who loved them.  In the longer term, I feel the biggest test will be one of generosity on the part of the 1% who rule this country.  If the lockdown and slowdown stretch on for many months, will our ruling autocrats, the CEOs, the presidents of companies, the big bosses, go straight to their playbook of cutting losses in order to increase their own personal profits?  If so, we are looking at an enormous loss of jobs and migrations of workers.  All we know of such times comes from what you can read from 1880s-1890s history in the days of Andrew Carnegie, J.P.

2020-03-29 20:32,"Dear New York Times:
The story is the ventilators. The story that is not being covered is the ventilators and the anesthesiology machines that can be converted into alternate ventilators. How many are there in the United Sates? How many are in each state? What hospitals are they in? How many are broken? Can they be repaired? By the same token, how many are in use now? How many patients in each state need ventilators?
We need a ‘round the clock ventilator team that knows where all the ventilators in the nation are and how many patients in each state need ventilator support so that ventilators can be flown or trucked to the area where they are needed.
Please start working on this so folks can start thinking about borrowing them and deploying them to the areas where they are needed immediately. We don’t have time to manufacture enough to meet the needs of New York in the next 14 to 21 days, but we don’t need to. We already have them. We just need to agree that we need to get them to where they are needed.

Trump takes no responsibility and all decisions (and non-decisions) on the COVID virus pandemic have been wrong, idiotic and late.
Thank God the Governors (Democratic and Republican) have stepped up.  The CDC and FDA actually dithered in the early stages and let the virus flower - despite lots of pleas from state health agencies and medical institutions.  If those two guardians of our health system had worked better, maybe even Trumps decision to ignore the virus and do happy talk would have had less bad consequences.

The ventilator czar will track two things: the location of ventilators and the location of patients with Covid-19 who need ventilators. Why: There is no time to manufacture all the ventilators. States are competing with each other and the federal government to amass ventilators. We are competing for resources, and we are all going to lose. But if we cooperate and share resources, maybe we can get out of this alive. How: First, the team is tasked with tracking the location of all ventilators in each state. The team will track operational ventilators, broken ventilators and ventilator alternates, anesthesiology equipment that can be equipped to serve as ventilators. The broken machines will be repaired and the alternate equipment will be outfitted to serve a new purpose. Second, the team will track how may ventilators are being used for in each location and how many patients are waiting in the wings.

he is responsible for, have done a ""good"" job, or even an
acceptable job? I've asked such people to explain this with
reason/evidence,  but haven't  yet found any replies.

One answer is that they've been
told   this by people in their social milieu or social media
community and are either ignorant of or mentally suppressing everything that  contradicts this word of mouth chain of approval which  internalizes into an individual judgment;  or they just get
off on howling their rage with trump as  snarler in chief;  or
something about how MSM has been co-opted into promoting and staging 
the daily   fictions of   the chief decider's great big
 day making great big decisions have convinced people that 
behind the performance there is a competent source of 
authority; or it is the reflex instigated to rally around
the POTUS at times of emergency, and that approval

40 years of conservative propaganda have led us to this moment.  They, the conservatives, made Trump president.  He is following their states rights anti-federal government dogma when he refuses to use the powers of the presidency to aid the citizens of the states battling this pandemic.  He is behaving in the churlish, immature, hyper-partisan manner they admire when he attacks and denies aid to the governors of blue states.  He IS them.

Elections really do have consequences.  Get out this November and remove these fools and incompetents from the offices they have disgraced."

Meanwhile, at the Insane Asylum (AKA the Oval Office) the chief Inmate is touting the RATINGS of his coronavirus press briefings – claiming media are ‘going crazy’ that it rivals some of the most high-rated television programs. He tweeted: 'Because the 'Ratings' of my News Conferences etc. are so high, 'Bachelor finale, Monday Night Football type numbers' according to the @nytimes, the Lamestream Media is going CRAZY,' Trump posted to Twitter Sunday. 'Trump is reaching too many people, we must stop him.' said one lunatic,' the president claimed, adding he will 'See you at 5:00 P.M.!'"

Fauci is putting up a 'fake target' that he knows he can achieve without too much difficulty - but he has not tied it to a target for infection.  The NY Times model allows you to achieve 50,000 deaths over 71 days of moderate restrictions.  200,000 deaths is about 6-7% infection - its a big fat FAIL in my opinion.  Italy is peaking at 1-2%

BUT, if you don't shut down the airports the USA is in big trouble. 

Look at the figures for Italy and Australia (worldometer - countries - then go to the charts for daily new cases)- there is some  very good news. Australia has had consistent reduction in cases for a week. Italy has stabilised.    

They have both locked down on travel.  Our airports are closed because travellers are a key source of transmission.

Yet roughly half of Americans don't get an annual flu vaccination, even though 20,000-50,000 Americans (I've heard different numbers) die each year from the seasonal flu.

The Times ran an article last week on the DPA in which it noted that it's an ""open question"" whether the federal government can require a manufacturer to make something that it's never made before. As I understand it, GM's Kokomo plant always made auto transmissions. If the US government ""ordered"" GM to convert its Kokomo plant to ventilator production, GM undoubtedly would point out that it's never made ventilators before and insist that it isn't required to do so. 

I'm all in favor of citing the DPA to lean on GM for fair pricing (the NYT also ran an article on two price-gouger brothers about two weeks ago, and I distinctly recall NYT readers having a much different view of the practice then), but I'd rely on the existing voluntary cooperation of US manufacturers to convert unused plants (closed auto-transmission plants in Kokomo IN, for example) to the production of things we need now. If US manufacturers weren't volunteering, I'd feel different. But they are.

If I were going to invoke the DPA, I'd go after Gilead Sciences. It recently ""discontinued"" its practice of allowing consumers to buy some FDA-approved drug that Gilead sells for some other purpose. I'd order Gilead to make more."

2020-03-29 22:12,"As a matter of national security and public health, I think it should be mandatory that any coverage of Trump be accompanied by a split screen of Gov Cuomo.  A simple daily comparison of the two would do wonders, not only to reassure American citizens, but markets as well.  

Just because we have a second rate reality TV actor bankrupting the Federal government doesn't mean America has dysfunctional government or leadership. 

Isn't it time to get a petition going to quarantine the Trump Administration heads on a Princess Cruise liner circling the Atlantic for the duration? The taxpayers have just paid for a bunch of them, he can take his pick."
2020-03-29 22:14,"So, basically, per the Rose Garden:

Trump is unable to see how the surgical mask demand can have gone up so precipitously if everything was on the up and up.

Trump restores the deductability of the three-martini lunch for corporations.

Trump wonders if ventilators are going in the front door of the states and out the back door at a profit; suggests reporters look into possible nefarious behavior."
2020-03-29 22:15,"Listen up, we in the rest of the world are sick of Trump saying that America has the best minds in the world. How then did America end up with this man become your president? He is now accusing American hospitals of hoarding or stealing supplies."
2020-03-29 22:15,"I phoned an octogenarian cousin last evening to ask how she’s doing. Eventually, the conversation turned to politics, and I learned that she, who used to be a staunch Democrat, now intends to vote for trump in November. She said she’s getting all her news from Fox now, and
she’s convinced that trump is doing a good job protecting us from the virus. When I managed to sputter, “What job?” she replied that he has found both a cure and a way to make a vaccine available in a couple of months. She also said she thinks the virus is no big deal, so she has been going grocery shopping every other day in stores that are mobbed by the ill and the well seeking scarce items. trump’s misinformation- larded briefings are going to get us all killed."
2020-03-29 22:16,"The most terrifying thought to me, right now, is what would happen if I or a family member were to become seriously ill, in need of hospitalization or a ventilator, and could not access care because all are taken. That's an increasingly frightening and possible prospect in NYC, as the numbers of infected shoot up and one wonders if any beds or ventilators are currently available at all. To die because nothing at all is available to care for you is a horrifying thought. Especially at age 25."
2020-03-29 22:16,"Trump is congratulating himself in the Rose Garden this evening. As in ""When Harry met Sally,"" I want what he's having."
2020-03-29 22:18,"Before we credit Kushner with getting supplies and, I don’t know, bringing peace to the Mid East and curing cancer, let me say that some San Francisco companies have also gotten bulk medical supplies, from China, without his magic.  Factories are reopening, it’s not a miracle. Certainly I want New York to have what they need — but let’s not lose sight of the fact that Trump’s failures — and those of his administration— have cost many American lives."
2020-03-29 22:19,Please tell me why some states are not on total lockdown yet?
2020-03-29 22:20,"Two things: HIPAA is a dangerous thing during a pandemic. The public needs to know and has a right to know basic demographics of victims of this virus and their locations. If they don’t, they will not take the threat seriously. Withholding information at this time from a nationalized database is tantamount to throwing gasoline on the fire. It has to stop!

Second thing:

While the country after country shuts down, most citizens of other places can depend on nationalized healthcare. What about everyone who has just become unemployed? What about all of our part time grocery workers?? I have a close family member working at a grocery store. His girlfriend worked there also, but just quit because she was only making $7 per hour, with no health benefits. These people are serving our country and working on the frontlines. 
The government needs to step up now to protect these workers and pay them more. Food is just as important right now as medical care. Institute federal safety rules for them to wear PPE. Make sure even part-time grocery workers have health coverage through the government. If not, we will have an even bigger problem on our hands. This is chess. You have to think four steps ahead. 

The problem is that it doesn’t seem like anyone in charge is thinking even one step ahead. They’ve been acting surprised as the crisis grows. All of them. Wake up and help your people!!! China doesn’t just shut down a whole country for no good reason."
2020-03-29 22:20,"So Mr. Trump believes he should get the Nobel Peace Prize.   However, he is closer to being charged for Crimes Against Humanity in the International World Court for the way in which he is  has given preferential treatment to certain groups, plus the status of immigrants still being held.  Several patterns of his behavior meet the  criteria for tjje charges.  The failures of the federal government in the handling of this pandemic are unconscionable and there are at least 27 hot viruses waiting in the wings for the right time to emerge."
2020-03-29 22:20,"And yet our ignorant, ill mannered, mouth breathing president is on TV right now saying that something is fishy about the high need for equipment, as if these  brave, and hardworking at risk 
 people on the front lines or the over stretched hospitals are steeling from the government. "" I hear stories...."" 
It's a good thing I took my shoes off at the door or I would have thrown them at the TV when I heard that."
2020-03-29 22:25,"American exceptionalism and nationalism have led to viral exponentialism.
America is about a relatively small number of very privileged men and the establishments they own being served by most of the country’s resources.
Trump and the Congress are just making that more glaringly obvious in the midst of a national crisis.
Over recent years, a great many abroad have lost confidence in the US.
Given its lack of principles and meaningful direction.
I think now Americans themselves are likely to begin doing so too.

We’ve already sacrificed our grandchildren, after all. Why not our grandparents, as well?"

2020-03-29 22:24,"Please shut Donald Trump up.  Now he nonchalantly is talking about 100,000 deaths, and bragging it will not be 2.2 million deaths."
2020-03-29 22:27,"Trump implied tonight without evidence that some hospitals were pretending they didn't have enough supplies, and some were hoarding respirators, depriving others in need.

This is the fantasy world of the president."
2020-03-29 22:34,"They need to get started on additional stimuli.  

What was enacted this past week addresses only a portion of what is going to be a very long road back.  Plunging tax revenues at the state and local levels are the next issue.  These entities have only just begun assessing the damage.  

Getting the economy restarted is another area.  Maybe the federal government can get a serious infrastructure program going."
2020-03-29 22:29,They are going to need to flatter trump and tell him how wonderful he is and how much they admire him.  Then and only then will he help them.
2020-03-29 22:29,Wait a minute.  You mean I can't go to church on Easter.  I'm crushed especially as the great leader told me I could regardless of his pandemic.
2020-03-29 22:30,"""If we did nothing..., 2.2 million people."" I wish leaders would impede  the temptation into going into a self-aggrandizement rant. You can gloat all you want at the end of all.... this."
2020-03-29 22:33,"I don't think I ever thought in my lifetime I would see a public health crisis handled as badly as AIDS was those first few years. I have been having flashbacks of remembering how awful those days were. And I feel like we're right back to that again.  All we're getting are lies, blame, and insults from this leader. 

At some point I can't watch the coverage anymore because it's too upsetting.  This country has learned nothing from 40 years ago."
2020-03-29 16:59,I think that it is wrong of the NYT to report a death of an infant who died with coronavirus in the child’s blood and make no other comments or refer to the overall health of the child. Your reader has no idea if that child had other health issues that were truly consequential for the infant. Trust in NYT reporting going fast down the drain. Do a better job on reporting overall people’s health and do more comparative reports between other viruses!
2020-03-29 22:34,Trump is running a two track attack. He is feeding his base red meat by braggadocio and insulting reporters while at the same time smartly taking his advisors counsel on what to get done for the blue states in a manner akin to pulling teeth. He wants to be the hero and the anti-hero.
2020-03-29 22:37,"When Donald Trump says to Yamiche Alcindor, ""You people,"" does he mean:

Journalists?
Women?
Black women?
Anyone black?
Anyone who doesn't agree with his 'logic?'

(I would advise Ms. Alcindor to wash her hands; apparently, they are all handling the same microphone without gloves.)"
2020-03-29 17:20,"I wish they’d stop reporting “overnight death toll record” for countries. Exponential growth means significantly more people are infected every single day than there was the day before, up until the infections begin declining. Since Spain is not yet declining, the fact that an record overnight death toll is achieved is completely expected. The same will probably happen tomorrow night, and the next night. 

These facts are expected, unsurprising, and should be no cause for alarm to most people. Record death tolls will likely happen every day in the US until the infection reaches it’s peak. It’s not actual news. News should be new things that are discovered. These “record death” tolls were set in stone at the outset of the outbreak and simply are not noteworthy in any since.

Many more people died from non-coronavirus deaths yesterday than the totality of coronavirus deaths. No one reports on that. Why? Because it is expected, it is not news, it is not noteworthy. So are these deaths. These reports cause unnecessary alarm. The NYT is doing a disservice to it’s readers and it’s country by reporting in this way. But hey, it gets clicks. Even in these dire times it seems there strategy of “create the most alarming headline possible” is in full effect. 

I wish they’d realize the negative impact this type of reporting is having on the psyche of the people. But they never will."

2020-03-29 22:42,"New York City has committees of experts that think about what to do in case of a pandemic in the city.  I can't believe that de Blasio was caught so flat-footed during this mess.  His only out is blaming Donald Trump.  This is a huge embarrassment to New York, especially post 9/11.  Was nothing learned?  Instead of working out in Brooklyn every day, Bill should have been planning for situations like this."

2020-03-29 22:45,"During Trumps 'news conference' earlier this evening he said that there is no way that hospitals that regularly use 20,000 mask per week now need 200,000.  'They must be going out the backdoor'.  Does this guy have any decency?"
2020-03-29 22:45,During the news conference in the ladt fifteen minutes.. Trump said where are doing so well because we are doing more tests than anyone. Minutes later he said Germany's numbers are looking so good because Germany tests more than us. Just now he slipped back into saying that America is testing more than anyone again. It's lie after after lie.
2020-03-29 22:46,"In his tweets, Mr. Trump was bragging about his TV ratings at his daily news briefings, comparing them to the season finale of the Bachelor. Coronavirus cases and deaths, in the meantime, continue to skyrocket in the US, to 140,000+ and 2,400+ respectively. Just another example of his priorities, and of his lack of empathy for the people he was elected to take care of."
2020-03-29 22:47,President flim flam strikes again.
2020-03-29 22:48,36-24-36 was Trump’s concept of a model until Fauci schooled him.
2020-03-29 22:48,"The greatest generation survived two major world crises in the Great Depression and WWII, under a President who for over 12 years served the American people while  he, himself, battled polio all that time.  And he didn't have twitter or any  of those easily used features to rely on.  He did it with simple  words and what they called ""fire side chats."" 

And  he was followed by a President who wasn't a flash and dash kind of guy, who said those simple words ""the buck stops here"" in plain languiage on his desk in the  oval office and who also  said ""It is amazing what one can accomplish when they don't care who gets credit for it.""

And on returning to Missouri after his presidency when sought after by  businesses to serve on their boards turned them all down with this  comment: ""You don't want me,  you want the presidency and it is not for sale; it belongs to the American people.""  

That was FDR and Truman.

Oh! For such leadership today!"
2020-03-29 22:48,Donald Trump refuses to accept responsibility for anything remotely negative about himself or his administration's failure to prepare for this pandemic. And it is galling that he constantly denies what he has previously said. His best course would be to minimize his statements since he says whatever comes into his head at the moment and what he says does not seem to involve much thought. I would blame his advisers but I don't think they have any affect on his shoot from the hip statements. And it really gets old to have these corporate types get up there and the first words out of their mouths are to praise this guy for his leadership. His movement forward was driven only by increasingly scary facts and his own need for self preservation.
2020-03-29 22:49,"Social distancing works. But Trump knows best. Time after time we see him breaking the rules even WITH medical people being there, participating. He is good at corrupting even well established principles and people smarter than himself (that is nearly everybody.) 
Anyway some good news from the birthplace of Rupert Murdoch.
Australia has started to flatten the curve (remember the pre Trump notion of data?

The only thing we had was social distancing.
""The number of new cases of COVID-19 in Australia has dropped from a growth rate of 25 percent per day to nine percent, giving positive indications the country's rate of infection is slowing.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said ""we have had a somewhat slowing of the growth in epidemiology curve but it's not enough. We have to slow it further.""""

2020-03-29 22:50,"Does this rule apply to every where in the United States? Many states are not yet practicing social distancing.

Trump seems to be treating states getting clobbered by the coronavirus like he treated Puerto Rico after the hurricane. I remember Trump stuck with the belief that less than a hundred people died and that the Puerto Rico leaders were lying about the damage. Instead of acting Presidential he threw out paper towels."
2020-03-29 22:50,"The White House has lost any respect I may have had for it.  Tired of the lying, partisan bickering, self-dealing, everything.  I’ve never seen such a terrible political party in my life hold power in any country, I am baffled by this administration and their actions.  So many needless deaths for the sake of scoring a rhetorical point here and there.  It’s disgusting and foul."
2020-03-29 22:50,More chaos and confusion.  But yet some of you are still supporting Trump. Why?
2020-03-29 22:31,"Totally agree with the President’s perspective that the Press is sinking even further in terms of public trust. When they stand up and taunt the President with accusatory questions, most Americans are turned off."

2020-03-29 22:52,"It’s amazing how this far into this, there is no national strategy for simple things, stores and people are left to their own devices to form a patchwork set of guidelines.
  Let’s take grocery stores for instance. Since we have shut down just about every way for humans to assemble in one spot, we still have the grocery store problem. Would it really be that hard to come up with a way people can get food without putting their health and life at risk, plus putting the life and health of store workers at even more risk.
    The number one thing we can do is make 2 rules. Rule 1 if you shop you must wear a mask and eye protection, this would help. Rule 2 , by law, you cannot enter a store if you have a cough or are running a fever, Those 2 things, if they are law, would help a lot. This presupposes that people can actually get masks. In America 2020 that’s asking a lot.
  If the above can’t be done, then all grocery stores must go to full time delivery , or have people call in orders, pay by credit card, and pick up their groceries outside the store or curb side pickup.
  We are either going to figure out how to adapt to this situation or it will just continue. Almost from the start we have been on our own. Just a few simple rules put in place can save lives."
2020-03-29 22:53,"I'm going to give credit to this ""president"" for at least extending his wishful deadline. I really thought he would double and triple down on Easter because ""American Resurrection"" was just too great to pass up. (Think of the t-shirt sales!) So... yay for that, I guess. Though that's a bit like congratulating someone for not driving into the Grand Canyon. It's pretty obvious."
2020-03-29 22:51,"Why does anyone listen to this man ?  He has been out of his depth since Day One.  He never thought he would win and loved the attention that running for President attracted, but, for him, it was just another episode of a TV reality show.

Mr Trump.  NONE of us takes any notice of what you say.  You are so way out of your depth.  It is insulting to all of us that the media follows you so slavishly. 

Right now, Dr Fauci and Governor Cuomo are the only guys who count.   Trump, just go play golf... we don't need to hear anything about that."
2020-03-29 22:51,"During his campaign presser in the Rose Garden he is stressing 2.2 million dead if he had done nothing. So there it is. Anything under 2,2 will be considered a great victory."

2020-03-29 22:55,"If the president had been in the hospital or done outpatient services he would understand why so many gloves are being used, masks too. Every time the provider goes to a different patient there are new gloves and masks, so germs are not transmitted between patients. I witnessed this firsthand earlier this year. Had masks and gloves not been changed I would very well be dead now. and no, i did not  have COVID-19. this was before COVID showed up here. His remarks are not helping the caregivers."

2020-03-29 22:56,"First of all, our thanks for keeping us informed with your updates; data that, being based on reality, is what we need right now. I say this because right now, even if Trump  may utter the truth (likely by mistake), he has lost all credibility, the danger that occurs as a charlatan incurs in telling the truth, when no one dares to believe it anymore. And yet, as time goes by, we have made some progress...other than the rise in cadavers awaiting their fate, in the sense that Governors have learned to flatter Mr. 'bragadoccio'...so to get the help States need from the federal government."

2020-03-29 23:03,"Just a week ago, Trump was observing that the US will be open for business by Easter.  Maybe he was echoing the wishes of his Wall Street friend Steve Schwarzman  who it seems stands to lose a $B with every week of market turbulence.   Or maybe, he is just trying to play the markets so that his lackeys can short it.  Or maybe, he just decided to listen to Tony Fauci and Andrew Cuomo after all.  

Any which way you look at it - ignore Trump and listen to the Dem governors.  The man in the White House is an incoherent and rudderless mug."

Todd asked whether trump had blood on his hands because of this infant's death. Biden didn't say one way or the other, claiming that there was no need to go that far.

Yes. There is a need to go there. People are suffering and will die all because of trump's utter and complete failure as a leader. 

The consequences flowing from his lack of consistent guidance and misleading and false statements are on full display in Lynchburg, VA, home to Liberty University.

Jerry Falwell, Jr, president of that university, and all in supporter of trump, is on record of uttering false conspiracies that N. Korea was behind this virus.

But he also arranged a grand display of praise for his “let the private sector do it” with rich thanks from a crowd of CEOs who were eager to praise Trump’s administration. They remember what happened with GM. Don’t forget that the people who need the ventilators and PPE are either facing or experiencing big shortages, and the test kits are insufficient to measure the size of the pandemic and even are too few to test many suspected cases. This display of self-congratulations is disgraceful. Trump is still not planning a head."

And world wide China seems to be stepping into the void of leadership traditionally occupied by American Presidents. The US has a quarter of the population of China and more cases of the infection. What is wrong here?  The American century courtesy of Trump appears to be over exactly 100 year since it began.
2020-03-29 23:06,"I don't think Trump pulled back on a quarantine because of Cuomo.

I think he thought a quarantine would invoke the civil authority coverage for his business interruption insurance.  The hotels and Trump Tower must be hurting.  

While he was musing about it someone must have told him the own acts exclusion would nullify coverage for him because he still has an economic interest in those propertles.

I bet this was something Jared googled."
2020-03-29 23:09,"And with the Abomination in Chief crowing about his ""ratings"" today - it's becoming clearer and clearer that he's leveraging the greatest national crisis since the Civil War as a daily re-election stunt in which the media is forced to participate. The depth of this monster's evil seems bottomless."
2020-03-29 23:04,"Trump alleging NY doing something bad with the PPEs and refused to give details. This is exactly inventing conspiracy theory, making up rumors, and pitting states against states.

2020-03-29 23:06,"The news about the supply plane is ridiculous.  Another 130,000 flights and we’ll have all the masks we need!"
2020-03-29 23:12,"It’s great that supplies are coming in. I hope someone is checking the surgical masks coming in from China. The Netherlands got a huge shipment from there only to find out they didn’t fit properly and did not protect against the virus. They sent something like 35,000 back."

2020-03-29 23:15,It looks like the public health experts are fading away from Donald's daily briefings on major TV networks. These wise dudes have enough of him.
2020-03-29 23:18,"Trump's administration attack on Speaker Pelosi assessment that Trump waited too long before acting on the pandemic is just an example of the problem with the trump presidency. The fact is trump wasted a month and a half calling the corona virus a democratic hoax and fake news, instead of preparing our nation. Trump and his administration did not react as quickly as they should have regarding the corona virus and that is an easily provable fact. His administration and cabinet including Secretary of Health and human services along with the head of the CDC have been working on the premise that trump's alternative reality has to be the reality they must react to, oppose to the reality of the real world and that's why we are in a bigger crisis than we should be. The president and his administration lack of actions based on the real world is causing the loss of more lives than might have died if he just shut up and stop campaigning for a moment to listen to the healthcare professionals, you know the one's trump's so-called news groupies calls ""the deep state"" ."
2020-03-29 23:14,"The president wants to know: ""How do you get from 20 to 40 to 300???""  He is talking about the thousands of masks needed in New York hospitals to fight the Coronavirus Pandemic. He implies that Gov. Cuomo is trying to pull a fast one.  The answer to his question is math.  The pandemic grows exponentially, which means by multiplication rather than by addition.  It's hard to visualize; but write the numbers in a list and you will be amazed.  Exponential growth means every data point is multiplied by two by the time you arrive at the next data point (in this case corresponding to the two people each one infected person infects-- 20 people infect 40).  Thus 20 doubles to 40, 40 doubles to 80, 80 doubles to 160, 160 doubles to 320, and so on.  If the doubling time is, say, 3 days (which it is right now), you get from 20,000 to 40,000 to 300,00 masks in about 12 days.  Add the numbers up and after 12 days your 20 has become 640.  In this matter, that refers to 640,00 masks needed within two weeks.  (If you ADDED only 20 every three days to your original 20 you'd be at 100, a number the president could presumably comprehend.)
 Try doing it 30 times, representing 90 days. You'll see why the Governors are pleading for help."
2020-03-29 23:17,"In his press briefing (still going on)  Trump is looking for taking credit for any number of fatalities less than the worst case model estimate of 2.2 million victims.  That means that he will repeat ad nauseam that should 100,000 victims die, a more realistic estimate, this will be a ""victory"" and due to the outstanding response of the administration!  The level of dishonesty of this man is breathtaking but I guess we can't be surprised.  He also made a number of bold faced lies, like denying an actual quote about his relationship with certain governors and, as usual, he attacked CNN, the NYT, and others of being fake news.

I'd really like to know what his higher approval rating is all about.  Maybe there's a Trump supporter who could explain that to me.  Are Americans that blind that they can't see how incompetent this man is as well as being utterly revolting?"
2020-03-29 23:13,Social distancing can still happen in a working economy. Time for business to adapt to social distancing. It can work without shutting everything down and stay at home orders.

2020-03-29 23:16,"The media has to demand, and I mean demand, that Trump prove his allegation that something worse than hoarding is going on in NYC hospitals.  This is the same kind of innuendo he used against Clinton in 2016 and what he plans to use against Biden later this year to deflect attention from his failures.  Don't check out the story in NYC.  Check it out in the White House.  Trump made the statement.  He either proves it or feel free to call him a liar yet again."
2020-03-29 23:18,"Trump moves Easter!
A true Movable Feast. 
Even though , in any given year, Easter is fixed; Trump has seemingly done the impossible. 
But; it does smell like Fake News:
Later than the latest possible date (non-orthodox, 4/25)
Plus, he moved it to a Thursday. 
Maybe the Bone spurs reloaded to his head."
2020-03-29 23:22,"I keep feeling that I need to help. I am a semiretired RN and my heart breaks for the health care workers trying and doing the best they can. If I could help I would, and I bet there are thousands like me. I understand that nurses need a sate license to practice as an RN and many like me are only licensed in their home state, but if needed the license could be waived.  I don't know how bad this may get but maybe it's time to register healthcare volunteers who are willing to travel to the hardest hit areas. My children are all grown and I am self isolating from my grandchildren. I feel for these young healthcare workers with children at home. It's hard to imagine how hard it is for them. Let people like me help."
2020-03-29 23:23,"Nothing about rent, mortgage, utility, etc. payments will be done until April 1st passes and it's apparent just how many people are in really in trouble."
2020-03-29 23:18,"Trump is the ""wizard"" behind the curtain:  He acts like it is HE who determines social distancing guidelines throughout this nation, whereas in reality it is the state governors, mayors and more local authorities who decide and administer those guidelines.  He just has to act like the important  man of the hour.  I wouldn't shine my shoes with his spittle."
2020-03-29 23:18,"Sure Trump has drastically mis-handled this pandemic - to put it nicely. But we need to understand and keep in mind the media's current role of simply toadying to him during his press conferences, and then penning articles such as these, as if he were a sane, decent, thoughtful man. He is none of these things. He is a deranged tyrant and a pathological liar. 

And yet journalists continue to shy away from challenging this would-be dictator. Yes, they are driven by fear of him, but this does not mean they should report Trump's lies as if they were the truth.

In 2016, many of us simply couldn't fathom why the media continued to bow down to this disgusting, unfit man, while they savaged Hillary Clinton, one of the finest public servants this country has ever had. Did anyone honestly believe Trump would be the better president? And yet the media gave him a pass.

They are doing the same thing now. They are treating the Emperor as if he really does wear clothes. And then those Americans who do not think critically accept articles such as these at face value, and then conclude that we have a competent, decent person in the Oval Office. And nothing could be further from the truth.

If this mentally unfit man wins re-election, the media must acknowledge its role in giving him a second term."
2020-03-29 23:19,"Trump  went from stating that we have  15 cases will be soon be down to zero.....to saying if we have 100,000-200,000 deaths we have done a good job

Please wake me up and tell me that I am having a nightmare"
2020-03-29 23:20,"I don't watch Trump's new conferences normally. And today I'm glad I don't.

I know its been said a thousand times over, but its not a president's job to lecture reporters for their questions, or tell the public that certain networks are ""fake news"".

Its unbelievable that even under these conditions he just can't help himself.

And I listen to his endless, uninterrupted spiels on every topic--almost like he's a rapper--and I wonder if all of this completely inappropriate and juvenile commentary will even be remembered by most people listening, or whether they will even think about how completely inappropriate and juvenile it is.

Our public communication is debased. He's not the only reason, but he's a big part of it. 

A president shouting down a reporter's question? I'm sorry, but if you don't see that that is NOT ever OK, then you're part of the debasement of our communication too.

Wake up people! This is disgraceful! 

I don't care how many trillions of dollars he'll be handing out.

It still is what it is."
2020-03-29 23:20,"'We can't have the cure be worse than the problem.""
""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won.""  Catchy phrases, Mr. President (probably not written by you).   A three week period separates these two utterances, and as far as the American people are concerned, they represent this administration's schizoid response to COVID-19 since the beginning.  Not exactly what you need during a pandemic of this magnitude.  Please get your act together, Mr. President."
2020-03-29 23:20,"China provided these necessities to NY  , how soon after their virus crisis? Matter of a couple of weeks?  This shows how inept , how deficient our manufacturing sector is, but wait , just what manufacturing sector? We shipped it to China starting 27 years ago.  As of today those few remaining are ""gearing up"" to manufacture the needed supplies.  What joke this country has become and has been for quite sometime.  China: for 0-60 in  a couple of weeks; America:  from 0- tortoise speed ... still waiting."
2020-03-29 23:20,"Trump said in this evening's press conference that the US will be ""lucky"" to have had only 100,000 or 200,000 dead in the next few months.  I remind people that in WW II the military dead numbered 416,800 in about four years.  Similarly the Civil War cost 600,000 dead in four years.  Anything approaching these numbers in a matter of a few months is far from lucky.  It is a monstrous catastrophe and epic failure of a president."
2020-03-29 23:21,"I dislike Trump as much as the next NY Times Subscriber, but let's give credit where credit is due. Spelling out the seriousness of this and letting Americans know that this is going to take some time and that we need to be serious about social distancing is, finally, a  step in the right direction by this President."
2020-03-29 23:23,"Just watch, within two days he'll change his mind, sort of. Just for a while. Then float out some ridiculous idea, then get all serious again, then float out another stupid idea. Then he'll take credit for all he is doing despite the governors and mayors, citing how stupid they all are, and then float out another stupid idea."
2020-03-29 23:21,"Look, I can’t stand Trump, and his  bungling and incompetence, but it’s great news that supplies are coming from China—and that there are more on the way. So it’s not enough for the year—well, they will make more. Come on, Times. Give us the facts. Tell us how this partnership works. Let us know how long 3M has been making things in China. Report.

2020-03-29 23:24,"Trump’s televised dog and pony shows are the Third Millennium version of the 1940s propaganda events from government palaces balconies with the masses in the adjacent square, where the masses were getting “informed” about the “achievements” of their respective country regime and were incited to take action against those considered enemies of that regime."
2020-03-29 23:24,"This is not about Trump, what's happening right now in the USA happened in Wuhan, and is happening here In Europe. Unfortunately, our leaders have not invested in our healthcare systems they have been more interested in scrounging workers rights, and in austerity measures. All of the sudden our modern depots have a bottomless pit of money to stop the pandemic; in the USA trillions, in the UK billions and in Spain they talk about millions of euros to save the economy.

I could carry on criticizing, but this is not the right moment to start pointing fingers, what we need now is solidarity and to take the appropriate measures to save as many people as we can. If you can emulate Germany or South Korea a lot of lives will be saved in the USA, in the case of South Korea 9,583 case and 152 deaths and Germany 60.659 and 482 deaths; in the meantime everywhere else the virus is spreading rapidly. Korea has suffered two pandemics in the past SARS and MERS and that masks save lives that's why healthcare professionals wear them, said Professor Kim Woo-Joo from Korea University Guro Hospital. Listen well to the advice of the World Health Organization, wash your hands regularly and maintain a distance of at least a 1 metre from other people when you go out, don’t visit your grandparents and for the love of God don’t become a mask hoarder."

So issue a ""stay at home"" order.  Issue a ""don't go out"" order.  Whatever!  People are starting to resent New Yorkers as they continue to drive elsewhere for protection, and they continue to congregate.

- No one spoke about ratings on TV.
- No one insulted the reporters or the quality of their questions.

- They told the truth."

2020-03-29 23:29,"Trump extending social distancing guidelines to April 30 is fine but business as usual can begin from tomorrow under the conditions of social distancing and extreme hygienic conditions. NY being the epicenter, it could be under a lock down just as Wuhan and surrounding areas of Hubei province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak were under a lock down for several weeks. Bu what safety measures were possible in a one party communist authoritarian China cannot be expected in the USA. 

The global count could reach 1 million with over 50,000 deaths at the current mortality rate of about 5% if the spreading out from the population dense regions does not occur quickly. At least in the USA with 140,990 confirmed positive cases and 2457 deaths, the death rate/mortality rate is still under 2% but has gone up today from 1.4% to 1.7% . The lock down by prime minister Modi in the second most populated country in the world, India is well justified since it does not have adequate beds and medical support to bear the consequences of an uncontrolled spread. 

Those New Yorkers going from their homes in NY to their second homes cannot be prevented from driving to their second home.If they drive and self quarantine on reaching their second home, the risk of transmission is minimal as long as they do not mingle with others."

2020-03-29 23:31,"On one hand, I am greatly relieved that the president finally backed down from his prior notion that the country could return to work by Easter.

But on the other hand, why make such ludicrous and outlandish comments to begin with?  

The theme of much of his messaging centers around one contradiction after another.  

And yet members of the administration still become furious when his credibility comes under fire.  I keep thinking perhaps it's because there is very little credibility to begin with. . ."

2020-03-29 23:35,President Trump just had an excellent press conference and he was very impressive.  He said that the American economy would not be ready to get back to normal until at least April 30.  He realized that the Easter date was a bit too optimistic.  He has obviously been listening to the medical experts and taking their advice.  It is very reassuring to know that  he does consider these experts opinions and will do what they recommend.  He does not want to jeopardize or lose any more lives.  He knows this is very serious and we cannot take risks.  He was very presidential and we should feel confident that things will get better.  It will just take time.  We must all do our part and listen to the experts.

The $2 trillion in aid, for example, does little for some hard hit states, like New York, that didn't vote for him. Florida, which is key to his re-election in November, got all of the medical supplies it requested from the federal government where other states got a tiny portion of what they needed. 

Trump said he wouldn't return calls from Democratic governors who - unlike Republican leaders - didn't give him and his administration enough praise or credit. His contempt for Democratic states like New York and New Jersey is so intense that he threatened yesterday to order the military to seal them up and cordon them off from the rest of the country.

This, of course, is exactly the kind of behaviour we see so often from military juntas and dictatorships in banana republics around the world. Reward your supporters, silence the free press and punish anyone who speaks out against you. 

What's absolutely incredulous is that - despite's Trump's abysmal failure in handling this crisis - his poll numbers have actually gone up! How is this possible? This is the man who originally said the crisis was fake - that there were only 15 people with the virus in the entire country and in a matter of days there would be none.

How would you keep 100 million people from being infected? Well, you lock the country down in January or the latest early February when you learn about how serious it is elsewhere. Everyone socially distances immediately and faithfully, and you don't have hundreds of thousands, if not millions, ignoring that for various reasons - the most ludicrous possibly being the quasi-religious quackery coming from some conservative regions. You take the first viable test and immediately replicate it out using the vast production capabilities of the richest country in the world; test, test, test, so people who have it are not blithely roaming around and partying for Spring Break or Mardi Gras, spreading it among people from all over the country.

What you don't do is equate taking those necessary steps with being like communist China, in a derogatory way. You don't equate caring about others enough to socially distance with being un-Christian. You don't call the outbreak a hoax.

2020-03-30 0:30,"Trump certainly deserves a lot of blame, but there are layers and layers of neglect or incompetence or misguidedness to unravel. 

For example, why were hospitals so unprepared?
My hospital employer has modernized its business strategies over the past several years. It has strived for a leaner, less wasteful organizational approach.  More responsive to customers.  In this approach, stockpiles of equipment or supplies are classified as “waste.” 

Did that hospital administration terms play a role in this deadly debacle?  

One way for stockpiles of equipment climb out of ‘waste’ status is to be demanded by customers. And one hospital ‘customer’ is the Joint Commission.  

The Joint Commission markets itself as a guardian of patient safety.   Joint Commission accreditation surveys seem to leave no stone unturned.  So: why weren’t they demanding hospitals maintain an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, in case of an emergency?  

Public health experts predicted such a pandemic was possible.  And, it’s not brain surgery to calculate the number of masks, gloves, gowns, etc. needed for a given hospital for a month.   The state or federal government would need to take over eventually, so the process wouldn’t have been completely Trump- or DeSantis-proof.

Anyway, are a number of profit-oriented players up and down government and the health care industry that will eventually need to be called to account."

He seems to fail in understanding that once he took the oath of office in January 2017, regardless of what previous administrations might have done,  the total responsibility of overseeing the executive function of the United States became his and his alone.   Likewise, failure to not prepare the nation to effectively deal with a pandemic is his failure; and does not belong to Obama, Bush or anyone else.

Accusing hospitals in New York, as he did today, of the possible misuse or intentionally misplacing of health protecting masks is 
just wrong.   Obviously, Mr Trump does not appreciate the fact that medical personnel working in these hospitals are dealing with patients who are very ill and with a highly contagious disease.  It would seem reasonable to expect that in such an environment supplies would be used up at a rate much more rapid than normal."
2020-03-30 0:35,"Agree:

""I dislike Trump as much as the next NY Times Subscriber, but let's give credit where credit is due.""

I read carefully the NYT article that ""explained"" why the Trump administration dropped the ball here, and it appears that the lion's share of the blame can be fairly laid at the feet of Drs. Redfield and Hahn, and more specifically can be attributed to the FDA's well-known strict rules for approval of new drugs. The premise of movies such as ""Dallas Buyer's Club,"" after all, is that the FDA approval process is too time-consuming and overly cautious (which also explains the oft-noted discrepancy between the optimistic projections of Trump and the real-world corrections of Dr. Tauci). 

I don't know whether the FDA is overly slow, but I do know that the current crisis cries out for fast tracks. It sounds like the CDC rep unreasonably lulled everyone else in the coronavirus task force into believing that the CDC had testing kits ""nailed"" -- even though the CDC clearly didn't. One certainly can argue that Trump and Azar should have been skeptical, but it is normal to accept on faith representations made by a credible source that stated things will come to pass. Redfield and Hahn overstated what they could deliver, and Trump and Azar took them at their word. It's that simple. Maybe Trump and Azar should have been skeptical, but that's not how the real world works: Redfield and Hahn should have confessed, much earlier, that they had serious doubts about the CDC test."

I’ll fix it for you, without the needling pejorative: “Trump states that social distancing will not be resolved by Easter, as he had hoped.” I have a suggestion. Just pretend you’re covering Obama during this time of crisis, and leave the editorializing for what chic outfit to wear during lockdown. (Yeah, I saw that article.

2020-03-30 0:33,"Trump did not “”backdown” when he ordered social distancing till April 30. He is trying to be hopeful, trying to salvage the economy because if the economy goes down, more people will die. But he has said that we have to take this day by day. That is what he is doing. Remember, hate has no place here."
2020-03-30 0:37,"It was suggested to me that limiting infection to 1-2% of the population was unrealistic since the virus will keep infecting people until herd immunity kicked in.  But a 1-2% infection rate can be achieved using the NY Times interactive model, and is consistent with what we are observing in Italy and elsewhere.  

But the herd immunity thing made me ask whether the rate of herd immunity grows at the same pace or faster than the infection rate.  Why does the model show a peak in June?  Why have we not seen herd immunity curves for COVID-19?  Well its new.

My hypothesis is based on the following reasoning.  For every 100 cases, 80% are fine, 20% get sick and on average 1% die (according to the model default setting anyway).  So, that would suggest for each death there are 99 cases of herd immunity.  Therefore, my theory is that as people start to recover from the virus, we get a peak before too long because as people recover the rate of herd immunity grows  99 x faster than the death toll.

Is there an epidemiologist or infectious disease expert in the house who debunk my theory?  I have not yet seen the herd immunity curve plotted against the model for the death toll.

I would also like an explanation for why the average period of a flu epidemic is said to be 4 weeks.  Why do we get a peak if my theory is wrong?"

At a time when any real leader will be in the “war room” trying to define the best strategy to defeat the enemy as soon as possible Trump is reviewing his ratings and bragging about the smallest increase on them.  At a time when any real leader will be stepping on the battle ground to get a first hand account of the situation Trump is in the comfort of his office signing Wall Street charts and distributing them to his unconditional supporters.

Does anyone remember the NYT's headlines last week that President Trump was ignoring sage medical expertise and instead would release an apocalypse upon the American people by removing the social distancing mitigation strategy by Easter?

Of course, there is no ""we were wrong"" NYT acknowledgement. Also, one has to watch the entire White House briefing to see/hear what was actually said and not accept for one minute any NYT's rendition of the event. 

I heard journalists, whom I have known before give long-winded preamble comments prior to asking their question containing false/misleading/mean-spirited assumptions that impugn the President and do not acknowledge that this is a rapidly evolving situation. Particularly, statements made by President Trump in January are re-raised as being discredited now in the light of recent information.

Ten days ago he wanted to open up the country and pack the churches for Easter.  Today he claimed that due to his federal leadership that deaths would be limited to one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand, as opposed to 2.2 million.

However we remain in grave danger until we have leadership that can admit to mistakes (and learn from them), that can trust and defer to experts, and that does not constantly just react to what has already happened but works to alter that which has not.

Why was De Blasio telling New Yorkers to go out and go about their business two weeks ago? They now want Trump to take more action, but push back on a quarantine, even as rich New Yorkers spread the flu to CT, RI and FL. The irony of all of the Andrew Cuomo worship and grandstanding, is that the Trust for America's Health rated New York at the bottom of the pack in terms of public health preparedness in December 2019. Now he is stockpiling ventilators and PPE, even as his constituents spread the disease all over the East Coast. Louisiana needs ventilators from the stockpile, but NY is warehousing them. The media needs to be honest with the American people instead of featuring whining governors every two seconds. It costs the Governors nothing to over-requisition supplies.

Support and appreciate the efforts and sacrifices of front line workers, be they grocery store employees, delivery workers, sanitation workers, nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, and many other essential workers who don’t have the luxury of working from home. Remember that even though COVID-19 is getting all the attention, people still need medical care for strokes, heart attacks, and trauma. All those ventilators aren’t just sitting around - they’re being used by other critically ill patients. At my hospital, we are slowing everything nonessential down to prepare for something that we hope will not come to pass, ie being overwhelmed by a crush of COVID-19 emergencies. Our critical care beds are slowly but surely being taken over by COVID-19. We pray that our efforts to flatten the curve will work.

A national emergency and one without utilizing resources and the power of our government to help those in need.

So sad that Trump still berates governors who are asking for help. Certainly not a time and place to spew hatred and negativity.  Hopefully this stimulus package finally passed will add some relief.

The Spanish authorities asked the Chinese government how that could have happened and the Chinese government informed the Spanish authorities that the cited company is not even authorized (in China) to produce those testing kits.

What ""appreciation"" does he expect from the governors of states looking to the federal government for supplies it should be able to offer in this pandemic disaster?

Women all over the USA should remember every one of Trump's comments and actions affecting women as they vote in November.  However, in the midst of a pandemic which Trump is not managing competently his treatment of the governor of Michigan stands out.

I don't know what proportion of medical insurance is with Aetna or Cigna.  I note the article states that the copay relief is for people who have Aetna or Cigna insurance, and does not apply to people for whom the employer self-insures, using Aetna or Cigna as the administrator.

We still have normal-to-our-system holes affecting us for covid:

1)Surprise bills and out-of-network emergency bills, even for Aetna and Cigna

2)Pharmaceutical bills in an MBA-designed system that will not let an insured person see their cost until the prescription has been filled

3)People without  coverage because 14 states have not expanded Medicaid, even though 90% of the medical cost would be paid for by the federal government

4)People who have no insurance because their ACA insurance would plus copays would cost 30% or more of income, due to ""subsidy cliff"" and ""family glitch"" flaws.

5)People in a number of states, including ""blue"" states like Massachusetts, who have ACA expanded Medicaid and are 55 or older, and don't have insurance.  Medicaid estate recovery laws in the state make their ""coverage"" not insurance at all, but rather a loan until death for medical expenses.

That's enough to kill or bankrupt plenty of people."
2020-03-30 2:57,"IMHO, president Trump is doing a great job  to keep our country alive. Despite any hiccups that anyone could suggest could have been addressed better.

I'm listening to the Sunday evening update and frankly I am puzzled as to why Trump has not drawn a line in the sand and made an example of Fla and NJ for not cancelling the Easter Break allowing thousands of college revelers to cross contaminate,bring their virusback  home around the USA. 

That the Florida governor failed to cancel or require isolation prior to outbound, that airlines were complicit in this glaring denial of our national well being and that these revelers were not quarantined upon return from whence they came is near criminal.

All this rhetoric about social distancing is obviated? To what end? Multiply tens of thousands of potential covid19 carriers and you extrapolate millions of potential infections. 

Why was this major disastrous event afforded a free pass while the rest of us remain anxious about our futures, our lives?
Why hasn't the media or Dems jumped on this like piranhas in heat? The country is in a death spiral and suddenly people grow deaf and dumb.

Next let's look at why NJ Gov Murphy is giving Lakewood NJ a free pass allowing violations of the edict governing social attendance.  3 to 4 weeks into this crisis and events are held with total impunity and disregard of the common welfare of it's citizens.
Trump should declare that any such clear violations will deny all future federal aid!"

He then took credit for his great plan to keep Romanians well fed, which did nothing of the sort.
The trump crime family is no different in its mismanagement of the Public Trust, leading to health workers having to use bandanas as masks or sew their own, or trump accusing New York health care workers of embezzlement of masks because they ""used to use 20,000 or 30,000, and now they're asking for 300,000.""

When one reads of Kushner's ""public-private partnership"" deal to ship supplies from China, the real story is that this is the definition of fascism, and proves that the USA has a full-blown fascist regime at work, and mainly at work to enrich its own despicable family in the white house."

I am sure the question has arisen in the minds of many of the reporters in the room, but they haven't brought it up, in the spirit of national unity.

Still, it would be fun to see the question posed, and hear the President's response.

Perhaps Yamiche, from the PBS Newshour, who has already irritated the President with reasonable questions, will fire out that one.

That's how the illustrious Mr Trump thinks.

If he does think that is happening is this how he addresses it? In a news conference? Somebody should look into it he says.
I heard hum explaining painfully what the word ""peak"" means.
He thought previously that it is what you do when you enter a female dressing room uninvited. He explained for the .001% who did not know, that peak means when something is at its highest point.

2020-03-30 3:30,"If we were a bit more advanced we could have our cake and eat it too.  Those most at risk would stay home while those less likely to be affected would go to work.  The economy would slow but not stop.  The economy would be half-staffed.

The first obvious way is sheltering the over-55 crowd; everyone else would work while taking precautions and they'd be segregated from the over 55 year-olds.

That alone would unburden the hospitals.

But there's another way no one has mentioned - maybe not considered.  

This SARS-CoV-2 virus specifically latches on to the ACE2 receptor while also using the TMPRSS2 gene to make its spike sticky so it can attach.  It then injects its RNA through the cell membrane to hijack the cell and replicate.

Researchers are looking at drugs to deny virus entry by filling in that ACE2 receptor notch and interfering with TMPRSS2.  

(There are many safe and cheap natural supplements, and a few synthetics, that directly target those two genes but for some reason - maybe because they're not patentable and not profitable - you don't hear much about them)  

But what no one's mentioned is that many people have a genome with variants that already down-regulate one or both of those genes.  (You can determine your genome with a $99 genome map) 

18% of everyone for ACE2, 36% for TMPRSS2, and 6% with both.  That's about half the population.  Note that 80% of those infected have very mild symptoms.

Those with partial immunity could keep the economy open."
2020-03-30 4:09,"The 200,000 deaths is a conservative estimate. It could go into millions, unless we can test everyone faster than the spread of virus and quarantine everyone tested positive. Alternatively, develop vaccines that works to blunt the virus. Social distancing helps to slow down the spread of virus, albeit, very important, but doesn’t stop it."

Start basic data collection on the course of the virus with antibody tests, the goal is to test all adults by June. All critical manufacturing should be 24/7 till we have all the PPE, ventilators we need, and other supplies we need through the summer. The armed forces should be setting up hospitals in all major metropolitan areas to relieve the stress on critical care workers, hospitals...we need to assure that the critical supply chains are maintained till at least July 1st, so trucking companies and warehouse can assure we have needed supplies. Testing of antibodies with the goal of testing all adults to track where the next hot stops and begin to replace workers who have not yet contracted the disease with workers who are immune. And last, we need to have a plan for future outbreaks.  Anything else? Any questions? Let’s got-er-done!"

Nowhere in the discussion was there any sense of him weighing the gravity of the situation that lives have been lost and there are parts of the country that need help.

I read that Thai doctors in FEBRUARY used large doses of TamiFlu and the HIV anti-virals TOGETHER and had good success ridding patient of the virus within 2 days.   Where are those reports, and TamiFlu is not even part of the WHO trials.  What gives......

I really believe that Remdesivir will work well once testing is faster and more prevalent.  Get the cocktail early once symptoms appear and not wait until you need a hospital bed.

And I also believe that we are already ramping production of millions of vaccines that are likely to have great success in trials that started weeks ago.  We will beat this, we must have faith, and Trump will make sure we don't beat around the bush for months and years for approval to use the drugs.

The public health and infectious disease experts are doing their jobs and dragging the President into reacting relevantly but he’s still way behind. 

But he is about to see what it means to have responsibilities that have life and death consequences. As the death toll rises and the diversity of victims includes people who are not in the high risk groups, he is going to face questions about why he denied the seriousness of this pandemic for so long."

New York has issued stay at home orders, but its OK for them to leave the state to infect others.  The Governors think they have the authority to tell people to stay home, but they know they really cannot enforce it.  But the President can enforce a quarantine when something presents a clear and present danger to public health, even national security. 

It probably makes sense, and now other Governors and police are having to stop people on their way into states to make them quarantine.  Democrats are hypocrites.

In another note, why doesn't anyone release any information  on success or failure of treatment methods.  There is secrecy, likely to avoid panic and hoarding, overpricing, etc...but it also will prevent some from living.  

Thailand reported in February that large doses of Tamiflu combined with the HIV antivirals did well in treating cases.  What happened to this news?  Did they retract it?  Does it not work, is anyone trying?  The world powers are probably hoarding Tamiflu for themselves."

2020-03-30 11:30,"Anyone who thinks Trump has managed our long-term economy well is not paying attention. Let's look at the facts. 

Trump's tariffs backfired...

Trump's tariffs resulted in a reduction in aggregate U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month in deadweight losses, and cost U.S. consumers an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax according to a study from the Journal of Economic Perspectives. Farmers and many industry have been savaged by Trump's tariffs. 

The Trump/GOP Tax Cut has not helped workers...

The Trump/GOP tax cut rammed through congress was supported by only 29% of Americans -- with good reason. Most corporations used the saving to buy back their shares. The uber-wealthy got more yachts. Most workers got a few extra bucks in their paychecks -- which will expire in 2025. The tax cuts to fat cats are permanent. 

Trump and the GOP put us $1 trillion in debt -- before the coronavirus relief package...

The 2017 tax cuts produced only a brief sugar high for the economy. The 2019 deficit was more than double what it was in 2015 and up from $160 billion in 2007, before the Great Recession. And now, we're forced to add another $2 trillion to the federal debts to save jobs and lives. 

Donald Trump has not helped our long-term economy. He has damaged it."
2020-03-30 11:41,"South Korea, with a population of 50 million, one-sixth as many people as the United States of America, only had 166 deaths; this would be only 1000 deaths if the South Korea population were six times larger, the same size as the USA.
But already, the USA has over 2400 deaths, and the pandemic will not peak for several more weeks and perhaps more. We are now being told that the USA could incur 200,000 deaths. 
That would be a proportionate death rate that is 200 times greater than that of South Jorea.
President Trump says he is doing a “good job,” because the death count in the USA could have been 2.2 million if “nothing were done.” 
But the USA and South Korea are allies. There was nothing secret about what South Korea was doing.
Trump tells us that preventing 90 percent of the deaths that could have happened, is a “good job.”
But, compared to the US, South Korea’s measures were 99.5 percent effective, and would have lowered the USA death rate to just 1000 deaths, not 200,000 deaths.
Why didn’t the USA adopt South Korea’s methods right away? There were several months of lead time to get ready. 
Instead Trump and Fox News said the corona virus was a “hoax.”
And he tells governors they need to show “appreciation” for him in order to send their states aid. And he condemns reporters who ask about the South Korea example, and says: “Don’t be a cutie pie.”
200,000 deaths instead of 1000. That is not being a cutie pie."

Those also led us to operate our own professional office and stay lean.  Unofortunately, as the Federal Reserve noted last year, 4 in ten families did not have enough reserves to pay for a $400. unexpected expense.  And, they are mostly also not those who will NOT probably receive one of those checks from the Federal Government, or unemployment insurance either.

This pandemic is showing us what’s and who’s really important (who: healthcare professionals, grocery store clerks, first responders, scientists; what: our precious lives and health, vibrant social connections) and what has been unduly prized by our society for far too long (cancerous, unenlightened economic growth) - and this delights me.

I expect many to excoriate me for holding these views.  I know that people are dying, and that we’re all very scared.  This pandemic is not the direct fault of the Milton Friedman’s of this world, and I am not trying to attack anyone.

But I hope people take note: this is the real world, what’s left when one removes the glittering veneer.  Commercials for luxury cars and all-inclusive vacations, punctuating somber news reports on television, seem incredibly tone-deaf.  The once-impenetrable facade of competency cultivated by big business is cracking, and we’re getting a glimpse of the small, helpless, ignorant men and women behind the curtain, which we once thought shrouded wizards too powerful to question.

A large percentage of oil production volume in the Permian is not WTI, it is WTL and the percentages increase in favor of WTL over time as more of the wells being drilled at the long lateral horizontal wells producing from tight formations.

None of that money will have any effect on the problems caused by the coronavirus. The package is not going to change the current business climate due to COVID-19. Even the Orange Creature is less optimistic.

Eventually the bill for our largess is going to come due and our legislature refuses to roll back tax cuts which were based on preposterous trickle-down economics. That money did nothing but inflate the equity markets and executive compensation. The enormous deficit is going to be more enormous and it will be inflationary. Is the government going to cut important programs to service the debt?

Those are the two choices. Increase taxes or further fray the safety net.

According to the Fed, 4th quarter credit card defaults and delinquencies ar at a seven year high and that was BEFORE the coronavirus.

But what do I know? The DJIA is up about 400 points and traders have more information than I do. The current cycle was starting to reverse before the coronavirus affected us. Long term I think that we are in for some serious pain.

How much revenue has been lost over just the last couple of years?  More than enough to pay for this emergency stimulus, I think. 

Even if their survival is important to the country's economy, it is not as critical as the ability of states and cities to pay our police, fire-fighters, and other services essential to the community.

When corporations suffer by doing what their investors reward them for doing, the investors want and expect governments to bail them out so they continue to provide the dividends and capital gains the investors invest for.

Companies that invested by buying their own stock back should survive by cutting dividends and reissuing the stock.  Or they should go under, selling their assets at fire-sale prices to somebody with the deep pockets of Jeff Bezos, so that the deep-pocketed can use the assets to make money and the investors unwise enough to pursue short-term gains (most of them) are wiped out.

People are taught that a) it pays not to work and b) their job is worthless, if the gov can magically pay them about as much for no work.  

Business bailouts? It’s a long process to build a collection of skills, machinery, property and reputation to make a business work, if a healthy biz dies an equally good one may never replace it. But should we bail out companies that were highly leveraged (who borrowed tons with the idea that risk is not their problem)?  If a biz wants to buy their own shares, fine, but then if the same biz runs out of cash because they used it for those buybacks, do you and me need to bail them out? (No, d-m h-l no). 

There’s nothing of the former ideas of the Republican party (the ideas, not the offal sausage of practice) in this bill, it feels more like a combo of FDR and Huey Long.  But there’s no light on the supposedly opposing side: the garbage tacked on by the Democrats shows open contempt for the project of containing the bug, it’s a wish list of totally unrelated total waste.

Second, South Korea has a very homogeneous population. If you want to compare South Korea, compare it to New Hampshire, not to the whole USA, which includes third world cities, like New York.

Third, South Korea went through SARS and MERS, so all their pandemic lessons were fresh and learned.

Fourth, South Korea took anyone infected out of their homes into mandatory isolation, something that would have caused armed standoffs if tried in America - no one here would go for it.

Fifth, again, look at the population. Look at New York population, then look again at Seoul's population - see the difference?

So, why not compare it to promise land instead - the liberal European democracies with they rainbow single payer health care system.

However, money is the most fungible commodity.  Meaning the funds from the bailout permits other funds that a company has on hand to buy back their stock.  That is why we have the contrast between a rising stock market and a country that is entering a recession or a depression. 

Democrats were not only deceived that companies would use the bail out to help their employees, they were deceived that there would be oversight on the half a trillion designated for discretionary assistance by Menuhin to businesses. Trump mockingly said he would provide the oversight. He probably meant that he would oversee the funds designated for his businesses.

Japanese industry, today, operates more or less as it has since the days of the bubble economy, with the stark exception that Japan no longer as the client base to support the models that they used when money was flowing freely.  Too often the most talented in Japan are held back thanks to a structure that rewards years of service rather than workplace excellence.  Additionally, the emphasis on extreme quality measures results in prohibitive costs for products that an older and income-challenged population find it hard (if not impossible) to meet.  For Japanese, the number of hours worked is still considered more important than the quality of the work done and herein lies the heart of the problem for the country.  This is culturally deeply ingrained and if they don't come to terms with the limitations this causes, their economy will die as quickly as the population is contracting (30% by 2050).

Moreover, more people are retiring every day, and the size of the workforce is declining.   The population is also going down.   This makes it nearly impossible for the economy to grow.

But most Japanese were already having to contend with a rise in consumption tax last year and the economic chill that arrived from plummeting exports to China and overseas markets, even before the virus hit. The Olympics and the rise in tourism-related demand were supposed to get things off the ground, but that is now out the window, too.

Americans, in least in most urban areas, are locked down and most businesses have gone into hibernation. People are frightened but seem determined to get by the crisis. In Japan people are still eating and drinking (I see many bragging on social media) and even openly ignoring government requests to not hold events - the K1 even in Saitama was a shocking misjudgment by the organizer. So the ultimate irony - Americans are listening to their local leaders, while Japanese are where America was in early March, a turnaround I thought I would never see. A reckoning is coming. Finally, thought I would never say it, but Abe is worse than Trump infections. At least Trump finally had to admit, but it took the IOC cancelling the Olympics to get Abe to stop hiding virus infections."
2020-03-31 1:18,"Japan isn't just Tokyo, nor a few metro regions. Most of the country is still in the provinces, which were already precarious due to years of neglect by the Administration. The virus will be devastating economically, even if the health situation is relatively contained.

I live in a city of 300,000 in a rural prefecture. We're lucky: a disaster-tested governor,  good health infrastructure, and  currently one of the last 4 prefectures without any reported COVID cases. But fear of the virus -- and suspicions that the infected have been undercounted -- has reduced patronage at most small businesses here. A wave of closings has already started. Last year, private equity killed off one of our last 2 department stores, plus a cluster of businesses that depended on the traffic it drew. This year, the last one might succumb to the virus.

Unlike in Tokyo, where most empty storefronts don't stay that way for long, once shops disappear in Morioka, they're almost never revived. 

Those who love this city face a real dilemma: should we stay home to protect ourselves, or should we try to support our local businesses, to help keep the city alive? If we isolate before an official order, will there be a city left when we emerge?

The situation is the same in other regions. And most are starting from a worse baseline than our prefecture. The Times shouldn't close its eyes to this."
2020-03-31 5:25,"The US, Japanese, and many other stock markets have been rocketing up even though unemployment is starting to rocket up like never before seen. Many governments are lying or are way too optimistic to their own people. There’s not enough money to care for all the infected people, let alone make everybody economically whole again. No one knows how long this pandemic will last or perhaps if this virus will be forever lingering over humanity. Yet, the markets are rocketing back up already. Something just doesn’t seem right."

He has a month's vacation time coming, so he gets paid through April. After that he's out of work, and this is what's happening to employees all over the entertainment industry in Los Angeles and elsewhere.

2020-03-30 15:39,"The Times totally misses the point: every TV show discussed here comes from a science fiction novel. Dystopian novels have been around for over a hundred years, and many are still in print, or can be read on-line, for instance on Gutenberg.

""The Purple Cloud"" by M.P. Shiel is a 1901 British novel about the last man on Earth, after a world-wide disaster. ""The Earth Abides"" by George R. Stewart is set in a post-disaster USA. There are hundreds of such works out there.

We start off seeing one infected creaure, and as the news grows we learn it has invaded the entire world. Just as there, this is a plague that spreads, in some countries at potentially uncontrollable rates. Whether George Romero was thinking pandemic, he was clearly focusing on what mankind will do survive. Prescient beyond belief."

I would like to encourage these incredibly creative people to believe more in the power of their ability to conjure worlds that entertain, than simply believe in the power of dystopian imagery. While I appreciate their attempts to warn us, the brain works differently. The images these shows provide don’t just trigger anxiety, but give our brain a roadmap for where we want to go. This is how the brain works — on images. And their creative talent makes these images powerful. Please take a different approach. Instead of warning us with darkness, show us the light. In your talented hands, it won’t be treacle. But you can give us back something to aspire to."

Unfortunately, the worst is demonstrated by our president who cannot understand topics more complex than a tweet. Fortunately, there are other capable people working hard to meet the demand for a critical piece of medical equipment. 

But we must remember that this crisis is not just about us. There are 57 countries that lack critical health care resources. They stretch from Central America to Sub-Saharan Africa to Southern and Southeast Asia. These are the nations where COVID-19 will likely decimate not just their populations, but their health care workers—because they lack protective equipment and lifesaving technologies. 

So, GM and Ventec, rest assured that there is a critical need for ventilators worldwide. We just need to find a way to help low-income countries afford them."

- constantly stiffed working-class contractors 
- cannot focus on a single thing for more than a few moments 

now is somehow an expert on how long it should take for a major automaker to turn itself into a producer of a complex medical device that +must work perfectly+ or kill someone - something they've never done before?

Meanwhile, he is publicly thrilled for his high TV ratings as a result of the COVID-19 disaster he personally incited through massive incompetence in his administration.

To start up a totally new product line even when you have a knowledgeable partner is a herculean task. There are so many design, tooling, regulatory, training and testing hurdles to overcome that I would be surprised if they can make saleable product in 4 months let alone weeks. This is of course that you have a supply chain that can provide the component parts. Promises from CEOs and pressure from the president doesn't make the job any easier and that's how mistakes are made. No amount of pressure can make up for the lost time in being unprepared. Instead of pumping more money into an already bloated military more should have been put into the preparations for a possible pandemic.  They were warned. The next great catastrophe waiting to happen is the failure of our infrastructure. Who will Trump blame that on? Obama again?"

Though I hold advance degree in engineering every interview I went I was told that Aerospace engineering is diametrically opposite to medical device manufacturing engineering.  Which I thought was nonsense since the manufacturing processes can be learnt rather rapidly.
Little that I know of the medical device manufacturing I believe there are formidable challenges; car manufacturing is not medical device manufacturing. There is retooling required, supply chain need to identified or created, processes need to be learnt most importantly for quality assurance, workforce needs to be retrained, since the devices are for human appropriate hygiene cleanliness as well as controlled environment will be required ...
Even if GM agrees tomorrow, I think ramp up will be few months away and first ventilator at best will be 4 months away. Assuming they let their current workforce be retrained unlike what I encountered."

The tweets mostly provide the media with something to talk about and any damage is likely to be temporary.  Kind of like the weather.  If you don't like it, just wait a day and it will change.

He also lashed out at everyone who dared disagree. 

I had my resume out on the street within the first two weeks and walked as soon as the first offer came - even though it paid less.

I was a Supply Chain Management professional. The conversion of any space into a fully functional operation with a functioning supply chain doesn't happen with a snap of the fingers. Even our tales of WWII don't consider the facts that while America rose to the challenge, it wasn't as fast as the propaganda movies made it out to be. 

The real problem is that Trump demands the spotlight on everything. Other presidents, including FDR, used their people who knew how things actually work, to get the job done. Trump derails their efforts every time he takes center stage. 

Despite his fear of a (non-existent) ""Deep State"" the reality is that there are Americans who cannot stand Trump who will do the necessary work for America and the Constitution.

Trump thinks he is the ""Boss - Apprentice Master"" of America and we all work for him. No, he works for us, and those in government swore an oath to the Constitution not to Trump. Somebody has to tell Trump to shut-up-already and let America do what it does best and rise to the challenge."

The one who will be in November though is Trump.  Especially when the ads with the refrigerated morgue trucks are followed by: ""We have 15 cases.  And very, very soon we will be down to zero"".  Particularly when Cuomo offers to share his refrigerated trucks with other states.  How about this:  lets have two news conferences every day.  One where the experts minus Trump present the facts.

2020-03-30 11:49,"Sources for this story felt compelled to be anonymous; a story of steps taken by Americans seeking to help in times of crisis, and they feared retribution.

But how far have we fallen when straightforward truths cannot be told simply because they are that—truths?"
2020-03-30 11:49,"I just can’t stand to read about Donald Trump’s behavior anymore. Trump is quite simply the most malignant, destructive human being ever to occupy the Oval Office. Not even Andrew Johnson can compare. While this man prevaricates, bloviates and preens, tens of thousands will die; trillions of dollars will be lost; and millions will be out of work.

By refusing to confront the reality of the covid-19 threat when it was apparent in January, Trump allowed this virus to rage out of control. Now that others are scrambling and risking their lives to try to contain the conflagration, he just gets in the way — and as always tries to take credit for the good work others are doing, while blaming everyone else for what goes wrong. 

‘The Donald’ has single-handedly devastated this country. It will be left with a battered economy, lives and careers destroyed, families bereaved. And this despicable man can do nothing but lash out; spar with the press; call those far better than him names like a spoiled, bratty child; and always, always crow about his ‘ratings’ — as though this were all a reality tv show. The man is just unhinged. 

The fact that millions of Americans somehow still pledge their allegiance to this horrible man reveals that our nation is suffering from a sickness far worse than any virus, and likely will continue to be deathly ill long after that little strand of RNA  in a protein coat has receded in the rear-view mirror. A million ventilators won’t cure that sickness."
2020-03-30 11:42,"The President’s attacks on GM for its good engineering process are deplorable. Here are some other throw away phrases that turn reasoned problem solving into useless wastes of time:
“Analysis Paralysis”,
“A perfect document insures a perfect product”,
“Fix it (a hardware problem) in the software”,
“Too much testing”,
“Make up the lost time by compressing/reducing testing”,
“We have a big payment riding on this delivery deadline”,
“Make a baby in a month by getting nine women pregnant” (Hat Tip to “The Mythical Man Month),

“Take off your engineering hat and put on your management hat”.
This one resulted in the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986 and the disaster that followed.

I am getting to the place in my life where I may not be able to work much longer as an engineer (mid-60’s). I was always fighting this attitude from management, and never forgot that I was making safety- critical products.  I never worked in the medical products industry, but I know their products are also safety-critical."
2020-03-30 11:51,"Trump will do and say anything to look presidential, informed or relevant.  Attacking those trying to actually respond to this crisis is yet another example of his misdirection, calculated to steer attention from his own bungling incompetence.  Worst. Leader. Ever."

He makes up facts, which change from moment to moment, and is surrounded by a team who do nothing but flatter him, while he pits contestants (that is, states) against each other. Where he'll make ""decisions"" on the basis of momentary whim. This is what has become of our Federal government. I struggle daily with trying to fathom how we as a nation fell so far so fast. It is humbling and humiliating."
2020-03-30 12:02,Maybe it is just me- does not Trump sound not only confused but out of touch with reality.

2020-03-30 11:57,"Not all business people would stoop to any level to make a buck.

“Working through the weekend of March 21 and 22, they hurried to find new suppliers that could provide parts in high volumes, said the five people, who asked not to be named because they fear it would further antagonize Mr. Trump.”
Trump wants things to happen “very quickly”.
“The automaker has said it will not make a profit on the ventilators it assembles and is only seeking to cover its costs.”

Is Trump confused and frightened by the apparent lack of a profit motive?

“You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,” Mr. Cuomo said last Tuesday.

Two days later, Mr. Trump disputed the governor’s numbers while calling in to Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News. “I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,” Mr. Trump said. “You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they’ll have two ventilators.”

Willful, pathological ignorance.

He is understandably frantic and frightened.

He may think they are dusting off an electric chair for him…because so many people are dying.

He should be comforted in the knowledge that, as of 2014, electrocution is an optional form of execution in the states of Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Virginia, all of which allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method.(Thanks again Wikipedia)

Pleasant dreams Mr. President."
2020-03-30 12:04,"I can imagine those people putting in 18 hr days to pull all the threads together to start producing ventilators at high volume would be quite furious at being criticized by the President for not doing anything. 

Fortunately, the U.S. is a far, far larger country than one small President. 

Good for GM (and others) for pitching in. Lives will be saved."
2020-03-30 11:54,Such typical behavior from the child in the WH....he obviously crumbles under pressure and had to lash out at someone. Why didn't he use the DPA to force BOEING to make ventilators - all we have heard at almost every press conference is how GREAT this company is; how wonderful and how much money they are most likely going to get in the bailout. What is the real story behind this? What or who does he have from Boeing that he needs to stroke them publicly above all other American companies? The press should be looking at this.
2020-03-30 12:12,"It sounds like Trump was aware of the progress they had made, but preemptively chided them so he could take credit.

Or perhaps he wanted to distract from the fact they have clearly accomplished more in a week than he has in months."
2020-03-30 12:13,"Nothing, absolutely nothing happens without having 100 percent of parts available and in house ready for production and then having a constant stream of them coming in every day.  GM claiming that they had commitments from suppliers to produce ""95 percent of the needed parts"" means nothing more than they can't assemble a single unit.  Misinformation, disinformation, fake news."
2020-03-30 12:15,"Trump has for his whole life been isolated from the actualities of planning and engineering.  He is just a demander.  He has been lucky that none of his buildings has fallen down, because he certainly has not understood the art of structural engineering or design.  He has been a sheen glossing a vision.  So when it comes down to real engineering, as to make a compact ventilator, he is clueless.  

If we wanted a cheap and yet effective ventilator for relatively normal lungs, we could copy the Bird ventilator from the 60's and 70's.  However, a COVID patient with lung failure can't use such a device.  That patient needs a different and very ""high tech"" ventilator that will regulate respiratory rate, volume, end-expiratory pressure and other parameters.  

The problem with Trump is that he doesn't listen to experts."

2020-03-30 12:19,"A few things.
Nothing really knew here about Trump except I hope his supporters within business are beginning to see what they're getting. If this article is fully accurate, and I'm not sure there won't be a Round 2 and 3, it's even worse as an example of ""No good deed goes unpunished."" 
Also, nothing new about miscommunications. Happens all the time. It's worse, though, when its possibility isn't considered and checked before deciding to publicly blast someone. 
Still confused about the difference between what was allegedly promised and when, and what will be delivered.
If GM really is acting nobly and delivers, I hope they'll make their case. And if that's confirmed by auto writers, it will help make up for some things like their support for ending California's right to have tougher environmental regulations.

I thought as a recipient of a federal bailout when they needed it, they would have learned their lesson about giving back when society needs them. The next few months would be a good time to show it. 
For the most part, this article helps me understand and appreciate yet another profession that isn't high status: logistician.  I now can imagine it is now more difficult than ever to get parts. As an advocate of industrial policy, but even if I wasn't, it's good to realize that nothing happens without someone attending to the details, as well as the above-importance of communications."
2020-03-30 12:24,"In JANUARY, when he first knew of this virus and its potential, if he'd applied the same zeal that Ms. Barra and GM and Ventec displayed in one week, we might have a lot more of 2000+ dead still alive. We might not even need the GM-Ventec collaboration: he claims that he ""inherited a stockpile"" that was in ""terrible, terrible shape"" from previous administrations.

In an emergency, how is it possible to give more time? Choosing a ventilator is not rocket science. If one views five minute video of their product on Ventec website, one can readily tell VOCSN model is their top of the line model, and they are needed in bulk as fast as possible. In a pandemic, they will not go waste no matter how many are produced.

FEMA, please read this paragraph in this NYT article:
""Ventec isn’t a giant in the ventilator industry, but it is known for its VOCSN model, which received F.D.A. approval in 2017. The VOCSN, which is the size of a large toaster oven, combines a number of functions that had previously been performed by several machines to pump air into the lungs, suction out secretions and produce oxygen when a central oxygen line is not available. The device is used in critical-care hospital units but also can be used for home care."""

In addition, they need designs given to them from a current vent manufacturer. Ford who is working with GE healthcare said putting together the supply chain and distribution will take them weeks too.

What psychological mindset drives Trump to make these kind of often uninformed comments?  I know, in regard to my own behavior, that I am loathe to spend money on unnecessary things.  I believe this comes from decades as a child and young adult having to learn to do without, so now, even though I have more then enough money, I still hesitate to spend it for my own pleasure.  My instinct is to do without.

Maybe after decades of wheeling dealing, and now positioned to tangle with the big boys, he feels as though he's got to work a deal.  He's got to have some kind of leverage  over his nemesis.  He's got to beat them at their own game.

This startling revelation, along with all of Trump’s incompetence and corruption regarding this health crisis, needs to be investigated by a 9/11-style commission—once we get through this."
2020-03-30 13:54,"It is strange that Trump is attacked for imposing travel restrictions too quickly, then attacked for not doing enough, and then attacked for pushing suppliers too hard. Meanwhile, hundreds of investigative reporters fail to ask members of the Obama administration, especially Biden, why the emergency stockpiles set up by Bush were raided and never replenished in the following seven years that Obama was in office. They fail to ask Cuomo why he chose to not purchase thousands of ventilators. Apparently, Cuomo’s advisors were wrong in asking for the emergency supplies and their advice was disregarded."
2020-03-30 13:55,"Trump does not look at facts, and is not big on planning.  He uses his ""gut instincts"" which works fine when we are talking cheeseburgers, but does not work so well when we are talking medical equipment.

Evidently, Trump's understanding of ventilators is poor at best.  Usually, one ventilator is sufficient for one patient.  In emergency circumstances, the output can be split, and two patients can be supported by one ventilator, with specific caveats, such as the patients have to be well matched.  As an analogy, different tires may require different inflation pressures.  Splitting the output of an air pump to inflate two tires at once might work if the two tires need the same air pressure, and the pump has enough capacity.  If the tires need different pressures, say 30 pounds for one and 40 for the other, setting the pressure to 35 pounds gets you one overinflated tire and one underinflated tire. With humans, that could mean too much air for one, and too little for another, which is bad for both.

So Trump seems not to understand that two ventilators in a hospital means that the hospital will have a problem if three patients, all with different requirements, need to be provided with a ventilator.  But that does not stop him from making preposterous statements, or just plain lies.

If we get through this pandemic, it will be in spite of Donald Trump, and not because of anything he has done to ""help."""

The executives complained that it was not sufficiently profitable for the company.

It is clear from the lack of available testing, to the shortage of masks, to the ventilator production diatribe, that our leader does not understand the complexities of a supply chain. If we were in a war he would suggest that his troops could just bop into a local supermarket to grab lunch.

2020-03-30 12:13,"There's only one person who dragged his feet.  The ""leader"" who said ""the China virus"" is no big deal and it will be gone by April.  He had a good feeling about this and he's a smart guy, right?"
2020-03-30 12:49,"So who's being more truthful here?  In the Bizarro World of today, I regrettably have to trust a giant corporation like GM over the President of the USA.  Not even a close call.  Sad."
2020-03-30 13:30,Thank you Ventec and G.M. Your kind actions and professional demeanor are reassuring to America. I suspect you will be rewarded kindly post these pandemic days. Thank you.
2020-03-30 12:33,Trump is a dictator. The only thing that will save us is pushing forward with what’s best for us and ignoring him. I know there are people in the federal government and the private sector who will do their jobs despite him.
2020-03-30 13:51,What does a car company know about making ventilators?
2020-03-30 12:18,"The mentally unstable nature of Trump's whipsawing remarks show he is truly unfit to lead at this most critical time. He is literally costing lives, first with his inept denialism slowing our response, and now with his bullying that chills people from stepping up or speaking out, from Governers to industry leaders to public health officials.

It's time to stop focusing on Trump as the center of our response to this pandemic. It's time to socially distance the president from the crisis. Turn off his microphones.  Ignore him.  Turn towards the Governers.  Turn towards the unmuzzled health officials. Turn towards each other. This war will be won at the grassroots level in spite of our 'dear leader's' protestations. 

Trump is irrelevant."
2020-03-30 13:24,"If you want lots of ventilators fast you don't talk to GM, instead you detail a bunch of scrum teams to produce 10,000 per day and give them unlimited resources."
2020-03-30 13:53,"We have a president who is undisciplined and acts like a school yard bully. He does not have the education, basic skills and managing ability to be the leader of the US. However, 50% of the country support him. We are not going to be undone by our enemies but rather by our hubris"
2020-03-30 13:56,"“I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,” Mr. Trump said. “You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they’ll have two ventilators.”

Where does he come up with this stuff???  His intuition is completely deranged.  I can picture future titles of his biographies depicting his antics as ""Lessons in Leaderlessness - How to Cause the Most Harm with Supreme Incompetence, Dishonesty, and Callousness.""    It's amazing to me how the media continues to cover him when whatever comes out of his mouth is only harming the relief effort and is totally counter-productive.  The best medicine is to just tune him out."
2020-03-30 12:20,"If Trump was not the President and the CEO of a large corporation was using a shuttered plant to price gouge Americans, the left would be singing a different tune."
2020-03-30 12:33,"Trump knows nothing of production and manufacturing.  If GM can produce 6000 units by the end of April, that is a herculean task.  They should be commended for that result.

A ventilator is a highly sophisticated piece of equipment that has to meet strict sterilization and health safety criteria.  This is punching out wrenches.  The tooling, programming, quality control, assembly force, raw materials, component parts all have to be gathered together and made operational.  That's at least a year in normal times, just to get started.  Producing 6000 units in one month is a miracle. 

Shame on Trump for attacking GM.  His insults are only exceeded by his ignorance."
2020-03-30 12:17,"If there’s anybody in the White House who is reading this, could you please tell Jared or Ivanka or whoever is in charge that “A person involved in the Stop the Spread campaign said that several corporate executives who had been willing to contribute to the effort earlier had backed away for fear of ending up becoming targets for Mr. Trump as Ms. Barra had.”"
2020-03-30 13:14,"Is it an accident that he is attacking GM’s CEO, Mary Barra and Michigan’s Governor Whitmer in this dismissive way? He can’t deal with strong women leaders."
2020-03-30 13:37,"The president is so disturbingly predictable as he once again makes false statements to make a false claim.  Falsely attacking GM is part of his playbook.  As reported by the NYT's, GM has worked diligently to produce ventilators, but the president ignores that fact. Giving the appearance that the president's criticism of GM forced the company to stop delaying work on making ventilators is what matters.  Hence, the president's subsequent comments stating, ""I don't think we have to worry about General Motors now"", was made to show if not for the president's demands, GM would not be speeding up their production of ventilators.  The president's false statement about GM is what incompetent people in power do: they make false statements and create false narratives to blame others for the consequences of their own actions or inaction and take credit for things accomplished by others.  In the face of such a dishonorable powerful person, we must be brave and persist in countering the president's falsehoods with the truth.  Admittedly, falsehoods sometimes prevail, but I believe the truth will help the American people make decisions based on what is really happening, for how can you protect yourself and your loved ones if you don't know what's really going on?  Protect yourself and demand and uncover the truth.  Perhaps the truth about Donald J. Trump will lead enough people to see how dangerous he is and vote against him in November and remove him from office."
2020-03-30 12:48,"Two thoughts: First, Thank you to the people who have moved so quickly and tirelessly to help fill this need, people will remember this. 
Second, Ignore Trump. He ignored the covid 19 virus, and downplay it's threat. He cannot deal with facts or the truth . He cannot and does not know how to lead, he needs to get out of the way."
2020-03-30 13:37,"It is perplexing as to why Trump lashes out at people and businesses but I have some ""gut""instinct about this.
Trump is a very insecure person who is always comparing himself to others and he does not measure up in his mind so he strikes out at those "" perceived"" enemies. His attacks on women well I will leave that to the professionals as I do not have enough time.
Attacking companies like GM etc is again just Trump feeling inadequate. I want to point out this is NOT the person you want "" in charge"" as he cannot separate himself from the position and all of the responsibilities that go with it. That also means taking the good ( praise) with the bad ( criticism), Trump is just not able to handle.
The USA must elect Biden in 2020 if we are to ever move ahead. God save the Republic."
2020-03-30 13:57,"Once again, it’s all about Donald. We may wonder if he will somehow discover any sense of a larger humanity of which he is a part in this terrible time."
2020-03-30 14:14,"Please, go to You Tube and use the search term, ""Gas Powered Ventilator"" to review an ""Efficient Gas Powered Ventilator"" with minimum parts count and basic functionality, made of standard parts, that can be mass produced quickly. It's a gift to all manufacturers."
2020-03-30 14:15,Trumps tweets are a distraction to the real need at hand.  American manufacturing people knows how to work together and get the job done.  Trump didn't have the common sense to invoke the the Defense Production Act and move on the the Defense Priorities and Allocations System that is used to prioritize orders throughout the U.S. supply chains when first advised.  God help us in a war.
2020-03-30 14:20,"My deepest thanks to all those who are making every effort to produce our needed ventilators. Obviously, this is a complex task. Please know that we appreciate your hard work and long hours. Try not to pay too much attention to the words/actions of our inadequate President.  thank you!"
2020-03-30 14:22,"Thank you Mary Barra and your team.  Please know there are many grateful people that you have moved so quickly.  And just stop listening to the narcissist-in-""charge"".  He is a failure, and no one should take anything he says as true, and especially don't take his criticism to heart -( we all know he doesn't have one)."
2020-03-30 14:24,"Remember, when it comes to two parties that appear to have a dispute involving facts, and one of those parties is Trump... the other party is always telling the truth."
2020-03-30 14:29,"I have never believed that bullying is ever helpful.  We are all in this together.  It would be more helpful to have a president that spent his time encouraging businesses and comforting the American people.  I have not heard one single word of empathy so far from this president (maybe I missed it?).  Having said that, I am not surprised."
2020-03-30 14:30,"""Acting"" president Trump just had to do something to reclaim the spotlight and appear to be taking decisive action, thus explains the sudden and unnecessary order to GM.  From the biggest stock gains in history which began under his predecessor to the biggest nose dive in history and now a projected 200,000 COVID-19 deaths on his watch after claiming initially that it was 'contained' while it was spreading like wildfire, it's going to be pretty hard for Trump to claim that his presidency has been anything other than an abject failure, but he surely will anyway."
2020-03-30 14:35,Perhaps the governor of NY or Michigan should purse a side deal with GM.  Could bundle it with preference for the purchase of emergency vehicles for state contracts.
2020-03-30 14:40,"This is an inspiring story of US business leadership at its best in a time of great crisis.  Energy, speed, expertise all on display. It is unfortunate that the man in the Oval Office had to throw negativity in, but really, can't we just ignore him?  There is much to be done and I, for one, appreciate the strong efforts shown by GM and Ventec management and workers."
2020-03-30 14:40,"Lets have some balance here. I believe people are working hard, no doubt, but this is a results driven time and GM does not have a good track record. This is a poorly lead company that has lost tremendous ground over the years due to internal problems and a poor product line."
2020-03-30 14:43,"The main problem is here , why we are forcing Car manufacturer to built Ventilator.

GE, Phillips, Becton Dickinson, Hamilton Medical, Draeger, Medtronic  are  way mightier than General Motors at this moment of the history. This is not 1940's.

President fixed on a car company should easily figure out how to make  ventilator. WHY.

There is colossal industry over there why putting GM on the spot which has no money power, GE and Medtronic  combined might is 30 times of  GM .

There is no  sane  decision is emanating from thsi white house.  None."
2020-03-30 14:48,"This is one of those situations where Trump reveals his monumental ignorance.  A ventilator is extremely sophisticated, far more than a bellows that simply pushes air into a patient’s airway.  It has to interact with the patient; respond to their demands; perform ongoing monitoring; and be robust enough to function continuously for weeks at a time.  The photo reveals the complexity of the construction.  For Trump to sputter mindlessly about delays and inadequate output is absurd.  Any ventilator that is produce by  Ventec/GM will be welcome in any institution that is caring for patients in respiratory failure due to any cause, Covid-19 or otherwise."
2020-03-30 14:49,Placing health care & it's administration in the hands of profiteers & their governmental enablers before & during  this pandemic is akin to looking at the results of production quotas & quality control measures out of the old Soviet Union.  FAil.
2020-03-30 14:50,"From reading the story all the way through (ahem -- not all of you have), I clearly get the picture that GM is getting the job done DESPITE trump's bullying, not because of it."
2020-03-30 14:55,"The lesson is simple and brutally revealing of the failure of American trade policy and American industrial and manufacturing policy as well.

GM had no experience building respirators.  The major manufacturers had already sent the work, experience and institutional knowledge, not to forget the material and infrastructure  that supports building respirators to overseas producers. We do not have the supplies or logistics necessary to build the respirators. 

We can't even find an old dress or shirt factory to make gowns and masks. At one time there were over 300,000 garment workers in Manhattan and hundreds of factories. The great shortage of mask, gowns and booties could have been met in less than 10 days. But we totally dismantled the apparel and textile industry. I doubt we could put together 10 industrial grade sewing machines with experienced operators if we offered each a million dollars. Infrastructure, experience, machinery, machinists, electricians, pattern makers, cutters, and sewers no longer exist.  To make a tie (a band for tying a mask) you need a machine like an old Singer 253 chain stitch  and rolls of material called ""bias"".  Who in Manhattan or anywhere in America can make and cut bias material to needed widths? NO ONE!  We can't even make a sewing machine needle! That requires machine tools and experienced people to build them.

Now we are scrambling to find resources and workers while people are exposed to great viral danger.  

Bring manufacturing home!"
2020-03-30 14:56,"I wish the gm and Ventec Life Systems staff every success and luck for this great time challenge. 
The current man in the Wise House cannot and does not understand these efforts."
2020-03-30 15:10,"Trump continues to illustrate the necessary qualities needed to lead people through a crisis, too bad for us he doesn't possess any of them."
2020-03-30 15:10,Great reporting - thanks for filling in the backstory. Otherwise many people would have had only Trump's tweets to go by.
2020-03-30 15:18,"If Trump says it, I assume it is false. I know I am far from alone in that. As it happens, I have been looking for a car. Learning about the valiant efforts of GM here, I now plan to move GM to the top of my list. Thank you GM and Ventec. Other manufacturers take note."
2020-03-30 15:18,"Simply put, Trump created a fantasy problem then fixed it:
Trump publicly berates GM for dragging their feet producing ventilators
Trump claims credit for getting GM to hurry up with production
Trump supporters point to Trumps' great success at leading

Its a familiar pattern. What I don't understand is why the media, other than FOX, continues to let him do it."
2020-03-30 12:22,In spite of Trump we fight on. He's a national liability. Most of my friends are Republican retired business executives. Basically men and women of system and planning. They are astonished at Trump's incompetence and lack of perspective.
2020-03-30 14:17,"I applaud Ford and GM for stepping up, and I am not surprised by the distortion and judgement by you-know-who.

However, when the executives and spokesmen of these companies choose not to speak up and make clear how unhelpful the inept pettiness of the so called president is, they do no one any favors.

Speak up, tell the truth, and expose this clown who's most important goal is ratings..."
2020-03-30 14:57,"I think Corporate Executives better thicken their skins.  This is Trumps modus operandi.  He's a businessman and ruthless one at that.  Not defending him...just telling the way I see him.  And he currently holds the office of the president.  This too shall pass.  

But if you think the President is being harsh on GM....just wait until AOC +3 and Bernie hold political power.  They will crush companies like GM.  They hate powerful executives more than anyone could ever.  Can you imagine the ""government"" controlling the effort GM & Ventec is trying to do in the next 30 days?  At least Trump is out of the way and having agency heads strip away the buracracy to allow these two companies to produce without ""oversight"" weighing down and virtually stopping the process.  If these two companies were state run....god help us all."
2020-03-30 14:18,"Exactly the problem with Trump.  He wants ventilators now, but GM with incredible effort can only start providing them at the end of April.  That's not GM's fault.  That's Trump's fault for not getting GM involved earlier!"
2020-03-30 14:20,""" they hurried to find new suppliers that could provide parts in high volumes, said the five people, who asked not to be named because they fear it would further antagonize Mr. Trump. ""

What? do we have a dictator or a president? Why should they be concerned about antagonizing him? This is crazy. In dictatorships you have to watch what you say about the dictator, or the monarch, or whoever. I actually lived in a country back in the eighties where you literally had to watch what you said about the country's leader or you could be thrown in jail.

I can't believe I'm reading this."
2020-03-30 14:30,Maybe the upside to Trump’s insulting G.M. will be fewer voters casting their ballots for Biden in November.
2020-03-30 14:56,"Trump's modus operandi of creating a fictional problem and then saying he solved it - GM, Mrs Barra, Ford are a mess and then ""I dont think we have to worry about GM now"" after he publicly berates them is in the end self defeating.  But only in so far as he is supposed to represent the common good.  Pandering to his base and their adulation is all he cares about.  The damage to the US people appears to be an acceptable byproduct.   Not that he has the introspection required to see that.  As outlined in the article, companies will just refuse to get involved as they perceive the political and real costs to be too high.  Witness his backtracking on extending social restrictions.  He ignored medical advice until predictions of increased deaths forced his hand.  Political expediency, pandering to his base and the sanctimonious toadies at Fox News so he can feel the roar of their approval is the singular thing that drives him.  Kudos to GM and Ventec for staying the course.  The US will beat the Covid 19 virus despite Trump not because of him."
2020-03-30 15:03,"It’s an emergency and GM was bailed out before and owes back. This is an emergency and they need to step up. All involved in car production, unnecessary need to focus on priorities. If that is done they can produce more than thousands by April 
Certainly not 400 shameful given the circumstances. 
This is familiar of leadership. Trump is right.
Trump is wrong about CDC which caused the outbreak with their useless tests plus FDA bureaucracy still stifling testing efforts. Irrelevant and incompetent . Criminal - Trump was incorrect to rely on either"

2020-03-30 15:21,"President Trump doesn’t feel in charge and powerful except by sidestepping his own failures and having someone, anyone, to blame. Why he felt the need to pick GM this time is anyone’s guess. Hopefully, he just wasn’t informed of the fact behind GM’s efforts already underway."
2020-03-30 15:23,"It is nothing but simplistic to believe large companies like GM always act in the public interest no matter the circumstances. If this was nor seen as another opportunity to attack Trump this article would never have met the test for credibility, and all those commenting here rushing to the defense of GM would never ever do so except  it is an opportunity to criticize Donald Trump.

I am no fan of President Trump but here he made the correct decision to insure a supply of ventilators."
2020-03-30 15:18,"It is time to remind Tump that this is not television.  This is real life.  These are not stage sets and actors pretending to die.  These are human beings who are dying because of his ineptitude, ignornce and vanity.  The confusion he has caused with his preening, indecision, flipflopping and trying to blame others for his failures has become totally intolerable. His wrath against corporations and their personnel  who have done their best to mobilize demonstrates his inability to make informed decisions to ramp up production and is totally irresponsible and reprehensible.  It will take years to right what this man has done to damage our country and its citizens."

2020-03-30 14:53,"It's pathetic that way that Trump operates. Two corporations, working behind the scenes in the interest of the public good, get berated by the bully in the White House for not doing enough, after they have accomplished a small strategic miracle of organization that Trump is incapable of understanding. Then he praises them, taking credit for beating them into submission.
Kudos to GM and Ventec. You will be true heroes if you can pull it off.
Shame on Trump for playing politics while people are dying during his watch. 
We cannot forget come November."
2020-03-30 14:59,"GM is doing a great job. The President is not. He is vying for worst-ever with Calvin Coolidge, and I think he has Coolidge beat by 10-15 lengths."
2020-03-30 15:13,"Why would anyone demand that GM, a car company, build ventilators?  They have no experience, judging from what they put on the road, they have no culture of quality, another example of Trump's incompetence."
2020-03-30 14:58,"Most people who require and receive a ventilator will die, according to my physician friends. Preliminary data suggest that 86 percent of COVID-19 patients on ventilators will die.

2020-03-30 14:58,"People will die because of Trump's inaction whilst he blamed this on a Democrat plot, even more will die because of his prevarication and yet more because of his mindless lashing out when people start to call him to account.

Perhaps journalists should start labelling this the Trump Virus, in stark contrast to the Obamacare of his predecessor!"
2020-03-30 14:30,"Trump shoots from the lip. He doesn’t understand planning. He just makes things up so he figures everyone else does too. Instead of ready, aim, fire, Trump shouts fire and then complains about people not being ready. He entirely skips the aiming part because hitting the target is not necessary. Trump will say it happened even it doesn’t. Therefore planning is entirely unnecessary and a total waste of time to Trump.

The worst part? Trump is now saying if the US “only” has 100,000 deaths, he should be credited for doing an amazing job."

He is a manipulator beyond belief and all the CEO’s who don’t want to get on his bad side cower in the corner. Here’s a news flash—there is no good side.  Stop walking on egg shells just because you are afraid he won’t give you any money.  It’s like watching the Wizard of Oz.   Somebody (maybe Mary B) please pull back the curtain!"

Yesterday afternoon, he gives a brief, implying that masks are being, wasted, stolen, sold on a ""black market"", who knows?  Why isn't this illegal?  In the same way, that a person cannot yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater, why can the president say things that are unfounded and dangerous?  He may enjoy pitting people against one another, but his public statements are fomenting a fury, which places all of us at grave risk."

This morally bankrupt man trump, Fox News and a group of professional liars on radio and TV have undermined our country for their own financial gain, and we together as a nation need to remove trump from office.

Headline:
Trump administration sent protective medical gear to China while he minimized the virus threat to US

Quote:
Concerns about a dwindling supply of PPE are not new. Back on February 7, the World Health Organization sounded alarm bells about ""the limited stock of PPE,"" noting demand was 100 times higher than normal for this equipment.

Yet the same day as the WHO warning, the Trump administration announced that it was transporting to China nearly 17.8 tons (more than 35,000 pounds) of ""masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials."" As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noted in the press release announcing this shipment, ""These donations are a testament to the generosity of the American people.""
End Quote

Donald Trump is really concerned about the safety and welfare of We The People - in some alternative universe.

But he makes a big deal about GM not shipping equipment the day after he yells at them to set up production in the closed Lordstown, Ohio facility, one that GM sold to another company after closing production of the poorly selling Chevy Cruze at that plant."

2020-03-30 14:51,He does not understand that respirators are not cars and is trying to cover up his fatuous comments about the virus disappearing because he told it to. It takes time to retool because the robotic setup for cars cannot be used. I mute Trump and ignore him just as the Governors do. His “press” conferences are not worth the time and his Oval Office show dispiriting. The Governors are the leaders here not the WH theater staff who told them to find their own equipment and they were not shipping agents. No - they are too incompetent and discourteous to even be hired as delivery people.

We see this happening now, in real time, as the Despot-IN-Chief remains, not only out of touch, but continues to act in a counter productive manner."

2020-03-30 15:31,"This example of how one company tried to pitch in to provide desperately needed ventilators  illustrates trumps abject failure to meet the challenge that faces us. After refusing to come to grips with the seriousness of the situation , he has made one fateful mistake after the other. He casts about throwing blame everywhere but where the blame belongs. His need for absolute praise, his paranoia that GM and others willing to help companies might be charging too much for their efforts, and his constant attentiveness to his own reelection have cost lives. He must be held accountable! He wants credit for three years of a great economy, one he inherited, yet won't take responsibility for not gearing the nation up for a crisis such as this. He has been president for THREE years. He had plenty of time for golf and political rallies.And he dare not claim the impeachment prevented him from doing his job.

The United States Announces Assistance To Combat the Novel Coronavirus 
Press Statement
Michael R. Pompeo, Secretary of State
February 7, 2020
This week the State Department has facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.  These donations are a testament to the generosity of the American people.

Today, the US government is announcing it is prepared to spend up to $100 million in existing funds to assist China and other impacted countries, both directly and through multilateral organizations, to contain and combat the novel coronavirus.  This commitment – along with the hundreds of millions generously donated by the American private sector – demonstrates strong US leadership in response to the outbreak.
This assistance only adds to what the US has done to strengthen health security programs around the world.  For the last 20 years, the US through USAID has invested over one billion dollars to strengthen the capacity of more than 25 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to existing and emerging infectious disease threats.  ..."
2020-03-30 15:04,"It is imperative that someone shut trump up. He is nothing but an incompetent idiot who knows nothing about anything related to this virus and is only making matters worse. His mouth should be sewn shut - he's causing nothing but problems, fear and divisiveness from the very beginning.  Exactly the opposite of what anyone calling themselves a leader must be doing now.
Please - someone put this guy on a golf course and make sure he stays there. Give him a scorecard that shows he's the best golfer in the world.  That will make him very happy and silent him."
2020-03-30 15:11,Trump’s stupidity never ceases to amaze me
2020-03-30 15:16,"New York Times PLEASE print this or ask of your reporters:

Timeline:

Thursday 3/26 :Task Force @6pm:Trump brays he will talk to Xi later Thurs night.

Thurs 3/26: Trump brays on Hannity that we don't need no 40,000 vents. All fake.

Thurs 3/26: Trump has call with Xi late PM.

Fri 3/27: Complete change to Trump... Trump begins hysterical demands to GM and others to make vents NOW!!!! Desperate tweets over the whole day.

Here's what I think:

I think Xi told him: ""We had many,many more deaths in China than we said....tens of thousands. If you -Trump- don't lift the remaining tariffs immediately, we will make sure US knows as of today, 3/27, you knew of this danger. Many will die in US. You will never get re-elected. We will let you save face by taking tariffs off no later than Sunday, you can make a show of it, or we spill it that we told you of this grave danger coming to Americans.

I saw an article earlier this week about thousands of urns in Wuhan to be picked up by relatives after cremation...seemingly a lot more  urns than the death numbers we've been told.

This is what I think. Would some reporter please ask Trump why he suddenly changed his mind about vents AFTER he spoke to XI on Thursday night, after Trump was on Hannity's show???

PLEASE!!!! We need to know.

Didn't anyone else notice this? Look at reruns of Hannity's show Thursday night and Trump's newly found hysterical urgency on Friday.

Something stinks."

2020-03-30 15:34,"Pretty clear to me! Trump said ""They are dragging their feet,"" even though this was a lie, so that when they start producing needed equipment, he can claim that his actions forced their hand. Politically shrewd. Morally, as always, bankrupt."

The automakers aren't doing enough to make more ventilators.  They are trying to profit from making ventilators.  This is so transparent. As usual the President has no real point of view.  He simply knows what he has do do to remain in the headlines. Don't his supporters see this?"

""Nine days ago I announced the setting up of a more effective organization to direct our gigantic efforts to increase the production of munitions (emergency health care equipment). The appropriation of vast sums of money and a well-coordinated executive direction of our defense efforts are not in themselves enough. Guns, planes, ships  (Ventilators, masks and associated PPE) and many other things have to be built in the factories and the arsenals of America. They have to be produced by workers and managers and engineers with the aid of machines which in turn have to be built by hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the land. In this great work there has been splendid cooperation between the government and industry and labor. And I am very thankful.""

Clearly Trump is no FDR!"

NOTHING!"
2020-03-30 15:41,"Frustrated with his own inaction and incompetence Trump is simply forcing the companies like GM to mass produce what they can't produce not that they can't do or are unwilling but because they feel helpless to get the required components of ventilators demanded due to the disrupted supply chains, for which partly Trump is also responsible for his antiglobalisation tirade."
2020-03-30 15:50,"Trump is a master at bullying and deflection. Thank you for providing detail on the backstory. Trump was under progressively increasing pressure over lack of ventilators. To deflect from his failures and to change the narrative, he attacked two companies working overtime on this. The primary problem was and is not lack of commitment from them, but floundering FEMA learning how to deal with a pandemic on the job.  Coverage on 2 networks Friday evening newscasts presented the President’s tweets, with no comment on the perspectives of the 2 companies. Today, next week, or months from now, what will be the general public take away from this? Make no mistake-G.M. took a big hit here."
2020-03-30 15:54,"It would be expected the federal government would provide leadership as to the needs of the situation.  After Hurricane Andrew, the federal government in the form of FEMA defined  what they needed to house the thousands of people homeless after the storm.  They left it to us and did not berate and belittle the workers or our leadership.  Mr. Trump would do well to provide leadership, to identify for  the GMs, Fords and other manufacturers of the country the need, then to keep his mouth shut and let them do it.  Instead interferes, kicks up sand and generally impedes progress.  I say shut up Mr. Trump tell these companies what is needed and the get out of the way."
2020-03-30 15:59,"It is time for the responsible news media to stop compulsively reporting Trump's every utterance. It only encourages his worst behavior and thereby jeopardizes all of us. TV news should just run a still image when reporting on his press conferences, report only on their substantive content, and ignore his theatrics. Neither should his tweets be reported unless they reflect actual policies that can be confirmed independently by spokespeople for the relevant departments and agencies.

Trump thrives by putting himself at the center of dramas that he initiates. Its the sort of thing that the most obnoxiously insecure 8th grade provocateur in every middle school regrets having done in 7th grade. But the obnoxious 7th grader could never have caused all the grief that they did without the assistance of a crew of nearly as obnoxious and insecure ""friends"" eager to be the first to know and pass on the latest dirt. In relation to Trump that role is fulfilled by the corporate media always more interested in ratings and ad revenues than in the responsibilities they have to the public that they piously but unconvincingly invoke so often.

Trump is a manipulative and unreliable source and needs to treated as one. Instead of being fed the attention he craves, he needs to be starved of it. A pact to that effect among the leading national news outlets (NYT, WaPo, CNN & MSNBC) not in his pocket would likely produce a change in his antics within a week that might save many lives."
2020-03-30 16:01,"I  really would like to know why he singled out GM. Are there no other companies that are trying to provide ventilators or other critically needed medical equipment? He really had to haul out the defense procurement act to get them to move? He didn't give Ford the same treatment as he gave Mary Barra, also a personal attack. I'm sorry, there are those who will disagree, but to me it is just one more example of his misogyny, he can't stand a powerful woman who sometimes stands up to him. Look what he did again today to Yamiche Alcindor at his daily ""briefing"" which should be labeled what they are: election appearances. I'm out of the country, I hope it's true that networks have quit broadcasting his toxic, political and mendacious nonsense  live."
2020-03-30 16:05,"What does Trump know about manufacturing?  Absolutely nothing.  What does Jared Kushner know about manufacturing?  Absolutely nothing.  Limbaugh, Carlson, Hannity, Ingraham?  Less than nothing.  None of them have ever manufactured anything but propaganda their entire lives.

What could go wrong?  We're watching it in real time."
2020-03-30 16:05,"The key to this particular brouhaha is contained in the quote “always a mess with Mary B.” It is a typical one-sided Trumpian grudge match. Lest we forget, in 2018, Ms. Barra angered and embarrassed Trump by announcing GM would shutter auto plants (in swing states) that he had (irrationally) vowed to keep open. He publicly berated her then for daring to act in her company’s interests rather than in his. Then last year, she earned his ire again by announcing that GM would join other carmakers in continuing to follow Obama-era emissions regulations adopted by California rather than Trump’s emission standard rollbacks. Now, Ms. Barra is trying to do something most of would recognize as humane, selfless and patriotic. But can Trump say “thank you” to someone who has ever slighted him? Can he even just keep his mouth shut? No, he can’t. And he will have had the the last word, because “Messy Mary” will not dignify his taunts with a response."
2020-03-30 16:07,"With President Trump it's always simple: He only wanted the eventual production of ventilators to look like the result of his exhortations. The reality, as usual, isn't a factor in what he does or says, unless and until his wiser advisors convince him that an alternate path is more politically advantageous.

He didn't care about sick people actually getting ventilators. His concern never extends to the welfare of others, indeed by this point in his life he's probably incapable of it.

In this light, hopefully Americans will react less to his antics and see them as the acts of a child, while focusing energetically on voting him and his enablers in Congress out of office, to staunch the hemorrhage of America's self respect and harm to its social fabric."
2020-03-30 15:47,"His strutting boasts about the China travel ban while he denied the danger, blamed it on democrats and the press, and was ""not concerned,"" for six or seven weeks, wasting precious time that should have been used in an all-in effort to obtain PPE, earned Trump 60% approval by our pathetic citizens.  
Without actual contracts, orders, PAs, or even clarification on precisely what Trump wanted, these corporations invested great energy and expense with a sense of urgency, and were rewarded with insults and abuse.  
The contrast between Trump's unconscionable and dilatory inaction, and GM's immediate response is the difference between incompetence and competence."

Add DJT to that list. Small minded people who ascended to power have always found destruction more expedient than building forward.
Autocracy, not democracy, is what he promised and is exactly what he has delivered.

Why was it so hard for us to take this thing seriously?"
2020-03-30 16:17,A far better approach would have been to find the experts and inventors of ventilators and give them the power to ramp up production inside the ventilator industry to a large scale as quickly as possible.
2020-03-30 16:32,"Trump always has to find someone to blame, because he is a ""very stable genius"" who has never made a mistake in his life.

The F1 group has designed the new version of the device and says they can produce 10,000 a week

assuming their claims are accurate i wonder why we are not following along to modify existing CPAP and  BIPAP machines? 

there are already millions in use and those with less severe breathing needs this should relieve the strain on the ventilator stock and allow time to build up that stock

i use a CPAP and can modify my own once i find out what parts are needed."

When he promises something it is usually made up by him, such as ""40,000 ventilators."" Then when it turns out he is way off base instead of admitting he did not understand the issue he attacks the people who say that cannot be done, thereby making everyone angry at him. But then he pretends he was right all along and attacks more in hopes gullible people will see him as a ""tough guy."" But normal people just see him as a lying, incompetent fool."

Nobody in their right mind would want to work for him, except to feather their own nest."
2020-03-30 17:45,"It was obvious that Trump was being stupid in his attack. While all the negotiations were going on, GM and Ventec were hard at work doing the planning. Trump just wanted an opportunity to say he had used the Defense Production Act."

2020-03-30 17:54,"Mr President/Ms Barra,

Goes like this...

A long while back, worked for a Russian-born senior technology executive...

In explaining how large human hierarchies worked, he once told me:

“Getting something done in a large organization is either a two-step or a three-step process”

“The two-step process: You love them, they do something”

“The three-step process: You hate them, they do something, you love them”

Some things never change..."
2020-03-30 17:33,"It would be great if all CEOs learned to understand that character matters, and that tRump is a horrible character.  It would also be great should no CEO contribute henceforth to trump's re-election campaign, nor to any Republican's at all."
2020-03-30 17:43,I stand by Nancy Pelosi and AOC who said not using the Defense Production Act cost lives. Shame on GM.
2020-03-30 17:44,"I can't wait until Trump is no longer our president and we vote in a president who actually cares about our country and our citizens instead of how they themselves personally look and their own personal business interests.

Oh yeah, and that isn't laughed at and thought of as a buffoon by the rest of the world."
2020-03-30 17:54,"Vintage Trump. Was probably told that G.M was on it, working the details to start building ventilators.  The sleaze in Mr. Trump saw the chance to appear as if his scolding had forced the giant manufacturer to its knees.  Psychotic behavior at best.."
2020-03-30 17:25,"Trump always finds someone to blame...someone other than himself...for anything he can't lie himself out of, or lie himself into if it's something praiseworthy."
2020-03-30 17:25,"I think if anyone or administration could exemplify what a textbook example of ""wasting time"" looks like, it could be this group currently in charge.

It's because of the effective and strong working partnership between General Motors and Ventec Life Systems that has resulted in substantial progress continuing to be made.

I do not doubt what Kristin Dziczek's words that “We continue to work around the clock on our efforts with Ventec. We are working as fast as we can to begin production in Kokomo.”

I think if perhaps the call for these ventilators had been taken seriously and had been acted upon immediately instead of the typical ""wait and see"" demeanor, these ventilators would already be flying off the supply chain shelves and into the hands of the medical professionals who have been begging for them from jump street.

General Motors are neither the villain nor the ""Donnie Come Lately"" characters in this nightmare.  And to publicly humiliate and chastise this company over a situation 45 did not take seriously from the very beginning is beyond wrong.  But then, this guy stated in a press conference that he is not responsible for any of this.

Keep up the great work GM and Ventec!"
2020-03-30 17:11,"So the key takeaway is that the Federal government - still - hasn’t specified which ventilators it wants or how many it wants. It hasn’t committed to pay for them if GM builds them. Inexcusable.

Trump has killed citizens because of his abdication of leadership. Yes, he can shout from the bully pulpit but the implementation, the details are not there. Sending a tweet is not actually placing an order or delivering."
2020-03-30 17:15,"Anything this guy can do to save face, avoid responsibility, blame others, and criticize a woman in power, he will."
2020-03-30 17:43,The blame-shifter-in-chief is clearly looking for a scapegoat on which to hang his own lack if response. I would hope that the UAW workers who are busting their backs to get this done remember how they got thrown under the bus by Trump so that he can look like The Man to his supporters.
2020-03-30 17:51,"How is it ok that we pay our government, specifically our President to represent us as a people, and his behavior is so inappropriate that corporations that considered rising to the life and death needs of their countrymen are reluctant to put themselves at the mercy of a bully?

The violation of public trust that continues unanswered by this executive makes me doubt that our government, as designed, can be considered viable as a democratic government."
2020-03-30 17:54,"When working with companies that are putting an all out effort into producing lifesaving ventilators, it's always a good idea for their motivation to be trash talked by the President. Makes an individual just want to dig down deeper and do that much more for the effort. Those who are in the line of presidential fire should always remember the golden rule when forced to work with this president, stroke his ego repetitively and say nothing at all. Then get back to work on the problem and give him all the credit. Remember it's your job to keep the President happy first then save lives."
2020-03-30 17:17,"During a war, the Commander in Chief is the person ultimately responsible for ensuring front line troops have what they need. Our CIC failed miserably, dithering instead of effective leadership."
2020-03-30 17:14,"So, NYT, I’m confused. Was the reporting in your March 26 piece on the same topic incorrect? Was there not a potential $1 billion dollar price tag for the ventilators produced by GM and Ventec? What changed in GM/Ventec’s production capacity for the ventilators? Was FEMA misstating the truth of the matter? What changed in the Times reporting between the March 26th article and this one? Would love to understand this shift in reporting better."
2020-03-30 17:49,"Gee, another industry the ""world's smartest man"" doesn't begin to understand - this guy is an absolute total disgrace."
2020-03-30 17:59,Between General Motors and Donald Trump we know which one’s the clunker.
2020-03-30 17:59,"I was in the warehouse business and involved in automotive logistics for nearly 25 years in Michigan and Ohio.  What Trump seems to not understand (along with the myriad of things he does not understand) is that automotive companies do not really ""make"" cars.  They ""assemble"" cars from parts obtained from around the globe.  Tiny screws from France, brake castings from India, multiple pieces from China, etc.  Often these parts are sub-assembled in one location (sometimes Mexico or Canada) and shipped to another location for final assembly.   I imagine Ventec operates much the same.  Creating a manufacturing supply chain takes time, and it takes money.   GM and Ford are great companies, but they are car companies and their game plan is typically plotted years in advance."
2020-03-30 18:02,"Posting this article to the Facebook app the regular way on the Times Android app isn't working properly. It'd be good for your techies to fix this, so more people will see the article."
2020-03-30 18:05,"Based on the open box photo of the Ventilator , Whirlpool is better fit to assemble this."
2020-03-30 18:07,"It sounds like GM and Ventec are working as quickly as they can to set up a manufacturing line.

The president committed another round of political theater at the expense of GM.

But now GM is doing a ""fantastic"" job.

The media gives the president way too much air time; sadly 90% of what the president says is bloviating nonsense."
2020-03-30 18:14,"""The automaker has said it will not make a profit on the ventilators it assembles and is only seeking to cover its costs.""

Well, that statement is a far cry from what the administration claimed last week when they stated ""The $1.5 billion price tag comes to around $18,000 a ventilator."" 

The cost of labor (and a huge junk of skilled union labor) over-time, materials, insurance, etc. - all of the that just for starters will be costly.  But then, shouldn't every human life be considered priceless?

Thank you GM and Ventec for stepping up and for all that you are doing."
2020-03-30 18:34,Maybe now even some big corporations are beginning to realize that Trump is nobody's friend.
2020-03-30 18:35,I called GM to thank them for the work they are doing on producing ventilators after reading this story.
2020-03-30 18:38,"And the factories where goods are being made at the behest of  those in the Trump family? 

Aren't they jam-full of sewing machines and absolutely perfect for what Trump wants?"
2020-03-30 18:38,"We ought to see what they deliver, and how much they charge, before they get any sort of credit. NYC in the next few weeks could have tens of thousands die if the ventilators aren’t delivered. GM needs to make good."
2020-03-30 18:39,"Our woeful shortage of needed equipment and supplies is directly tied to the push to off-shore our manufacturing and production, much of it to China. Ninety percent of our critical supply chains are outside our direct control! This is a massive failure of our national security, traded for the ability of Corporate America, Wall St. and the donor class to make obscene amounts of money. We've spent trillions on building up our armed forces and security, but have made ourselves vulnerable in even worse ways.

This is a lesson that needs to be learned, but I suspect it won't because both parties support this ""trickle down"" system."
2020-03-30 18:50,"I always felt it was a
Mistake and shortsighted by our country of all countries not to make their own products. I also believe in purchasing from local stores. The big stores though they may be cheaper, I enjoy walking into smaller businesses and being recognized and helped knowing they will go the extra mile to help me. Having a chat makes your day enjoyable. I can’t count how many times people have assisted me with requests that are not the norm. Bring manufacturing back. Do we really need all “junk” items from China?"
2020-03-30 18:53,"I suspect that, like many others, when I saw the news about this disagreement or dispute, my inclination was to believe the GM/Ventec side and not that of the President of the United States -- i.e., the latter has no credibility at this stage.

The coronavirus could have happened to any President, but it's a sad state of affairs when the one in office now has demonstrated less trustworthiness and responsibility and more gamesmanship/self-interested twisting of the facts than probably the worst coworker any of us has ever had the experience of working with.  In these difficult times, most workplaces (at least white-collar workplaces that have the luxury of adapting) are admirably setting examples for teamwork and rising to the occasion, while we get this from our White House -- rather than leading by example, he diminishes us all and the very idea of working together."
2020-03-30 18:53,"As the article states, other companies decided working with trump was not worth the risk. 

How many lives did that cost?"
2020-03-30 18:59,"trump adds nothing positive to any situation.

But he takes credit when something works."
2020-03-30 18:20,"There is simply no other way to put this...

Vote like your life depends on it! Because it does."
2020-03-30 18:28,"Trump only interest is the sound bite for ratings.  He had been asked too many times about by the Defense Production Act, so he chose a scape goat.  And of course it was a woman CEO.  Trump likes to attack women who are doing “a man’s job”.  He is a pure misogynist!"
2020-03-30 18:42,"The best thing that trump could do right now is to just shut up and make himself scarce.  Let people who know what they're doing do it.  

Give him some chocolate cake and ice cream, send him to his $50,000 indoor golf range, pat him on the back and tell him he's brilliant, that he really straightened out all those nasty reporters who ask unfair questions and ungrateful governors who just complain.  

Then send him to Fox to further elaborate on how tremendous a job he's done and how lucky we are.  Keep this up for at least a week.  The whole world, the medical community, the economy, and stressed out citizens would breathe a sigh of relief.

He can't lead, he can't follow.  This isn't a reality show.  Many lives already lost and many more at risk.  Get him the heck out of the way so competent people - actual leaders - can do their jobs and save lives."
2020-03-30 18:48,"One wonders, how trump became the President of the USA ? Full of arrogance, incompetence, liar and a denier of Science, he was able to hoodwink  the electorate easily."
2020-03-30 18:42,Corporate execs who want to help should not back off for fear of being criticized by Trump.  The whole country knows Trump is a TV charlatan whose childish name-calling is irrelevant.  CEOs need to follow Governor Cuomo's leadership and unify to help the American people.  Ignore Trump.
2020-03-30 18:44,"""several corporate executives who had been willing to contribute to the effort earlier had backed away for fear of ending up becoming targets for Mr. Trump as Ms. Barra had.""
Being a target of Trump should be considered a badge of honor. If you can't stand his ridiculous tweet storms, you don't deserve to be a chief executive."

Accolades to GM and all people who are stepping up to the plate to help the sinking hospitals.  Lives are on the line, and the man-baby in chief can do nothing more than throw tirades.  Honestly, can he be more inept.

And please, people, STAY HOME if you are not essential services.  Any person can get the virus - it does not discriminate."
2020-03-30 18:27,"To quote Sun Tzu on the Art of War in this time of the coronavirus pandemic: “The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.”  Trump as “the buck doesn’t stop here” President, is not a General and not even a Private, just a so called “wartime” President who dodged the draft five times.  He is a jewel only unto his delusional imagination."
2020-03-30 18:30,"If one is looking for a clue as to his unwarranted hostility toward GM, it may be his perception of a ""delay"" which was in error.

Or, it could be that the person who leads General Motors is named Mary T. Barra.   Trump dislikes women who are clearly more able and intelligent than he could ever hope to be.  His opinion of a proper position for a woman cannot be mentioned here.

Note also his rudeness toward the governor of Michigan, the Majority leader in the House, and a very competent (and well mannered) journalist, Yamiche Alcindor.  He is incredibly insecure."
2020-03-30 18:15,So after all there is no need to invoke Defense Production Act?
2020-03-30 18:37,"Yes President ""I Take No Responsibility att All"", It's all GM's fault.

Of course GM did not waste time, but Trump and the conservatives and Republicans did.

They dismissed the threat of the pandemic.  They pretended it was like the flu.  They said it would magically go away (yes, in 21st century America that was what a president said about a proven pandemic).  They downplayed it's seriousness.  They refused the test kits the WHO offered them.  They refused, they are STILL refusing, to use the full powers of the federal government to help the medical community fight this virus.

Trump is trying to deflect blame and responsibility for his gross negligence and failure to lead onto others.  It just what this awful man does.  That does not mean the rest of us  should lower the accountability bar for him and his cult/party.

They have failed in ways that a few years ago would have been unimaginable for an American president and major political party.  This is their mess."
2020-03-30 18:43,"This is Trump's idea of ""leadership.""  Yell, fulminate, and bully, to give the impression you are being ""tough.""  It's all a show, and a self-defeating one at that."
2020-03-30 18:37,"This ventilator-manufacturing conflict is a classic case of Republicans manufacturing tension and conflict where there need be none: i.e. never let a crisis opportunity go to waste in the war to achieve political dominance.  Trump is a world champion at projection, doing the masterful head fake:  ‘Don’t look here to blame me for the ventilator shortage;  look over there to GM and Mary Barra.’  (Notice the attack on another woman.)  Perfect head-fake projection for the ditherer-in-chief.  He successfully intimidates and bullies top executives who are too wimpish to fight back, and the stable genius’s poll numbers will continue to rise.  Real politic on the road to MAGA indeed."
2020-03-30 19:04,"One might also speculate that Trump had planned to wow us all when the ventilators magically appeared. He'd pull out his black hat, wave his wand, and voila, there they'd be. But it didn't work out that way. Somehow it was more complicated than he'd told himself."
2020-03-30 19:10,"Trump has never been a part of publicly traded company like GM.  He's simply sits atop family (crime) enterprise which he inherited, and barks orders.  He has no earthly idea how real business and real production takes place, the obstacles the must be overcome, the planning that is done and executed.  He is, as we all know, a fraud, a charlatan, and a very poor excuse for a man and a leader."

2020-03-30 19:13,"AS expected in here the vast majority of the comments are ripping into Trump.  But ask yourselves a couple of questions.  

First, since Ventec is in the business of making ventilators and has had FDA approval since 2017 for their model, why did it take all the way to March 19th for the company to reach out to other companies to get the capacity needed to make large numbers of these.  It is the business they are in! 

Second, why does it appear that in basically a week's time Virgin Orbit partnered with two universities on a simple ventilator design to where they hope to get FDA approval for the design in a few days and expect to be able to make hundreds of thousands of these devices weekly in the near future while GM is hoping to be in production on an approved design that has already been produced on a smaller scale by the end of April?  

What do you think got in GM's way of moving faster on this?  They don't have to seek FDA approval.  They simply have to convert a manufacturing location over to doing this. Might it be the ""big business"" bureaucracy that everyone is up in arms against on these pages except when Trump offers a better target?

I worked on building and running manufacturing facilities in a variety of industries most of my career.  It is not about the ""can we do it"" as much as it is ""what makes it worth it to us to do it"" that always gets in the way of companies like GM."

Why aren’t there continuing televised debates for his competition come November? I think desperate times require desperate measures. In light of current events we need all of the top democratic candidates to participate in televised debate. In light of what is happening we need more choices and if need be, primary re-do’s.

Several? Afraid to be targeted by a tweet? If they would jump in and contribute, they would be lauded for their efforts.

The Stop the Spread campaign was formed to address the rampant xenophobia apparent to those who were triggered by calling the coronavirus the Wuhan virus or the China virus. I guess history will have to name this after the triggering period expires.

It is time for individual Americans to remember John Henry, to name just one of many who were not afraid to stand and be counted. 

It is also time for American political leaders to do the same. Responsible politicians at the state and local level must state clearly and often that people who act in the national interest will be protected against retribution by this out-of-control Executive Branch. Same thing for the House and (yes, greatness may yet be thrust upon them) the Senate."
2020-03-30 19:32,"""Ultimately, G.M. and Ventec executives decided that they would offer no direct response to the president because responding would only invite more criticism from the White House.""  I hope they will share a response in November so voters can take it into account in the election.  Democrats may need to ""prompt"" them."
2020-03-30 19:33,Trump doesn’t understand business.  GM in this situation is merely a contract manufacturer that is assembling someone else’s product using the design and know how created by that other person.  GM is just like an employee in this situation.  The other person who created the design and know how sets the price and collects the profit.  GM is entitled to compensation for providing services for assembling the product.
2020-03-30 19:35,"Trump has no understanding of what it takes to switch manufacturing of one product to another. He has no concept of Manufacturing because he has never MADE anything in his life. 
GM is doing a GREAT job in the conversion of their factory. And, the workers of Kokomo will do a GREAT job in learning the new assembly process. 
As for other companies shying away from doing their humane duty: be bold, be courageous. 
When will we ever come to the conclusion that that person inhabiting our White House is not a leader. That in reality that person has no constructive reason to be listened to. Thst person doesn't hold the US pursestrings. That person does not make law; and any tantrum of veto could be easily overcome in Congress IF we decide to put aside petty partisanship. That person doesn't control the FDA or FEMA or CDC. 
Who let's a child run their household? Who caves into their spoiled child tantrums? Ignore him. Let's get down to business."

2020-03-30 19:48,Those of us in NY know of Trump’s history of withholding payment for his buildings after the work is done. These companies should watch out. He’ll find some way to drive them into bankruptcy and blame their CEOs. This what you get when you elect a game show host to our highest office of President.
2020-03-30 19:53,"Trump is front-running events again. If GM is successful, he will claim that success. If it fails, he will say ""I told you so"".

Same with his claim that limiting casualties to 100k will be a good outcome. He is setting the expectation and will claim success either way.

Best strategy is to just ignore his rantings. Don't publish them, don't give them air. Send him back into his box."
2020-03-30 19:31,"GM, Ford and FCA are valued corporate citizens.  All three are working on much needed medical supplies.

Trump is a pathetic and incompetent leader.  Rather than rallying the nation with a plan to confront the crisis, he is misstating the facts and attacking those that want to help or need help."
2020-03-30 19:37,Wasting time has to be one of the few things Trump really understands!

Didn't a very revered world leader once say something along the lines of  ""... the only thing we have to fear is...fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance...""?

That is a line from, FDR's speech on the occasion of his first inauguration.  March 4, 1933. There was a horrific depression going on."

2020-03-30 19:58,"Thank you GM and Ventec for stepping up to help America.
Obviously our president is totally ignorant as to how to manage this pandemic so it falls to private industry to pick up the slack.

It's too bad he didn't listen to US Intelligence who told him in January we had a problem and we should start preparing.  He blames everyone for the mess and now says nurses are probably taking masks and selling them out the back door."
2020-03-30 19:58,"Lashing out unfairly at GM is so typical Trump. It accomplishes his two main goals - shifting the blame and pandering to his base. By distorting facts, he’s creating a false scenario to appear powerful. The fact that GM has a female CEO to demean was icing on the cake.

He doesn’t have the intellect or interest in understanding a complex system. And sadly his supporters won’t get to see the true story because their “news” channels are so biased."
2020-03-30 20:01,Can no one rid us of this turbulent president?
2020-03-30 20:07,"I didn't think it possible, but Trump is even more despicable now than at any other point in the last three and half years. He and his minions who continue to ignore science, civility, and reason should be tried for treason. If Trump had any shred of leadership quality he would don PPE and go and visit the medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis but he doesn't have the courage."
2020-03-30 20:23,Thanks to GM - and all the other companies that are stepping up to try to make critically needed resources!
2020-03-30 20:23,"Trump's inconsistent and unpredictable praise/criticism reminds me of Stalin and other lesser dictators: keep the subordinates wondering if it's a medal or the gulag...there's no way to predict which it will be...the dictator's momentary mood will decide. The paranoia and fear in such an atmosphere is crushing, even for the ""successful"" participants. Mr Barra and other corporate executives need to decide if they want to live in that kind of society -- their money is part of Trump's success."
2020-03-30 20:24,"I wondered since day one why the Times (and the rest of the media) didn't  go directly to GM to find out what exactly they were doing rather than let it be passed on by Trump.

We really need the press to verify what we are being told by the those that actually deliver what we need and not what any political party tells us.

That is  one of  the responsibilities of  a free press.

We deserve better."
2020-03-30 20:28,If any corporation in the USA can make things happen fast it's GM. I have seen it with my own eyes when GM executives from Detroit were in the Oklahoma City assembly plant just hours (early next morning) after a tornado destroyed our new multi-million dollar paint shop. All stops were pulled out and we were back in production in record time. I was in local mgt. at the time and in the meeting with the big shots. They said make it happen and gave us everything we needed to do so.
2020-03-30 20:32,"Glad Ventec and GM looked the other way and decided to go ahead with production. There efforts if successful , will be much appreciated. Trumps attempt to suggest he has straightened GM out on Sunday is a futile attempt to be relevant"

Your call, General."
2020-03-30 20:34,"Please, please, please, GM, disregard this hopeless president. We appreciate you stepping up and making things work.  Putting in 18-hour days is real patriotism.  It is your kind of can-do attitude that makes America great and that will get us through this pandemic.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
2020-03-30 20:36,"This problem dates back the Bush adminstration and wasn't addressed at all during the Obama adminstration. The differences with Trump are that: (1) it's more obvious this Emperor wears no clothes and (2) he is inarticlate to a degree that I haven't see any politician in my lifetime, though Pelosi and Bide come close."
2020-03-30 20:39,It sounds like GM and Ventec were moving to up production of ventilators as quickly as possible but if they weren't?  Trump failed to fully initiate the Defense Production Act for GM or any other company until last Friday so if there was a problem he has only himself to blame.
2020-03-30 20:40,"Big manufacturing businesses can get the job done, even if they have to start from scratch with a new product (especially if they don't have a know-nothing president insulting them and breathing down their necks).  During WWII, Ford Motor Corporation was charged with building heavy bombers, although their experience had been limited to automobiles.

 Automobiles of that era had 15,000 parts and weighed around 3,000 pounds.  Sixty-seven feet long, the B-24 Liberator Bomber had 450,000 parts and 360,000 rivets in 550 sizes, and it weighed 18 tons. Skeptics dismissed mass production of a plane this enormous and advanced as a carmaker’s fantasy that would crash and burn. At the height of its production, Ford was turning out one B24 every hour.  And they were instrumental in winning the war.

Mr. Trump, please leave them alone and let them do their business, while you do your own business (whatever that is)."

Without a contract, there is nothing for the government to compel Ventec to do.

That said, Ventec and GM are moving mountains to manufacture the VOCSN ventilator. I am really proud of them. As a GM retiree from purchasing and manufacturing, I have every faith they will succeed."

2020-03-30 20:15,"When we need leadership, what we have instead is a petulant five year old throwing fits and blaming people.  I hope at least some of this orange disaster's supporters come around to seeing exactly what happens when you elect an absolute unqualified disgrace to fill one of the most important jobs in the world. 
 Direct action should have been taken in January when this virus first reared it's ugly head.  Instead, this ridiculous parody of a man was more worried about the stock market and his own glorification.  
Thousands and thousands of unnecessary deaths will now happen in this Country because people elected an out of control, unhinged Bozo to supposedly change things around.  How utterly outrageous."

We'll even gladly continue to pay that $650/night/room hotel rate at his resorts like we already do for he and his whole family and their secret service entourage if he'll promise to stay away. Go for the steaks and lobsters and bottles of Mouton Rothschild every night on us too. (And tip the wait staff 20%, charged to us, instead of your usual 5%.)"
2020-03-30 20:54,"Trump is frightened because he wasted so much time early on and knows it, despite never admitting the fact.  Obviously everybody else knows that is why we are so far behind now.

His only response is to blame others.   

His only concern is his re election because the moment he is a private citizen in January 2021 he will be deluged by existing state and city charges which he feels immune to as president.  His behavior as president; disgusting, cowardly and criminal, may never even matter.  

I'm sure he's hurrying to steal more resources from the people of the U.S. so his poor offspring don't suffer.  Don Jr.'s hunting rifles are not cheap, not to mention his 'guides'.  I wonder if he makes them call him 'bwana'."
2020-03-30 20:57,"I see the problem, the head of GM is a woman.  Trump hates women in powerful positions and needs to make himself look 'big' by bashing them in some way."

2020-03-30 20:44,"Trump is a major part of the problem. He is grossly incompetent, lies pathologically, and engages in wholesale projection. It is he who always wastes time. He is worse than a wast of our time. This is what you get from a president who is a moronic sociopath. What a farce and a tragedy: having the pandemic AND Trump. This is MAGA."
2020-03-30 21:22,"Since Trump never takes the blame for anything that goes bad, why don't we just hear from the other person first. With the ventilators Trump hears about people dying from lack of ventilators. Trump quickly lashes out at GM, not knowing what is going on, but just the thought of something not making him look bad is enough. Then, when it turns out all things are going as planned, Trump makes comments like this: ""I don't think we have to worry about GM now"". What a magnanimous statement. Trump gets caught up in ""All Things Being Trump"". Just the thought of looking badly for Trump is enough for him to quickly make someone take the fall. Then, when Trump finds out that everything is really going well, he makes a statement that he condones everything and that things are well again. Not a statement that he may have spoken out of turn, but that all is ""now"" going well. I'm definitely afraid of Corvid-19, but I'm equally afraid of Trump being reelected."
2020-03-30 21:33,"Suppose Ms Barra got up on Monday morning and sent out a Tweet to all employees saying that they were dragging their feet and wasting time. Then on Wednesday, she sends a Tweet that says that GM employees were the greatest people in the universe. GM she says, is going to build an anti-gravity truck to replace the Silverado. She has no notion of what the demand might be, how many GM might produce and sell, what they would cost to build or how much GM would have to invest to produce them much less the state of the technology needed. No problem, she says. She will simply plow ahead.

Harvard Business School would be salivating to write a case study. Seriously serious people who pontificate would be writing seriously serious pontifical pieces about the psychological pathology of the unhinged Ms. Barra. The GM Board would be in a tizzy. The most fervent Silverado fans would be swearing that they would never buy another Chevy.

Lucky us. Ms. Barra has shown she is an experienced and competent executive. Maybe, just maybe, before GM commits to a huge undertaking to produce a product as different from a vehicle as a cabbage is from a Silverado, the dithering, incompetent FEMA could make up its collective mind since FEMA seems to have been charged with this responsibility. Maybe, just maybe, they could alone say, well, at least the 30 to 40,000 that New York might need.

Of course, Dr. Death feels free to criticize. Thank your for your forbearance, Ms. Barra."

Too little support= worsening organ failure, increased risk of prolonged need for ventilation, etc.  Both too much or too little can kill a patient.  Patient requirements can change rapidly and need to be adjusted regularly.  Then there are the complications...how to avoid them, detect them, and treat them, etc...

Of course, POTUS could have been tougher on GM.

He could have reminded Mary B. that the US government bailed out GM - less than a decade ago.

The least they can do is ask ""how high""."
2020-03-30 23:02,"Trump is irritated the GM/Ventec hasn't produced 40,000 ventilators “very quickly” and accuse them of dragging their feet when in fact when it normally takes a month to produce about 200 machines. 

The question that Trump needs to address is why did it take him two months to finally acknowledge this was a deadly virus and not a democratic hoax and proceeded to not even begin plans to prepare for the spread of this virus until mid March? He has the nerve to get irritated at the time it takes to produce these ventilators. To also attack GM chief executive, Mary T. Barra of dragging her feet without mentioning Ventec's CEO Chris Kiple is just another disgusting Trump misogynist statement we can do without. 

How about he point fingers at himself and accept his lack of responsibilities in preparing for this coronavirus tsunami? As usual he won't take any part in this Trump made disaster, instead blame, attack and complain."

2020-03-30 23:04,So he told GM to 'hurry up' to make the ventilators in times of significant emergency when Cuomo says he needs 26000 or people will die. Seems a sensible thig to do. Interesting to hear how GM and Ventec are progressing though.
2020-03-30 23:30,"Here's my cynical (=realistic) take on the situation.  Trump sees private industry rushing to fill the gap left by his downplaying the virus for critical weeks.  He pretends GM is dragging its heels, even while it is leading and innovating.  That way he can take credit for supposedly kicking them into action, and can say it was thanks to HIM, not Mary Barra, that GM started producing ventilators. It's reprehensible.  Even worse, his followers will believe him.  I hope Michigan voters see through this in November because this man cost some Michiganders their LIVES."

Given what you are facing in the U.S. and other European nations, it seems that having this type of regulations is NOT disproportionate at all, especially considering that the healthcare system in a developing country is way behind countries where SARS already has caused more than just trouble.

We thought our constitution nailed down some limits on power, but Republicans have pried lose the Founders' protections. Having a kleptocrat run amok at the head of government may be a worst case. 

Some on the left believe that if things get bad enough people will revolt, but it's as likely be for a fascist regime as workers paradise. And even democratic revolutions can devolve to authoritarian rule and cult of personality.

One would have thought that the legal profession, of all things, would have raised so much as an eyebrow at being shut down with the stroke of a pen. And not every northeastern state has shut down their legal system. Among other things, personal injury and property damage filings, as well as divorce filings are now barred.

2020-03-30 16:49,"The Coronavirus pandemic and the world's response to it show how powerful fear is in our species, especially when our fear takes us into uncharted territories with terrifying risks. However, the pandemic's death rate, including in the country where the virus arose, seems nowhere commensurate with its likely devastating economic impacts--short-term and long-term, micro and macro. But as this article rightly shows, this fear-inducing pandemic has created potential political impacts which are potentially more frightening to those of us who value basic freedom and other human rights. 

To autocrats like Orban, Erdogan and Duterte, fear is not unwanted. Indeed, they thrive politically on fear, in that it brought them to power and helps them maintain that power. We are fortunate indeed to be in a nation that takes seriously the protection of freedoms of speech, association and press, and to be ""led"" by a wannabe autocrat who is morally and politically incapable of mustering enough support from the frightened citizenry to be able to push through legislation curbing those freedoms. One shudders to think what our president would do if he could have his druthers with a populace hyped up on fear."

2020-03-30 17:13,"In the coming few years, I expect that this period will not only aid the further rise of authoritarianism both here and abroad, it will increase political polarization that will be manipulated by autocratic leaders.

If we once again do business as usual and stop social distancing too soon, hundreds of thousands of Americans (or more) could die. That will further polarize the nation and assist demagogues and authoritarian leaders like President Trump who offer fear and easy answers. 

If we continue social distancing and mitigate the worst effects of the virus, many on the right will claim that this was a ""hoax"" and no worse than the flu and an attempt to undermine Mr. Trump and the economy. That's even more true if the virus doesn't turn out to be as bad as first predicted, although with every day this seems less likely. In both instances, some people will doubt facts and expertise even more than they do already, setting the stage for increased misinformation, propaganda, and authoritarian opportunists. And that increased mistrust of facts will further endanger any possibility of dealing with climate change.

As the article says, authoritarian leaders around the world will use the virus to broaden surveillance and social control. But one thing is clear already here in America: we may mobilize now to fight the pandemic, but this virus won't bring us together over the longterm."

This will happen in the U.S. just as surely as in Hungary. Consider that even in states run by Democrats, we are flirting ever closer with martial law and with no end in sight. It's not just government bearing down on us, but a tremendous peer pressure among our fellow citizens to shut up and fall in line. 

No modern-day Patrick Henry can be found, but bravo to Ms. Gebrekidan for at least initiating discussion of these gravest concerns.

Countries like the USA, which since their foundation have been extremely aware of the constant threat of a possible return of tyranny, have wisely established a system of check and balance to prevent it. However, the corollary to this awareness — the mantra of “less State” — may prove to be a fifth column inside an otherwise sound notion.

Today, those concerned with civil rights are suspicious of our President's quickness to impose a ""classified"" claim to all communications between the White House and Center for Disease Control which belies a deep authoritarian streak in Mr. Trump: he absolutely hates it when Congress pries into executive business even when it is consistent with Constitutional Oversight duties.

Fortunately, Representative  Earl Blumenauer and Senator Wyden from Oregon anticipate the possibility that President Trump might try to suspend elections due to the Corona Virus pandemic. They are promoting legislation that would make it a federal rule for all citizens to have a chance to vote by mail if they choose.

The pandemic is showing us in amazing detail how inter-connected global society now is.  I wish that the UN or some such body were up for creating a more global governance structure but have my doubts.  The time to move beyond squabbling nation-states with increasingly myopic, nationalistic leaders (really in it for their own personal fortunes) is obvious. This is just the wake up call for the future global thinking and action needed to confront climate change and the challenge of equitably providing opportunity for the planet’s growing human population.  I don’t see a clear path forward but feel like COVID-19 is metaphorically like a virus on a computer system- the old system is now essentially disabled.  The reboot with a new system can look like the checkerboard of tribal authoritarian systems described in this article OR it could be the emergence of a global, humane, democratic, sane governance structure with actual support from and responsibility to humanity as a whole... How that can happen, I’m not sure.."
2020-03-30 17:46,"As an American, I am most concerned about what the politicians will do after the COVID-19 crisis has past regarding such core issues as civil rights and economic freedom.  After decades of observation, I have concluded that many of our politicians tend to be self deceived ... they often think of themselves as the best and brightest but in reality their actions expose them as insecure, lacking common sense, and out of touch."
2020-03-30 18:16,"It's great to finally see some attention give to this issue in the mainstream media. More worrying to me than the pandemic itself is that literally millions of Americans have been *asking* the government to take away their rights in exchange for a (mostly false) sense of security. All civil liberties, with the notable exception of freedom of the press, have been diminished by almost all states, with zero pushback. Leaders who were slow to restrict civil liberties were criticized harshly. Even at the federal level, Congress extended some of the PATRIOT Act provisions. This goes beyond party politics—both Democratic- and Republican-led states have been equally restricted, and strong bipartisan majorities in Congress voted to extend the PATRIOT Act.

Thankfully and surprisingly, our president has (thus far) refrained from joining the chorus of chief executives issuing draconian decrees. The fact that, in most states, one person has the power to instantaneously criminalize life as we know it, with no vote from a legislature, is beyond frightening, and the very definition of ""dictatorship."" It's too early to say that we live in a dictatorship, but it's not at all unreasonable to say we live in 50 mini-dictatorships.

""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" –Benjamin Franklin.

We've sadly come a long way from that."
2020-03-30 16:47,Never let a good crisis go to waste.
2020-03-30 17:28,Watch out for Trump doing the same thing!!
2020-03-30 17:53,Trump will declare martial law and will cancel November election to stay in power
2020-03-30 17:39,Have America's leaders relinquished the power given them by the Patriot Act?
2020-03-30 18:01,And what about the Autocrat in the White House?  Very scary time.  I don't put anything past him.
2020-03-30 17:35,"Autocrats also use ""rumors, fabrications and false news"" to gaslight -- from one extreme to the other -- from rosy to dire, with a willful, deliberate intent:

Trump Feb 26th: ""when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.""

Trump yesterday: ""You're gonna have large numbers of suicides -- tremendous [numbers of] suicides... You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before, and people are going to be dying all over the place"""
2020-03-30 17:39,"I've been thinking about this, ever since Captain Bonespurs named himself a ""war time"" president.  For sure he will attempt to retain control in November, saying that the election must be postponed.

I'd say we all need to urge our Democratic representatives and Senators to sign a pledge, swearing that 1. they will not allow postponement of elections and 2. any ""special"" powers give to any branch of the government must come with an automatic sunset law, of 6 months to 1 year, which may be renewed with substantial majorities.  No sunset, no passage of any bill whatsoever.

Any Democrat who won't swear to this pledge, should be voted out, (as soon as we get a vote?!)

Also: the Democrats need to start RIGHT NOW to set up a way that we can have both primaries and the final election by mail, this year!  A simple paper ballot should be given, along with a duplicate copy.  The voter fills out one ballot, and mails it.  He retains the second ballot, signed and dated, in case of recounts.  

This is not that hard to do, folks.  My state already holds elections by mail.  Anything else discriminates against the elderly, the ill, the working--any voter who cannot stand in the rain for hours on voting day.

Please call your reps and ask for this pledge!"
2020-03-30 17:42,"Stephen Miller and Trump are happy as vultures on roadkill as the emergency makes stealing the 2020 elections unnecessary.  Elections, what elections?"
2020-03-30 17:53,I am convinced Trump will use this crisis to corrupt the upcoming election by further suppressing the vote.  This may include endlessly delaying the election if he is polling poorly.
2020-03-30 17:54,"These are dark times for humankind.

Dictators always seek to confuse their victims as they consolidate power and gain total control.

Once won, they never relinquish those gains. 

Then, we face the awful dilemma; accept their dictatorship with all that entails or resist and face the consequences and all that entails.

The only way to win is not to play. 

Too late."
2020-03-30 18:02,Perhaps Trump will reinstate big rallies with his supporters. wouldn't the be great!

2020-03-30 17:28,"""Never let a good crisis go to waste"".

We see it here; William Barr with his trial balloon in suspending habeas corpus, the EPA willingly allowing businesses to pollute with impunity, Trump essentially telling governors to treat him nicely if they want to save their citizens.  

Even with the best of intentions, it is human nature to capitalize on a situation to gain more control and advantage."
2020-03-30 17:38,"I would not be too worry about the autocrats at this time.

Besides, this is hardly time for much pondering and parliamentary discussions, that much should be obvious, and thus things naturally fall into the hands of what the author thinks might be 'autocrats'.

Finally, there are no autocrats in Europe, at all.  Orban in Hungary is winning left and right, and to call him an 'autocrat' is very inaccurate and somewhat malevolent.  England had no autocrat for a couple of centuries.

Rest assured things will slide back into normalcy once the virus goes home."

2020-03-30 17:46,"People have long recognized that in times of emergency, leaders need to exercise more power than in normal times. That is why the Roman Republic had the year-long position of ""dictator""—to help manage military crises and other extraordinary events. And this system worked well for a surprisingly long time, as some leaders were civic-minded enough to actually relinquish the title when their time was up.

Until there were too many crises all at once, leading to a vacuum of power, civil war, and all the rest. Leaving room for Julius Caesar to declare himself ""Dictator for Life."" And we know how the story goes after that. 

And we'd be lucky if we had someone with half the integrity and intelligence of Julius Caesar."
2020-03-30 17:23,"From the start of this pandemic the hasty calls for states of emergency and the ""war speak""- which allow governments extra-judicial powers to curtail our civil liberties - were what terrified me. I do not fear the virus, but I am terrified of how government will take advantage of the situation to deprive us of our blessed freedom. We must vigilantly question any curtailment of our civil liberties. A lot can be justified in the name of the ""public good."" It's a slippery slope. You don't lose freedom overnight. It happens incrementally, you don't even notice. You become complacent and before you know it you accept it as the new normal. I trust nature more than I trust man. The virus will run its course and I am confident the vast majority will survive unscathed. Man on the other hand is unscrupulous and knows no limits. Thank you for writing this. God help us to keep our freedom."
2020-03-30 17:23,"Trump has declared a National Emergency that he claims gives him ""powers most people don't even know about.""
Trump has not used those powers to order companies to make desperately needed medical supplies (except to punish GM for embarrassing him.) If those powers are not for fighting this virus, then what does he think those powers will let him do.

Trump and his party keeps mocking, contradicting, threatening to violate, and actually violating the Constitution on TV, and is blatantly using this disaster to attack NYC and other blue cities. They gave NY less money per capita to deal with this disease than red states with few cases.

Trump has been creating disasters and pretending to solve them for his entire term, only caring about how it affects HIM. Trump has made a career out of using disasters to loot organizations from the top down, leaving everyone else involved worse off. He did this to four casinos in Atlantic City alone. Casinos don't lose money unless the CEO is stealing it.

Trump was contradicting his own scientists for months while this thing grew, because disaster is how Trump increases his wealth and power.

Why is he making states bid up the price of ventilators (from $25,000 to $45,000 according to Cuomo) by not ordering companies to build ventilators?

Primaries are already being postponed. What happens when Trump says he is suspending the presidential election because HE let a virus spin out of control?

Meanwhile, Trump governs by WHIM as if he were king."
2020-03-30 18:20,"In the current climate of fear, are articles like this helpful? Many bad things can happen but what good does it do to conjecture in the middle of a pandemic something that has little chance of happening. Keep up the excellent articles informing us on all things pandemic."
2020-03-30 18:40,"It’s a repeat of Europe in the 1930s, but on a global scale. The main difference is that now there are nuclear weapons."
2020-03-30 18:45,"Eventually this virus will diminish to being quite controllable.  In addition a vaccine will most surely be developed, hopefully sooner than later.   So what will be the life of the temporary authoritarian laws/regulations that were agreed to during the crisis.     
Reading comments the general feeling seems to be that they will not be eradicated.
In view of this hindsight is it not possible to announce restrictive measures during this crisis that are only in force while there is no vaccine.
That is that once a vaccine is developed the temporary laws are automatically removed from the books without having Congress to issue such an order."
2020-03-30 18:47,"Trump has not assumed any special powers, but has let the states decide what they are going to do themselves. He has provided guidance and avoided enacting martial law. States have rights that cannot be dictated by the Federal government."
2020-03-30 18:50,"When I've mentioned the following to friends, they look at me with skepticism and disbelief: I predict Trump will seek to cancel the November election if he finds that the economy continues a downtown and Covid-19 happens to continues an upturn through the summer. A state of emergency will ""demand"" he remain commander-in-chief, to protect the nation.

The courts will support him, his base will demand it, and despite Democrats screaming -- we will lack sufficient cohesion and heft to defeat his authoritarian madness.

Surely I'll be proven wrong. Surely he'll accept the law of the land. Surely he'll conform to the nation's standards. Surely Hillary Clinton was going to be elected in 2016."
2020-03-30 18:52,"It's not so easy to put the genie back in the bottle.  Big Brother is certainly upon us, and global health pandemics will only make him stronger. 

If I were younger, I'd do more to fight this in whatever way possible, but to tell the truth, I'd be at a loss to advise as to where to start other than a huge emphasis on the teaching of critical thinking skills in the schools which in authoritarian countries, is an anathema.   

And people of the United States, if you keep electing authoritarians (whether on the Right or on the Left) you are adding to the problem."

2020-03-30 18:33,"Trump in some ways hopes this pandemic stretchers into the fall. Where he might seek to suspend elections, seize power for himself, and  do away with the other two branches. His base would support such moves even as their civil rights and liberties are taken from them in broad daylight. Effectively making himself 'president for life.' NYTIMES should pull this comment up in six months to see who is laughing then."
2020-03-30 18:38,"Pointing at others are we?  Our president is saying ""be nice to me, I will reward red states and punish blue ones,"" followed by, ""why don't you expendable people go back to work - catch the virus and die - while my family and I are safe and benefit from federal pork?""

It is a matter of time he declares one emergency after another and starts with the cash grab."
2020-03-30 18:15,"You're absolutely right about autocrats.  And it gives me an opportunity to ask yet again why the New York Times is not reporting that the Israeli government, whose democratic behavior is  of such concern to the entire world,  first sent instructions on self isolation to the residents of Gaza, and then offered test kits, which were accepted and returned to Israel for analysis, as Gaza cannot do it themselves.  And the thanks they got?  Rockets into southern Israel.  How quietly do you expect Israelis to die?  The patience of the Israeli left does not extend that far, not past survival of their children and grandchildren.  But they will demand democracy, when the crisis is over.

The Palestinian Authority and Israel have cooperated in fighting Covid19 from the first; the PA and its citizens will survive.  Gaza is going to be desperate, and is allowing Hamas to fire rockets into Israel.  They are not going to be met at the border by Israeli doctors and food packages.  Not after firing rockets.

Britain, Israel, America, will all survive necessary autocracy.  And the Middle East, Iran, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, may get remade.  Not necessarily made more democratic, not necessarily friendlier to the West, but remade.  Happy Passover and Easter, and give thanks that Iran and Erdogan do not have atomic weapons."

2020-03-30 18:47,"This is what I had anticipated. While the world is distracted by the Covid-19 virus, power mongers make their grab to further their agenda under the guise of “ protection” for their population. A population too fearful and stressed to oversee them, and when they are able to in the too distant future, will discover that reversals can’t be made without prolonged legal and constitutional battles between the executive branch and the other branches of government. The US just went through an impeachment for abuse of power and the GOP gave him a pass. Trump can pretty much do whatever he wants in a weary nation, and already is, ie; nullifying all environmental restrictions, etc. This is how democracies fall when your busy doing other things."
2020-03-30 18:11,"The rich and the influential, detached from the needs of the people and from common sense, will continue their singleminded pursuit of more power at the expense of everything and everyone.

What citizen would not willingly give up his civil rights in return for safety and security, and in time the ACLU will seem old fashioned, composed of odd ball quirks harking back to a previous age when freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution appeared sacrosanct. In 1970's Henry Kissinger predicted that with the rise of transnational terrorism,strong, authoritarian Jacobin style governments,""bref"" dictatorships were inevitable.Forecast made by one analysis of our politics is that whoever is elected to replace TRUMP in 2024 or who defeats him in 2020 would do exactly the same things that he has done!But article, once again is excellently written!"
2020-03-30 18:16,"Add India's Modi to these autocrats who are trying to grab more and more power. If there is one country whose PM has shown great fortitude and wisdom and has not become a dictatorship, it is Pakistan and its Prime Minister Imran Khan. Media is free to criticize the government, the communications of the government with people are free, and Imran Khan is always available and accountable to his people. This is a refreshing environment even in this turbulent time."
2020-03-30 18:18,"An excellent article. Maybe the following should be added though. The autocrats, basically all of them, have first denied the problem and waited deliberately that it become catastrophic - clearly in order to gain more power. And it is not just say Orban, Duterte and other semi-dictators , but also the buffoons  like Trump and Johnson who are threatening democracy in their respective countries. 

I have been following BBC news for years and until the Johnson disaster it has never failed to offer a critical view of the government and/or prime ministers. Not with Johnson though, one can find critical opinions only in foreign newspapers. There is a serious danger for democracy in Great Britain, maybe even more than in the States."

  I thought allowing him to negotiate off-record with our enemies was dangerous.

  I thought turning the US military into his personal patsies and showcase was dangerous and trumpeting extreme levels of revenge against all his enemies (no matter how trivial the conflict or criticism).

But yes, having a failed and spoiled rich kid who hates the world and is paranoid and vengeful to all his critics is not the person to be in charge of resources in a global pandemic - 
                                 now that's dangerous.

The pandemic will allow Trump to add purposeful manslaughter to his resume and historical record."

It's been ready to go pending the November elections outcome, but with their incompetent handling of the pandemic it could be ready to go a lot sooner.

The (second civil) war against blue states began as soon as he was installed in office and has escalated ever since as he dances and skips over any and all checks on his power. He's even tried to lock down the NYC area who know trump best and media capital of the world exposing him for what he is."

2020-03-30 19:01,"I suspect we would not be in this mess if we did not have autocrats in charge. China did not get warnings out fast enough because they were scared of Beijing authority, the US is lagging because we have a foolish autocrat who no one dares to stand up to. The results from N.

2020-03-30 18:58,"This article is insidious. Yes, we all fear that these powers may not be rescinded, but the article places it simply as a choice by autocrats, and completely wipes out the agency of people across the globe in affecting policy. 

People will read this and decide not to comply with social distancing orders for fear of letting the government have more control over them that they will not be able to reverse. This article completely validates them by placing humanity in some crude high-school version of the Platonic philosopher's kingdom where the people have no voice and must submit to the higher wisdom.

By telling us that this choice is simply up to the government and we have no power, this article will make that true. It further alienates people from their government and will actually allow dictators and those with authoritarian tendencies to hold on to these powers by destroying popular hope for resistance.
The question should not be whether leaders will relinquish their power, but whether the people will force them to, and this article is of the firm belief that we have no power. Time will tell, and I hope to be proven wrong, but I would not be surprised if this article becomes partially responsible for humanity's second descent into fascism."
2020-03-30 19:00,"Great article. Could have benefited from some acknowledgement that these governments were already autocratic, arbitrary, and ruthless toward certain sectors of their populations, and that crises like this pandemic only provide occasion for expanding misrule -- rather than occasion for inventing misrule. In the United States, for example, much of what the Department of Justice asked for -- indefinite detention without trial -- is already practices against large sectors of its jailed population, which is disproportionately nonwhite. The upshot: even without a pandemic, protect the rights of the most vulnerable; prevent any mistreatment.  One day, they will come for you."
2020-03-30 19:04,"I doubt the government can roll back authority. The current coronavirus crisis is not the last novel pandemic we will see. MERS, SARS, West Nile, Ebola, Zika - they keep getting weirder and more infectious. As our population grows and encroaches on wildlife habitat, we will create more opportunities for animal viruses to jump to humans, and pandemics will increase in severity.  Viruses are too opportunistic for any other reality. 

The unfortunate fact is there are too many of us choking up freeways. Big populations require big states. Technological advances reduce the need for ""surplus labor.""  As our numbers increase, we lose value (supply/demand), and the threat of riots in the face of exploitation by capital necessitates increased police powers to protect the private property rights of the opulent.

You want a small government, decrease your numbers."
2020-03-30 15:47,"This is one of the more important  — and sadly, overlooked —aspects of what is going on now. Just as the events of September 11th allowed the government (at least the United States) nearly unchecked power to infringe on people's civil liberties, so too will the war on coronavirus. What's more, you've got people stuck in their homes, afraid to leave for fear they might catch this thing and wind up in an ill-equipped hospital; additionally, people are afraid to gather, told to socially-distance, leaving them unable to mobilize in any meaningful kind of way. They're also economically depressed, with no money or opportunity. All the while, the government is still assembling, passing bills which enrich themselves and their friends (the senator inside trading scandal from 2 weeks ago has been totally swept under the rug). I mean, this is a bad situation all around. If you can't see the writing on the wall, something is wrong here. Dark times ahead."

Gone is the democratic skepticism of demagoguery.

How would having a Guantanamo-style black site where even US citizens can be locked indefinitely without trial on US soil help with a health crisis?

However, as you point out, big government is often intrusive and  dictatorial.  To offset that, we have to re-read Tocqueville's Democracy in America. He celebrated the intermediary and voluntary associations, such as churches, labor unions, the entertainment industry, the universities, even the sports leagues.  They represent private power centers that can offset the power of the government in Washington. We should also celebrate federalism, the  governors and mayors who are pushing back against Trump and  his misguided rhetoric and policies.
We still have elections, but cannot be sure that they will be free and fair."

Its kind of ridiculous to show a picture of police control in Chile, at the tope of the note, while Chile is a democracy undergoing a health crisis and enforcing stric controls to limit the spread of a virus......mixing pears and spinach!"
2020-03-30 19:31,"As Bill Barr uses the health crisis to push for Guantanamo style detention on US soil, It’s a good time to consider former Supreme Court Justice David Souter’s warning:

“I don't worry about our losing republican government in the United States because I'm afraid of a foreign invasion. I don't worry about it because I think there is going to be a coup by the military as has happened in some of other places. What I worry about is that when problems are not addressed, people will not know who is responsible. And when the problems get bad enough, as they might do, for example, with another serious terrorist attack, as they might do with another financial meltdown, some one person will come forward and say, 'Give me total power and I will solve this problem.'...That’s how democracy dies.”"
2020-03-30 19:36,"The CV is an unfortunate matter, but fie on big business that will emerge improved therefrom thanks to social forces as, albeit slowly, ‘value’ is slowly moved from the many unto the few… finally the one.  The destruction of the (unnatural) person (corporation), as an unnatural legal construct, is the only way out of this mess."
2020-03-30 19:43,"And even here in Germany (I no longer live in Manila, have to fix that), it is this ""eye"" that is being taken off the ball.

The closure of German (and French, and Spanish, and Italian, and) ""borders"", all completely illegal under every EU law there is, has not so much as caused a shrug of the shoulder.

So what, then, can we say about Orban, now a true dictator, in Hungary, a member state of the European Union, much less about an Israeli Prime Minister's ""closing of the courts"" (say, what??).

But here we are. 

Once even the most ostensibly ""democratic"" states begin to do what amounts, in our common law, to ""suspending habeas corpus"", (yes, as Lincoln himself once did), we better hope that those states are governed by Lincolns; for, if not, our rights, once forswarn to the state under imposition of ""emergency powers"", will seldom, if ever, be regained to us."
2020-03-30 18:24,"Almost the worst aspect of this crisis is how it's made people practically clamour for more state control and more surveillance - just as, indeed September 11 had. Where I live the government seems to have taken measures in (relatively) good time. But too many people think this means we should never criticise a thing they do. ""This is not the time"" is bandied about far too often. Yes, this IS the time to watch what our governments are doing, and who is profiting. If not now, when?"
2020-03-30 20:31,"I think we all know the answer to the question in the subtitle.

Now is the time for more transparency, democracy, and worker power. We have to stay vigilant.

Now is also the time to protect the earth as much as possible. We have a chance to get people to drive less, to grow their own food, to cook more, and to be part of local communities. This can help the entire planet and other species. I'm thinking of the grifter-in-chief president of my country halting environmental protections recently in order for men with power to make more money, the exact opposite of what shoud happen."

2020-03-30 19:51,"There is a rising tide of right-wing autocracy afoot in the world. Its proponents despise constitutional democracy no less than the early-to-mid 20th Century extremists of the right and the left derided democratic norms to the murderous calamity of totalitarianism that we naïvely thought had been defeated once and for all with the fall of the Berlin Wall.

But the human pathology autocratic oppression lives on forever, sometimes in illegitimate control and at other times sleeping in hibernation. The drive to control others, however, never goes away. 

Our own Civil War, notwithstanding the known, bloody and exhorbitant cost, rages on beneath the surface today, ready to poke its ugly head out of the muck to impose a new version of Jim Crow throughout the nation.

It will take a relentlessly dedicated collective effort of constitutional struggle to keep the autocrats in their dog crates. The concrete and rebar wall of Berlin might be gone, but the metaphorical wall lives on in the dreams of extremists who despise consensus."

2020-03-30 19:52,"This is happening everywhere, even in the U.S. In Los Angeles, one can be fined for walking in public, alone, or, God forbid, stepping on a beach, again alone (as opposed to in a large group). Neither of those things is recommended by the WHO or the CDC. Moreover, people are accepting overly broad quarantine and ""shelter in place"" orders, which pose enough constitutional problems when they are directed at people who are known to be ill or infectious; how can they be directed at an entire population?"
2020-03-30 20:25,"Liberal thinkers have made of individual liberties the touchstone of political rectitude. However, the main internal constraint to these is that they can only be enjoyed in a safe environment... whereas any measure to secure public safety must infringe on those very liberties. This painful paradox is convincingly illustrated by the following metaphor. Threats to security originate either from others (theft, aggression, murder, rape...), or from oneself (carelessness, risky behaviour, excessive drinking, drug abuse...). 
Defense against the former is symbolized by the rampart, which protects you against other people by restricting their movements. Defense against the latter is symbolized by the guardrail, which prevents you from harming yourself, but at the cost of limiting your movements. Every rule or law designed to safeguard the members of a community are more or less abstract renderings of one of these physical realities. There can be no absolute freedom without insecurity... and no complete security without a contraction of personal freedom.
When a group of people feel safe, they wish to push back the restrictions to widen their margin of freedom. When they are threatened, on the opposite, they feel the need to pull them in, to increase their safety zone. So a socio-political regime cannot define personal freedom or public safety as absolutes, but should rather give itself a flexible and transparent mechanism to adjust them to any situation."
2020-03-30 20:00,"If the present nation states of the world, that call themselves ""democracies"", were ever true democracies, they would have never had to be at war with ""people rule"" over the centuries. However, the problem for those who continue to war against ""people power"" is that as they continue to roll out their machinations to usurp Nature's Template for planetary governance, know that ""The Force of Democracy is ALWAYS with the governed."" (D. Hume) Therefore, these agents of deceit, and illicit power, will come to know by the consequence of their actions, that they are not only warring against humanity but also against the planet and the Universe itself! For no amount of power born of the ego in Man can ever circumvent that which is Curved!"

2020-03-30 20:40,"The potential is real, even in this country. In desperate times people want to believe in those in charge, against their common sense and even when they lie. Unfortunately it opens the door for those inclined to grab whatever power they can and hold onto it after the crisis is over. I have been afraid of that with Trump since the beginning of this, and as the election approaches we'll soon know whether or not he is one of those leaders."

2020-03-30 20:42,"Question/Comment:  why didn’t the NYT include an analysis of the Bush presidency in retrospect and now of Donald Trump who though impeached remains President surrounded by his Republican sycophants (i.e., henchmen and women) ?"
2020-03-30 20:45,"Democracy is a fragile flower that blooms best in good times where a certain tolerance for inefficiency and mistakes can be graciously endured. In a democracy difficult decisions tend to be avoided because they are controversial and unpopular, and once they become non-controversial it is often too late.

It is too soon to say whether Trump will make a decisively authoritarian move based on the pandemic. He wanted it gone by Easter, but for largely symbolic reasons. Having to extend economic restrictions through April was neither a surprise for Trump nor a huge political burden.

The calculus will change if the economy is still shut down in late August. Trump clearly believes he needs an economic upswing going into November in order to be reelected. If that hasn't happened by the end of summer, he will see his political fate as being at risk.

Plus a continuing ban on normal social life will create an intolerable situation at the Republican convention. There will be no adoring crowds to greet Trump and shower their adulation upon him. There will be no triumphant economy to celebrate. If any argument can be plausibly made that the pandemic has been conquered and restrictions can be safely removed, Trump will seize upon it.

And if perchance Trump is forced to acknowledge that the economic shutdown must be extended through August and the convention, he will begin thinking in terms of canceling the November election. It will offer his last, best opportunity for retaining power."
2020-03-30 20:47,"We should all be very concerned about the concentration of power in the government that has occurred in the US as a result of the various “emergency” measures that have been promulgated and legislated. This will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to undo when the crisis is over; our freedom will be permanently compromised."
2020-03-30 20:47,"I've thought a lot about this. 
There's no question that the world's autocrats, including Pres. Trump, will use this pandemic to try take & hold onto more power. 
It will be up to us to stop them."
2020-03-30 20:55,"I would like to offer a view from someone living in the UK who  spent 6 years living and working in NJ and NYC from 1996 to 2002. I ride my bike to work in the morning and see food stores open with full shelves and few people. Delivery vans make up half the traffic. It is rare to see a police presence in my town. A few days ago I rode into the seaside resort of Blackpool with my son and stopped on the promenade to rest. There were 2 police vehicles monitoring the area. While sat down 4 drunks walked out past us and started talking loudly with fervour and the occasional profanity. One of the police vans drove over and wound their window down to talk to them. They told them to get back indoors, ignoring the slightly confrontational comments. ""What are you gonna do?"", challenged one drunk while approaching the open window, ""...Arrest us?"". The policeman told them to follow the rules and if he had to come back he would arrest them. The police van then retired to it's original position, 500 yards away. The drunks muttered and shouted, then they each moved apart by about 6 feet creating a socially correct distancing group. The police looked over, 2 is the max in public, the police let it go. How the police apply the rules makes a very big difference. Let's try not to write Britain's democracy off just yet. It has survived much worse than this."
2020-03-30 21:00,"It's no secret that autocrats exploit the public's fear during crises to push through agendas that sacrifice freedom for  ""security.""  The silver lining is with less distractions and higher stakes, Americans will pay closer attention to Trump and his admin's machinations. The fire hose of daily scandals and schemes have become white noise in the background. My hope is we take this time to collectively hit the reset button, wake up, and take action."
2020-03-30 21:09,"The test will be if the powers are rescinded when the worst of this crisis is over.

I am not optimistic about Hungary, Orban has been on this trajectory for a long time.

But even here much of the USA Patriot Act is still intact, even though it has to be periodically re-authorized by Congress. 

As the article suggests, it is hard to claw back extraordinary powers."
2020-03-30 21:29,"Where I live, the legal provsions and amendments enacted in light of the COVID crisis do have a sunset clause, set to expire in a year but under regular review. I expect this to also apply to the further restrictions on gatherings (expected to be limited from ten to to people in one place) likely enacted within a few days. Our prime minister enjoys wide political and popular support for her handling of this situation, but I did hear the leader of the opposition reply to a reporter last week that while near-perfect unity is seen on the surface, things may not be so simple behind closed doors. He probably realised that this is not the time for the usual bickering and posturing, and I commend him for that."

Through conversations with family and friends, mostly opposed to his government, most Chileans approve of the measures being taken to try to stop the coronavirus from spreading wildly as it is happening in the US.  Critical times require critical measures!"
2020-03-30 21:45,"Any laws that are passed in the time of crisis should always contain a sunset clause and a specific end date. Orban – like Putin – has been moving rapidly toward a ""real dictatorship"" as soon as he was elected. And the first thing authoritarian bent/autocratic rulers do – like Donald Trump for instance – is attack journalists and the free press. Then they work to discredit and impugn their critics, especially those within the established government and in related fields designed to create checks and balances on those in power. It is shocking and sobering to see how much that was already happening even before this global viral and economic pandemic struck.
(Go read ""Fascisim:A Warning"" by Madeleine Albright and ""How Democracies Die"" by Harvard professors Levitsky and Ziblatt. Fortunately they also point a pathway toward redemption and light.) Thank you for this reporting. It is a warning and also a call for everyone who values liberty to insist limits of authority.

Tyrants have nothing but the power of the police and military to back their treasonous actions, and if we cede moral authority to those bodies, they will certainly use it against us. ""Law and Order"" cares not what it defends; they see it, in a naked power grab, as an end in itself. Ninety-five percent of gun owners, I'd wager, would turn them over voluntarily rather than fight if the government demanded they do so in the name of ""keeping us safe.""

You give him an outlet and make it harder to contain his irrational, narcissist behavior. Sometimes, as a journalist, you have to act in the benefit of what is right, not about what sells.

Our serial liar in chief would love an excuse to postpone the November elections. The time to act is now. Not only with medical and economic measures.

So, if government is doing right by us, this might make sense. It can use it to protect us. However, under our current Republican overlords,it's way too much power for my comfort. They seem to think that killing off old folks is a solution to the Social Security issues and deficit spending and otherwise stealing from ordinary citizens. 

I would only feel slightly better under a Democratic administration, to be honest. If there were some way to squeeze most of the corruption out of the system, that would help. Maybe stripping all assets that could create a conflict of interest from office-holders while they are in office would help.

Pettiness, politics, and anything less than solid planning, action, and follow through has no place.

Equally important, this could help balance his reactive followers with alleviating their anger expressed towards helpful individuals like Dr. Fauci. This contingency needs to and will respond well to an admission of misunderstanding. It is a pretty light load to bear. We all make mistakes, and he did in a few areas.  Simply taking full responsibility for his part, apologize, and then we get to work. We need to be operating and doing up our parts in the global economy ASAP.  

There is a way to engage with a work force of persons who are already well from the covid19 exposure as well as persons w/o exposure risks to others.  This economic DEEP FREEZE will destroy our shared basis of commerce we all depend on.

These measures will DELAY infections, giving us extra time to build out surge capacity in the healthcare system. They won't magically end the pandemic. Many folks are using #stayhomesavelines & showing enthusiastic support for government restrictions. Perhaps CCP propaganda helped convince people that this is the best path. Over 2 months we watched scenes of China's authoritarian lockdown followed by celebrations claiming triumph over the ""demon virus."" I just want everyone to understand that a lockdown isn't a panacea. By ""flattening the curve"" we extend the pandemic timeframe to reach herd immunity. This is a marathon, not a sprint. We need to find a balance between the restrictions that delay infections while we grow our healthcare capacity, & the freedoms that make the lives we save worth living."

Only comparative crumbs were reserved for individuals and small businesses -- desperately needed crumbs, to be sure, but far, far less than what is required. What happened with TARP 12 years ago was a mere dress rehersal -- this bill utterly dwarfs TARP and literally gives the banks and big business, with not even token oversight, the means to swamp their smaller competition and consolidate their economic and political power to an unprecedented and previously unimagined degree.  It is undisguised legalized robbery -- the Fed has already hired BlackRock to manage the bailout, even though it will also be allowed to participate in it -- and a total capitulation of democratic values to the demands of the one per cent, who already effectively ruled this country.

What do the think the chances are that the USA will invoke some of these draconian measures as the trumpvirus keeps spreading like wildfire?

We faced a challenge that threatened democracy around the world. We should have done as Bolivia did and postpone elections to negate the threat. But it's too late now. 

We would have had to postpone our 2016 elections to avoid the real threat to our nation and the world - donald j trump."
2020-03-31 14:00,"Include Trump in this.  Calling himself a ""wartime president"" (yet refusing to use powers to actually address the coronavirus pandemic and save lives), he is testing the waters to shut down campaigning, dissent, free press and ultimately the November election. Wouldn't put it past him to declare martial law and have the National Guard or military intimidate people from coming to polls (having blocked widespread mail-in voting) & enforce 6-foot separation so that lines that take four hours already will be impossibly long. Trump, crowing that the $2.2 trillion CARES “relief” act (slush fund) was able to keep out Democrats’ call for spending for national mail-in voting, said “The things they had in there were crazy. They had levels of voting that if you ever agreed to it you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” Attorney General William Barr already sought to suppress habeus corpus, which would allow someone to be incarcerated indefinitely without being charged - something the Supreme Court did not even allow Lincoln to do during the Civil War. They have already used the pandemic to halt the many court cases against Trump and his administration."

But when the Senate majority leader refuses to allow consideration of legislation passed by the House unless the President first gives permission, and when a Supreme Court justice accuses the Court of putting its thumb on the scale in favor of the President, how much confidence can we have that checks and balances will really work?

The President's own behavior does not instill that confidence. Not only does he say that he can do anything he wants, but he indulges his every whim on a day to day basis.

2020-03-31 15:07,"Reading what is happening to rights across the globe is an eye opener. Thanks for such a comprehensive article.

We have two things that make us different from other nations, The Constitution that defines our rights and liberties, and a nation of people who are not afraid to demand their rights specifically through lawsuits. What in normal times might seem like we are an overly lawsuit seeking society, after the pandemic ends this might become the chief route to regain our rights. As a member of the legal profession (I am a paralegal) I do a lot of reading and Googling on these topics. There is an undercurrent of legal anger among us AND the general population. What we all must do is not cave in to negativity, to believing we can't do anything to right the situation after the pandemic. Remember, African Americans never gave up and are not giving up on demanding their civil rights, we must follow adopt that attitude if our President decides he wants to become a dictator!"

I also suspect that government will insist on growing itself in the name of 'protecting the people.'  However, from where I sit, it appears that the House is currently working to take this opportunity to expand their desires for the country.  The pork in the bill made that obvious.  

We need our government to get back on track.  Their role to the public is to provide services the private sector will not or can not.  Our effective safety and security (police, fire, EMT, military defense, basic healthcare), effective education k-12 (public), regulations that monitor and disable monopolies and actions/service/products that may cause harm from private enterprise, national parks, mail, libraries, and a number of other publicly available programs written into law (social security, Medicare, Medicaid for temporary assistance to the poor and disabled).   

Seems we've veered far from that role.  We are a Republic, not a democracy.  That used to be a strength.  We must have any law implemented today to protect the security, safety, and health in the face of this pandemic be temporary.  Including pork."

Perhaps other autocrats will follow his perfect lead."

Europe has taught that high mobility is the #1 factor in favor of the virus and high mortality rate; High mortality not only due to the limited capacity to test the spread of an exceptionally contagious virus, but also due to the fact that allowing the virus to spread has overwhelmed the healthcare system causing unnecessary casualties.
The natural response of Cuomo will be to blame Trump, and that will be the biggest mistake.
I just hope other states in US implement the 14 days mandatory quarantine for people coming from hot spots like NYC, otherwise any effort to contain the virus will be useless resulting in greater human lives loss and greater damage to the economy"
2020-03-30 10:41,"Gov. Inslee and Mayor Durkan in Washington State have been the first to feel the effects of this scourge. And they took steps to blunt its impact based on advice by medical professionals. As a result they are seeing a slight ""bending"" in the curve.

While this is good news, Gov. Inslee correctly notes that the state is not “within 1,000 miles of declaring victory.”

On the other hand we have a POTUS, who is so fixated on his approval numbers and stock market's indices, that he wants to get people back to work by Easter. 

If that is not bad enough, he has high approval ratings for handling this crisis from his base, many of whom still believe that it is a Chinese or a Democratic hoax being thrust upon the POTUS.

Go figure that one out!

2020-03-30 11:27,"Actually Inslee was asleep at the wheel.
Incredibly he didn’t even order a state wide school closure until two weeks ago. The state death toll and the nursing home catastrophe reveals a poorly run State Board of Health even before this out break.

2020-03-30 11:35,"I'm no international epidemiologists ...but I am told that only people spread viruses once the virus has jumped from an animal. 

IF that is correct, the only sure way to slow spread of any virus, anywhere, anytime is distancing and limiting travel - in other words, all contacts that are not absolutely essential. 

This doesn't only protect people from being infected ... it makes all the difference in protecting the weaker and those essential workers, like medical staff.

Our Republican city and county government in my area, are absolutely on board with the data and science that social distancing is the only tool we have to fight with.

It has taken hundreds of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths for him to wake up.  
Please, Mr. President, step aside (a safe distance!) and let your betters analyze the facts, set the policies and communicate to our people.  So far, you have been the virus' best friend imaginable."

  The important numbers for the relevant period are 1) # of tests made; 2) # of people tested (not the same); 3) # of positives; 4) # of positives who were symptomatic at time of tests.  Other numbers matter but these are the central ones.  Oh, and # of medical personnel tested per day.  Report trends.  The rest of the article is unrelated to the critical question: when will the number of infected decline?"

2020-03-30 13:24,"Social distancing does not explain why Seattle had the first cases in the nation but has not seen the same explosion as NYC.

There are other factors at play here that we won't understand for months or years, until the data is crunched on demographics, pre-existing conditions, weather, etc.

It's hard not to imagine that the particularly dense urban environment of NYC did not contribute to the explosion of the virus there.  It is by far the most densely populated city in the U.S. Seattle and most other U.S cities are really just big suburbs in comparison."
2020-03-30 13:51,"How can we know the downward trend is not due to seasonality? While we do not know that COVID-19 is a seasonal virus, we also cannot say it is not. We can only hope. 

And if it is seasonal, be prepared for endless arguments regarding whether or not the measures taken to slow the spread were effective and whether they should be repeated in the future."
2020-03-30 13:58,"Also, the hospitals near where I live in the Seattle area are in fact overwhelmed and running low on supplies. Local residents and businesses are donating supplies, meals, and money to help them  Some businesses have shifted to mask production, and distilleries have shifted production to hand sanitizer. These are all the voluntary actions of the people who live here and have decided to take matters into their own hands."
2020-03-30 14:01,I’m surprised to find that more is not made of the distribution of our population vs. NY. We are a largely single occupancy vehicle commuter town and off the cuff I would conservatively estimate at least half of our residence live in single family structures.  Compared to the NY subway and urban density these two cities are apples and oranges when it comes to transmission vectors.
2020-03-30 14:07,"Good information.  Thank you.  I have a question on word choice.  I am not a Donald Trump fan, but why is the president ""backing down"" on the social distancing  end date rather than the more neutral (and to my way of thinking professional) term ""revising.""  We are all looking at better data from day to day and reassessing decisions.  We are all hopeful about returning to normalcy.  We know our president is not a word-smith.  The reason many of us are skeptical about mainstream news coverage - is this sense of agenda on the part of news outlets - rather than reporting.  A big part of that is this subtle, powerful choice of words.  We need to be able to rely on reporting that does not have an agenda beyond reporting the best and most timely information available."
2020-03-30 14:09,"A footnote to this excellent article: I live with my 55 year old son, in Washington, on the North shore of the Columbia River. He has asthma. He is an electrician for a company based in Washington where Governor Inslee has decreed only essential construction projects may continue. We are grateful for Governor Inslee's leadership and courage in shutting down all non-essential construction projects, but he has apparently forgotten that Portland, Oregon is the largest urban center near Southern Washington residents where most people commute to work in Portland. Governor Brown's leadership from Salem, Oregon is more timid. According to her, all construction is essential. So my son's Washington based company continues to send electricians to Portland, Oregon to work on a large new apartment building in situations where it is impossible to maintain social distancing. While Governor Inslee is doing the right thing and saving lives, Governor Brown is not. It is frightening."
2020-03-30 14:27,"The information in this article is good news and important data. It disseminates what we can add to our knowledge of how to deal with this virus. I fear that people in my state, Ohio, will not listen to our public health authorities and will continue to hoard supplies and food. As a physician, I look for any and all data on this new virus that I can find. I have lost patients to this infection and I have seen people recover. I am in the steepest learning curve since my first year of medical school. These are difficult times when we all need to heed what we NEED to hear and not just what we WANT to hear. Our State Public Health Commissioner Amy Acton MD has been outstanding along with our Governor Mike DeWine but every person in this country has to be vigilant and look out for the most vulnerable. This is a time to think of the entire state, country and work as our human family."
2020-03-30 14:36,"These are all excellent points.

The epidemiological models coming out however are only as good as the data going in. We have an uneven patchwork of local, county, state officials posting numbers that are incomplete and not in a standardized format that includes age, sex, location, underlying conditions, etc. This will make these models tentative at best.

Our testing capacity is also still in the basement. I just got an email yesterday from my physician that their (large) clinic cannot test me even if I AM symptomatic. This is the case throughout the country. 

About 7/10 Americans are in favor of universal healthcare. This pandemic has certainly shown that we desperately need a uniform, organized, equal access system for all. Health experts in the federal government working with colleagues at medical and other research centers are uniquely positioned to plan ahead for epidemics and other contingencies such as this. We can no longer allow good science to be thwarted by companies that place profit over the well being and lives of those in our society."
2020-03-30 14:43,"It is good news to learn that the transmissions per person might be down.  That news may be premature because the data available is still fairly small in spite of increased testing in King County.  Testing at UW hospital has been in the range of 2500 per day for three of the last four days, but dropped to 1500 yesterday.  For such small samples in King County, pop. 2 million, the range of uncertainty in the transmissions per person is large.  When the uncertainty in the data is factored in, it is not clear how much the transmission per has declined, if it has declined at all.  The percentage of tests returned positive to UW Hospital has been 9.5, 11.7,15.0,and 13.3 over the last four days, with the 13.3% on about half of the samples of the prior 3 days.  These numbers are not indicative of a decline, other than a decline in testing.  If testing is reduced because of fewer identified subjects to test, that would be good news.  The transmission numbers are in the right direction, which is good news, but we need two or three more days of data to confirm that there is indeed a trend.  The testing data needs to be complete enough to show the number of new cases traceable to a prior case.  But there are not enough tests to identify a substantial portion of existing cases yet.  The best advice is to continue hunkering down until the virus has conclusively been checked."
2020-03-30 14:51,"Seattle has been lucky. The infection has been spreading quietly in both Washington State as well as NY and CA since January. But Seattle was the first to act. Local companies like Amazon and Microsoft started working from home around March 4th, a good 10 days before NY. 

The reason for this is that one of the first places that was hit was the nursing home in Kirkland, which led to the first dozen or so deaths in the US. This vulnerable community showed the presence of the virus clearly and unambiguously, triggering a response. Local business and administrators acted immediately. 

In a sense, Seattle was lucky that the nursing home served as a canary in a coal mine. It caused us to start taking the virus seriously well before others did and gave us a headstart.  States that still have time to act should take note."
2020-03-30 14:59,"As much as this seems to be good news, I would like to see more analysis regarding the testing sample size. From the reporting here and elsewhere it is not clear to me that enough random people are tested to know how many folks are not showing symptoms  yet have the virus. What percentage of the total population needs to be tested to fine tune our growth rate analysis (or perhaps I am wrong and we now have accurate numbers)
That said keep up the great reporting, and keep the visibility on the governmental and private section actions and result of those actions. As always, a free press is a vital element to our health, culture, and survival."
2020-03-30 15:02,"There's only one answer here. Keep the restrictions in place and be willing to strengthen them if necessary. 

Some experts have floated the idea of using widespread surveillance and testing of individuals (as China had done and continues to do) as an option to a complete shutdown. But we do not, nor, realistically are we going to develop, this capability. Full stop.

We either maintain these lockdowns (and based on everything I've read they will really need to stay in place through the end of May, at a minimum), or we are going to be looking at a catastrophe the likes of which the vast majority of us cannot even imagine."
2020-03-30 15:07,"Wishing well to all those on the East coast!  As a Seattle resident, I have to say that this article is too soft on the local WA state government and Seattle leadership.  Keep in mind (with full hindsight) that the Puget Sound region had the FIRST COVID 19 case in the US, in late January, and Gov Inslee did not order any real ""stay home"" order until March 25th, 2 months later!  Seattle schools were resistant to closure initially, and the WA government chose to delay issuing any real stay-home order until weeks after other states.  Italy issued pleas to other countries to take drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus in early March, but no on really listened.  Face it, the virus will spread to every city and town in the US.  No ""Locals Only"" signs will stop it.  Delaying proactive measures will only prolong this pandemic.  Note to other states and cities: do NOT wait until it's too late.  Take measures at least 3 weeks before you think you should.  Learn from Italy and Seattle."
2020-03-30 15:09,"Living just south of Seattle, in Portland metro, we followed many of the same recommendations of Seattle - a little later by a week perhaps - but from initial reports from several front line doctors we know, there seems to have been a significant flattening of the curve and a reduction in the expected rise and peak of transmissions at the hospitals where they work - yea! 

The point is that it is better to be over cautious and view this stay in place - and the data seems to be supporting that.  

Unfortunately not all states are taking it seriously and believe science can be trumped by belief or sheer will power of not wanting to catch it.  From the preliminary transmission tracking data that appears not to be a strategy worth following.   

We view this hibernation a little like the time between Thanksgiving and New Years (without all the shopping madness) where we hold up as a family and spend time cooking, exercising, watching movies, and completing items on the long list of house chores!  We have not been out in two weeks since our initial food purchase and since we have an earthquake preparedness kit - we are self sufficient for another two months."
2020-03-30 15:10,"This article is a good summary, but there are additional factors that may explain the slowdown here. The University of Washington has a top-ranked medical school which has attracted world-class researchers. The governor and the mayor paid attention when these experts told them of the coming storm. Also, there is a culture here of civic responsibility. The natives line up automatically at events and don't jaywalk.  If the authorities tell us to wash our hands and stay six feet apart, the vast majority will do it. But it's also true, as others have pointed out, that Seattle is has less density compared to NYC. Some of our local politicians have labeled single-family homes as ""evil,"" but in this case, they may be saving lives."
2020-03-30 15:13,"I live in a university community. I am cautiously optimistic that our community is taking the right measures, but there was a hiccup at the beginning. When we had a single case that was connected to a traveler returning from Beijing who went from our local airport to the hospital, we instituted traveler screening at that time and just sat and waited for community spread. Feb. 5, the date the first case was isolated and travel screening started was marked as if it really had any scientific basis. We did not even suspect infected travelers who did not report to the hospital existed. This was a bizarre way of looking at our first case. Our public officials thought we were just lucky that the first case self-identified and showed up to be tested. I worried then, and have been proven correct, that case was just a single data point in the disease coming into our community. It was smoke indicating a fire was starting. We are a college town. These cases were coming to our city for weeks before the first case self-identified and travel screening was implemented. I think our community was ready for social distancing on March 4, just like Washington, but we held off naively. Watchful waiting. When we look at this in retrospect, we need to educate health officials about not promoting magical thinking. Be a little skeptical."
2020-03-30 15:14,"That is good if Seattle is starting to see a slowdown in the number of  coronavirus cases. 

If that is so, Boeing should now use its vast and capable engineering and manufacturing resources in the Seattle area to produce much-needed ventilators. 

Obviously ventilators are much different than commercial airplanes, but both are highly technical devices that must be designed and built to exacting specifications. 

Boeing is asking for a multi-billion dollar bailout. 

Perhaps they could make ventilators as partial payment for the bailout. 

Of course it isn’t a simple matter of pushing a button after which ventilators emerge, but Boeing has great potential, which should now be utilized to the max, not the 737 MAX."

When the Dem governor of Ky ordered a lockdown last week the cases in that state and the neighbouring state of Tn, where the GOP governor refused to do so (and still hasn’t), were roughly the same.

Now Tn as of this writing has 1387 cases and Ky 439.

2020-03-30 14:00,"Like Paul from California, I am concerned that there has been so little published about the demographics of those who fall severely ill and/or die. Has there been no research? Or has it been suppressed? It would not be difficult to do the research. Almost all the dead (let’s start with them) died in a hospital. Contagious disease reports are sent to health departments. It would be trivial to require the hospitals and health departments to report the basic demographics of the dead to a central database. Age, sex, underlying conditions, typed of residence, etc. Any grad student in public health could design this, and the computer power to analyze the basics is resident on a home computer. PS I used to work in hospital management. 

Suppose we remove all the nursing home residents, multiple immunosuppressant, morbidly obese, COPD, and a few other “walking dead” conditions from the data. How many deaths now, who are they, and what treatments did not work? That’s how we save people who are most likely to be saved. Darwinian reality and not PC, but it appears that most who died were already living on borrowed time. The good news is who has not died in droves. Most cancer, HIV, RA, etc patients who have been on immunosuppressants for years. And a few nursing home residents have come back from the brink. 

The NYT would do a great service if it would pursue and publish the demographics, and determine why this has not been done already."
2020-03-30 14:10,"As a WA state resident for 50 years. 40 in Puget Sound area I can honestly say I’ve never heard of the “Seattle Freeze”. Anyway I’m proud to be in WA and proud of Jay Inslee. Whom, as you recall was called a “snake” by Trump.  I watch our numbers daily and I live in Spokane now as far from Seattle as you can get and we are now seeing our numbers rise quickly. Since we have been practicing pretty strict distancing I’m hoping that in another week our curve will also start to bend."
2020-03-30 14:19,"The official numbers of infected people in Washington State does not reflect the reality on the ground.  They never did.

They are skewed towards the people who met whatever overly stringent requirements to get tested.  The reality is people with coronavirus are  being turned away even as labs capacity expands.  For example, someone with coronavirus was turned away multiple times because she had a temperature of 100 instead of 100.4

2020-03-30 14:09,"Washington and California have had some success in flattening the curve, because their leaders took this seriously from the beginnings.  But now - even now! - the Federal “guidelines” put forth by Trump are grossly inadequate.

We should not be gathering in groups of ten.

Social distancing should me mandatory, not “recommended”.

Aggressive, competent action in the earliest days could have saved tens of thousands of American lives.  We’re well past that now.  It will take months more of these measures to give us a chance to return to some semblance of normal life."
2020-03-30 14:07,"Note that data from China and South Korea indicates that death number lags new cases number by around 2 weeks. By just making statement that death number is still rising without elaborating, this will unnecessarily cause anxiety among people who do not understand this lagging effect. The data in the last few days shows that US is about to flattening out.  Please don't give the conservative group and President Trump more reasons to claim that most media is trying to hype this coronavirus issue"
2020-03-30 15:01,"As someone who lives in Seattle, this makes sense. Seattlelites were already good at avoiding each other before the pandemic so we just made the Seattle Freeze official policy."
2020-03-30 15:17,"I'm skeptical. I've included below a official link to a nice source of information from the country in which Seattle is located. Here in Seattle we have done no randomized testing pr spot checks, so we have no real-time idea as to who has the virus now or where they are. We are, as far as I can tell, only testing people who already have serious symptoms. Either that or the virus is far more deadly than we think. The death rate in our county is presently 6.5 percent, and the death rate for my zip code is presently. Finally there are significant sources of contagion that have yet to be addressed. For example, the state has permitted manufacturing and other businesses in the region to pretty much determine for themselves whether or not they are an essential business. Consequently, a whole lot of businesses representing tens if not hundreds of thousands of workers are still conducting business as usual, and compelling their employees to continue working at penalty of losing their jobs. (Yep, we know for a fact that some if not most of those businesses are run or managed by pro-Trump Republicans.) We know firsthand that frontline medical workers here, even those working with at-risk populations, don't have the equipment they need, even just masks.

2020-03-30 13:19,It was the big employers in tech that really were ahead of this and asked their employees to stay at home.
2020-03-30 13:26,"It's very hard to calculate an R0 without knowing the actual number of people who have the disease, which we still do not know. There are several reasons: first, we have not been doing enough testing, and we are not testing mild or asymptomatic people; second, we don't actually know the false negative rate of the test, because we don't have a true denominator of who is carrying (no antibody test which we could carry out after negative or positive swabs); and third, we are actually telling people to *not* try to get tested and to stay home unless they're very sick. If our actual number of cases is much higher, and testing rate has gone up finding more of them, R0 might be negative. It is almost certainly not higher."
2020-03-30 14:10,"I'm glad scientists are in charge in Washington, all up and down the West coast for that matter. It would be interesting to see how it plays out in Texas and Florida whose governors rather practice politics than science. I think situation will soon reverse and the south will be in flame while the fire in the science respecting states subsides."
2020-03-30 14:22,"There is evidence that the virus is slowing in the United States as well as across the globe.  In the US, recoveries are overtaking deaths attributed to the virus.  The incidence of ""confirmed cases"" has reached an inflection point.

But, these same data remain consistent with the following hypothesis: The virus has already dispersed itself across the general population.  Local governments may take credit for evidence that the effects of the virus are showing signs of abating, but that may amount to taking credit where no credit is due.

Right now governments around the world are pursuing different strategies.  For example, Sweden and Japan have been pursuing more relaxed strategies.  It may very well be the case that all strategies yield the same results -- because the idea that the virus can be contained may be deeply flawed.  The virus may already be out there.   Even if it were not, it may still be impossible to contain.

Think about it.  The US may be spending $2.2 trillion to do little more than track a bad cold virus.  It would be great if we could spend a mere $10 million to randomly sample 10,000 New Yorkers and screen them for *antibodies*.  We may find that 40% or more of them have already had the virus."
2020-03-30 13:49,"Could just be the virus is acting like the flu, and tapering off as the seasons change."
2020-03-30 13:19,"As long as we don't listen to Trump, most of us will get thru this. The most important factors are accurate information and adequate supplies. As evidenced by the last three months, Trump WILL NOT say the truth if it's opposed to his personal interests. Even worse,  his administration's ability to deal with the crisis has been abysmal.

We're short the most fundamental equipment nationwide and the message from the white house has been ""every state for itself"". Instead of a cohesive approach like 9/11, Trump argues with reporters claiming his statements recorded on video never happened.

In Trump's mind, those statements didn't happened which further demonstrates the delusions he's under. For the sake of the nation and millions of people who don't have to die, I implore the congress to impeach him."
2020-03-30 14:14,Thank you Jay Inslee for having the foresight and guts to take decisive and early action that appears to be putting a dent in the numbers.  Thank you for giving is hope. Thank you UW and all your researchers and medical efforts.  You are a world class organization under the amazing leadership of Ana Mari Cauce. Thank you Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer and other corporate leaders who have given millions to help the community. But the biggest thanks of all goes to the people of Washington who have sacrificed so much for the good of the whole.
2020-03-30 14:29,"Fewer new cases in NY on Sunday than Saturday or Friday (even as tests rise?).  Makes sense that rising fatalities would lag a week or two behind the cases rising, but keep an eye on those new cases."
2020-03-30 13:11,The only reason it looks like numbers might be decreasing is LACK OF TESTING!!! Until most people are tested we will not know the real situation. The US is way behind all advanced countries in testing. We will see a million confirmed cases in the US soon but that will be the tip of the iceberg.
2020-03-30 14:43,To make up for the poor health management and inadequate preventive measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak what is left is only imposition of restrictions like lock downs-a poor consolation for the slowdown in infection cases.
2020-03-30 15:38,"The people in Seattle are a lot smarter than the people in rural Virginia where I live, who still think everything is fine and watch Fox News and nothing else.  I was invited to a dinner party yesterday which was declined."

The death rate (as a proportion of positive test results) in our county is presently 6.5 percent. As we know, most of the transmissions are caused by folks who have been infected but are still virtually symptomless. Finally there are significant sources of contagion that have yet to be addressed. For example, the state has permitted manufacturing and other businesses in the region to pretty much determine for themselves whether or not they are an essential business. Consequently, a whole lot of businesses representing tens if not hundreds of thousands of workers are still conducting business as usual, and forcing their employees to continue working at penalty of losing their jobs and benefits. (Yep, some if not most of those businesses are owned or run by pro-Trump Republicans who are toeing the virus denial line.) We need mandatory closures and explicit guarantees of jobs and income. Moreover, we know firsthand that frontline medical workers here, even those working with at-risk populations, don't have the equipment they need, even just masks.

2020-03-30 15:30,I live 60 miles south of Seattle straight down I-5. Our county nearly mimicked Seattle. My sense is the physical distancing is working. I know hundreds of people in this county and I know nobody who has the virus. But it’s here and cases are increasing. Staying home is a total drag for everybody. But that’s what we must do. And I’d guess until summer.
2020-03-30 16:33,We are in Seattle and have lost track of how long we have been inside. Our son-in-law’s grandfather is in hospice (north of Seattle) and the virus has spread in the home. Granddad has tested positive but as of today he has no symptoms. Yet. He was tested over a week ago. My husband and I take a good walk everyday but stay way way away from everyone else.
2020-03-30 16:39,"Local and state health officials raised public awareness as soon as the first case of community spread was detected. Prompt action is critical as is patience. I live near Everett and people are staying the course. 

There was a six week gap between the first travel-related case in Everett (just up the street) and the first case of community spread. This gave the virus time to circulate in the community. Any public official who thinks their community will be spared is literally whistling past the graveyard.

News about the deaths in Kirkland was personally shocking. 93% of deaths were people over age 60 and 54% of deaths were people over age 80. That's a call to action and people responded.

My own tracking shows Washington State's positivity rate is rising slightly, so there is more work to be done. We need surveillance testing, but test capacity and supplies are only sufficient for diagnostic tests. Without community-wide epidemiological studies we're rolling dice in the dark."
2020-03-30 16:58,"There are now published accounts where entire small subpopulations have (mostly) been tested.  I'm thinking of the Kirkland, WA Life Care Center data in last week's NEJM, Diamond Princess testing, some NBA teams, etc. If these were systematically tabled, then we could see rates of infection, rates of asymptomatic infection (% who later had symptoms), etc., at least in these special population subsets (and assuming that testing is 100% reliable)."
2020-03-30 17:07,"Here in rural eastern WA, social distancing is essentially voluntary except that bars are closed and restaurants too except for take out.  Other businesses seem to be able to decide they're essential, and many people are still going to work.  But everyone has changed their behavior and is trying to be careful.  It's unfortunate that there's a shortage of N95s because many, especially older folks, would wear them, I think, if they were available and hospitals weren't short of them.  We have a lot of advantages relative to the cities, including advanced warning, so I hope it's enough to at least avoid overwhelming the hospitals."
2020-03-30 17:38,"Happy to see that social distancing is working. I downloaded the Disease Modeling Institute's chart when they first published it locally on Match 10, and I have been comparing the numbers on a daily basis with those projections. The Institute's chart says that with ""25% contact reduction"" (as compared to their ""no behavior change"" baseline) the two counties - King and Snohomish - which were the epicenter in Feb and early March, should be showing about 4000 cases by today, March 30th.
That's 1/2 of the projected 8000 of the ""no behavior change"" baseline.
That's good progress but it still indicates only ""25% contact reduction"" according to the chart.
So I agree with the Governor, Seattle Mayor Durkin, and the healthcare professionals that we still need to do much more.
We need to get to that 50% contact reduction line or even the 75% line if possible.
I agree with  @robert here that too many people are still working. If you read the ""essential businesses"" exemption list published when Gov Inslee announced the voluntary shutdown, you can see that over a hundred types of businesses are listed on it.
I drive Uber/Lyft fulltime and am 60 years old. Everyone in my house is over 60 and we unanimously agreed that it was too risky for me to keep driving. I stopped working over a week ago. I would never be able to forgive myself if I was the cause of one of my housemates dying from the virus.
I am applying for the extended UI benefits but there's no guarantee they'll approve me."
2020-03-30 16:57,"Just note that there's been no plan presented about how to get out of this mass shutdown.  It was easy and quick to order it, but they've made no mention of how to end it.  Are they going to lock us up and destroy so many lives until a vaccine is ready in a year or more, if ever?"
2020-03-30 16:55,"I just read a story of a church choir that decided to do the opposite of distancing and be together to practice - in Skagit county near Seattle. Everyone seemed healthy, but within a couple of weeks many were sick and one person may have died. Many are old people in a high risk category. 

Distancing not only works, but it helps keep the rest of us safer as well."
2020-03-30 18:02,"This article is way too soft and doesn’t give the rest of the country the reality of the situation. It makes it sound like swift action was taken and those of us that live here know that’s not true. 
We had no orders to stay home until AFTER CA & NY issued theirs. We should have been the first to implement one. It could’ve saved many lived.

In addition, the fact that Governor Inslee has revised the orders many times now to include/exclude various workers hasn’t helped either. It’s confused people and some think the new orders apply to them, when in reality they don’t. The Real Estate industry is a prime example. First they were ordered to cease, then after they heavily lobbied the governors office, they were back in business a couple of days later but with some restrictions (which are not being followed by all). Some industries tied to real estate (stagers, photographers, etc) now think they can work too.

Governor Inslee has not handled this well at all, from the very beginning, and is just making matters worse.
People need to stay at home, unless they’re an essential worker. Period. That’s the only way this will be curbed.

To the Governor’s of all other States, please learn from Inslee’s mistakes."
2020-03-30 14:08,"So, in looking at the Washington State charts ... they are testing many fewer people in the last few days, really a considerable drop-off in tests performed ... if you don't test, you can't identify the cases which can provide a false sense of security, especially when the media trumpets that the spread is slowing down. 

Want to know for sure? Test everyone! And then test them again!

But our Governor Inslee has proven his leadership credentials are well-deserved. Walking in our suburban neighborhood you see lots of folks who normally might be at work, yet here they are, even on a rainy day, getting some exercise, staying in the proper social distancing posture, and following the rigid requirements put forth by our State and local officials. We’re not there yet, but we’ll continue the fight together to see light at the tunnel’s end. Hopefully sooner rather than later."
2020-03-30 19:06,"Also, I must express my extreme appreciation and upmost gratitude to Governor Inslee and Mayor Durkan.  Without their incomparable Leadership, this Situation would be exponentially worsened. I am a very frequent Visitor to Seattle.  Natives to the City have no idea of just how Lucky they really are, to live there. 
Not only the incomparable natural beauty, but a science and reality-based community.  Yes, I’m jealous. But I admit it.

Search the phrase ""Doctors call for a delay on the deployment of 5G due to health risks"" to learn more."
2020-03-30 22:02,"The sign at the top of the article says all there needs to be said:  STAY HOME!  

BC is also seeing a flattening of the curve due to the early mandate to stay home. 

This is crucial for the hospitals to not turn into war zones in full crisis mode. If people stay home the hospitals will be able to treat all the patients who need the care - there will be beds available and doctors and nurses’ lives will also be spared. 

So, please, stay home!"
2020-03-30 22:53,"WA state acted too slow. The first North America case was reported Jan. 21, 2020 right here in WA when a man who had traveled back from Wuhan, China was diagnosed with Covid-19 and stayed at a hospital in Snohomish County, WA.  He had traveled on an airport coach from Sea-Tac airport on Jan. 15 with ~15 other passengers and he did not have symptoms then; fortunately he recovered.  However, community spread was already happening in February. Asymptomatic carriers had probably unknowingly spread the disease, whether it was due to the first North American case we still don't know for sure. WA state then had its first Covid-19 deaths on Feb. 28, 2020. Gov. Inslee used the word 'contemplating' when asked about taking more drastic measures when interviewed by Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation on Mar. 8, 2020. He did not order stay-home until Mar. 23, 2020 (a lengthy delay). That is not decisive leadership.  This article is TOO SOFT.  The world is dealing with a very stealth-like virus. I have friends and family in Hong Kong, another place where indecisive leadership (in the form of Carrie Lam) coupled with half-baked measures around social distancing (many bordering on scary or asinine) will only result in more cases/deaths. ""If only we had known, had we done this"" phrase might be heard less if other countries still in a position to CONTAIN the virus act immediately and swiftly and not commit the same missteps as us here in WA state."

2020-03-31 3:18,"I'm very heartened to hear this, but I remain worried that part of our ""success"" is illusory.  The fact is that nobody -- Seattle included -- has enough testing capability to know the extent to which the virus has spread.   Thank goodness for Governor Inslee, at least."
2020-03-31 2:58,"If we’re committed to fighting COVID-19 with data and science, this is the most important study and demands that we change our strategy. Given the devastating impact of COVID-19 on Seattle and the city’s highly educated residents, this study shows that social distance is not enough to “bend the curve.” With social distancing, the best we can do in the most educated and highly motivated city is 1.4. This means that even with social distancing, the number of people with COVID-19 will continue to grow and double every 4 to 8 days.

With this, we MUST think about making additional and aggressive interventions to drive down the R0 (R-Naught) value below 1. This may include housing COVID-19 positive people in supervised quarantine (as simple as hotel rooms or cots in convention centers), wide-spread testing and contact tracing so that people who have the virus are identified before they can infect other people, and more strictly monitoring the quarantine of people flying into Washington state. In both China and South Korea, studies show that R0 value fell below 1 only AFTER supervised quarantine. This saved COVID-19 spread among family members and allowed much better outcome for patients who received much effective treatment at the quarantine centers than they would have otherwise."
2020-03-30 10:51,"Great news, but an odd article. In the absence of early and effective federal guidelines in this crisis, we’ve seen how powerful state and county governments have been in telling Americans how to respond. I’d like to see spelled out not why the federal response is so important now—because obviously it is and it would have been nice to see concerted action from Washington three months ago—but why the federal government is painted more important than all other levels of power, rather than part of a complex patchwork. Also, schools, universities, and restaurants did not close because the economy tanked. They closed to prevent the spread of a virus. Talking about the economy in more nuanced ways would be helpful here, too!"

2020-03-30 10:33,"And again trump bashes the media, and it subtracts from his message.  

His messaging needs to be focused.  Saturday's potential for a metro NY quarantine (whatever that meant) is a perfect example of what he should not do.  Messages get garbled, misinterpreted, and receives criticism.  Keeping messages short and direct, avoids that.  And his commentary needs to be minimized.

trump needs t realize he needs the so called mainstream media to get the message out.  When you look at the total size of cable news viewers, Fox only gets half.  MSNBC and CNN split the remaining.  When you look at total viewers, most do not get their news on cable (not everyone has access to cable).  The ABC/CBS/NBC evening newscasts have much higher viewership even before this crisis.  Their viewership has increased the last few weeks.  They get the message out.  Local news also has focused on getting the news and messages out, working under very tough conditions.  In many areas, including metro NY, the largest television market, local news is taking precedent over covering trump's briefings that until yesterday have been light on any news.

trump's advisors need to hammer in that he needs to stay focused, and show empathy.  No press bashing because he doesn't like the question.  No diversions by blaming others.  No rehashing for self gratification.  And no discussions beyond the crisis.  Who cares about Harry & Meghan right now."
2020-03-30 10:42,"I love the use of the word 'assessment' in the subtitle ""[Trump] Starkly Reverses Earlier Assessment"" as if the president has has the ability to engage in a rational, decision-making process."

Nurses, doctors and others are putting their own lives at risk daily to help others, and they need and deserve proper protection.  That the first thing out of the President's mouth when he was advised of the need for more masks was an accusation is disgusting. How could anyone not realize that when hospitals are over filled with people afflicted with this deadly virus, the need for  mask use for safety would rise?"
2020-03-30 10:31,"Finally! At last, listening to science and reason.  Unfortunately, it is too late to avoid the worst of the contagion.  Doing this a month ago would have saved many lives.

That will end up being the tragedy visited on America by its leadership.  MAGA, indeed. Sad."
2020-03-30 10:45,"But it’s a hoax, right?  All under control. Won’t it magically disappear soon?

If you survive to vote in November, put him out. Of course he’ll probably try to suspend the election. And Mitch will be right there with him."
2020-03-30 10:34,"The reason Trump woke is because he saw video of Elmhurst Hospital (his childhood hospital). Where he saw video of body bags. The second reason a robust friend of his got Covid 19 and went into a coma. 

It’s because he finally saw something as a Narcissist he could relate too. This is all verifiable via his news conference and picked up by another news organization ABC news.  

So if Trump never saw this video or his friend hadn’t gone into a coma. We would all still be suffering. This was preventable. We have a man not competent to do the job and a country with the supplies of a third world nation. Where does our $750billion military budget go?"
2020-03-30 10:37,"When will there be an accounting? Why does the scammer-in-chief who exacerbated the virus get his name in the headlines everyday only to be promoted further so he can do even more damage.

2020-03-30 10:58,"One of the cues to either continuing or cancelling social distancing must be based on the number of cases and deaths.

As long as the number of new cases and deaths continue to rise each day, social distancing must continue. PERIOD. 

When those numbers begin to decline, then and only then, should the issue of social distancing be revisited.  

Anything else would be irresponsible and reckless.

Returning to the daily routines everyone had a comfort level with cannot be rushed.  Science and viruses do not subscribe to the same game plan we have grown accustomed to.

Right now the new norm is uncertainty."

2020-03-30 10:59,"Italy needs to shift to mass quarantining of coronavirus patients with mild symptoms instead of letting them isolate at home, according to a group of Chinese experts who traveled to the European nation to advise officials there.

Doctors in Wuhan made the same error early on in the outbreak, said Liang Zong’An, head of the respiratory department at the West China Hospital at Sichuan University. While seriously ill patients were admitted to hospitals, doctors at the time recommended that those with mild symptoms isolate themselves at home, in part to reduce the strain on Wuhan’s overburdened health care system.

Back then, it was not well understood how infectious the virus can be even in those who don’t seem very sick. But researchers now know that those with mild symptoms who are told to stay at home usually risked passing the virus to family members, as well as to others outside their homes as some still moved around freely.

2020-03-30 11:02,"If the role of the President is to lead the country during challenging times, the effect of giving a speech to the nation should be reserved and only used during extreme circumstances. In that way, individuals would realize that there must be something extremely important to announce when the President chooses to address the nation. The daily briefings riddled with mistruths, accusations against a wide group of individuals, and the inability to let anyone speak on his behalf is hurting the credibility of government.  Trump appointed a task force to deal with COVID19; he should let the task force give daily briefings. His need to be the daily director as if he were still starring in ""The Apprentice"" is an abomination and leads one to believe that he has no faith in anyone but himself to be the spokesperson for the taskforce."
2020-03-30 10:44,"It is very sad that we have absolutely NO leadership in this country, at a time when it is most needed. Anyone with a brain knows that by Easter this would not just go away.    Trump is pandering to his base,the crazy Evangelicals, using the holiest day on the Christian calendar, to reopen everything, so he could be sure to glean more votes in November.  What is even more appalling, is his demonization of health care workers saying they are stealing the life saving equipment they so desperately  need to keep themselves alive...  Mr. Trump, these poor workers are nothing like you and your family,so please stop disparaging them immediately!"
2020-03-30 10:38,"USA is at a grave disadvantage compared to every other nation in the War on COVIP-19, President Trump."
2020-03-30 10:44,"In spite of this reversal, it’s very disheartening that the president’s first impulse is still to trust his own instinct instead of turning to experts. He’s not a stupid person, and his instincts have served him well for most of his dishonest life, but no person can do the job of President alone. It’s high time he learned this, and maybe not too late to turn his life around. He could yet be the leader that the world needs, but I’m not optimistic. If prayer would help, let’s all do it. Lead us, Nancy. Please. For the good of humankind."
2020-03-30 11:06,"Good to see the Trump administration taking the prudent and necessary action of extending mitigation.

However, that was perhaps the most bizarre and disconcerting Coronavirus Task Force update so far. From Trump's rambling, blathering opening statement, to his many non-sequitur responses, to his fascination with his television ""ratings"", very odd.

A few days ago, when complaining about something governor Cuomo said, Trump referred to the governor's press conference as a ""show"". Perhaps a window into Trump's personal reality."
2020-03-30 11:07,"""...return to normal life too quickly risked allowing the virus to rage...""  Sorry, but we are already at that point evidenced by the escalating numbers and the continued march of the disease across the country.   

Until 100% testing of everyone is done instead of just those already sick and and have already infected dozens or hundreds (maybe thousands?) of others, this disease will continue to accelerate at an even higher pace and soon the U.S. will be overwhelmed by the disease.  The consequences of such an approach will mean of hundreds of thousands or even millions of severe cases and the deaths that will go along with it will be totally devastating."
2020-03-30 11:09,"It is surreal that we have a president during a public health crisis who not only prioritizes comparing the ratings of his new conferences to TV programs, but he takes the time to brag about it on Twitter.  He is child in a man's body."
2020-03-30 11:07,"We cannot say “Trump should” or “Trump needs to...” because he is not a rational actor. 

The media, however, can be rational actors, and acknowledge that he is not. By not treating him as a normal president. Reporting on his ACTIONs, not his words. 

Broadcast media should stop playing his new daily briefings live. They don’t provide information to the American people, they are only campaign rally replacements, and full of dangerous misinformation. 

Also, he LIES. This is a word understood by all. Why can’t you use the word?"
2020-03-30 11:03,"I do wonder if the numbers would still have been this bad if Trump wasn’t in office.  Is he incompetent, of course. Is he the wrong person to lead during a crisis, duh.  Does his rhetoric cause doubt in the seriousness of this virus to some, yes.  But if Hillary Clinton were President, she would be giving sober advice about sheltering in place and social distancing all the way back in late February, and statistically would have saved thousands of lives.  But... the right wing and Fox News would have been lying to the public all along and downplaying this virus because it was the opposite of what Clinton would be saying.  It would’ve been a liberal ploy to get her re-elected and religion would save white people from a Chinese virus.  Think about it.  Trump supporters are not people that are swayed by silly things like facts and science."
2020-03-30 11:04,"Trump simply could not candy coat this any longer.  I no longer watch his news conferences.  I get far more and far better information from Cuomo.  As to the masks going out the back door.....where does Trump come up with this stuff?  Unless of course the idea comes from the one question he asks himself when the information comes to his attention:  ""If I were in their shoes, what would I do?   Sell it all for a huge profit, that's what.""  As to the phone calls from governors....he doesn't funnel their calls to others.  They aren't calling him anymore. They go right to the source.  Trump is no longer relevant in the handling of this crisis.  They have figured out they can get some of what they need without Trump.  He won't stand for that very long.  He'll find a way to gum up the works.  It's like , in the crime family world, people are going to one of the other bosses instead of him.  He's collecting some horse heads to distribute, as we speak.   And as to embracing the bad data and having to change position, keep an eye on him.  This week anyone donating to his campaign will be given the winning lottery numbers.  Or he will sweep away those spring rain showers.  May flowers without the showers.  Compliments of DJT."

2020-03-30 11:11,"It is disgraceful that Trump needed to know someone personally who is likely on his deathbed to see the horror of the pandemic. With all of the  nation's scientific experts telling him the same thing and a few ideology-driven radio and TV entertainers and evangelical preachers telling him another, Trump chose the ideologues. If he needs body bags to convince him, show him more body bags.  I hope that none of the body bags contains members of Trump's family, but if they ever do, it is on him."
2020-03-30 11:09,"Meanwhile, Trump took time to brag about his TV ratings on Twitter yesterday. 

Verbatim from Trump's Twitter account at 1:48 on March 29:

“President Trump is a ratings hit. Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news, roughly the viewership of the season finale of ‘The Bachelor.’ Numbers are continuing to rise""

Do we need any more evidence that Trump is a sociopath?"
2020-03-30 10:39,His ox was gored. I guess that’s what woke him up.
2020-03-30 10:56,"Maybe if Trump kept his mouth shut a bit more often and deferred to the intelligent professional scientists in the room, the American people wouldn't have to suffer as much?"
2020-03-30 11:19,"Quite interesting times as the whole world is witness to the US transition from democracy to idiocracy - spear headed, of course, by the enlightened leadership of the GOP and its fundamental belief that no-government is good government - with the exception of needing to spend US$750 billion a year on military programs while ignoring crumbling infrastructure, health crises, education, etc."
2020-03-30 11:29,"In the end, every Trump story shares a similar ending. It's about him. He will never get beyond himself. I read my news every morning and then that's it for the day - simply will no longer allow myself to become enraged and disheartened by continually listening to, or hearing about, what this man says and the way he says it. Part of my safe at home commitment."
2020-03-30 11:19,"The good news is that he seems to have listened to the experts. The bad news is that he is still Trump - vindictive and mean spirited. To complain about desperate governors, brag about how many people are watching him on tv, and insult the brave reporters who are at risk for simply attending these briefings is beyond inappropriate. To claim that New York is lying about how many ventilators they need is an attempt to distract us from his administration’s complete failure in their preparation and response to this crisis. Television should stop carrying these press conferences. The amount of real information could be conveyed in a tweet and it would spare us from listening to the ego driven ramblings of this lying and vengeful man."
2020-03-30 11:27,It's a shame that the pandemic will not get better quickly so that Trump can lie and take credit for it.
2020-03-30 11:24,The reported experiments that said that the coronavirus could survive on cardboard only for several hours neglects to inform the reader that all cardboard contains formaldehyde. The formaldehyde is deliberately added to the waste paper and waste cardboard used to make new cardboard to sterilize it and to keep mold from growing. The formaldehyde remains in the cardboard and may be the reason that it kills the virus quickly. There is no formaldehyde in paper or clothes so you cannot say that they will also be safe after several hours. Mail that is delivered by a contagious mailman may be contagious for days same as glass or metal.
2020-03-30 11:24,"If we need to make ventilators, we can do that quickly because the labor is available. So long as we have the raw materials and supplies and technology, we should waste no time and make whatever we need right away, running at full capacity 24 hours a day. Why are we just sitting back and not making what we need? Where is the sense of urgency? 

The very least we can do is make sure the equipment and any other items needed to combat the virus are available in abundance. 

The Republicans gave us Trump. Now we are all suffering because of it. He's terrible at directing this kind of crisis because he lacks empathy."
2020-03-30 11:25,"It's possible to offer some compliments to Trump for finally listening to the experts about the dire importance of extending the social distancing guidelines, but it is discouraging and unacceptable that he continues to disparage, denigrate and bully members of the press and those governors whom he perceives as questioning his actions and pronouncements. The next month or so will see him increasingly erratic, impulsive and nasty in his daily briefings. Instead of taking the time to genuinely acknowledge the heroic efforts of the health care workers, the scientists, public health officials, grocery store and mail delivery personnel he pays lip service to their dedication while obsessed with his approval ratings. America is not particularly grateful for your leadership."
2020-03-30 11:35,"On November 3rd the VAST majority of the Electorate will deny Trump a second Term.  They won't vote for Trump because of any one issue-including Covid 19, but because of the reality that in all ways, he is unfit for the office.  The isolation and distance by the electorate will allow for reflection, consideration, and questions.  One question, am I (we) better off with or worse with Trump?  His inability to see the big picture and act on behalf of the Nation is ignored due to his naked craving for power and retribution.  His narrow focus and flawed operating system rejects reality and facts, seeking instead his own hopes and desires for himself, his powerful and wealthy handlers, and elected and confirmed officials who reject a growing and maturing nation in favor of money and a dystopian society of the right religion and ""correct"" culture.  His handling of Covid 19 is classic and consistent Trump Doctrine at it's best.  Lie, incite rather than soothe, accuse and blame, reject responsibility, and when finally cornered by the the REAL reality, collapse in a heap of resignation with a lingering smell of revenge.  Those who are yet loyal to him at the ballot box will be cancelled by the majority who knew his flaws then, and now even more so.  They will be joined by those who thought they'd try something different, the rejection of Hillary by some, and the denied Bernie voters."
2020-03-30 11:35,"I kissed my anesthesiologist husband goodbye this morning after a one week stay-cation with the understanding we may not see each other for some time. The hospital where he works has good protocols in place and (for now) adequate equipment. It also has positive COVID patients and we live in an area where cases are expected to spike, so most likely he will come in contact with a positive patient. We will then make the decision for him live in the apartment we rented close to his place of work. We are fortunate to have that option where most health care workers do not. Still my concern and anxiety level increased exponentially this morning"

And, chances are, they will likely vote for him again."
2020-03-30 10:48,"The pandemic response - just look at how the world is reporting it  - is evolving, morphing and revealing.

2020-03-30 11:25,"Trump appears to have been the only human on earth that didn’t hear about the Imperial College’s modelling, released publicly on Mar 16th (see link below), that showed 1.1 - 1.2 million Americans would die from COVID-19 even if mitigation strategies were maintained for months.

Trump was right about banning travel from China. Unfortunately he only banned “foreign nationals who had been in China in the last 14 days.” This wording did not—at all—stop people from arriving in America from China. In fact, for much of the crisis, flights from China landed in America almost daily filled with people who had been in China, but did not fit the category as Trump’s “travel ban” defined it. People arriving from China should have self isolated for 14 days.

Trump’s next concrete action happened on Feb 24th when he sent a letter to Congress requesting between $1.8 billion and $2.5 billion to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. What does that say about how seriously Trump was taking the pandemic when the final bipartisan aid package ended up being ~$2 trillion?

What did Trump and his Administration due to protect the American people between Jan 31st and Feb 24th?

This is not news: how can we battle this crisis if the President lies or simply appears ignorant? His press conferences have revolved around his ego (fortunately the Covid task force physicians have abstained from mindlessly praising him, as his VP does). 

Even Nigel Farage appears more presidential and caring for the well-being of people: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCwWLAlwU7c"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCwWLAlwU7c</a>

2020-03-30 11:43,"As usual this is all about Trump. It always has been and it always will be. It is disturbing to hear how informed experts in almost every situation have to carefully lead this dim witted, petulant child into making the right decision. It reminds me of how you convince a child that it was their idea that it was a good time to go to bed and not yours. It would be a great comfort to once again live in a country where the president is brighter than the average citizen rather than having him be one of the least informed among us.

The United States of Trump and his acolytes have their pathetic president and the rest of us have no one to represent us. The US currently finds itself in a very sad spot and I don't mean COVID-19!"

Although the headline says it, the first paragraph, as well as previous coverage reporting the Easter opening nonsense, suggests that this is his call. Of course, it is not.  The Times as well as the other media, must start to figure out how to cover these non-story stories, which, as we all know, are simply his way of keeping the mic and spotlight firmly directed toward him.  For starters, we really don't need the daily redundant photos.  Jennifer Rubin over at the Post has some important ideas that you need to take to heart."

2020-03-30 11:59,It's great that he has finally voiced the danger that we are all in.  But he shouldn't be given a pass.  He did not listen to the experts.  He got rid of two programs established during the Obama Presidency that would have had us better prepared for the onslaught of this nightmare.   His irresponsible talk caused many to not take this seriously.  It's only been a couple of weeks before he has awakened to this tragedy.  I hope the people of the U.S. do not give him a chance to preside over our country for another four years.

No one can honestly say that Trump's behaviour is a model of leadership.  On the contrary, his knee-jerk approach to everything is based on a fatally flawed ""gut sense"" that he admits is central to his decision-making process.  We need science; we need responsibility; we need wisdom with backbone. 

Trump likes to shot random fakey bullets at our feet to see how high we'll jump...

He is the absolutely wrong man for this time...or any time."

Judge Blackburn has closed all “non-essential” businesses but has just opened up gun shops and gun ranges. The protection and assistance measures are steeped in red tape and long waits and are barely a trickle of what is needed to keep people in housing and food that weren’t already on assistance.  Although forced to close there is no protection for businesses that lease / rent their spaces as they are still required to pay their full rent or face loosing their property and place of business even though they are not permitted to work and in many cases even enter their place of work.
The assistance that will eventually come of $1,200 per person won’t cover rent, mortgages, or office space rent for many families and businesses thus compounding and prolonging the disaster."
2020-03-30 12:15,"The constant Trump bashing is not working. 

Ordinary Americans need to put our differences behind and quickly figure out how China successfully unleashed this deadly virus. After this crisis is over, one needs to investigate the help provided to China by those institutions in the West who hate President Trump. Trump's second term is likely to focus on that."

2020-03-30 12:29,"Forgive me two very disparate metaphors: Trump is very much like the backwoods preacher who believes that only his soul will ascend to heaven, or the movie star/producer who believes that the public will only want to see Lethal Weapon 8. We want a leadership that offers hope. But if Trump does not adapt, he will become the Lindsay Lohan of reality TV show stars. The economic success of his first years are a distant memory. Trump does not traffic in hope, he sees things only as measured by his own ratings. He manufactures his own reality, and keeps rescripting his movie story for his own sequel. Hope at some level, involves building something with other people; now more than ever. The leaders who will thrive will be resilient, they will adapt, they will create new programs, and new potential. Working with others, they will build a path forward."

So Trump is now the government? In this country you take an oath to the constitution not to the president. I've never heard any president in my lifetime say openly they do not like a certain governor. Sadly that kind of wayward talk is what gets Trump points with his Pied Piper base.

""He instructed Ms. Alcindor to be nice and not “threatening,” while Mr. Diamond’s question prompted him to declare: “CNN is not trusted anymore. They are fake news.”

Ms. Alcindor was repeating his own words on Hannity's show on Fox. Trump reminds me of Christopher Columbus he has one fake log and one that was real. The fake log is what he provides to Fox where he knows he has an audience that does not fact check what he says. The other log he gives to the real media while distancing himself from what he said on Fox. As for CNN they are able to pull up videos of him contradicting himself and engaging in prevarication or outright lies. How else can one explain reading back someone's own words then being accused of providing fake news?"

NYT wrote resently, ""That failure delayed the development of an affordable ventilator by at least half a decade, depriving hospitals, states and the federal government of the ability to stock up. The federal government started over with another company in 2014, whose ventilator was approved only last year and whose products have not yet been delivered.""

The problem we face today is due to the mishandling of this issue by the Federal Government in 2014. Obama was responsible for this callous error in judgment that now jeopardizes the life of millions of Americans."
2020-03-30 12:47,"Once again, the left/mainstream media twists Trump’s words.

From this article:  “The president seemed to be suggesting that New York hospitals were lying about how many masks they needed.”

I watched the full speech.  This is NOT what the president was suggesting.  He was suggesting that somewhere between the point at which masks were given to the state and given to the hospital, it’s possible that some people have been sneaking off boxes of masks, presumably to sell to the public.

I realized right after Trump said it that this was the spin the left/mainstream media was going to take.

From my running of the numbers, based on what has been seen so far, I would say that if we get off with only 200,000 dead we will have been lucky.  We have not yet managed to get a grip on this thing (although there has been progress) and it is running rampant.

If left uncontrolled - whether through lack of leadership or lack of necessary supplies - I would not be surprised to see 150 million total cases in the US before it burns out.  If you take the lower limit of 2 percent mortality that is three million dead.  If you take the (data driven) upper limit of 5 percent that is 7.5 million dead.

Stay at home, practice social distancing, listen to you local public health officials.  Wash your hands frequently, stay safe.

And above all:  DO NOT PANIC.

I start my day with the liberal/left New York Times and work my way to Fox by nighttime.  I still read the NYT every day, as I’ve done many years.  But, over time, it’s Fox that I’ve come to trust and respect.  Trump certainly has his flaws.  But the liberal/left media has been less than honest about him since before he even moved into the White House.  Please… watch just one episode of Sean Hannity on Fox."

The reality of the virus, the threat to our nation and the world and the estimate of up to if not more than 200,000 deaths in this country may have finally sunk into Trump's own twisted reality of things; even extending to April 30th may not be enough, only time will tell. 

With that said and knowing Trump's erratic behavior and the stable genius he proclaims to be, I am hoping he does not decide to change his mind tomorrow or later this week about eliminating the guidelines again."

“He’s a little older and he’s heavy. But he’s a tough person, and we went to the hospital and a day later he’s in a coma,” Mr. Trump said. “How is he doing? ‘Sir, he’s in a coma. He’s unconscious. He’s not doing well.’ The speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it is horrible.”

And now Trump is affected personally--an older overweight male friend of Trump went to the hospital with COVID19 and is now in a coma--now Trump thinks the virus is ""vicious"".  Too bad he didn't focus on the viciousness of the virus in January instead of engaging in his own viciousness and firing/removing those courageous individuals who testified at Trump's impeachment hearing.  Trump should have been removed in January.  Thank all the hypocritical GOP Senators in November with a NO vote."

If the US had a properly functioning national government instead of the current kakistocracy, the (hypothetical) president would have tasked the CDC in Dec 2019 to develop and issue public health guidelines by Jan 2020. Press conferences would be conducted by the CDC director or another public health official.

Trump created this ""task force"" for two reasons: to exercise political control over the information flow and for the halo effect of having Drs. Redfield, Fauci, Giroir, Adams, and Birx within six feet of himself on the stage.

Americans concerned about their family's health and the nation's future should be looking to state governors for guidance, especially to those states hit earliest and hardest by the pandemic (WA, CA, NY).

Fortunately, the states are assisted by the CDC and NIH."

But, Mr. Biden, et al condemned ""hysterical xenophobia"" when President Trump implemented his early, farsighted, bold, and highly effective travel restrictions on China and Biden declared that Trump had a “record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.”   Can't win.

Interestingly, Trump imposed his now widely praised China (and parts of Europe) travel ban when “the academic model suggested not to do that.”  –  acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli 

Trump has been relentlessly accused of ignoring science and the advice of experts.  

Now (as clearly stated in this highly detailed article) that Trump has acted upon evidence and experts' advice, let's see how soon that reliance and his action will be condemned by the usual suspects.  Will anyone be surprised?"

As Rome burns, this president is more concerned with getting the Dow Jones back to where it was three weeks ago so he can tout his great economy before November 3rd.

Like Nero playing his fiddle, Donald Trump is playing the country trying to ensure four more years for his presidency.

I can see the day that Trump boasts only 50,000 Americans have died, and 150,000 Americans have been saved thanks to his effectiveness and that of the White House.

If the media is going to cover the modified news conferences of Trump which recently gives him a legitimate national audience, they need to immediately identify his statements that have no established foundation.  A color code of his quotations is the next step after 17,000 untruths and lies..."
2020-03-30 16:10,"This should tell Trump to step aside and let the medical experts take charge. Stop treating this crisis as a photo opportunity and reelection event. This medical can't be solved through political rhetoric. Stop insulting the governors, the media and anyone who criticizes you. You failed to take timely action and you must take responsibility for that failure. You didn't bring this virus to America but you made this epidemic worse with more lies of life that didn't need to happen. Hopefully this crisis will also serve to educate you on how fragile the economic situation is for so many of our citizens. This crisis has laid bare the gross income inequality that exists in our country. You had a chance to be a transformative present but you failed us. We therefore must deny you another four years."
2020-03-30 16:16,"Our guidelines here in New Mexico were announced by our governor while Trump was, I believe, playing golf.  So were those in California, New York, etc., etc.  However, by putting in his ""opinions"" here and there, usually to be ""corrected"" by White House Staff in 15 minutes and, then, fortunately, usually overlooked completely by the agency in charge, Trump is simply trying to insert himself.  Unfortunately, though, our poor people then get on the phone to try to find out what the policy really is, jamming phone lines and, of course, those they call don't have straight answers either.  The best thing would be for him simply to shut up.  But, of course, he won't, and every time he makes even a half way coherent sentence, Republicans all over jam the media with praise."
2020-03-30 16:28,Trump consistently misses his opportunity use the powers available to him to take command of this situation. He appears to continually look for a quick fix (miracle) rather than a pragmatic one.  We never hear any coherent response to the pleas from Governors regarding the needs of their states and the imminent shortages they face. The states are left to compete among themselves for dwindling supplies resulting in astronomical price increases.  Instead we must now  place all  hope on unproven drugs.  Hopefully the results will not cause additional deaths. But there are many outcomes with unproven treatments. The effect of these drugs may merely prolong the sickness with no change in the outcome.   I can't help but wonder if the Federal government considered the consequences to the cumulative need for ventilators  if by chance these drugs should only prolong peoples lives rather than cure them.

At least in CA (and all over the country, I assume), a homeowner or renter can have a plumber come in to fix the toilet. Newsom's ""shelter in place"" order makes this very clear. BUT I doubt that very many (as in ""none"") homeowners or renters are calling plumbers to fix toilets, and I doubt that many plumbers would come into a home or apartment to do that. 

Things may change down the road, but right now many service businesses are still allowed but consumers aren't asking for them and service-providers are understandably disinclined to provide them."
2020-03-30 18:12,"Last I looked was about an hour ago, and I don't know whether my source is accurate but I think it is. Worldometer showed 2,606 coronavirus deaths in the US, mostly in New York and New Jersey. 

Many states (CA and NY, for example) are subject to state-wide ""shelter in place"" orders. In other states (TX, for example), it varies from county to county; the governor has left it up to local authorities (in TX, for example, county authorities have issued ""shelter in place"" orders for several large urban areas, but other county officials have not imposed any restrictions at all.

Down the road, I expect that my area (SF) will be subject to a ""shelter in place"" order for a very long time, but that other counties in CA will not be. That MAY make matters worse, though, since ""open"" counties (in CA, or in other states) are very likely to attract shoppers from ""closed"" counties."
2020-03-30 17:31,"""One adviser said the president recognized that the data about the potential impact of the virus in the United States was bad, and could not be bent to his will.""

I think that says it all.

Donald Trump has taken advantage of people for his entire life (scamming people with Trump U, stiffing vendors who supply his businesses, repeatedly using bankruptcy to avoid paying money he owes, and so forth).  

Now he is confronting Mother Nature, a force he does not understand, and that he cannot control.  

Coronavirus does not listen to arguments or insults, does not honor man made laws, and is immune to threats of lawsuits.  

Coronavirus does not care how popular (or unpopular) Donald trump is.

Coronavirus does not care what pejorative nickname Donnie uses to discuss it. 

Now Donald Trump has to ""put up or shut up.""

For a life long scam artist, ""putting up"" is a novel experience.

Good luck, Donnie.  (I say that sincerely, because your failure is going to be paid for with many innocent lives.)

However this ends, well or badly, we all know now that Donald Trump is totally unfit to hold any office of public trust.

We must elect somebody else as POTUS on November 3, 2020.

Most or all ""shelter in place"" order carve out numerous exemptions. Some exemptions have been discussed at length: leaving home to buy groceries, or visit the doctor, for example. 

OTHER exemptions have not, but business is booming for some of them. In CA, for example, marijuana dispensaries are considered an ""Essential Service"" and are doing an around-the-block business, while other store and shops around them are closed. Mental health professionals are swamped with work, though mostly over the phone or Internet.

This seems to be something that has dogged him since his childhood – fear of not living up to his father’s expectations. Many, if not most of us have experienced similar feelings. In order to hide his fear of incompetence, he shoves blame onto others and praises himself as a “brilliant genius”. It doesn’t matter that he is neither of these things.

Now his insecurity and hidden shame are costing people’s lives. His vacillations and flip-flops confuse health care professionals and his own cabinet officers and they try to compensate. Perhaps those who have been near him have experienced his feeling of inadequacy and try to compensate by praising him publicly while pursuing their own agendas to deal with problems.

In other cultures – in the Buddhist tradition for example – accepting one’s vulnerability strengthens and empowers one. Most military commanders have known vulnerability and fear in combat. It’s what makes heroism possible. People overcome their fear of death and charge into the battle, into the burning house, into the water to rescue a drowning person.

The president has never done any of this. Now we have a national leader that puts other people in harm’s way and blames others for his decisions. He denies any responsibility for the virus. He pretends to be a leader at the cost of human lives."

I grew up in poverty and took 20 years to build a business. How many people died in the depression from hunger?

The other irrational aspect of these bizarre attacks on Dr Fauci is that after three years we see clearly that Trump damages his own remaining shreds of credibility when he tells the public false information that is so easily disproven.

He has been propitiating the president in order to get the government to do the right thing. It didn't work. The dishonest, confusing, self-aggrandizing propaganda events have done more harm than help. And Trump's blunders continue apace. Americans continue to needlessly get sick or die directly because of his blunders. At this point, shouldn't Fauci have known that propitiation doesn't work for a president as unfit and amoral as this one? Moreover, Fauci talked to us as if we were scientists and he were doing a scientific study. Please recall that he told us on NPR and elsewhere that he could not conclude definitively that the White House's blunders had caused harm. That was explicitly not what the country needed. The country needed an expert's best estimate of the truth. Yep, he would have been fired but the nation would have believed him--and that would have made him something of a hero."
2020-03-28 20:15,Of course this is ridiculous but ridiculous are the people that spread and support these false claims. That’s the real virus in the U.S.
2020-03-28 20:15,"This is beyond being ridiculous .

A World Famous Scientist Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, advisor of six Presidents incuding trump now is a target of trump supporters ?

Trump is the reason for this beyond control situation in the United States because of his late response , and the death of so many.

Does Dr. Anthony S. Fauci cares, no, he is busy with his reasearch to find a vaccine . He was doing trump a favor to be there when trump speaks his nonsensical lies. 

Stupidity is not in his vocabulary !"
2020-03-28 20:21,Dr. Fauci doesn’t need to undermine the President. Mr. Trump is doing that all by himself — every time he opens his mouth.
2020-03-28 20:21,"Don’t take their insults Dr. Fauci, fire Trump, and quit for your own self esteem.  Through Trump’s delays, he created this national trauma - let the “stable genius” muddle through his own mess."
2020-03-28 20:22,"Crises like this either bring out the best or the worst in people.  It will be interesting, once the worst is over, the number of first hand stories that will emerge regarding how Donald Trump actually handled this.  One can only imagine.  

The question is, will it make a difference."
2020-03-28 20:22,"Good God! We need fact based analysis, not guesses.

For once, can we all look at the data and work with what it implies? Just absurd. 

We have absurdity going all around by both parties who obviously do not understand the definition of Risk: More things can happen than will happen.

We need to understand and prepare, and the better we do that, the more we reduce the number of things that can happen."
2020-03-28 20:24,"Remember, the Birther Lie was also a fringe right-wing conspiracy theory.

Now its champion is President, and the Republican Party is a servant to the champion of that fringe right-wing conspiracy theory.

Decent Americans do not support or vote for Trump or his Republican co-conspirators."
2020-03-28 20:25,"My response is to Dr. Fauci directly: I want you to know that there is no one I admire more at this time of crisis, and I believe that every intelligent and compassionate being will say the same. We need your brilliance and your leadership more than ever, and  because my letter through the mail may never reach you, I want to say thank you here."
2020-03-28 20:25,We need  to saturate the airways with a bipartisan public service announcement that succinctly shares the facts and warns against the demonizing of science and the spreading of panic-inducing falsehoods about this pandemic.
2020-03-28 20:26,"This kind of response has a chilling effect on any expert with contradictory views weighing-in, creating a stilted and unbalanced view. It presents a danger to the democratic process--a process requiring input from many divergent sources."
2020-03-28 20:27,"If I had a prominent national platform from which to speak to the public and had said in December of 2019 that the right wing media machine and it’s audience were a threat to the lives of Americans and people around the world, I assure you I would have received push back for be to exaggerative and “being partisan.” Probably from members of the left wing, even. Back then I would have said as much because of denial and inaction regarding climate change. Today it is even more evidently true. Ignoring experts and ignoring the facts they come to the table with is deadly."
2020-03-28 20:29,"Not a surprising outcome. Anyone who is around Donald Trump eventually gets buried unless they take the approach that Dr Birx has taken of becoming a Trump Shill. Dr. Fauci knows that The Donald and his supporters cannot stand anyone who takes the limelight away from the president. Cuomo has been walking that tightrope, saying his piece but occasionally praising the president. Now it is clear that Trump has finally decided Cuomo is getting too much good coverage so hes started a new move to force quarantine on the state. A moment of peril for Cuomo who just got presidential permission to build four more field hospitals but knows that the smallest perceived slight (ala Inslee) can turn the president vindictive. Cuomo dissed the quarantine idea today, but may be forced by presdiential power to agree.IT WOULD MEAN STATIONING NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS AT THE AIRPORT AND ALL BORDERS OF NYS to prevent people from fleeing to their country homes."
2020-03-28 20:30,"Some things we can count on from the Right;
consistent resistance to scientific data even if proven repeatedly, a pattern of making up conspiracy theories when the proven facts don't agree with their view,  the discrediting of known and trusted experts when they call attention to the truth,
character assassination of anyone who calls out trump about his mis-truths, and a continuing pattern of belittling and denigrating women and minorities. 
The GOP has these things in their DNA. Their followers do as well and will continue to support division, misogyny, and racism as long as they have a platform."
2020-03-28 20:21,"That’s one prime example for the many reasons I will leave this country once the crisis has abated. Why would I chose to work and live in a nation where experts are constantly undermined?
Where science is belittled? 
Where reason lost its voice?
Where hate trumps tolerance?
Where freedom is reduced to the unrestricted right of  gun ownership?
Where false understood individualism destroys social coherence?
Where minorities are deprived of their rights?
Where basic human rights yield to religious privilege?
Where money equates to freedom of speech?
Where it is legal to bribe politicians and call it lobbying?
Where a president can trample over constitutional norms?
Where one major party has chosen white national apartheid over democracy? 
Where millions have insufficient health care?
Where the public health system does not even function in normal times?

The coronavirus epidemic has revealed within weeks to anyone with eyes to see that the United States of America are a broken nation."
2020-03-28 20:31,"In order to scientifically assess whether the coronavirus is a hoax, I suggest the following scientific study. We should choose a random group of 1000 people who are voluntarily remaining at home for 14 days and following Dr. Fauci's advice. We would then chose another random group of 1000 individuals who believe that the virus is a hoax to discredit the President and have them spend 14 days together on holiday in New Orleans (Republican 'hoax' Senators are welcome).  After the two weeks, each of the 2000 individuals would be assessed for illness and statistically measure the degree of health or sickness for every person."
2020-03-28 20:33,"Being a target of Trump supporters is a good sign.

Anyone who still supports Trump after his performance during this crisis is incapable of independent critical thinking. I feel sorry for them, but they should just be ignored while we let the adults deal with reality.

I'm guessing Dr. Fauci will quit before he adopts Trump's ""alternate facts""."
2020-03-28 20:37,"Surely the most frightening and discouraging aspect of this crisis is the extent and intensity of Mr Trump's support. Terrifying. What does reality matter in the face of ""alternative facts""."
2020-03-28 20:38,"Being truthful is now seen as being part of a 'deep state conspiracy'.  Folks, this is what happens in China, Russia, North Korea and every other country that is run by dictators.  We are now officially part of the globalization of authoritarianism.

I have for a long time suggested that there will never be a meeting of minds between those who want to live in the Fox, Brieibart, Sinclair bubble and those of us who want to live in a country with truth and science to inform and guide us. And now, we have to deal with this pandemic that could have played out differently by any other sane leader.

Quite frankly, I think it's more than time to split this country into two separate countries.  Half want to be lied to and hate anyone different then themselves.  The other half want to have peace, harmony, science, truth, etc, etc.

If this doesn't happen, what I see unfolding is that all of us will be made to live under a dictators rule and be at the mercy of someone who is indifferent to such pain and suffering."
2020-03-28 20:38,The far right doesn't believe experts who know what they're talking but would rather listen to the guy who has a hunch fish tank cleaner might be the cure.
2020-03-28 20:38,I'm seriously beginning to think that the alt-right is a bigger threat to the security and stability of this country than any external entity.
2020-03-28 20:38,Nothing from the far right shocks me anymore -- nor do the hordes of people who believe their lies. We don't need to wait for the zombie apocalypse. We are living in it now.
2020-03-28 20:39,"""But misinformation campaigns during a pandemic carry a unique danger because they may sow distrust in public health officials when accurate information and advice are crucial, said Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who teaches digital ethics.""

Same is true with climate change it is just that the environment's response to (lack of) human's changes is slower."
2020-03-28 20:39,"The question of whether or not ""it"" can or cannot happen here, is surely resolved.
This is a chilling development, as are the current approval ratings.
We should be more afraid of this than of Covid 19."
2020-03-28 20:39,"All networks need to immediately stop airing the nightly Trump rallies thinly disguised as press conferences. There is nothing newsworthy or informative about these. To the contrary, they are filled with misinformation, outright lies, confusion, and propaganda. ""News"" is meant to protect our democracy, and airing these sham conferences is not.

Instead, hold real press conferences from the CDC or NIH and let medical experts speak. This is what Americans need and deserve right now."
2020-03-28 20:40,"Amazing.  We now have faith-based politics. This goes part and parcel along with the known anti-scientific bent of evangelicals.  In a better country, a respect for knowledge and professionalism would prevail, but as scholars like Richard Hofstadter and Susan Jacoby have pointed out, there is a log strain of anti-intellectualism in American culture.  Given the danger we're in right now, we MUST pay attention to the doctors.  Rational people will do exactly that."
2020-03-28 20:40,"Dr. Fauci—you are my hero and the hero of all Americans, even those too blinded by their political beliefs to understand the depths of your heroism.  Please stay strong.  We need your voice."
2020-03-28 20:40,"I'm at a loss... I've been imagining a scenario where Fox News challenges something- ANYTHING- Trump says and what the fallout might be. It could be any number of things that they could question, whether past contradictory statements, revisionisms or hateful characterizations. Would the president denounce them? Would it confuse his true believers?

I'm having a harder and harder time understanding how we can still call ourselves the United States. The divisions are clearer than ever and our leader seeks only to widen the gaps."
2020-03-28 20:42,"News like this firms my building conviction that we would be much better off without facebook and twitter.  I'm afraid the genie is out of the bottle, but these tools have been instrumental in bringing out the worst in us.  Unless these platforms that promote rapid dissemination of fear, paranoia, lies and mod-mentality are reined in, I suspect they will be instrumental in the death of democracy."
2020-03-28 20:43,"I admire Fauci. He has a lifetime of work in medicine, research and epidemiology. His credentials, publications and reputation speak for themselves. He does not need his job, the country needs him at this time. He deserves admiration and respect. 

But he is no hero. In fact most who are called heroes are not heroes. Look up the definition and stop cheapening the word. It is not a particular occupation or belief system. It is a set of actions in a given context of lack of self-regard and safety in favor of others. I am confident he would agree that he is no hero. He is just a man doing his job and telling the truth. Please understand that he is one of the few in medicine and society who stick to their lanes of expertise. He speaks to where the evidence is or is lacking in the medical realm. He does not speak to the nuances of public policy or non medical consequences. And beware of many doctors and others who claim special knowledge but rather use their credentials to parrot the statements of others and project their own anxieties with false authority. 

Lastly as pet peeve of mine. If I were in his shoes, I would privately tell Trump, that the next time I am called Tony in public, I reply to Donald in public, not Mr. President! It is Dr. Fauci, Mr. President! Everyone else in his orbit should do likewise."
2020-03-28 20:44,"The article states that Fauci  "" has become the target of an online conspiracy theory that he is mobilizing to undermine the president.""  I am dumbfounded by their thinking process.  Do they think that all the other countries in the world with overwhelming numbers of Covid 19, are out to get Trump, too.  Or is only our Covid 19 specialized to undermine Trump. Do they realize that Covid 19 doesn't belong to a political party?   The critics of Fauci dabble in very strange thinking processes.  It seems that telling the truth, is the equivalent of attacking Trump."
2020-03-28 20:44,"Everyone agrees the COVID-19 pandemic will get worse before it gets better. Beyond that, Fauci doesn’t make rosy predictions or gloomy predictions. So, he is going to be right no matter what happens. 

Tump is optimist the pandemic will peak during May in the United States just as it peaked during February in China. We will know in late May if Trump is right or wrong. But there’s no possibility Wille right or wrong."
2020-03-28 20:44,"The Soviet Union spent much of its existence privileging political orthdoxy over scientific correctness. And the results were predictably dreadful, because it turns out that the truth doesn't care what Congress thinks about it."
2020-03-28 20:45,"Dr. Fauci and Gov. Cuomo = leadership, intelligence, experienced in crises, moral character, integrity, calm, sensibility, strength, voice of reason, empathetic, etc., etc.

Trump = none of these qualities

Case closed."
2020-03-28 20:46,"Fauci is a scientist of unquestionable integrity. As a mayor of a small rural coastal Oregon community I also know loggers and fishermen and I would not more question the integrity of their knowledge that I would Fauci's and all of them base their knowledge on science. Trump's base needs a wake-up call! Everything we utilize in the world--everything successful or even close to it--is science-based. 

Trump's base must set aside their own fear-based rhetoric to embrace the very thing that makes the can-opener, the kitchen stove, the 4x4 350 what it is and the Husqvarna chainsaw purr. Science, not the magical thinking of hysterical politicians like Trump make the world work. 

Fauci is an expert. Support him in what he does!"
2020-03-28 20:46,"In fact, Fauci appears to be doing everything within his ability NOT to antagonize Trump. Clearly, Fauci's priority is clearly to stay in his role, where he can do the most good for the country as a scientist, and not weigh in politically. But, as a venerable person of science, one can imagine what he must be thinking..."
2020-03-28 20:46,"Donald Trump, enabled by the craven Republican party under his thrall, has mobilized the truly irrational unhinged elements in our midst. Those elements magnify their awfulness, and distribute their corrosive craziness far and wide through thousands of social media outlets. While I believe Trump's shocking (but not surprising) mishandling of the Coronovirus response will cause him and Republicans in general to be crushed in the November election, I wonder if we aren't seeing the beginnings of a technology-enabled rollback of the age of enlightenment. Is objective truth gone and will unbridled irrationality rule the day if conspiracy theories, made ""true"" by perfectly doctored photos, videos, audio recordings and public and private records, form the basis of what will pass for public and political discourse, and revised historical perspective? Somebody please tell me I'm way off-base!"
2020-03-28 20:46,I'm shocked but not surprised. Science takes a back seat to Trump's world view. I hope the human cost does not number in the millions...but it could.
2020-03-28 20:47,"Stories such as this one, and many similar ones beginning even before his presidential campaign, are proof that a fairly large number of Trump's supporters are mentally challenged in both intelligence and sanity."
2020-03-28 20:47,"I've seen articles, in the past, how deadly epidemics in shoddily-governed South African countries are so challenging to snuff out, because all credibility in the government has already vanished by the time they strike.  So when afflicted communities see cars or people that appear to be from the government--even if they're from the Red Cross or some other aid organization--their first reaction is to kill them, because they've already concluded that the government is actually behind all the dying people.
Never in my life could I imagine that something equivalent could happen in this country.  Guess again."
2020-03-28 20:47,"I am generally not one for aphorisms, but Dr Fauci's steady brilliance -- in the face of the ultimate loose cannon -- brings about a dozen to mind. 

For the most patient man in the public eye -- who could have retired long ago without anyone thinking the lesser of him  -- the most apt, for me, is:

""No good deed goes unpunished"""
2020-03-28 20:49,"Why can’t we lead this article with this paragraph?: “There seems to be a concerted effort on the part of Trump supporters to spread misinformation about the virus aggressively,” said Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington who has studied misinformation.

Giving details on the alt right groups and what they’re claiming about The Dr is not the point. The point is in that paragraph. And those groups don’t deserve the attention they get for the terrible things they’re doing."
2020-03-28 20:51,"Classic example of right wing paranoia.  The most common symptom is the sense that everyone is out to get you which is literally the root cause of everything Trump says and does on a daily basis.  And since he has the same ""enemies"" as the far right, he can do no wrong because the paranoid mind priorities its fears over everything.  They are predisposed to unconscious, automatic ""thinking"", a remnant of evolution."
2020-03-28 20:51,"Living in a country where people are not allowed to spread obvious lies has been a very interesting change from living in the US, where you just say whatever you want and whenever you want. 

Our freedom of speech is broken. 

I used to defend it. I used to think people would see through it. I used to think it was too risky, to not allow everyone to say anything. But I have changed my mind. 

Here in Germany, where anyone can offer their opinion but they avoid committing libel, most people think before they speak. They use facts. There is discourse without being personally offensive. 

How is it allowed that we can absolutely ruin people and their reputations with no shreds of evidence? Where is the fairness in that? The system is slanted towards protecting extremists and not the average person. 

We have a president who makes up stories as he goes and half the country basically follows along. And anyone who annoys him gets smashed along the way, their lives ruined. 

We need to rethink what freedom means."
2020-03-28 20:51,"When normalcy is returned, we must change Free Speech laws so that they do not protect hatred and dangerous speech.

So much of what the far right says is ""shouting 'fire' in a crowded theater."""
2020-03-28 20:52,"Crises shine a hard light on realities, one of which is that we are burdened with a President who is a doctrinaire focused on re-election.  His  surrogates' attacks will not subvert the rational judgment that his flailing about reflects ineptitude. Neither will they dispel contradictions, misrepresentations, and theatrics, nor mask the ignorance inherent in his thinking that he's expert in everything, that science is negotiable bunk, that political loyalty is a better test of suitability for government service than is competence. Despite what this self-proclaimed ""stable genius"" claims, his denigration (both explicit and implicit) of honest concern has undercut the strength of this nation. Fauchi and all those of position who support fact over dogma must speak up against the attack tweets and howls of Trump and his sycophants. High minded, polite silence is not longer tenable. They should heed the words of Albert Camus, in speaking of the Spanish Civil War: ""... [my generation] learned that one can be right and yet be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit, that there are times when courage is not its own recompense,"" and speak out nonetheless.
   The one good in the medical/economic tragedy of this pandemic is that, having been tested to the extreme, Trump's personal lack of character and administrative incompetence will be on center stage come the next election. We may yet avert the prolonged socioeconomic decline that he set in motion."
2020-03-28 20:52,"When a person's credibility is judged solely on the basis of whether that person makes Trump look good, we're in trouble. 

We're in trouble."
2020-03-28 20:52,"Of course the right wing doers this, they are traitors to any US government that they do not control.  The GOP in general has been in an active state of treason since the early 1970s, funded by the wealthy who believe that all tax dollars are their dollars and they do not like any government who spends them without their approval and OK.  This is fact and you can follow the history by starting with the Lewis Powell letter to the wealthy after one of their annual Jackson Hole meetings.  Hedrick Smith described it in part in his book ""How We Lost Our Democracy."""

Carpe diem!"
2020-03-28 20:30,Apparently these people don’t get that this is about a life and death issue.  This is a new world we are living in now.  All the bluster and attacks on Twitter isn’t going to stop the spread of the virus it’s only going to hurt those who believe these lies if they ignore the advice of Dr. Fauci.  Do they really think Donald Trump is going to save them?

2020-03-28 20:54,"The campaign against Dr. Fauci is grossly wrong and has improperly shifted the focus away from aggressively fighting the virus crisis. Those spreading the lies need to be told to stand down by President Trump. And the president needs to ramp up his focus on the facts and stop listening to the common man who is not a medical expert or a scientist. It's not doing anything other than sewing confusion and reaping mixed messages. President Trump should make much more use of the DPA and expand it to included all PPE.  He should use his Bully Pulpit to be the head cheerleader for the experts and their strategies and tactics to fight COVID-19. But, most of all, he needs to tell the conspiracy theorists to knock it off. That's how a president leads."

His formerly reasonable (though highly conservative) politics have morph into far-right conspiracy mania over the past few years, and his siblings have witnessed the transformation.

This article is deeply upsetting. The growing audience for conspiracy theories and anti-science rhetoric is a major threat to our democracy, and our planet. I don't know how our nation will ever heal. No matter how badly Trump blunders this crisis, there will always be a far-right ""theory"" to support his actions. Shame on those who propagate misinformation by gaslighting the public."
2020-03-28 20:56,"I recall reading about the virus in January and thinking that if it became widespread here it would be huge test for the country. We would see if something that went far beyond politics- into potentially mass casualties- could hold up to social media, regular media and politics.

I allowed myself to dream that Trump would rise to the occasion, understanding the gravity and understanding how handling this well would practically guarantee re-election; that the country would come together as it traditionally has in trying times, and not make this an us vs them fight like everything else.

I am so incredibly disappointed, and feel like a fool for imagining a different outcome."
2020-03-28 20:23,"Trump is the one who can put a stop to these hyperpartisan conspiracy theories, but he won't; to the contrary, he'll support them more and more once he fully embraces the belief that Dr. Fauci isn't ""being nice"" to him.
This insanity by the far right that liberals are out to undermine Trump has got to stop before more lives are lost. We have no leadership now. What we have is a tragedy playing out before our eyes -- even worse than the horrific coronavirus is the stark reality that Trump and his cronies and followers are destroying are country. It's never been more clear than now."

Relatively quietly, except in circles of individuals who understood the science, the politics, the true exclusivity of super individuals who do not want public notice, but just to be put in the position where their gifts can benefit the most people. And they are not reaching ""the summit"" of their work, their life work, and again there are individual with power stocking the ignorant, and unstable, to make money, by vilifying people that should be having memorials built to them.

2020-03-28 20:40,"Dr. Fauci,

With all due respect, your participation in these press conferences adds to the confusion. Who are the American people supposed to believe, their president, or you? By continuing to stand with the president, your participation suggests that what the president says is accurate and truthful, but it is not. In addition, Dr. Birx is also contributing misdirection and evasive answers such as her statement that there is no benefit to testing because if you’re negative one day, you could be positive the next. Does she not realize that the goal of testing is to find the positive people so they can be quarantined and not affect anyone else.

Dr. Fauci, you need to remove yourself from this political theater side show and speak directly to the American people, unfiltered.

Good luck."
2020-03-28 20:49,"This has been going on by his supporters since before his election and consists mainly of any facts that go against their opinion is fake news, attack the messenger, deny, deflect or divert.  Belief is stronger than facts for most of them.  Fauci is just the latest victim."
2020-03-28 20:50,"Yes, he is undermining the president... because the president is delivering false information.

In a time like this, false information is dangerous."
2020-03-28 20:52,Of course the news is all about Trump and of course lending credence to the partisan attacks on Dr. Fauci by repeatedly bringing them up.  Just what Trump needs to get re-elected!  Dr. Fauci is the person I believe.  Birx is turning into just another mouthpiece for Trump.  Let’s see more news about what sensible things other countries are doing to combat this pandemic and less about the vindictive and paranoid person masquerading as President.
2020-03-28 20:35,"How did this happen?  Were we not paying enough attention? How did so many millions of Americans just lose their minds, self-respect and common sense, all at the same time?

Who are the parents who raised these evil people? What about the schools that clearly failed them? Were we not watching? Did we just think it was a fringe thing? How did it happen and will it get even worse?

Finally, isn't there even one Republican who has the guts to stand up to them, take them to task and call them out for what they are? If there is, I haven't seen them in the House, the Senate or my state government.  Not one."
2020-03-28 20:31,"This is not ""another example of hyperpartisan information."" This is  a false equivalency. Left and right are not the same thing. When someone on the left says Trump is lying, it is because he is lying."
2020-03-28 20:23,"Be strong and know that most Americans are truly grateful for your work in trying to save lives while coping with a mentally ill president . 
You have tried the careful control of your words so he wouldn't fire you , forget it , very difficult to handle the insane as their mental status changes too rapidly, he is labile. The stress trump is under now has only exacerbated  his illness.Though he also a truely evil  person set on destroying this country.
Please know rational people believe you are  a hero.

2020-03-28 20:28,"We need our experts to guide public policy during this pandemic.    We need a President who seeks to unite us, not divide us, but that's not who we have now.  We need a superhuman Dr. Fauci.  He needs to remain stone-faced, and his body language must not show his human reactions when Trump says things that are repugnant to anyone who values science and a functional democracy.

I am a scientist.  I feel for Dr. Fauci, and for Dr. Birx.

I have nothing but contempt for those in the media and in the Trump base who actively work to politicize our country's response to coronavirus.  Cut it out!!  It can increase the death toll and the number of Americans who contract the virus.  It can prolong the economic paralysis.  It is dangerous."
2020-03-28 20:29,"Someone once said that you have to leave your country to truly understand it.  Perhaps it’s true that standing so close to the light tends only to blind you from the detail. Perspective is everything. Looking at the US from a distance is a sobering business. I heard an interview with a US academic in the very early days of Trump, who said, not to worry, the machinery of government is robust, honed throughout the centuries to stand firm against people like Mr Trump. How wrong she was. The institutions of government are like the proverbial house of cards. Flimsy. And corrupt. Open to the highest bidder.  What we are seeing, what the world is seeing, is the rotten core of American politics and indeed civil life being exposed and consuming the society from which it emerged, like an alien bursting out of the chest of its human host. Only this is real. The jury is in. The verdict delivered. The American project is a failure."
2020-03-28 20:30,"I've had two conversations with Trump supporters this week. Actually the one was more a confrontation than an actual conversation. I was stuck by the naivete and simple mindedness of both of them. Not stupidity, but an allegiance to a man who continues to feed into their fears. He tells them what they want to hear, not so much what is the truth. The truth, I believe, is too terrifying for them to hear. Thank God for Dr. Fauci and his speaking of the truth and science based messaging."
2020-03-28 20:48,"The attacks on Dr. Fauci by the usual suspects were both inevitable and predictable for all the reasons we are familiar with.  Whatever becomes of the public disregard for truth and expertise as this crisis plays out, you can absolutely count on one thing -- in the end Trump will find a way to settle his personal score with Dr. Fauci.  Trump's mendacity, disregard for truth, and need to control the narrative simply have no limits.  These traits are exceeded only by his relentlessness -- he never forgets and he never forgives.
Somewhere down the road -- at a time and place of his choosing -- Trump will issue the usual nuclear tweet that ""... Dr Fauci is weak, not very intelligent, and a LOSER!""  It's only a matter of time."
2020-03-28 20:22,"I'm dismayed to see the Trump/ right wing attacks on Dr. Anthony Fauci. I had the honor of meeting him when he came to visit our office at CDC South Africa in 2011, and he struck me as a brilliant, honest, accomplished, down to earth, humble, kind man. They can attack him all they like, but next week or the following when COVID decimates those communities, they might be singing a different tune."
2020-03-28 20:39,"We are in serious trouble as a Country when one the most experienced and qualified epidemiologists is publicly attacked, not for his medical recommendations, but because he is seen as someone whose role is to keep the the President from being re-elected. Failure to support and see that Dr. Fauci’s recommendations will only prolong the pandemic and increase fatalities. Is this panic, fear, ignorance among the President’s supporters or simply a means to attempt to cover up gross criminal incompetence?"
2020-03-28 20:25,"The decline of Dr. Fauci explains the now prominent role of Dr. Birx on the podium - she is now the new Trump enabler - a recent
Christian-right video showed her describing Trump's great ability to grasp science and his support of that effort - a politially convenient way to increase her visibility and status among right wingers - but speaks very ill of her as a medical expert and truth-teller.  She is now almost on par with Pence as an obsequious and syncophantic supporter."
2020-03-28 20:24,"Just another example of how Trump and his administration are toxic to anybody who comes near. Unfortunately, we really need Dr. Fauci on the podium, even though he has to hold back a few direct comments. And I suspect he understands that he can best serve America by hanging in there for as long as he can, until he gets fired by tweet."
2020-03-28 20:56,"Dr. Fauci is a true patriot. He could easily walk away from this administration and stay the course with in his field. He is walking a fine line to stay in the forefront and stand for science. Protection Americans 
I hope we see the day when we can celebrate him and his colleagues"
2020-03-28 20:56,"If we get the government we deserve, Dr. Fauchi should resign and work for a country that still appreciates expertise, experience and science. He doesn't need this noise."
2020-03-28 20:57,"Hang in there Dr. Fauci. Don’t let the persistent noise of political mosquitoes distract you from the critical need to keep the needle of Corona-virus discussions unwaveringly trained on the facts of science and human health. Two more subjects about which Trump continually demonstrates he knows nothing. 

Throughout his eight years in office, President Obama knew enough to defer to experts whenever the American people needed guidance on topics beyond his expertise. The entire world would benefit if Trump would try to follow Obama’s lead on matters of healthcare,  as well as science."
2020-03-28 20:57,"After fifty-seven months of German occupation, Paul-Henri Spaak, a future prime minister of Belgium wrote, ""Belgians and French and Dutch had been brought up in the war to believe that their patriotic duty was to cheat, to lie, to run a black market, to discredit and to defraud; these habits became ingrained after fiver years.""

After just three years of the Trump occupation many of our citizens have come to believe in a deep state that is out to get them."
2020-03-28 20:44,No one qualified ever lasts in a Trump Administration. NO ONE!
2020-03-28 20:27,"The Republican propaganda machine has systematically and so successfully cultivated beliefs in 50% of Americans that are so toxic and self-perpetuating that they now threaten to destroy the country. 

At what point does the machine pull back? 

When do the Republicans realize that lording over a lawless, hateful, and regressive country makes their propaganda ultimately self-destructive?"
2020-03-28 20:53,"I’ve met Dr Fauci a few times in my career & he’s not only one of the most renowned virologists in the world, he’s genuinely a nice guy. I hate that this admin & the media are bringing his life into the spotlight in this way, he’d much rather be at the lab bench, I’m sure. 

Scientists don’t play politics, they look at data. So just remember that about Dr Fauci, the only information he will share is that based upon what the data shows."
2020-03-28 20:37,"We need Fauci and every other thinking human to stand up and speak the truth now more than ever. Those who do not, and historically have not to this “president” will have near as much blood on their hands as DJT when this is over."
2020-03-28 20:23,The galling thing is you can bet those right pundits are taking every precaution to protect themselves and their families while they are exhorting their followers to ignore Dr Fauci.
2020-03-28 20:27,"This was one of the more horrific stories connected to the Covid-19 pandemic I've ever read.

What is wrong with these people?  Why do they take such pleasure in destroying reputable, experienced, revered scientists?  What makes them instantly create some sort of unbelievable accusation based on nothing but a gesture?

They have little to do, and they're destroying America, far more than any virus can do."
2020-03-28 20:32,"Well this was just a matter of time.  Dr. Fauci has been respectful but factual so of course the science denying, conspiracy touting Trump supporters have turned on him.  He is everything they hate: intelligent, open-minded, and compassionate."
2020-03-28 20:36,We are all doomed by an administration that does not understand science.
2020-03-28 20:39,"My hope is that these Right Wing zealots will ignore the cautions entirely.  If they go out, and the rest of us stay in....A bright new day will eventually dawn."
2020-03-28 20:46,Only in America. Only in America amongst advanced nations does such insanity thrive.
2020-03-28 20:46,"Of course the right wing attacks Fauci, he's everything Trump is not, intelligent, highly educated, firm grasp on reality, moral compass, etc, etc, etc."
2020-03-28 20:54,"If Fox News cared about the health of its viewers it would disabuse them of potentially dangerous notions.  This is not an abstract philosophical discussion.  People are sick and dying.  Even though I strongly disagree with these folks attacking Fauci, I would still much prefer to prevent illness in any human being."
2020-03-28 20:58,">> a torrent of false claims that he is mobilizing to undermine the president.

Pretty much by default, any rational, intelligent person who speaks the truth ""undermines the president."""
2020-03-28 20:36,Only Trump can put a stop to this. He needs to publicly affirm Dr. Fauci as a reliable expert. Can he do it?
2020-03-28 20:41,"The novel coronavirus must be green with envy at the speed and spread of the right-wing conspiracy theories. 

We'll survive Covid 19. I'm not so sure about the other virus that so many Americans are carrying, the one that speads on social media and destroys our herd immunity to lies and propaganda. 

As goes Fauci, so goes our American resistance to the virus of Trump."
2020-03-28 20:43,You have to wonder how many of these pro-trump tweeters are of Russian origin. We must be vigilant about the malevolent foreign influence on our national affairs.
2020-03-28 20:44,"These anti-Fauci-ists are endangering all of us, no matter where we fall on the political spectrum.   Pointing out that Dr. Fauci once sent an email praising Hillary Clinton is like the HUAC Committee (look it up) accusing someone of Communist ties because they praised Paul Robeson (look him up too).   And not praising their favorite President means that (to use one more dated analogy), Trump/Anthony will send you to the cornfield (google it)."
2020-03-28 20:46,"So I am infuriated that other states are shunning NY because of the rise of cases. As if we are the cause for the spread of the coronavirus. NY is doing what they are suppose to do. Testing more people. Unlike other states. And to imply that New Yorkers who have visited other places has led the spread of the virus is simply ignorant. 

Scenario: NY is quarantine, weeks later, cases continue to rise in other states. Then what?"
2020-03-28 20:46,How do we know that these social media accounts tweeting this information hundreds of times per day aren't Russians?
2020-03-28 20:53,"My difficulty with articles like this is that they don't reveal the size of the group attacking Dr. Fauci -- is it just a few diehard malcontents who spend their time spewing poison via the Internet  -- to use Trump's oddly apt phrase, some 400 pound guy on his bed in a basement -- or is it a significant phenomenon?  Should we be mildly  irritated or deeply troubled? Without knowing how many people are involved, it is hard to tell whether or not there is really a problem here."
2020-03-28 20:57,I’m one of those folks who thinks trump should hold a huge rally.  Lets see if his followers believe him or Dr Fauci.
2020-03-28 20:58,Something about the pleasure online Trump supporters take in creating chaos and sowing discord makes my stomach churn. I can't help but wonder if these accounts are troll farms (international or domestic) or bots or just dark souls lost in the sick underbelly of the internet hoping the world experiences as much pain as possible. And those that approve and retweet are just as guilty.
2020-03-28 21:00,"Dr. Fauci deserves his ""Second"" Medal of Freedom.

We are in deep trouble and crave a voice of reason and expertise.   I mute every WH conference except when the Drs. speak.

The President's approval ratings are creeping higher.   It's right out of Alice In Wonderland.  Up is down and down is up.

If the Far Right are verbally targeting Dr. Fauci our President should do the right thing.   He should make an announcement at every WH conference until they stop, It will not be tolerated and must cease.  Sadly he probably won't because of the increasing ratings."
2020-03-28 21:00,Dr. Fauci is the only reason I watch the nightly Trump rallies. Fauci is walking the walk. I respect him for the amount of respect he shows Trump. We should all appreciate how difficult that must be.
2020-03-28 21:01,"Only the far right would try to discredit the most sane, knowledgeable, and comforting medical authority in our country right now. I suppose I should not be surprised, but I am. Dr. Fauci is likely the greatest force in reducing the additional deaths that Donald Trump is creating."
2020-03-28 21:02,"This is an example of why the cult of trump is so dangerous. Belief and faith are what's important to the worshipful, not truth, not data, not science, not proof. In fact, to the faithful, there can be no proof that does not support their beliefs. You cannot persuade them because nothing you say that disagrees with their faith can be allowed to stand. So science and scientist must be attacked. They are heretics questioning the wisdom of the anointed. When the crisis first started I thought, this is the time that people will see that true value of science. How it is the tool that will help save the country in its time of need. That was wrong, blind faith will not see. This will not end well for the rest of us."
2020-03-28 21:02,"It is surely becoming reasonable to suggest that the 50 US States disunite, and become separate countries, perhaps in combination with contiguous states of like mind. Such are the manic differences between populations across the current country. This crisis has shown a side of the country I just don't like, and would prefer not to be part of anymore."
2020-03-28 21:02,"Hi from Europe, where - although there are disagreements about the scientific understanding around Covid 19 - and serious differences in the initial stages around public policy responses - there is incredulity about the way Fauci and other informed opinion is being received in some quarters. Alas, areas of the US are headed for serious trouble. This is of immeasurable concern, compounded by the friends and family in, and deep affinity for, the US that I hold. Please stay safe and look out for each other - but it looks like you'll need to be vigilant and organise this by yourselves."
2020-03-28 21:04,"For 3 years, Trump has been replacing the people around him with far-right anti-science political activists.  He has also has systematically pushed to defund agencies like the CDC.  There are no people around him that believe in science.  Trump's latest statement about ending quarantines at the hight of this epidemic are the words of a mad man.  Trump does not see the danger of this epidemic.  Trump has no idea how to contain this epidemic.  Sadly, hundreds of thousands of people will die because of Trump's lies and miss handling of this epidemic.  There needs to be a national quarantine now.  Trump needs to explain why this quarantine will help more people live and eventually allow America's economy to start.   Trump's lies and miss handling of this epidemic are both why America's transmission rate is the highest in the world.  Hundreds of thousands of people will needlessly die because of how badly Trump miss-handled this epidemic."
2020-03-28 21:04,"Our whole response to the coronavirus crisis is conditioned, distorted and magnified by the easy availability to everyone of the internet which gives apparent equality to every opinion, informed or uninformed, and allows (requires) each individual to decide for himself the truth or falsity of what he reads.  It allows clever, self-interested people to intentionally distort information for political, economic reasons, or just for (mischievous) fun; it facilitates mass panic.  The present crisis would be much less severe without the internet.  Reality is what it is, the internet won't go away, so we just have to learn to evaluate its offerings as best we can; we live and learn."
2020-03-28 20:24,"When people in the far right start dying in droves perhaps, just perhaps, they may think differently."
2020-03-28 20:59,"I suggest reading ""Anti-Intellectualism in American Life by Richard Hofstadter, a 1963 winner of the Pulitzer Prize.  
""Anti-Intellectualism in American Life is a book which throws light on many features of the American character. Its concern is not merely to portray the scorners of intellect in American life, but to say something about what the intellectual is, and can be, as a force in a democratic society.""  Available on Amazon"
2020-03-28 20:58,"A simple, forceful statement from the White House condemning this kind of foolishness is all it will take to bring it to a quick end. We're waiting, Mr. President."
2020-03-28 20:42,"795 tweets a day?  That’s either a typo or activity by a bot.  I wouldn’t be surprised if malicious foreign actors are trying to stir the pot.  Having said that, I just can’t help being disappointed that this country is so divided that in a time of crisis people can’t pull together.  Attacking the truth doesn’t diminish its veracity."
2020-03-28 20:32,"I do wonder how much of it is Bots and are the Russians, N. Korans, Iranians... up to whatever. I do get there are no shortage of Trump believers, but the ones I know seem to be baffled by the White House's actions in the wake of this crisis."
2020-03-28 20:42,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is the face of reason, along with most governors. Mr. Trump is the face of evil. 

Please remember that in November"
2020-03-28 20:34,Trump doesn't like anyone who is smarter than he is. Which is pretty much everyone.
2020-03-28 20:49,"I don’t think Democrats or journalists are damaging Trump politically. He does it all by himself every time he opens his mouth to lie or say some other outrageous, unsubstantiated thing. If requiring governors of states soon to be overrun with patients needing ventilators to praise him to receive aid doesn’t damage him politically, nothing will."
2020-03-28 20:18,Some of the ale-right seem to have a problem with anyone presenting facts that disprove their ridiculous conspiracy theories.
2020-03-28 20:47,"China silenced the physician who told the truth about the novel coronavirus.  That physician died of the disease, still a pariah in his own country, at least to the regime.

  Key question:  How long before Dr. Fauci, too, is silenced by Trump, the psychological confrere of Xi Jinping, the Chinese dictator?  

  Was Dr. Fauci trying to cover his amazement at the stupidity of what Trump had just said, or was he just trying to catch half a wink, knowing that nothing important or truthful was coming out of the mouth of Trump?  He certainly could use some sleep after working in our behalf for something like 100 hours a week since January.

  Expect Dr. Fauci to be fired within a week or two.  He knows too much (science) to be allowed to continue."
2020-03-28 20:54,And how much of these campaigns against Dr. Fauci are escalated by Russia?
2020-03-28 20:30,"I sincerely can’t mentally handle reading this kind of thing any more. It’s so psychologically upsetting to live with a narcissistic, deeply ill president amidst millions of poorly educated, illogical citizens...Suggestion: start designing/depicting the dynamics and communication flow you’re explaining in graphic/infographic format. Visually show their playbooks. Have that shared. Text-based articles are preaching to the converted and make it feel like we are locked in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”"
2020-03-28 20:59,"If Fauci is fired the Dow will go down 10,000 points.  If it is seen that Fauci's advice is not being taken, the Dow will go down 8,000 points."
2020-03-28 20:56,"It is astounding, but not really surprising, that the far right wing, and not so far right wing, continue to believe the 6-times bankrupt, thrice married, failed businessman turned TV show host, carpetbagging conman instead of the Dr. who has advised presidents of both parties since Reagan. They've yet to meet a conspiracy theory they won't embrace, or an act by this president they would challenge or criticize. Pathetic, little people with a platform."
2020-03-28 20:33,"There is a massive crisis with 1000s of dead, more to come and the US achieving a very sad ""America first!"" .
There is one last guy with credibility on the stage during these briefings, like the last buffer between a sensible response to this crisis - and complete insanity. 

Who are these people, making Dr. Fauci their target, now? They can´t all be Russina trolls, can they?

Madness reigns."
2020-03-28 20:30,"Condense the conflict between scientific fact and fascist propaganda and here we are. This is the dress rehearsal for climate change. Science must win out or our species is doomed to extinction. I continue to be puzzled as to why Trump would so callously kill off what will be mostly his own voters but reality reminds me that he doesn't care about them at all as he is only interested in expanding the role of corporations in government. Think of the utter callousness of lifting EPA regulations during this emergency. Some states have made abortion unavailable because of the virus. Every disaster is an important opportunity to unleash the pseudo religious/fascist businesses who want total authoritarian control. This propaganda based demand for consideration is a violence against us all. Right down to the ridiculous bill. ""People are dying"" business knows, ""but we need their money so we'll just take it, again."" Violence. There is no other way to interpret it. While this slog to capitalist theocratic fascism was slow and deliberate its merits could be argued. Not anymore. Lying is violence. This onslaught of lies is violence. Why do we, and how long must we, take it?"
2020-03-28 20:24,"As far as I'm concerned, since the far right does not want to listen to Dr. Fauci, they can reap from their sowing and deal w the disease on their own."
2020-03-28 20:21,Fauci's tireless contributions to the health and welfare of all Americans have been nothing less than heroic.
2020-03-28 20:16,Facebook and twitter may have a moral obligation to actively fight disinformation related to deadly diseases such as coronavirus. It is not that just a few more people will die if medical experts are villified and their advice ignored. A lot more people will die.
2020-03-28 20:37,"Stay strong Dr Fauci.  We need your truth, wisdom and clarity now more than every.  Thank you for your service."
2020-03-28 20:33,"Sad commentary on the rise of partisanship, the fact that some people have no sense of responsibility regarding the reputations of others and don't care whom they hurt, and the decline of trust in all institutions in the US.  We also don't know how much of this involves foreign bots.  But the doctors and other health professionals remain among the most trusted individuals in the US, and I am sure Mr. Fauci's reputation will rise not suffer because our society desperately needs his and his colleagues' expertise.   What we don't need is the politicization of a health crisis that affects us all."
2020-03-28 21:05,"If Dr Fauci was a celebrity, he would at the very least have had a public tantrum by now. Fortunately, he is a top academic with the highest level of integrity who is used to being criticized by people less informed than him. Presumably he will ignore the right-wing social media and get on with his job. Thank you Dr Fauci. This is our global future at stake."
2020-03-28 21:05,"How the Trump right-wing reveals itself! It's great that their fear and loathing is quantified. The US may suffer now. But our future historians, and other countries, will be able to use it to manage some of the devilry in human nature."
2020-03-28 21:14,"of the quoting of frank rich (12 march inst.) there will apparently be no end:

In the midst of the current crisis, the question of Trump’s reelection prospects seems academic. What’s clear is that the older voters who make up a large segment of his base are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus — and equally vulnerable to the propaganda that Trump, Fox News, and Rush Limbaugh are putting out, telling them to disregard all Fake News reports of the pandemic’s threat to their lives and livelihoods and to ignore any instructions about how to combat it. One thing is certain: This political strategy is not likely to increase the turnout of the GOP base in November."
2020-03-28 21:15,One can't help but wonder if there will be a bit of social Darwinism at play in the near future - for those who heed medical experts and those who don't.
2020-03-28 21:08,"I’m a specialist physician in my mid-50s from Australia. When my cohort was studying for our specialist exams some 30 years ago, Dr Fauci’s name was already on the spine of our bible: Harrison’s textbook of internal medicine. His name and reputation is recognisable to medical specialists the world over. This story highlights the schizophrenia that America is suffering through at present. How could it be that your people could not universally laud this gentleman as a national hero, as he would surely be in any other country. A proportion of the US population appears to make all decisions about the world through a political lens, placing politics above science, medicine, the law, even religion and common sense. This is a very dangerous time to place politics first."
2020-03-28 21:11,"Dr. Fauci is playing a crucial role in protecting our health and safety.  Mr. Trump is simply dangerous to both.  From another perspective, compare Mr. Trump's moments in his briefings to Gov. Cuomo's well informed updates.  Fauci and Cuomo are the true leaders during this crisis because they are in control of the facts: Fauci with science; Cuomo with leadership.  Along from his inability to be able to read his advisers' notes during those briefings, Mr. Trump fails genuinely to appreciate Dr. Fauci's scientific expertise and cannot hold a candle to Gov. Cuomo's leadership."
2020-03-28 21:13,"Think that one of the problems with the way the virus numbers are reported is countries with large populations -- like the US -- are compared to much smaller countries, like Italy. I would think that the statistics on the virus would be better to understand if the number of people who are shown to have the virus and the number of deaths from the virus are given as a percentage of total population. There is no way to downplay the shocking number of deaths, of course, and the hotspots are disturbing as well, but even when the virus is reported as passing one million around the globe, the population of the entire world is HUGE in comparison."
2020-03-28 21:02,"Trump needs Fauci far more than Fauci needs Trump. His voice of knowledge of integrity is what gives Trump's daily dog-and-pony briefing an element of credibility and scientific relevance. If Fauci departs, we will be left with little more than a White House version of ""Fox and Friends"".  America's faith in the federal pandemic response, already low, will plummet even further."
2020-03-28 21:08,"I don't think this article quite captures the feverish lunacy of the cult of personality on display here.  Fauci puts his head in his hand for a moment, and this provokes a vast wave of hatred, lies, and conspiracy theories. It's a form of mass hysteria.

And I don't think the media is quite capturing the larger context.  The actions and beliefs of this febrile cult are going to help cause the suffering and death of tens of thousands of people.  They represent a huge obstacle to an effective and intelligent collective effort to mitigate this suffering.  In a horrible irony, they will help cause precisely the lasting economic damage they are now blaming on those efforts. The cult of Trumpism--which is to say the stranglehold Republicans have on our national politics--is now a historically unprecedented menace to public health and the common weal.  How do we defend these things?  How do we defend ourselves?"
2020-03-28 21:10,The density of far right denialism and refusal to face scientific facts will be quite lethal.
2020-03-28 21:12,Poor Dr Fauci.  A brilliant man with a brilliant career of service being criticized for being factual and honest.  It beggars belief.  Years from now historians will marvel at this period in history.   There will be an institute in his honor.  Grants and buildings named after him.  Hang in there Dr Fauci.  You will prevail ultimately.
2020-03-28 21:11,"The US has a third-world healthcare system. Trump’s ratings suggest a third-world education system, too."
2020-03-28 21:13,"That hand-to-the-forehead gesture of Dr. Fauci was a great service to the nation; a desperately-needed gesture of solidarity with the millions of us science-believers suffering through this new Dark Age and a much-needed rebuke to the ignorance and fear of Trump supporters. If they don’t like it, too bad. Truth sometimes hurts but it can’t be denied for long because, eventually, it always wins."
2020-03-28 21:14,"Dr. Fauci is an American hero.  Despite immense pressure to compliantly support factual errors and lies, he has bravely provided accurate information that has most likely saved hundreds of lives."
2020-03-28 21:18,"So Trump, who dismissed the Coronavirus for Months is suddenly leading the charge to keep the country safe. Safe may be open to interpretation of course, depending on whether you live in a Blue or Red state.
 I just received a  mailing from the CDC that looks very much like campaign material.   Much like the nightly briefings which to me are nothing more than free air time.
 I won’t forget in November. Hope you will not either !"
2020-03-28 21:19,"Thank you, Dr Fauci. We need you, as a voice of reason and fact. Ignore the naysayers."
2020-03-28 21:19,"Really thoughtful and clear cut conversation between Trevor Noah and Dr Fauci is on the Daily Show's You Tube channel. Amazing guy, smart, funny - and at 79 he was probably due for a well earned rest. Though compared with you-know-who he's a picture of excellent health.
A true US (and world) hero and profile in courage."
2020-03-28 21:19,"Any leader who is presumed to always be right, who cannot be contradicted for fear of punishment, is by definition a tyrant. What is the point of seeking advice from experts if you know everything already? A true leader will seek counsel from experts who will express themselves sincerely."
2020-03-28 21:06,"Well, I see only one description for the Far Right: Enemy of the People."
2020-03-28 21:02,"Can we really attribute all these folks to the ""Far Right""? 
Many  (my belief) don't have a particular political bent; they are simply literal dregs of society.  They have no other purpose but filling their empty lives with vitriol hurled at others.

We've always had these types of creatures; they just now have a world-wide mechanism (and audience).

 Going around the online ""comment sphere"" one readily recognizes some who ""collect"" accounts on every site recycling their conspiracy blabber Do us a favor- don't provide them publicity."
2020-03-28 20:16,"I originally posted the following comment on March 26, 2020 to another article:

""You know I really hate to say this, but I've kind of had it with Dr. Fauci. And I'm old enough to remember how instrumental he was with investigating HIV/AIDS back when a certain segment of the population thought that horrible syndrome would solve the 'problem' of homosexuality.

Does Dr. Fauci not realize that by standing behind the president during his fork-tongued cotton-mouthed self-encomiums, he gives currency to the Trump brand of anti-intellectual bombast?

These press briefings are ostensibly held to provide updates by the Coronavirus Task Force. They have obviously devolved into campaign advertisements; although, for the life of me, I cannot fathom who is buying what he is selling.

Regardless, I believe in order to maintain his credibility; Dr. Fauci should refuse to be present for at least the political portion of these briefings. He could release necessary public health statements separately.

I think Dr. Birx is also in danger of loss of reputation. At today's briefing, she basically refuted reports of equipment shortages. Apparently, everyone lies except Donald Trump.

Drs. Fauci and Birx are in a long line of formerly respected civil servants who have been sullied by proximity to Mr. Trump. I would recommend social distancing to maintain their integrity.""

And I'm a bleeding-heart liberal."
2020-03-28 20:55,"Once again, Trump should be impeached. Immediately. Monday. Over the signing statement. 

Why should that be an impeachable offense? Because it is intended to undermine America's system of government by checks and balances, in the midst of an emergency. Letting Trump defiance of law stand unchallenged would cripple any ability of congress to negotiate with the executive over further emergency measures. 

Trump has announced that whatever the law requires, if he does not like it, he will ignore it. That leaves congress as a non-participant, and Trump as the King. Impeach him. Find out now if after all this bungling on the pandemic, the Republican senate will once again endorse outlandish misconduct in office—this time in the midst of a deadly crisis of unprecedented magnitude—while the economy crumbles. 

As for poor Fauci, his usefulness in the administration is done. He ought to resign, and go public with what he has had to contend with. As an unfettered voice for truth, outside the administration, Fauci can do the nation a great service. Inside? Inside the Trump administration? It is hopeless."
2020-03-28 20:57,"It just so easy, so reassuring, and so much more fun to believe whatever your ideology tells you to. This must have been what Rome was like in their end times."
2020-03-28 20:58,"We need to vocally and emphatically defend and support Dr. Fauci now, and I hope we will."
2020-03-28 21:06,"Of course discrediting Fauci and further undermining already failing federal activity on coronavirus would be an attractive approach for Putin's henchmen or any of the other enemies of the U.S. practiced in digital assaults.  However, it would also amplify the already high likelihood that the red states that are ignoring the pandemic will be hit with extremely severe viral spread and its lethal and economic consequences if Trump's Easter dementia prevails.  In turn, that would undermine his re-electability, and his ejection from the White House would be a real mishap from the point of view of our enemies."
2020-03-28 21:12,"How have we come to this?  A world in which intelligence, reason, and facts take a backseat to deliberate distortion, uninformed opinion, small-mindedness?  Mr. Trump is partly to blame for elevating meanness and self-aggrandizement in political discourse about the most serious topics."
2020-03-28 21:12,"If Trump supporters want to follow Trump the pied piper off the edge of the cliff, so be it.  It's a free country.

Save the science for those who want to know the truth and who follow the mainstream media because that's where the facts can be found.  It's here that you'll find the people who want to hear you Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-28 21:13,"Anybody who values Dr. Trump's medical advice over that of Dr. Fauci deserves whatever happens to them. If, as a consequence, every red and purple state turns blue, well so much the better."
2020-03-28 21:19,"Trump supporters are a cult, they are too far gone for now. Logic and expert advice from specialists well-educated in their field doesn't matter. Cults are immune to logic and rationality so long as their divine Father figure remains in a position of power. It takes the cult leader being removed from power somehow for fanatics to awaken from their trance and come to see the error of their ways. And even then, not all of them will.

There's no hope right now for Trump's supporters. What we have to hope for is that the hatred towards Trump, which run just as deep as the devotion to him, is powerful enough to win out in November. Once the spell he cast is broken and some of his supporters wake up, maybe we can work with the more moderate ones, hear them out, and heal some of our divisions to reduce the likelihood a demagogue comes to power again."
2020-03-28 21:01,"Without meaning to or wanting to, we should all be undermining forces that pose an existential threat to us. Threats to our government, our culture, our health, and the very existence of this planet.
That threat is Trump."
2020-03-28 20:56,"If you don't care for the control over the conversation that the far right ignorati exert, the only definitive cure is to swamp them out in November."
2020-03-28 21:00,"Dr. Fauci is ""right"" to hold his head in disgust that we are burdened by the worst possible president. Here in New Orleans, it's absolute bedlam because patients have no idea when/if/how to get tested. Hospitals are overrun but instead of using the $500 billion congress allocated to help people, Trump says he is that he's going to disregard the legislation just passed, allocate the $500 billion as he sees fit, and not account for any of it.

In another life, this would be known as a ""coup d'etat"" but we're so busy fighting this pandemic w/o proper equipment, no one seems to cares that Trump is about to loot the government..... again."
2020-03-28 21:16,"when Trump supporters attack an individual it is the surest sign that the individual is right and a sane person.
If John Kelly and others had been like Dr Fauci who shows his disagreement through his body langauage we would not have had Trump to deal with by now."
2020-03-28 21:17,It should tell a lot that about the extremest  positions left or right that needs to tell lies to survive. As much so about those than need even more to lie about facts when so presented.
2020-03-28 21:01,"Previous to reading this article, I researched the comparison of U.S. money spent on education per capita as against China, India, etc.  Reading how these political hacks attack Dr. Fauci not only makes me sick but wonder if we are spending too much money on education.  The hacks clearly skipped science class.  Bio 101  separated the wheat from the chaff. The hacks are chaff.  I was the C+ to Dr. Fauci's A++."
2020-03-28 21:20,"Criticism from Trump and his followers bestow a badge of honor on those, like Fauci, and the governors of Washington and Michigan who are Trump's targets. The divide is deep, with us Democrats hungry for the truth from leaders and finding it in, for example, the governors. Fortunately, first and foremost among the governors is a Republican, a voice of reason and balance, Larry Hogan. I cannot speak of politics to my relatives and friends who I think are Republicans. I cannot accept their biases and it appears a hopeless effort to try and change their minds."
2020-03-28 20:58,"The freakish devotion to… Donald Trump??

Huh??

Like a cult of hateful maniacs. 

It shows me and helps me understand how human beings became so blindly sick and thoughtless and hateful that they were able to shove my father's family into gas chambers. 

These extremist right wing people are sick. 

Period. 

And, it needs to be said and said and said again. 

And, I'll say the same about any left wing person who goes to a sick extreme. 

Same thing. 

Normal Americans choke on it!"

2020-03-28 20:19,These comments are not coming from some mysterious “far right fringe.” They are coming from the base of the Republican Party and amplified by Russian trolls.
2020-03-28 21:21,"What is really needed is a massive, long-running ad campaign for science.  There will always be the fringe nuts, but right now their voice is  disproportionately loud.  I think the majority of the American public is more ambivalent, and probably can be convinced to look upon science more favorably.  The current danger is that people will use (or rather continue to use) the economy as an excuse to push science funding down even more, in favor of 'priorities'... which in this country means luxuries, basically."
2020-03-28 20:44,"I'm sure history will show that early in this crisis somebody told Trump that Korea was a country to emulate for a response to the Covid-19 crisis.  Of course Trump would follow that course - only  thing Trump seems to be following NORTH Korea and his ""love"" Kim  Jong Un and not South Korea which handled its response quickly, effectively and successfully,  Instead the US got lies, mis-direction, egoistic puffery, and  dithering based on the narcissistic need for constant accolades and praise for the Dear Leader.  I pray for our neighbours in America.  You need it more than ever in your history.
I would not go near the US right now - no need for Trump to put the military on the US -Canada  border - no Canadian in their right mind would give up our universal health care system and sane leadership for what is going on.  
The other unmentionable is these right-leaning  wing-nuts probably own the vast majority of the 400 million guns floating around your country.  Please work to calm things down for the sake of the rest of the world!

2020-03-28 20:47,"When Trump mentioned ""The Deep State,"" it looked like Dr. Fauci sort of giggled and he touched his face to hide it. Trump himself had a playful vibe when he mentioned it so I feel like he was just reflecting the mood. Who knows how the Dr. feels personally, but I feel like the head touching part was taken out of context."
2020-03-28 20:52,"It is all to easy to blame Trump for this, as he is such a disgusting example of a human being.  The truth, though, is that the start of this goes back much further and much deeper within the Republican party.  One must go back at least to Gingrich to see the rise of hyper partisanship and attack on government per se."

2020-03-28 21:09,"On an HBO documentary, a communications expert explained that a threat our society is now facing is the ability to discern reality and facts — call it Reality A — from Reality B, which consists of intentionally manufactured, scripted content made up of lies, deceptions and outright falsehoods. The further point: we are not prepared to see Reality B for what it is, causing both realities to compete equally for citizen understanding and acceptance.

The assault on Fauci is Reality B in all its disgraceful prominence. This article should have stated in the first paragraph and in no uncertain terms that the criticisms are unwarranted, false, baseless, untrue and part of an organized campaign to destroy the good doctor’s reputation.

Truth — verifiable facts — is under frontal assault."

Targeting Dr Fauci is against Twitter rules.  Report them when you see it!
Both Twitter and Facebook must do their share to keep misinformation and threats off their sites!

Tragically, for them and those they have been in contact with, it will be too late."
2020-03-28 20:49,"If anything, Dr. Fauci should wear these far right-wing attacks as a source of pride especially because those who are taking aim at him have as much medical knowledge of this virus as the president does.
And that is to say the least, none."
2020-03-28 20:38,"Dr. Fauci is direct and tells the absolute truth, unlike Trump and his followers who deny, deny, deny the truth and reality of COVID 19. It is the latter that is so dangerous and will get many more thousands of Americans killed.  The little deadly virus doesn't care what you ""believe or what you wish to be true"", it just latches on and passes easily from person to person  creating devastating illness  and death as it marches  across the country.  Only Fauci has been willing to tell the truth.  The right-wing and Trump  are only interested in lying and blowing smoke about the deadly threat."

2020-03-28 20:54,"Is this what it's come to? A brilliant scientist, in order to serve and save the people, endures a willfully ignorant head of state only to be vilified for his scientific truth.

Maybe the hate is thing.  There's a place to direct it in a conspiracy theory.  I was hoping everyone would be better in this situation.  You know, lay down the swords so to speak. Then again, when people are scalping disinfectant and hoarding medical supplies, why would I expect anything like decency?  I hope Dr. Fauci is able to avoid hearing about such things. and I.m sorry for the personal nature these attacks (theories has too intelligent a connotation.)

2020-03-28 21:25,"Recently, PBS Frontline did an investigative journalism deep dive report on China and specifically Chinese politics and politicians.

China's politicians are more apt to be educated engineers or computer scientists than lawyers.
The difference being that the Chinese politicos must understand and respect science in order to progress their society. 

It was very revealing to learn that China regards science as their future, because it is our future too. Technology and discovery are what the Chinese government officials want their populace to pursue.  It makes sense.  The discoveries of the past century were all feats of science, math, arts, technological advances and engineering. 
Arts is not a typo, yes. We needs the arts too,  Steve Jobs calligraphy inspired his early Mac design.

The US will benefit from more diversity in our elected officials: medical doctors, engineers of all stripes; biologists, chemists, physicists, artists and many with computer science degrees and yes, some lawyers.

The concentration of lawyers in this congress are not serving us well, their constituents.

A diversity of ideas from varied backgrounds and from those who look like the US is needed in our government.

The photograph of the signing of the $2+Trillion bill yesterday looks nothing like the country that it was being signed for.

And that is SAD."
2020-03-28 20:28,"Oh, for crying out loud!  The people who are criticizing Dr. Fauci for putting his hand to his face to cover his smile at Trump's Freudian slip have, at very least, no sense of humor.  (At worst they are overzealous, dangerous cultists.)  I heard and saw that incident.  It was amusing.  We often laugh at other people's slip-ups but we mean nothing malignant. Ironic things can be funny.  Or sad.  Or telling."
2020-03-28 21:25,"Of course, people seeing evolutionism and science contradictory to Christianism will not like Dr. Faucy (being a Catholic I see no contradictions).

But this is not about the distrust of science. This is about a sect like movement. The same ones who would think it is OK for Trump to shoot somebody in 5th Ave. The ones protecting the messianic ego of the president.

Dr. Fauci does not flinch. He does his job which is almost not found in that Mickey Mouse team. Dr. Fauci must also know that it is not only science that make some hate him. It happens that Dr. Fauci has the same exact voice pitch as Sanders. That adds insult to injury. To them."
2020-03-28 20:33,"Any disagreement with Trump, who could not stay on story or tell the truth if his life depended upon it is pounced on immediately by Judicial Watch and other right wing organizations. Fauci is not a true believer in the lies that Trump tell; therefore, he is portrayed as a liberal liar who is out to keep the President from being re-elected! This is too close to ""1984"" where lies are turned into truths and everyone is afraid to tell the Emperor he is unclothed!

The goal of many conservatives is to get their way without regard for science, truth, and honesty. If you don't like the facts, then offer ""alternative"" facts. If the speaker is a scientist, paint him as a liar who possesses an agenda. If caught in a lie, then scream that the Democrats are worse. This will continue as long as every action, behavior, and statement is filtered through a liberal-conservative analysis.  Corona virus has no politics, but politicians are doing their damnest to make everything politics!"

He could not even solve a dispute between 2 people in a fair way, how could you give him the whole country? Unbelievable."
2020-03-28 21:00,"Dr. Fauci is the only steady hand in this national nightmare.
This, as Mr. Trump has a perverse ability to deny obvious facts that you know intuitively and delete it from being covered by the media.
The media moves on to cover the latest shiny object he pulls from his pocket. Almost no one talks of his disregard for the sick and dying. But will debate his absurd crowding of churches on Easter.
This is what happened in 1930's Germany. An us -versus -them mentality, no respect for others, a suffocating nationalism."

We are faced with an epic pandemic bringing death to tens of thousands and yet these anger- and hate-filled individuals are so caught up in their own death wish that they'd rather kill the messenger than try to affirm life, love, human dignity and work to save lives.

Pretty sure this isn't a plucky band of passionate fellow citizens we're dealing with anymore."
2020-03-28 20:32,"I call on Michael Bloomberg to start using your wealth and vast media savvy to saturate the airwaves with the truth about Trump and Dr. Fauci.

Trump is ignorance personified.

He is evil.

Fauci is the opposite.

Who people side with is very telling."
2020-03-28 21:03,Give the man a break will you. He's just plain exhaused taking care of YOUR best interests. Show some gratitude for crying out loud. Love.
2020-03-28 20:27,Dr. Fauci is the best in the world and we are fortunate to have his leadership. Anyone who says otherwise is simply ignorant or willfully negligent of reason.
2020-03-28 21:07,"This happens in part because Times and other press won’t challenge Trump himself.  

He says outright citizens get to die if governors don’t flatter him. Where’s the follow up? Silence.

He says MI doing bad job.What evidence? Where’s the follow up? Silence.

Insults a reporter. Other reporters happy to move on to next question. Make him answer first.  

Pathetic. Complicit."
2020-03-28 20:59,"Those who mock Tony Fauci may wish they had listened to him, rather than to their faux hero, trump; that is, if they live to tell the tale."
2020-03-28 21:39,What is wrong with these people ? They (the far right) seem to be lacking in every positive human trait that I’m aware of. Even animals don’t behave like this.
2020-03-28 21:11,"Fauci is undermining the President: with facts and reason, things Trump knows and cares nothing about."
2020-03-28 20:22,"Dr. Anthony Fauci bases his comments and advice on Science.

The Twitter in Chief bases his comments and advice on lies.

That is why the management of the grave situation of the coronavirus pandemic from the Oval Office in the US resembles that of a Banana Republic."
2020-03-28 21:09,"When a trump cult follower becomes seriously ill, does this person sacrifice a goat, lamb, or perhaps a first-born son to their lord? Or, does he or she seek out an elite physician at a world-class hospital? Ignore the shameless words of these hypocrites and measure them by their actions.  What they say in obeisance to their lord has little overlap with what they really believe about scientists and their expert knowledge."
2020-03-28 21:12,"These right-wingers who support the theory of Trumpian infallibity seem to have become more vocal as more and more of them find themselves with too much time on their hands as their jobs and future prospects disappear. I wonder what they will do if their Dear Leader recommends that they take methanol or hydroxychloroquine phosphate to counter symptoms of Covid-19.

Dr. Fauci certainly doesn't need this grief after 40+ years of fighting infectious diseases."
2020-03-28 20:21,"Just gimmee some truth! Dr Fauci is a dedicated public servant and brings credibility, truth, reason to the table."
2020-03-28 20:45,These are trolls. Or fake accounts. Twitter needs to disable them and delete the hashtags.
2020-03-28 20:21,"For some, it must feel like a great threat to have a true expert in the room."
2020-03-28 20:31,Dr. Fauci--Please get some rest!  We need you!  You're the best--but please delegate a little to take some of the burden off yourself.  I'm holding you in the light--as the Quakers say.
2020-03-28 21:40,"Why do we still say 'Far Right'?  The country politically doesn't have any centrists on the 'right'.   There are zealots, pundits, a decentralized media/economic echochamber focused on a culture war and a whole bunch of confused people who been indoctrinated with years of incorrect and limited info.  
If driving on the Interstate with multiple lanes and someone is driving 20 mph in the left lane and the car behind them follows at the same 20 mph but doesn't honk, pass, or make space for the person behind them to pass then what is the difference between the troublemaker and the copycat?"
2020-03-28 20:36,"It is time for someone to step up and call for unity to fight this virus threat. The tribalism and radicalism that is driving these attacks is not helping anyone, does not save a single life and will not restart the economy at the end of the crisis. It is 100% useless....and the virus does not care of you are a Trump devote or not when it decides to attack your body. Behave patriotic and start working to save as many lives as possible or “shut up” while others are trying to protect your life."
2020-03-28 21:11,"Wow. To all those far-right folks who think that Dr. Fauci is a fraud and that Trump relaxing social distancing on April 12th is a good idea, you better start brushing up on tracheal intubation and working your own ventilators. This is real, and eventually all the hard working healthcare professionals are going get sick, die, burn out or just quit. Don't forget, then you're on your own. I hear there are some good ventilator tutorials on YouTube. Ponder that."
2020-03-28 21:15,Time for all the Evangelicals to go to church hold hand and pray for us.
2020-03-28 20:31,Dr. Fauci was suppressing a smile.  The media gets this one wrong again.
2020-03-28 21:18,"You know...I never thought in my 80 years, that I'd see the United States in this situation, being ruled by a corrupt man and a minority of corrupt enablers.  And now this country has been brought to its knees by a terrible virus. And the leadership doesn't exist and the scientist are 'bad' people.  What next, a civil revolution, much like France had in the 18th century?  It wouldn't surprise me and at this point, nothing would surprise me.  I weep for the young."
2020-03-28 21:07,This is outrageous and the reason I will never vote for a republican again. Ever.
2020-03-28 20:35,The far right should follow the advice of their leader.  Pack the churches on Easter.  Please do.
2020-03-28 21:10,“Far Right” in today’s America is the entire Republican Party. Don’t pretend there’s no connection between Republicans and far-right extremism. They’re joined at the hips.
2020-03-28 21:42,"The stupidification of this nation is astounding. When Easter comes and the death toll is has doubled three or four times (let's hope not more), perhaps people will stop listening to these ridiculous conspiracy theories and acknowledge that this issue is beyond Trump's ability to understand.  There is always going to be a small number of people with wacky ideas but they just shouldn't get amplification like this now and they should be consistently called out for their counterproductive and dangerous nature."
2020-03-28 21:43,"Dr. Fauci is a hero, a lone figure with his head firmly on his shoulders countering the sea of misinformation. An astute technocrat who has salvaged a dire situation standing his ground and working hard to push the truth to country and the world about the pandemic."
2020-03-28 21:44,"Doesn't surprise me.  I talked with an acquaintance, a nice fellow but an unquestioning Trump supporter, who insisted that the the reason the coronavirus has spread so virulently is that America's hospitals didn't start testing fast enough or process tests efficiently.  In other words, it was our medical personnel who brought this nightmare onto themselves.

It also wouldn't surprise me if the rumors about Dr. Fauci were started with Trump's blessing.  After all, why should some random short guy sharing the podium get more attention than the brilliant and all-knowing genius Donald Trump?"
2020-03-28 21:44,Perhaps he will replace him with Jared his go to guy for all seasons.   Or Rodriquez?

2020-03-28 21:47,"I'm finding it difficult to be civil with this kind of garbage going on. Now truth is becoming ""sensationalism"" or ""fake news"" or just ""bad reporting"" when it doesn't completely agree with the endlessly changing pronouncements of our Leader. (I don't want to call him a President anymore, since his performance doesn't fit with my understanding of that role.) And Dr. Fauci, with scientific knowledge, years of experience, and the respect of his peers, is being maligned because his is trying to keep more people alive. Do people really prefer the ""information"" that comes from the Vice President, where every other sentence extols the benevolence and supreme genius of our Leader? People in this country who want to live this way really need to visit North Korea more often. I'm thinking maybe i should retire to Estonia - it seems calmer and much more democratic there."
2020-03-28 21:20,"Why are people afraid to criticize and confront Trump?  He is not untouchable.  Every briefing that Trump gives, at least one reporter should ask him about his 2 month delay in responding to this deadly pandemic and what gave him the idea that this was a “Democrat hoax” to make him look bad for the upcoming Presidential election.  What proof does he have of that and why didn’t he act sooner with aggressive testing, case identification and isolation as Taiwan and South Korea did.  Reporters should confront him with, “Why does he feel that despite being President, he can take no responsibility?”
Why is Trump not able to be confronted to his face?  Isn’t that what investigative journalism is about?"
2020-03-28 20:24,"Trump’s cult believe anything crazy, if you don’t believe it, just read the insane comments they make on Fox. Trump and Fox brought us to this Twilight Zone and I wonder if we will survive it."
2020-03-28 21:39,"Tom Fitton is the chief officer of Judicial Watch, a tax exempt foundation which calls itself ""a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation.""

2020-03-28 21:38,"I fear the online juggernaut that got Trump elected in 2016 is flexing its muscles, getting ready for the 2020 election. Dr. Fauci is just a convenient target ... for now."
2020-03-28 20:45,"Isn't Dr Fauci himself pleading media to not pit him against President Trump? What a pity that nobody in the media listens to him, while we are all talking about we have to trust/listen to experts/scientists."
2020-03-28 21:22,"An honest man.  Yet the far right fawns over Dr Birx who kowtows and grovels to Trump almost as pathetically as Vice Sycophant Pence.  Diogenes was right it's time to give up looking for an honest man, or woman in the Trump regime."
2020-03-28 21:48,"COVID-19 will enjoy a robust rampage across the American body politic owing to our biggest vulnerability - hyper-partisan division.  If we don’t find a way to get right with one another and in a hurry, this brush fire will erupt into an all engulfing inferno."
2020-03-28 21:49,Trump and the far right need to be reminded every day of the damage they have done to our country by not listening to scientists and doctors. This is what non winning looks like.
2020-03-28 21:15,I can't take all this winning.
2020-03-28 21:37,These people who denounce experts will be very glad then they need one but they do not consider such a case. I wouldn’t want to have a beginner or ignorant handle my ventilator as this us not a job fir non experts. Do they know how these machines are working? It needs alit if experience and understanding to run it successfully this is not a simple pump. Crazy what is discussed instead.
2020-03-28 21:30,Unfortunately it will not get through until some large evangelical churches parishioners come down with the virus. I hope that doesn’t have to happen before these people wake up.
2020-03-28 21:06,"The Trump vs Fauci tension is one emblematic of the whole Trump administration. Lies and conspiracy theories vs facts and rational thought.
Fauci appears to be intelligent, committed, and genuinely interested in helping people. Trump certainly is none of these things, so we are lucky to have Fauci as part of the team fighting the spread of this virus"
2020-03-28 21:25,"Dr. Fauci’s vital public service is the story, not his inevitable detractors."
2020-03-28 21:49,"As a now-retired scientist, I have always had the highest professional regard for Dr. Fauci.  In his present position, I am fairly confident that he has never had to thread the needle so carefully in his life.  Sandwiched between an antiscience administration of hard-right idealogs and what he knows as the scientific facts he is working on a knife edge that he has probably never had to negotiate before.  I say to him, continue to be brave for the people you know you serve and talk truth to power.

When I read such things these days I sometimes allow myself to imagine that perhaps things might be better for the USA if those who believe more about biblical and ideological answers to modern problems than to science and rationality would simply self-select to the southern part of our country and form a new autonomous country.  They could name it ""The Confederate States of America"".  It could be done bloodlessly by mutual consent.  We would, however, need to build a wall - a beautiful wall."
2020-03-28 21:50,"I wonder how many deaths in the US and around the world from the Corona virus will it take before the deniers will recognize this as a life threatening disease and not some government hoax?

I am grateful for the brave folks in our country who are risking their own lives to help those who have been diagnosed with this terrible disease. Thank God for Dr. Fauci and pray that he and all the other medical workers around the world escape infection."
2020-03-28 21:50,"Dr. Fauci is the only person on the stage during these press conferences that I trust.  He is the only one on stage who has no axe to grind, no partisan standing.  He is the only one on stage who's only goal is to protect as many U.S. residents as possible from the deadly COVID-19.  He deserves a place in heaven and our prayers."
2020-03-28 21:51,"There is a unique irony in this action by the Far Right. A first year law student and any fair-minded person who has observed Dr Fauci acting tirelessly to treat and make treatment options intelligible to a justifiably frightened public as well as those in a position to act, knows this is defamation: it's false and its propagators know it is (even if not actionable because the doctor is apparently a public figure whose legal burdens are therefore greatly  increased,were he to sue). 

The irony is that it is smearing a long-established expert - and hero really - in this area of medicine, which smear is done on behalf of someone who - when the history of this tragic human period is written - will be found to have been responsible for needless deaths and more, because of his intentional failure to have acted timely and fully, in order to serve his own political ends.

The only question for the historians will be just how many deaths is Trump responsible for."
2020-03-28 21:52,"But isn't that exactly what's needed: A mobilization to undermine the President? Three-and-a-half years into this fiasco and there has been no concerted effort by those few straight-talkers in his entourage to simply say what needs to be said. In front of the cameras. In front of Trump. ""What the President has just said is utterly false."" and other like statements. I feel certain that if two or three brave individuals (including Dr Fauci) said just that, then others would follow, and the whole house of cards would fall within a week or two.

Am I deluding myself? From across the border we watch and wonder at the absurdity of the whole situation, and how it's been allowed to continue for so long."
2020-03-28 21:52,This is one of the saddest articles I’ve read recently.  What has this once great nation become?
2020-03-28 21:54,The spectacle of truth being spoken within feet of Donald Trump is delightful. He is wilted in its presence.
2020-03-28 21:54,"Scientists deserves support and respect. This administration has no respect and punishes honest, qualified people for speaking the truth. Let's punish this administration in November and return our government to people who deserve to be heard because the actually know what they're talking about.

We've had enough chaos. Support professionalism this November."
2020-03-28 21:55,"How does a man like Trump have the audacity to try to blemish the reputation of Dr. Fauci who has done more in his lifetime to benefit mankind than can be counted. 
There aren't enough 4 letter words to describe how I feel about Trump. This person has not got one ounce of human feelings.  He is entirely involved in marketing how wonderful he is and to make as much money as he can off the backs of hardworking honest people, avoiding military service, taxes and anything that would benefit others and belittling those who don't worship him but do what they can to benefit humanity."
2020-03-28 21:48,Wouldn't it be great if all the conspiracy theorists could get together in one place and trade stories that prove the veracity of their suspicions?  Perhaps at a beach in Florida or the French Quarter in New Orleans. Easter Sunday would be the ideal time
2020-03-28 21:49,I have this fantasy that Trump will deal with this (awful but unsurprising) lunacy by forcefully and publicly defending Dr. Fauci. Let me repeat: it’s a fantasy.
2020-03-28 21:24,"Could the Fauci naysayers=Trump-lovers=persons lacking reason, logic, and scientific understanding go to one state (Mississippi comes to mind, after letting the not dumb people out). Trump and Pence can run their little world and hang out and do whatever people who don't comprehend science do.  We'll put yellow tape around said state so that these 'unique' individuals and their genius leaders stay in...not to worry no one else will go there."
2020-03-28 21:56,"To many Americans and the entire medical community, Dr. Fauci, a leading expert on viruses, is highly respected for providing the coutnry with consistent, factual information about the coronavirus pandemic – even if it means contradicting Trump. 
The stringent restrictions on gatherings he proposed and his dire predictions about a rising death toll are - unfortunately - at odds with Trump’s naïve outlook. 
Now those right-wing, pro-Trump fanatics see Fauci as a threat to their president. 
It doesn’t help that Trump – apparently – listens to conspiracy theories cooked up by his uniquely ignorant son-in-law, Jared Kushner. 
Trump’s unqualified advisers and  pundits seem alarmed that Fauci tamps down Trump’s optimism over quick-fix solutions. Trump said not long ago that the virus “will go away” in April, urging Americans to go back to work. 
Ahead of the November elections they can’t afford to tank the economy."
2020-03-28 21:56,"The reactionaries simply don't like Dr. Fauci contradicting their personification of veracity and light Donald Trump. They also appear to care more about the economy and their 401Ks than all the people who are dying. 

Fauci just needs to tune out all the extraneous noise and keep telling the truth to America, because we know Trump can't."
2020-03-28 21:42,"Just wondering when the press pool will ask Trump directly about this, and ask him if he is willing to repudiate theses delusional, paranoid theories. Pretty sure his response will be crack-paranoid loopy, accompanied by an attack on the reporter who asks, followed by banning the poor person from all further press briefings (which may actually be a relief— there is only so much crazy one person can stand.)"
2020-03-28 21:56,"As USA divided along tribal politics descents into individualism and populism lauding its own experts, China is on the ascent with an army of educated people willing to work hard for the sake of their nation."
2020-03-28 21:56,"Ignorance begets a mean spirit, curiosity humility.  Fauci gets that it's as simple as that.  He'll be fine whatever shakes out on far-right social media.
Thank you for your service, Dr. Fauci.  Keep up the good work!"
2020-03-28 21:48,"Right-wing conspiracy theory cranks have the critical thinking skills of a gnat. What they say doesn't matter, won't contribute to anything, and only makes sense to those so afflicted. Why even profile the lowest fifth percentile of the class?"
2020-03-28 21:31,"Trump is an expert on the new mag lev aircraft launching systems on the next generation of aircraft carriers; he doesn't like them.  Trump has been recognized by unrecognizable sources as incredibly intelligent.  Trump is the chosen one.  Trump knew it was a pandemic while he was saying it was nothing and would disappear in no time flat.  Trump knows that New York doesn't need thirty or forty thousand ventilators but only a few hundred.  There isn't much that Trump doesn't know or isn't the world's number one expert concerning.  So, when professionals like Fauci contradicts Trump, his long tongue dupes get upset."
2020-03-28 21:57,Let's see.  Comments on social media?  It never ceases to amaze me the number of people in this world that are so single minded in their determination to demonstrate to the rest of the world how small minded they really are.
2020-03-28 21:58,"The QAnon hordes live in a state of delusion that is continually reinforced by their myriad online echo chambers. They see Trump as a literal savior, and view any challenge or threat to his dominance as worthy of malicious attack. Our only hope is that the end of Trump's presidency will deflate their obsession sufficiently to allow our country to move toward a better future."
2020-03-28 21:58,"Stand strong Dr. Fauci, you are doing good work and honoring your oath."
2020-03-28 21:40,"As for those who choose to believe this administration, as opposed to literally every medical expert in the world, perhaps we are witnessing evolution at work."
2020-03-28 21:38,A decent leader would admonish his supporters for their abuse against a respected scientist who works tirelessly for the nation. But trump is neither decent nor a leader. Trump and his right-wing ilk are sick to the core.
2020-03-28 21:50,"Trump is an anti-science president because science tends not to corroborate his views on relevant matters such as climate change and abortion.

So his stand on the virus is consistent. By the way, Bolsonaro of Brazil has a similar view on the virus to Trump and he's also anti-science."
2020-03-28 21:59,"Clearly, many do not understand that the President is fighting a different battle than is being fought by doctors, nurses and health officials.  He is locked in a struggle to the death with forces who oppose his re-election. It is clear from his vitriol that a few hundred thousand dead and millions suffering are not as significant as a clear and resounding victory against anyone opposing him."
2020-03-28 21:28,"This people has the same rights I have; they vote, consume, reproduce, walk free in the streets, access the Internet, flock together, discuss, express their opinions. This is democracy, correct ? It is in the Constitution, right ? I have to repeat this to myself many many times."
2020-03-28 21:25,"Trump could shut down this misinformation campaign against Fauci in a heartbeat, but he won’t because, as we all know by now, he feeds on hatred and lies, the meaner, the better. Even now, when the country is in a genuine state of crisis, he cannot bring himself to respect others’ expertise which we are so desperately in need of. A classic narcissist on so many levels."
2020-03-28 21:50,Dr Fauci is the scientist / professor / expert caricatured and discounted in every disaster B movie ever made.  Does he have a daughter torn between her devotion to her father and a romantic interest from a handsome man in the administration?  The circle would be unbroken.
2020-03-28 22:00,"Carl Sagan: “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”"
2020-03-28 21:27,"These online conspiracy theorists should put their theories to the test. Don't just sit behind your keyboards and webcams, get out there and hold a rally! Go out and meet one another in person, shake hands, show each other some support."
2020-03-28 22:01,"Sadly this was inevitable as the human and economic costs of Trump's, and his Administration's, mishandling of the pandemic continues to mount.

His reelection is clearly in doubt more now than ever and more than likely if  Trump's does not ""like"" how this pandemic plays  out for him over the next few weeks, surely Dr. Fauci and others will be fired.As they will never abandon their Hippocratic Oath, and abandon the American public if this misinformation campaign continues to threaten their credibility and ultimately the public's health.

More power to you Dr. Fauci and others. You are our firewall against this incompetent Administration.

We stand with you and your colleagues, as I am sure the governors of all  50 states led by Gov. Cuomo will, to help guide us through this crisis."
2020-03-28 21:26,"For a long time I blamed Trump. Now I realize he is simply the leader of the crazy tribe, and alas, they're allowed to vote."
2020-03-28 22:01,"Fauci is brilliant.  So is Brix.  They will analyze everything and come up with a path for public health.  They will need to partner with Business leaders to balance out the plan with the ability for the American people to be able to take charge of their lives once again, economically and spiritually.  Both are needed for a healthy USA and that is a tall order.  instead of alienating 1/2 the population with political rhetoric on both sides,  why can't we agree to solve the crisis at hand.  I don't think keeping us at home for 18 months is a viable solution nor is herd immunity with no slowing of the spread.  We need a balance. Our country is great because we have different points of view, IMHO.  Forget the fringe on both sides, the majority of us are solid, hard working people."
2020-03-28 21:23,"I would never wish ill on anyone... 
But I'm wondering if this will all shift when these right wing communities that doubt corona is real start to get sick."
2020-03-28 21:24,Can’t people just stop? Enough already....Dr. Fauci is a patriot and more knowledgable then the current resident in the White House. So tired of people defending trump’s insecurities. trump is not the stable genius that he thinks he is and he’s followers are just as insecure.
2020-03-28 21:37,Call your senators and congressmen and congresswomen to keep Dr. Fauci safe from Trump.
2020-03-28 21:31,"Of all the personal attributes, vast knowledge, experience and calm, personable demeanor that one can laud Dr. Fauci with and for all the deep credibility he has with the rest of the world, the grotesque defacement currently leading the United States reveals his ignorant resentment by ""praising” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci as a “major television star.” This was the first sentence in Ms Haberman’s recent 23 March NYT piece.
Peering through his dense green-eyed fog, this attention seeking,  mean spirited, science denier probably has no understanding of why millions of people follow every word offered by Dr Fauci and he clearly resents the attention and adulation Dr Fauci receives.
Why  doesn’t he instead, look into his own soul or whatever he has replaced that with,  where he will likely find he has created  nothing in himself that can be liked or admired.
Dr Fauci is our light as we navigate the new unknown we now inhabit.
Could someone please get the so-called President to step out of the way, sit down and be quiet."
2020-03-28 21:23,Trump is a national disgrace.  It's time for his supporters to wake up.  Time is examine the truth and proceed from there.  We need to focus on what is needed right now.  We are in the middle of an emergency.  Let's concentrate on that.
2020-03-28 21:43,"Grateful and Deeply Thankful to you Dr. Fauci!
You are strongly supported, admired and loved for your medical expertise, wisdom, thoughtfulness, and calm. The voice of truth and reason during this chaos.

Most, unfortunately, we have an evil, toxic and ignorant, Dictator 
Trump and Co.ruining our country. He could have acted quickly when the virus started in the cruel and barbaric Wuhan animal live market (same market SARS originated), to prepare for the arrival of Covid -19 but instead, he ignored way too long prior to taking action."
2020-03-28 21:23,"If Dr. Fauci is not up there, it'll be all the more reason for all broadcast media not to air these dangerous Trump rallies. Fauci can work with the Biden campaign and other news sources to keep us safe. Terrible times. And entirely predictable that Jared & Co. would do to him what they did to Marie Yovanovitch."
2020-03-28 21:10,"This proves the adage, “You can’t please everyone.” In the article is says there ar70 Twitter accounts. Twitter has millions though so it’s not that large a crowd. But it won’t matter what you do.  
Dr. Fauci is a great example of what we need in government. It’s serious business for him and he speaks up to the problem. He is animated and reassuring when speaks of the virus.  His message has stayed the same from day one: “This is serious. 
Meanwhile the President has no consistent program. He drones on with the numbers and throws magical thinking and innuendo for good measure. He said he takes no responsibility. 
Shelter in Place and stay safe"
2020-03-28 21:24,"With this kind of savaging of a good man's reputation, an American hero in fact, can anyone doubt that the United States is the object of insidious outside influences pitting us against one another to take our country down?"
2020-03-28 21:05,"In response to the H1N1 virus, the Bush and then Obama administrations developed nation wide non pharmaceutical preparedness plans to protect us from the inevitable next outbreak of a novel virus. The Trump administration was alerted that this was a top national priority and executive responsibility. 

Not a border wall. Not a Space Force. Not beach front real estate deals in North Korea. Not sword dances in Saudi Arabia. Not putting the Trump name on Israeli settlements in occupied territory. Not trade wars. Not tweet storms. Not rallies of the faithful. Not obstructing Congress. Not dishing dirt on political opponents. Not cleansing the Executive branch of public servants loyal to America. Not undermining government agencies. Not the million and one things Trump's been doing instead of his job,

Now the eminent and admirable Dr. Fauci has been trying to spare us from the worst of Trump incompetence.  We are grateful. Trump's base is reflexively vicious. 

I can understand a virus. I cannot understand this hate filled cult of personality that has evolved around Trump. And which is more toxic than anything nature can throw at us. I wish someone could explain it to me.,"
2020-03-28 22:03,"Can  a gathering for all the deep state conspiracy theorists  be organized? Something like Burning Man for the far right? They can have an extravagant bonding experience out in the desert, camping very close to one another, and listening to speeches from their leaders such as Rush Limbaugh, and Alex Jones. 
They can form their own state, and have their own medical facilities. Let's quarantine them out there for a few months and see how long it takes before they come back begging for medical help."
2020-03-28 21:18,"We are now dealing with competing diseases. One, COVID-19, a public health crisis and another, is far-right conspiracy theories. Both kill. The way trump continues to communicate is no surprise, but it is disappointing and appalling. He continues to damage our county and degrade humanity. Those who follow him, support him, or whatever, are just as guilty as he is, if not more so. If you are a far-right conservative your actions are sinister, and evil. You are engaged in WILLFUL IGNORANCE, for which one should be held accountable by the courts, as well as by public opinion, for it is is a CRIME."
2020-03-28 21:33,"The media must protect Dr. Fauci. We need this voice of truth and reason in America right now. What we don’t need is the Times publishing photos that will stir the fire of falsehoods coming from ignorant sources.
What was the journalistic good of putting this photo out and thus ramping up the vitriol against him? 
Those who keep informed of the facts already know and appreciate his wisdom and steady truth. We don’t need reaffirmation of it.
STOP subjecting him to potential harm."
2020-03-28 21:28,Evidently the far right lives on another plane with their own reality.
2020-03-28 21:32,Trump needs to go! He’s the biggest danger the American people have ever faced. He’s a malevolent force determined to undermine the core of American values. His followers need to be prosecuted for their support of conspiracy theories designed to harm the well being of the public. I implore the media to expose him and his followers as a force of anti-American  propaganda deserving nothing short of a life in prison.
2020-03-28 21:24,"Lets face it. Anyone that aligns with fact, honesty, or science is suddenly against Trump"
2020-03-28 22:07,"The word despicable comes to mind. And I’m not one to use that word often, not lightly. Dr. Fauci has spent his adult life in service to the health and well-being of his fellow citizens. His life is an example of the pursuit of truth and integrity. I’m reminded of the saying, “birds peck at the best fruit.”  In this case, vultures."
2020-03-28 22:07,"This is one of the most disturbing articles I have read. Dr. Fauci is a physician and scientist with few equals in all of medicine. He has been revered in the medical community for two generations. I have personally been inspired by him since 1982 when, as a third year medical student, I met a critically ill patient admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital with what turned out to be Wegener's Granulomatosis. Every paper that I read on the the subject at the time had his name on it, and he is largely responsible for turning that disease from one that was near uniformly fatal to highly treatable and curable. That critically ill patient left the hospital thanks to work done by Dr. Fauci in the 1970s and is only one example of the many lives around the world saved by Dr. Fauci's work in his more than 50 year career.

Dr. Fauci is a national treasure. The politically driven anti-Fauci sentiment reinforced by Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group;  Bill Mitchell host of the far-right online talk show “YourVoice America”; Shiva Ayyadurai, all named in this article, and other outspoken Trump supporters sickens and angers me and it should you too. Many of us owe our lives and the lives of our loved ones to him and his work. They owe him, the country, and the world an apology. And when they are done apologizing to Dr. Fauci, they need to offer him their thanks for all his has done to improve the health and welfare of people around the world."
2020-03-28 21:46,"Some of these people are probably Russians. The others, the Americans who push and parrot these intellectually bankrupt memes, are narrow-minded troglodytes. We must do everything we can to disenfranchise them, using the same underhanded tactics they've used for years. There is no Sorkinesque political revival in our future. Our leaders who still spout this nonsense about Americans coming together and uniting are either too dense or self-serving to know that this is a zero-sum game."
2020-03-28 22:10,"I can't listen to the White House press briefings any more, even though it means missing whatever Fauci or Brix might be permitted to contribute.  Trump's redundant belaboring, bragging, and blue-skying about his exaggerated or even imaginary progress and accomplishments, and his blaming of China, state governments, or the previous administration for problems, ratchets up anxiety and despair to a level I can't cope with.

Whereas listening to Fauci, Cuomo, General Semonite, or any other competent and truth-telling leader or authority speak makes me feel proud, hopeful or at least better informed.  If only our political leaders would cede the podium to them.  We deserve a lot better than what we're getting."
2020-03-28 21:38,"Please remember many of the accounts on Twitter are hot genuine, they could be Russian trolls or other bad actors. Many of your readers may not be aware of this."
2020-03-28 22:13,"To be despised by Donald Trump is an honor. Wear it with pride, Dr. Fauci. You have courage and character that history will remember. As a doctor myself (Ph.D.), I salute you."
2020-03-28 22:14,"Ok, it's starting to seem like this country really will fall apart at the seams.  I think we on the coasts blinded ourselves to the myth of American exceptionalism, & that was exacerbated by the general cultural inclination to stick to the superficial, & the habit of putting a spin on everything, such that we're now in a situation where telling the truth can be dangerous if it's not what people want to hear."
2020-03-28 22:16,"I fully expect Trump to fire Dr. Fauci when we're through this. Regrettably, it will not be right but that's the kind of person Trump is. Having put up with Trump through this, Dr. Fauci may be happy to leave.

If he fires Dr. Fauci  before we are through this. I hope you will join me in rising up and letting every politician you know that this cannot be allowed to stand. Trump's narcissism is one thing. The health and lives of my family and friends and the citizens of this country is another thing."
2020-03-28 22:21,Dr. Fauci is a distinguished and respected physician and scientist with world-wide regard.  Americans already know he is knowledgeable and trustworthy. Only the president's base will be swayed by the despicable smear attempts on Dr. Fauci's reputation.  The true leaders in the COVID-19 battle (the governors and mayors) will continue to listen to the scientific findings explained by Dr. Fauci and will do their best to act on them in their constituents' best interests.
2020-03-28 22:22,"Fauci is making Trump’s supporters angry because he’s contradicting Trump and so undermining trust in him. Whether what Trump says is factually incorrect is not relevant to these people. When people act this unreasonably, it means that their feelings are overwhelming their reasoning. Either they will sober up when they realize that Trump is not the man that they wish him to be or they won’t. All anyone can do is just continue to deal with reality and accept that Trump may never do so."
2020-03-28 22:22,"I first saw Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the Nat. Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD jogging from his office past the building I worked in which housed the lab. of Viral Diseases in 1985. It was the time when HIV pandemic was just getting to becoming a public health concern and the AIDS activism was getting to be a wake up call to the Reagan admin. to do more to allocate more funding for HIV treatment. ACTUP as the activists called themselves demonstrated in front of the NIH building 1 where the Director of NIH had an office just across from building 31 where the office of DR. Fauci was. His office was occupied by ACT UP activists for I don't remember how many days but I saw clothes  of the activists hanging on the windows of Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci was my post doctoral mentor's administrative boss. I would have opportunities to see him but conversed with him just twice. 

Dr. Fauci is undoubtedly the most articulate Infectious disease specialist in the US. Through 6 presidents Dr. Fauci has been the public face on talk shows for NIH. THE NIH is the flagship of the US govt and has received bipartisan support for whatever funding requests that were made. Dr. Fauci has the entire US congress wrapped around his finger and I don't think there was anyone knowledgeable enough in Congress to challenge Dr. Fauci and ask for accountability. He never met anyone like Trump. But together the duo does just fine."
2020-03-28 22:23,"Dr Fauci looked tired and slightly under the weather to me, he is nearly 80 years old after all.  No reasonable person could think he had the time or inclination to throw shade at Trump in the middle of  a pandemic.  Could the conspiracy theorists please agree to stay out of the hospitals should they become infected with Covid-19 and treat themselves at home with one of Trump's remedies?  Thank you."
2020-03-28 22:00,This should come as no surprise because there will have to be somebody other than Trump to blame for him losing the election. Trump isn't to blame for anything ever but can take credit for anything and everything that is done by others. So they have figured out that his days are numbered and are setting up the scenario so that there's someone to blame. Saddest part is that these same people wouldn't accept Trump's logic coming out of their 12 year olds mouth trying to justify their own bad behavior but they are perfectly willing to accept it as gospel coming out of the mouth of a 72 year old troll with tiny little hands.
2020-03-28 22:25,"While Trump supporters have shown themselves capable of stooping to such tactics, you also can't discount the possibility that some or all of this is the work of the Russians or the Chinese. The perfect time to sow discord in a society is precisely during a crisis when it is at its most vulnerable."
2020-03-28 22:23,"I long since gave up talking to Trumpists about anything or anyone who does not fit their world view. These people are seriously flawed, and generally unable to rationally examine any issue."
2020-03-28 21:57,"I don't know what the solution is to this variety of toxin spewing hatemonger. There do seem to be a lot of them out there. I feel as if all publicity makes this worse, and gives them a sense of power, plus attracting more losers.

We do not have any real rules in place, because for the most part, whatever is posted online is treated as if it were conversation, simple speech.   But it becomes advertising - often free advertising - for all manor of  vipers ( trolls are the least of it).  Perhaps it is time, especially as a generation more adept in the digital world gains influence,  to work out some internet rules. 

I personally think that laws should be adjusted to allow even public figures, so called, to take action against those who create blatant lies meant to cause harm. 

i know - this is a fraught area -- but I really believe that these so called fringe conspiracy generators can cause real damage."
2020-03-28 21:37,"I would say that the performance of Trump is no different than Nero or Caligula. Fox and Friends, no different than the grifters and sycophants that surrounded the emperors of old. And Trump's base, satisfied with bread tossed in the gladiatorial games held daily for their constant entertainment and distraction as Rome and the empire collapsed from within."
2020-03-28 21:42,"That headline is ironic – nobody undermines Trump as effectively as Trump. The fact that the right is now going after Dr. Fauci is just further proof of how far the right will go in its scorched earth culture wars. Though I'm not really sure it's an authentic culture war. I think it's also a monetized assault on truth that keeps making them richer and richer. In that sense they and Trump are a perfect pair, at least until the endgame when one has to turn on the other to survive – as in most criminal enterprises."
2020-03-28 21:24,"Makes me feel like Ralph Kramden, in the Honeymooners.
""I could just scream"""
2020-03-28 21:44,"I kind felt this would happen after Fauci went on all the late night talk shows that make fun of Trump. He wasn't asked any questions like that.

The media likes to make mountain out of molehills."
2020-03-28 21:29,"Just out of interest, does the President have the power to cancel the elections and mobilise the national guard if the virus is out of control by November ? He loves the worlds dictators and I'm sure he'd like to join the club if the opportunity arises."
2020-03-28 21:43,"Everybody who has worked for or in proximity to this President has probably struck this pose on more than one occasion, loyalist or not.  Dr. Fauci just happened to be on public view.  Trump supporters should quit deriding upstanding people like Dr. Fauci and realize what this image says about our President.  Trump speaks without knowing the facts and abuses his power."
2020-03-28 22:22,"As has been the case since he announced his candidacy (okay, to be more accurate, insert “his entire adult life”) the only person undermining Donald Trump is Donald Trump."
2020-03-28 22:26,"The paranoia in the present administration is incredible. The only thing Dr. Fauci is mobilizing to undermine is the virus.

A leader who cannot bear to be corrected will never have a firm grasp of reality, and will resort to magical thinking time and time again. He will never be better than a second-rate (or worse) leader. And that, unfortunately, is the current state of things in the USA during this serious international pandemic."
2020-03-28 22:27,"This type of disinformation, attempting to undermine Dr. Fauci's credibility, could clearly lead segments of the population to behave in ways that place their lives, and the lives of others, at risk. This behavior should not be protected as free speech, with all that is implied by that."
2020-03-28 22:12,"Even a pandemic does not stop stupidity, which may be more harmful than the virus."
2020-03-28 22:15,"Dr. Fauci is in a very difficult position, having to stand on a platform with a guy who has the microphone and just makes stuff up.  Pence just stands there like an adoring zombie, and that is what Trump wants.  Apparently that is what the far right wants too.  The only redeeming fact is these far right types are actually less than 1 in 100 of the US population.  Loud mouths, but, thank you Jesus, small numbers.  Decent conservatives want to have the facts from an honest expert, rather than hateful rants from people with personality issues."
2020-03-28 22:29,Who needs the Chinese and Russians to spread disinformation when we have so  much local talent eager to delay treatment and recovery of the thousands now suffering from this disease? I think Dr. Fauci is great.  The only reason for watching  Trump's so-called press conferences (in reality campaign rallies).  So  the good doctor's face itched and he put his hand up to scratch it.  So what?
2020-03-28 22:29,I think we are only just starting to feel the virus. It will get much worse in the next month or two and maybe even longer. I think some people may change their minds about science and Dr. Fauci. Or maybe not.
2020-03-28 22:29,"We keep hearing, people in the Some areas  don't understand exponential math.
How about we make the whole country watch that ""Star Trek"" episode, it's famous: ""The Trouble With Tribbles."" Or that shampoo commercial fro years ago:
""'I told 2 friends, and they told 2 friends and so on and so on...""

Would that make things any clearer?"
2020-03-28 21:47,"Please don't blame ""partisanship.""  Trump is a master of the verbal knife in the back.  Mostly, these folks revere that kind of approach and see it as real mastery.  The rest of them are likely from enemy troll farms ... who else could put out almost 800 tweets in one day?

It surely isn't the Democrats I know, even the Bernie Bros."
2020-03-28 21:29,Further confirmation that science and facts are the enemy of trump and trumpism. Dystopian hardly begins to describe the current state of our nation.
2020-03-28 21:39,"Dr.’s Fauci and Birx are the adults in the room.  Trump’s original guardrails, his generals who used to stand behind him, gave his acts of whimsy weight.  They apparently stayed on to keep Trump from acting on his worst instincts. The actual affect was to make Trump seem as if he were a legitimate leader.  They were what in a crime would be called accomplices, even if their intent was good.  Fauci and Birx and the other serious people behind Trump during press conferences, are invaluable to Trump, covering for his errors,  vague statements and lies.  Trump and his supporters have already bent Birx to their will; she never seems to have enough praise for Trump’s leadership and his willingness to listen to diverse perspectives. The pressure on Fauci is unnecessary and will be very counterproductive.  Fauci is all that stands between Trump and a Biblical-style disaster."
2020-03-28 21:41,"How did we allow this to happen? Are these trump supporters  disenfranchised and disenchanted by being left behind in the race to the top of the chain? Are the greedy capitalists?  Vulnerable sheep who fall prey to misinformation ? Who are they? 
Until we figure out the motives and dynamics of those who vote for him and address them, the rest of us are gonna perish with these self-destructive and tunnel visioned voters. Easier said than done but we owe it to humanity. Sadly in a democracy we live and die together. It is no longer enough for us to vote and hope for the best.
Dr Fauci, thank you for your service! We salute you sir!"
2020-03-28 21:23,"I know this is wicked, but just think - if Trumpsters continue to disregard Dr. Fauci's warnings, we won't have to worry about them showing up at the ballot box."
2020-03-28 21:29,"When we conquer Covid-19 and have a vaccine and move on with our lives we will need to tackle another pandemic in this country: stupidity. We are a nation with tens of millions of adults who are disturbingly undereducated and prone to believing anything without applying critical thought. We are reaping the result of decades of disinvestment in education while we engaged in quixotic foreign military adventures. Until we address the manifest failures of America, we will continue to spiral into a dystopia of pulp propaganda, mass gun violence and further erosion of civil rights. All the things people like Steve Bannon dream about."
2020-03-28 22:31,"The next administration should focus much of their work on rebuilding the education system in this country - particularly critical thinking skills. I also think it would be a good idea to offer the options of military or social service for 2 years after high school, with a focus on putting people in areas completely different from where they grew up. We really need people in this country to become better educated and more well-rounded human beings. We cannot continue on this path."
2020-03-28 21:38,"Well .... Trump and the GOP told us covid-19 was a ""liberal hoax"" for weeks, and now the US is the epicenter of a global pandemic, losing American lives each and every day (and even more so than the worst dictatorships out there), ONLY because the GOP decided to politicize this too, instead of taking firm action.

Weakest president ever."
2020-03-28 22:25,"A shout out to Dr Fauci.  When he's finishes speaking, I change the station. I bet I'm not the only one."
2020-03-28 22:10,"This is what happens when you allow the lowest common denominator, that being hate and ignorance on the far right, select a president of a great country. What a sad hour. We're all paying the price of our broken election system."
2020-03-28 22:22,"Which goes to show that the far right is made up of not-so-bright people, which we've known all along."
2020-03-28 21:41,"Anthony Fauci, MD, is a highly trained medical doctor who knows of what he speaks.  Trump is not.  There that's the difference."
2020-03-28 21:26,"Right-wing fanaticism has reached a new nadir in attacking Dr. Fauci and the true heroes of the coronavirus pandemic, our global medical professionals. The Presidential Medal of Freedom that Melania Trump shamelessly draped over Rush Limbaugh's neck during Donald Trump's State of the Union address rightfully belongs to Tony Fauci. I should mention Mitt Romney as well. Both have displayed the necessary moral integrity publicly to stand up to our self-burnishing president.

Within twenty-four hours, Mr. Trump erratically reversed course as he urged, entirely unsupported by any credible data,  that we abandon proven methods of social distancing in favor of county-by-county return to normalcy by Easter in the face of nearly nonexistent national testing which could guide us reliably. This sordid picture portrays insanity at its worst."
2020-03-28 22:34,Notable that Trump will not defend him. That speaks to a deeply flawed personality.
2020-03-28 22:38,"The Trump supporters I know in Ohio are zealous in denying science, facts, and assert one person's connection to another makes them equal to the other.  This article just shows their denial of science.  I hope at some point when Donald Trump is no longer in office we have peace.  The man can only accomplish things that harm someone.  Nothing is good.  Nothing."
2020-03-28 22:39,"In today’s NYT article on Scandinavia’s response to Covid 19, public health official Lars Tragardh said...Not only do citizens have confidence in public institutions and governmental agencies and vice versa, but high social trust exists among citizens, as well.  

 We are all just people trying to do our best in difficult circumstances. By looking down Dr. Fauci could have simply been experiencing fatigue.  Anyone who went through what HRC did over Benghazi would recognize how hard that process was. To acknowledge that fact is a simple act of humanity. 

Conspiracy-minded Americans are exhausting. People who undermine confidence in our institutions and public servants during a crisis are anti-American. I quit FB and Twitter because the are full of disinformation and most Americans - my friends among them - seem unable to tell the difference between that and information."
2020-03-28 22:40,"Those who believe in these conspiracy theories and who denigrate Dr. Fauci may ignore the advice we're all being given to preserve our health by staying home and at a distance when we need to go out.  Trump mania is its own disease in my opinion; I certainly can't explain it in any other way.  I wonder if adherents will gather together in praise and voicing of their belief in Mr. Trump, and if they do, whether they will infect each other.  Maybe poetic justice awaits"
2020-03-28 22:42,"Any neighbours to my south that are missing national leadership(and I'm guessing their numbers are legion) may I recommend Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's address to her heartbroken nation from a year ago.
No link
Just go see.
Stay well and stay apart."
2020-03-28 22:42,"Roughly 50% of Americans will agree with the trashing of a national hero, Dr. Fauci if Fox and Friends agree.
Dr. Fauci a brilliant thinker,  is a threat to an administration thats leader leads by his gut instead of facts.
Fauci is a clear threat to this administration.
The talk of quarantining the tri-state area by Trump to stop the spread of the virus even though the virus is present in all fifty states would be red meat for red states.
Trump is creating yet another division in our society - state vs state.
When this is all said and done, I would like to see the coastal states seek more autonomy by using their economic and political muscle.
Why do we have to be the United States if we are not?"
2020-03-28 22:45,"Trump has a way of doing the exact opposite of the right thing to do. He causes havoc because nothing is carefully planned with advisors, it is just off the cuff what Trump thinks at the time. The virus has been mismanaged from the start by Trump because the best way to deal with it is to lock it down from the start and test to see where it really is and find contacts and lock them down.  Once it is out in the general public it is too late to control. The time to control it has been ignored and passed and the virus just does its thing regardless of what Trump happens to think at the time. 
Now we are in for a tough time until the virus plays itself out, or the general public is immune,or until we get a virus shot on line. You cannot recover the economy until the cause of the problem, the virus, is under control. Control is hard now, but necessary for recovery


."
2020-03-28 22:48,"I'm a doctor from Singapore. Generally, I think Trump has been an unconventional but broadly decent president when it comes to dealing with China and Europe for America. Europe has taken advantage of the US for a long time. BUT specific to this issue, Fauci is a highly respected member of the international medical community. He edits Harrison's, a regularly updated authoritative textbook in Internal Medicine. At this age. Brilliant doctor. I don't think he is undermining the president. He is doing his job."
2020-03-28 22:49,"I cannot believe in this time of an health crisis, political ambitions is what many far right organizations think is most important and not caring about the health of fellow USA citizens.  I am ashamed at what they are doing.  I am ashamed at what America is becoming in time when we need to be united."
2020-03-28 22:51,"Dr. Fauci serves as an indelible reminder of the importance of holding ourselves to the highest standards of scientific rigor. In the future, we may recall his willingness to suffer the needless contempt of the political leadership in order to uphold these standards as a “Faucian Bargain”. He’s a modern day hero to me."
2020-03-28 22:54,This story isn't about partisanship. It is about a large segment of our population that has become mentally ill. Any brief study of the QAnon movement shows that these people have problems way beyond political anxiety; they are delusional. The problem is exacerbated by Trump since he has legitimized people like Alex Jones by appearing on their shows. Truly dangerous times.
2020-03-28 21:05,The far right’s ignorance and hatred knows no bounds.
2020-03-28 22:55,The assaults on science feel harder to take than the last three weeks I've spent in isolation.
2020-03-28 20:39,"Our acute disease is Covid-19.

Our chronic condition is Republicans.

That's right, I said it."
2020-03-28 21:08,"The messengers of truth are the messengers of God. If God exists, God MUST exist in the truth, for God is all-knowing and perfect in God's vision. Fauci is not God, but he is truly a prophet of the truth as close as any human might possess at this moment."
2020-03-28 22:55,"This is so predictable. Trump and people who support him can't stand the thought that there are Experts in this world that know more than they do. I am an immunologist who has received grants from NIAID for 40 years, the Institute that Tony Fauci so ably has run since 1984. I've found him to be over many decades to be an honorable, smart, compassionate special person, a gifted scientist and physician. I am hoping that after this pandemic gets under control, there will be a renewed respect for Experts like Dr. Fauci, awareness that we need people like him. Also, I hope that Dr. Fauci can get some sleep. He seems to be running on almost no sleep."
2020-03-28 20:56,I really don't know what is more dangerous to public health. The virus or the subservient republican party.
2020-03-28 22:07,"I hope someone is looking into whether some Russian entity is behind this sliming campaign.  Who else might actually believe that if if many more people in the USA die, they win?"
2020-03-28 22:28,"Dr. Fauci, this kind and brilliant man, needs to stay healthy and in the picture.  I don't blame him for putting his hand over his face when Trump says something not true or way out of line, which is most of any briefing he has had!  I think Dr. Fauci  has done a great job of being fact driven and diplomatic at the same time.  I for one can barely listen to any of Trump's briefings.  I have to mute the TV until another speaker comes up to the podium.  Anyone is better than Trump, who just repeats, gloats and repeats while droning on and on.  Dr. Fauci has to stay well.  I consider him in the same category as Ruth Bader Ginsburg...we CANNOT lose him!"
2020-03-28 22:09,It is time for President Trump to turn over the administration to Mike Pence.  At least Pence listens to the experts.  Trump listens only to himself.  This is more dangerous than the virus itself.  Heaven help us.
2020-03-28 22:32,Dr. Fauci deserves the Nobel Prize for stamina and courage in addition to his expertise. Please create a category for him.
2020-03-28 21:08,"Historically, the answer to this kind of mass hysteria and hijacking of reality assessment has been destruction of the country, usually by war or civil war.    Hitler stayed in power as long as he possibly could, even sending young boys to almost certain death.  It's a way of thinking that is not stupid, not ignorant, not dumb but something else that we who don't think that way do not understand what to do about it."

2020-03-28 22:28,why are people like this given a platform?
2020-03-28 21:25,Trump is the laughing stock of the galaxy.  Fauci is very tolerant.  I'm not.
2020-03-28 22:15,"First off, I read “I Am Hospitalized With the Coronavirus” by Jeremy Egner and found it heartbreaking. His account of being sick was both riveting and compelling.

“...a post that falsely claimed he (Dr. Fauci) was part of a secret cabal who opposed Mr. Trump...”

That’s ridiculous. There are millions of us and it’s no secret.

“An analysis by The New York Times found over 70 accounts on Twitter that have promoted the hashtag #FauciFraud, with some tweeting as frequently as 795 times a day.”

The primitive mind must be entertained, hence a frequency of 795 tweets a day. Trump supporters do not read. They may not understand how. They know nothing about science, math, or anything else that smacks of reality.

Trump supporters relish in conspiracy theories. They love made up stories. They need to be tucked in at night...with a night light...and an AK47.

I’m surprised only 70 accounts. Trump’s entire base must be several million. The rest must be watching reruns of The Dukes of Hazzard."
2020-03-28 21:59,no-one with a seriously sane mind is going to fall for these off-the-wall people- as for those who do.....they will wind up as statistics on the wrong side.
2020-03-28 22:18,Fauci is the single source of truth on the topic. Good luck without him!
2020-03-28 22:33,Can we simply stop broadcasting #45s statements? As well as removing his twitter account. Can we quarantine him?

2020-03-28 21:55,It is sad to see this kind of reaction to a scientist whose only interest is total care of America. The reaction discussed here is shameful and True and his base at one point must pay the price for this hate and insanity.
2020-03-28 22:15,"President Trump's initial claim labelling the onset of the coronavirus a hoax perpetrated by the Democrats is was set the stage for how Covid-19 would be perceived by many millions of our country. His reactiuon was clearly a sign of his continuing sense of paranoia, paranoia being a false fear of something, get that?-a false fear and not something based on fact/

Trump's accusation, to this day, has members of our eletorate believing Covid-19 should not be taken as serious a threat as it should. n"
2020-03-28 21:43,I'm positive that Trump will speak aggressively in favor of Dr. Fauci and stop the dangerous rumors. Let us look to the next White House Coranavirus update and watch the good doctor being welcomed back and free to speak his mind.
2020-03-28 22:09,I'm  wondering if someone is investigating a possible Russian hand in this -- working to promote this right-wing anti-Fauci campaign in the interest of creating greater dissension among Americans at a time when our society is at its point of greatest vulnerability?  This just seems too likely and familiar. Is the NY Times looking into this?
2020-03-28 23:06,"Thank you, Dr. Fauci.  History is on your side. Thank you for dedicating your life's work to humanity.  You are not alone."

2020-03-28 23:19,"If you visit the right-wing sites, you'l see that GOPers have made the coronavirus crisis all about Trump. Apparently, Trump also believes the crisis is all about him. This became evident early, when Trump expressed his disapproval of a cruise ship debarking American citizens because the virus numbers would go up -- numbers inversely reflecting his job performance, he obviously believed. Ditto his disdain of governors who didn't display sufficient gratitude.

FDR, JFK, George H.W. Bush.... There was a belief that America always got the right president at the right time to lead the nation through crises. Not this time."
2020-03-28 23:21,Maybe the #FauciFraud crowd could band together @ a conference hall (great deals I imagine) and just see where that takes them?
2020-03-28 23:22,This is what happens when a big chunk of the country has been conditioned to see everything in terms of us vs them. Even scientific expertise is assumed to be partisan rather than factual.
2020-03-28 23:22,"The right wing echo chamber, filled with fact free rants by individuals such as Tom Fitton and Bill Mitchell, is literally causing the deaths of thousands of Americans. The individual currently occupying the White House is both a product of and contributor to this system that is founded upon the worst traits of humanity. Trump's narcissism and socipathy, and his rejection of all expertise, particularly expertise in science, prevented the Unites States from taking preventative action in January that would have constrained the spread of the coronavirus. That failure to act has resulted in over 2000 deaths in this country and will result in the deaths of thousands more in the next few months. That blood is on Trump's hands and on the hands of all those who have minimized the danger of this virus. These people orchestrating attacks against Dr. Fauci are destroying this country and can only be described as abhorrent threats to our society."
2020-03-28 23:23,"We need a passive national rebellion.  If you think Trump is not worthy of your cooperation just ignore him.  No cooperation at all would cause chaos, but our governors (from both sides of the aisle) are practical, intelligent, and sincere in protecting their states.  Let's just obey them.  States can help each other without including the farce which is our president."
2020-03-28 23:25,"Unfortunately the people on the right who will benefit from another view point will neither read  this article nor the comments here in. So we are wasting our breath.
And of course those on the left can barely glance at what comes out from the right, the good and the bad. Case in point,  Trump's China travel ban . Some on the Left did not lose a moment to jump at a chance to go after him despite this being an entirely reasonable measure.
So we can go on pulling our hair out without really making a difference , like a mice running on a wheel.
We are in civil war in this country where the left and right  go for each others throat. 
When and how do we de-escalate? Only when we are mature enough to stop viewing every issue through a partisan lens can we  actually have a conversation and look to changing minds for the better."
2020-03-28 23:27,We are fortunate in that most of our governors (both sides of the aisle) are sincere and competent.  Let's obey them and the medical community.  We do not have to accept Trump as the leader of the fight against Covid-19.  We can simply ignore him and turn to the men we trust.

Hence, rather than respect for his expertise, we see disdain and suspicion.  I thank Dr. Faucci and hope he has the strength to continue serving the nation."
2020-03-28 23:32,"There seems to be no stopping of the hatred, the desperate attachment to '45' and how far many people are willing to go to maintain their sense of reality in alignment with his.  We are witnessing delusional proportions, and I think unlike some of his followers, '45' only pretends to be delusional.  It is the saddest of times in so many ways. I pray for healing for all of us.  In the meantime, Dr. Fauci deserves only our admiration and gratitude.  May we support and honor him."

The States have a sad record of the most infections at the moment, that is fact and no theory to discredit Mr Trump. Mr. Fauci has only shared what all scientists around the world are stating. He is there to help. Why don’t they see the seriousness of this? How many more situations like New York are needed?"
2020-03-28 23:35,"Unfortunately words, actions, and science will not convince many people in this country that the current pandemic is a threat to us all. I wish that was not the case and that, as a people,  we could trust each other and science with a political lead who understood the value of both. 

It’s hard to feel optimistic at times like the present. And unfortunately, this country may only come together and change after the disruption and death of millions of people. Perhaps, when their family members get sick and die and they lose their income, ￼the vitriol of the right will fade and they will understand the value of American institutions and values.

Sadly, it’s going to take many deaths IF this change is seen.￼￼

I would think legal action could be taken against some reckless behavior as you are not allowed to endanger people. On the other hand, there may be far fewer of them after this pandemic passes as their reckless actions may infect themselves and, unfortunately, others. But the mixed messaging from the White House with Trump sometimes acting like he’s a schizophrenic doesn’t help, nor does it help that many states are a patchwork quilt in varying degrees of lockdown.

Of everything that we as Americans have had to endure for the last three years, this is, to my mind, the most potentially tragic.

Dr. Fauci's continued presence on the podium with Mr. Trump is of course testimony that the former's counsel is still valued by the president.

But that is a nuance that is clearly lost on many.

The White House needs to issue a statement STAT underscoring Mr. Trump's alliance with Dr. Fauci."

Now, our disunity will be measured by body counts and the suffering of our people, not only caused by gun violence which has not been extreme enough to warrant a cultural re-assessment of our values, but by a silent virus we knew was going to arrive but chose the dismiss and disqualify.

Unlike Trump Dr Fauci tells the truth. His experience is our gift.  Our country is horribly divided.  We must pull together to get through this crisis.  The sooner we listen to the doctors and scientists, the sooner we get out of this.  We will become a better country having weathered the storm together.  It will have nothing to do with Trump and his politicizing this crisis."

2020-03-28 23:46,"Dr. Fauci's  legacy is alive and well in the work he's done and continues to do, and I believe is well done. It lives on in our lives through those physicians, health care professionals, and researchers he has taught, or mentored, and who may now staff hospitals and care facilities we attend or our loved ones do.   Before this pandemic, most of it was done day by day outside the eye of the news cycle. Years ago I worked to help prepare grants submitted to the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for funded reseach programs awarded after competitive review to investigate in clinical trials vaccine development for influenza and rotavirus.  When the grant was awarded I was a member of the research team that consisted of physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, volunteers and clerical staff at a teaching medical institution in Baltimore. to conduct  a well structured, safety protocol reinforced study for the approved clinical trials.  When the research was completed, the results were statistically analyzed, the results were written up, and they were published by the study principal investigators in a reputable scientific journal.  That is how we've created great medicine in the U.S., with the trust and the financial investment of the U.S. taxpayer, and the trustworthiness of physicians and leadership of people like Dr. Anthony Fauci.  Fitton, Mitchell, and Ayyadurai, they are soon dust in the wind."
2020-03-28 23:47,"Tony Fauci is not a hero.  He has stood on stage hearing Trump lie, potentially undermining public health, and has neither walked off nor stopped him nor corrected him.  Like many others, he has chosen to compromise himself and bend the truth to remain close and ""mitigate"" the damage. 

Fauci has enjoyed the big stage since the '80s and has allowed truth to be sacrificed to keep the spotlight since then.  While he has been a solid leader, he should no longer be NIAID director at his age.  

It is sad that we are lionizing a guy like Fauci just because he is willing to partially do his job.   I see no evidence that Trump has used his counsel except as part of a political calculation.  Time to stop the charade."

I'm inclined to agree with Dr. Jeremy Sherman, who stated in ""Psychology Today"" that ""fanatics, ideologues and absolutists are humanity’s greatest scourge.""  These are the people impervious to facts and logic who focus their unhappiness against people and ideas. 

 As Dr. Sherman says, ""The absolute truths that fanatics latch onto might be religious or political . . . but it’s not what they believe that makes them fanatics but how they believe it, that they have final word, no need to consider further evidence, no need to ever wonder or doubt themselves again.""

For reasons beyond understanding, these individuals have latched onto Trump to the detriment of our country--he's given them a voice that is dangerous, indeed."

 Physicians take a Hippocratic Oath which includes the admonition to do the patient no harm. When Trump misleads patients with blatantly false claims, this can & does cause patients harm, so Fauci is obligated to correct Trump's falsehoods as quickly as possible.

 Fauci now faces smears from misinformed partisan zealots who buy Trump's implausible, baseless claim that anything which makes him look bad must be being done for that purpose alone. This is a sad commentary on how Trump has succeeded in his quest to divide this nation for the sake of his political fortunes.

Fauci is protecting patients. Trump seems to feel that the millions of lost or disrupted lives of corona victims are simply the collateral damage in his re-election campaign.

Dr. Fauci has served our country with distinction since the Reagan era.  He does have an agenda: to make America and the world safe, be it from COVID-19 or any other illness.

Bashing a public health genius - and a very stable one at that - because Fauci doesn't always toe the Trump party line is, in a word, irresponsible.  We need experts like him on the front lines educating us and working tirelessly for the good of the American people."

Woman sues state - she bought a prom dress and with schools shut down, there will be no prom.
County commissioner says county does not need to take action because there are very few Chinese in the county.
We need to fight the threat of the virus, comparing the loss of a prom to the loss of a single person because of inaction is ludicrous. Listening to Trump call it ""The Chinese Flu"" opens the door to mob violence and inaction to take preventitive measures.
Why is this guy still in office? Why have not the grownups in Washington seen him as unsuited for office and used the 25th Amendment to remove him?

This time, though, Trump's lies will cause more death, more cost incurred for hospitalization. Melodramatic? The US has overtaken and is running wildly ahead of the total number of Covid-19 cases for any country on this earth. It's only a matter of time before the death toll starts to rise, due to the government failing to treat this as it should be, a serious threat to every person in the US.

Suddenly something happened and there was only one trying to speak the truth. Dr Birx was essentially silenced and had to fall in line of Pence et al. Maybe Colonel was out ranked by the Commander in Chief.

Dr Fauci is the only adult left standing, I do hope he stays and continue doing the professional job that he is doing to help this nation fight this Pandemic now.

The owners of destructive industry. and funders of the Republican party want it that way because the undereducated cannot manage what it takes to fight them in the courts and otherwise. Big oil is one example. Dictators also want it that way for similar reasons. Trump loves his followers because they will follow him anywhere without a thought to darken their minds.

2020-03-29 0:31,"To be honest, I've dealt with difficult people before, Trump would count as one. Fauci should stop being passive aggressive on national tv and turn to Trump and say, ""Mr. President I respectfully disagree with what you are saying, it is dangerous and will lead to many more deaths and wasted time/money. Here's what we need to do."" Of course that will be the last we see of Fauci until there is a national uproar and Trump brings him out agreeing with him. In fact Fauci should make a dramatic exit off the stage. People are letting Trump get away with too much."

The fact that we are now battling a pandemic with the chief infectious disease doctor the subject of an online conspiracy theory is alarming and unacceptable ."

His rally-style comments are based on his ""feelings"" and narcissistic belief that he knows everything about everything. 
The right always hates on the people who have real knowledge, common sense, and experience. The Trump Cult is such a frail illusion it depends on people only believing what they hear in the bubble. Apparently, they never got the message from The Age of Enlightenment."

2020-03-28 23:25,"I don’t understand why the Russian troll brigade is not mentioned here,at all, as the source of this new, divisive rhetoric. This is the usual pattern- the conspiracy theory begins on social media, echoed by Fox, Breitbart, and at trump rallies. Sometimes the right wing extremists in congress echo it, to some degree. This is embraced on line by trumpists. Indeed, this is how they learn much of their political “knowledge”.

And this group never bases its opinions on evidence-based anything- be it court rulings, documents, known historical facts, science, or medical expertise. Much like Trump.

The fact that Trump has done nothing to stem the Russian interference on his behalf might indicate that he is in touch with the troll farms messaging. And, of course, indicated by his own words. 

Another obvious pattern is the right-wings accusation that democrats goal in criticizing Trump is to blame him for events and portray him as a failure, when it is simply Trump rising to the occasion, in all his arrogance, bravado and willful ignorance.
It is certainly the Russian propaganda machine that has a stake in America’s failure, but this one just might reduce the number of trumps supporters as they reject advice from Dr. Fauci."

For God's sake people, wake up! This is not a reality TV show and President Trump is neither a medical expert or a stable genius. Listen to Dr. Fauci and the other experts from the CDC and the NIH and heed their advice."
2020-03-28 23:43,"How is it possible that any news that reveals Trump's incompetent or self-serving behavior is considered to be part of a conspiracy against him? Are Republicans unable or unwilling to think? Two of my friends in NYC are, thankfully, recovering from the virus. This is real - not merely a ploy to embarrass our pseudo President."
2020-03-28 23:13,"Kudos to Dr. Fauci, trying to save science from the voracious duplicity and purposeful ignorance of the most 'outstandingly vain' and awful president this side of the Atlantic. Too bad that medical expertise could not make Trump shut his big mouth, not only for his braggadocio in sowing disinformation...but in obstructing the smooth coordination of federal integration into a single voice of reason, so that states could be not only effective but efficient in diagnosing and treating the victims...sooner than later. 'Sooner' meaning before they run out of ventilators, masks and gloves (PPE)...and hit the morgue by neglect.

2020-03-29 1:04,"I know it's not useful to dump on Trump supporters but to attack a man who has devoted his entire professional life to stopping the spread of pandemics around the world while one is raging across the globe is crossing a line of decency. 

Donald Trump can stop it with one announcement if he had an ounce of leadership in him. He can't have liked Dr. Fauci correcting him even though he does it in the least aggressive way possible. Bad information now is equivalent to murder by those who suppress intentionally.

It could be outside interference, a foreign government continuing to divide us. But I also know Donald Trump can stop it and he has chosen not to. When the backlash hits him  he will make a tepid attempt.

is the same, the very same, as that which instigated  stalin's reign of terror in the 1930s when he was able
to convince security forces to look out for any signs, even
the most anodine, of disloyalty. The loyalists, so commanded,
went on the rampage, with no constraints as to how absurd
the targeted behavior was. Mere suspicion
was all that was needed to make someone suspect, and then, all too soon, victim.

Stalin's executioners, reincarnated as trump's alt right
paranoid  enforcers of loyalty to the dear leader, comprise
the not so harmless contingent of trump's loyalty enforcement machine. 

Others playing a role now are those in positions of authority at FEMA, or elsewhere in the west wing,  who seem
to be making loyalty, if not servility,  a precondition for a state to receive sufficient aid. That crude  vile
remark   that governors need to be good to us so   their state can keep on counting upon getting their    needed medical supplies must surely have been cycling within the memory of the bureaucrat who told Whitmer she really should not
count upon getting what Michigan desperately needed.

The coronavirus respects no person, border or political party.  Donald J Trump is not your COVID-19 Jesus.  Your best defense is proper nutrition, social distance, risk avoidance and common sense.  Since common sense is not a Trump attribute this makes Dr. Fauci all the more valuable.

It's a big reason why the election of 2016 turned out the way it did, and it's an essential component in the ability of a demagogue, in a shockingly short period of time, to morph into a dictator. As we face great danger from the coronavirus, our democracy itself is similarly threatened by Donald Trump. 

The words ""Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty"" have never been more pertinent than they are today. We can't let our all-hands-on-deck efforts against the pandemic distract us from the fact that America isn't meant to be ruled by a mad king.

Covid-19 may be invisible, but the enemy within is not. In fact, it's staring us right in the face -- the omnipresent ranting, bullying, lying, bloviating, rage tweeting and brazen above-the-law imperiousness that we're subjected to each and every day.

Red flags are everywhere. And it would be no surprise if the 2020 public health crisis is exploited while the relentless assault on truth is not only intensified, but expanded to include the most crucial Trumpublican target of all: the election.

Since the government will not do it we must demand that the companies controlling social media do. Free speech was never meant to protect liars and people intent on character assassination.

We need a Fairness Doctrine for the internet age - some way to hold accountable large organizations that disseminate vast quantities of false information. We also need to rein in what qualifies as a non-profit 501C. Organizations like the ill-named ""justice watch"" should not be allowed to spread propaganda and get a tax break at the same time, and donors shouldn't get tax deductions for helping them do it.

You just can't help some people and Trump is people that can't be helped.  

Dr. Fauci should not be subjected to this kind of treatment.  The CDC should walk out in protest until Trump tells his attack dogs to call it off.

Since then, in interviews with Steph Curry and Lilly Singh, he speaks directly to the masses and is visibly more relaxed. There was a brief period where Trump realized the coronavirus epidemic threatened his rule, and chose Fauci, head of the relatively obscure National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, over his own hand-picked lackeys at CDC and NIH, to speak. Now that he’s returned to all corporate economic growth, discarding even the semblance of public health, Fauci had to go. The right-wing will move on to bigger game. Hopefully Fauci, who understands CDC and WHO national health policy recommendations and the experiences of SARS and Ebola, will speak out on the proven methods of social distancing and containing viral clusters, mass testing, tracking infections, and quarantining, for the 10 week period of the coronavirus epidemic’s rise and fall in each local cluster, to reduce cases, deaths, and spreading.

We see stress in trump's behavior, as he cracks under the pressure of a situation he does not know how to handle.  After deaths in the U.S surpass 150,000 in a month, with the majority of deaths being in rural/Midwest states, his fanatics will then begin to see the magnitude of his lies.

Like the actual disease, the right wing media disease’s origins must be sourced, examined, and subjected to the vaccine of public denouncement, condemnation and, yes, ridicule. Once the sources of these malignancies were the fringes of right wing media, yet they have gained acceptance among the mainstream right wing and like a virus have spread throughout it. 

Clearly, we are imperiled by both the Coronavirus and it’s infectious counterpart, the right wing media organism.  We need a vaccine for both."

This keeps the balance of economic and political power concentrated among the wealthiest White men. This also controls the low income White men and women base of support by keeping them incurious, uneducated ignorant, fearful of The Other, and unquestioning. 

The plutocrats failed to consider their incurious, uneducated base would take their cynicism to heart, and turn their longing eyes to someone like trump, who openly expresses the hatred and disdain plutocrats have towards anyone who isn't a wealthy White man.

If far right vindictiveness because Dr. Fauci does not appear to be loyal to trump continues this hate campaign then Dr. Fauci must speak out as the expert he is.

If trump fires Dr. Fauci let him form a network with the governors of all states who were quick to act in good faith to contain the virus. Let those governors who are anti-science (Missouri, Lt. Gov or TX, and others) do what they decide to do and let the residents of those state follow Dr. Fauci's best practices. Appoint Ron Klain to head the network. Let's utilize the people with experience from 2014.

The risk is that the administration would withhold money from the individual states who are seen as ""not loyal"".

Would the Army Corp of Engineers, the National Guard and the Military continue to work with the states and the people?

Why hasn't the work on the wall been stopped  and put those workers to building hospitals for the immigrants who will develop this awful virus and try to save lives.

He has been naked for a very long time, but always managed to divert and distract attention somewhere else. 
The coronavirus will not let him do that as hundreds and thousands more are infected and the death count grows. There is nowhere else to look. He has to provide leadership and all of the support necessary to the American people and to their healthcare providers. He is having trouble doing this but maintains his scorecard: who thanks him, who compliments him, who flatters him. 
Meanwhile the richest country in the world does not have enough masks and gloves and other equipment for its frontline medical staff. The American healthcare system has been exposed to be unprepared for such a calamity, with no planning or preparation that might impact the bottom line of hospitals. After all, they are run for profit, not for the well being of Americans.

God bless Dr. Fauci. He is a national treasure. He will continue speaking truth to power, I have no doubt.

Unfortunately, they are facing the most dramatic of all Hobson's choices : if they keep ""interpreting"" trumps statements, many people will just think they agree with him . If they clearly state their disagreement, they will be fired and replaced by the usual coterie of incompetent nincompoops populating trumps administration, like Kushner and Miller .

In any other administration, the leader of a task force - in this case, the Vice President - would be the face of the administration . He would do the briefings, along with the scientists . One cannot fail to notice that Mike Pence has now been silenced - except to also interpret trumps own fallacies .

It is not hard to figure out why : Pence was getting too much ""face time"" on TV and trump disliked that . He now uses the daily briefings as he did his mass meetings - to rally his political base . It will get worse before it gets better . As the illness takes over more and more communities, he will have to expand his inventory of self congratulatory statements and blames of others .

The choice for Fauci and Birx, I believe is not if, but when, they will have to take a clear stand for truth, whatever the consequences."

They have all seen what happens to others who point out that the emperor has no clothes.  They are exercising diplomacy during wartime with a rogue leader. It’s not an enviable position. 

Politics must be set aside in these times, even though the country’s leader only sees the crisis in terms of how it reflects in a binary way on with his re-election or annihilation.  (Yes, we were all worn out by the impeachment as January rolled around..but there was no comfort to be had in the notion that the Coronavirus would spare America.)

Now, where is the democratic shadow cabinet and why aren’t they joining forces with the immunologists, the hospital administrators, the heroic state and municipal leaders to model the proper humane response to Covid-19?  

Where is Joe Biden?  Where is the democratic voice? Where are the grassroots?  How many Democrats would now rather have Cuomo lead the country? 

There’s work to be done in fighting this virus...it’s the toughest test of this presidency and this nation...may the democratic movement find its strength and its voice to elevate humanity in America."

I have known Tony Fauci since when we both were much younger and he assisted the nation's state health officers to investigate and control AIDS. His credentials were impeccable then and I have followed his career and his track record has been unassailable in his expertise, advice, and results.  To me and other former state health officers, he is the gold standard."

One wonders if malign foreign actors are contributing, but maybe that's a reflection of my own irrational tendencies.

be the response, indeed. 

I'd be curious to hear Pence answer
and would then expect his boss to remain silent.

Perhaps the clues for that answer can also be gleaned by attending to how fx ""news"" covers (or chooses not to) the story. It is their bread and butter to drop pointless 
asinine remarks to try and paint any of their opponents (even the Pope)  in the evidence based or establishment  faith community as people of bad faith,
questionable judgment, toadies of the liberal establishment, 
or enemies of free markets, blah blah blah...

So it would hardly be surprising, in light of their organized
effort to oppose distancing by states, to treat Fauci 
as just another opponent of ""getting the country back to work"". In which case, they would frame their coverage
 to emphasize the need to get back to work rather than leading with    explicit approval  of  vile    disloyalty  charges. 
They would rather obfuscate by   pointing  out how those who want  to maintaining  distancing  have been met by strong opposition without   characterizing  its nature.   

But they  would also surely refrain from criticizing up front those who are responsible for making them. These are, after all, such good people, all loyal fx watchers,  who can be found  under these particular rocks."
2020-03-29 2:20,"If The President would simply apologize, that would help heal the current confrontation between the Administration and the public, and those around him. 

Equally important this could balance his followers with helpful individuals like Dr. Fauci. All will respond well to a heartfelt admission of honesty and personal confession. 

It, more than anything, will strengthen the President, and allow a more human connection with the nation which we all need, now! 

And the apology, like all honest ones, is an admission of one's truth. Simply not understanding the details of one's actions; we all make this mistake often. His intention aside, the apology is one of honest admission of lack of information and understanding. Does not make a person, bad, just simply uninformed and as he was informed, better stated as unintelligent, about the pandemic's implications. He never was educated about this until too late, nor clearly understood it accurately.

That is true for most all of us!

Naive you say; not really if it was sincere, real, and with others (his wife , family, etc.), joining in this resolve. He is NOT responsible for covid10; he WAS irresponsible for not understanding it. 
We must unify, with our minds and entire beings open, committed, and energized as a country.
An apology is a perfect way to lift us all, as well as help us in this dire dangerous situation needing all the stregth and resolve we as a nation can muster and direct together."

It will probably save lives."
2020-03-29 2:26,"Reading this the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller, the man who post WWII wrote the poem ""First they came...Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.""

It was many years before we as a country united behind FDR in WWII, and in the meantime millions of lives were lost in the world. Our country allows for such toxic divisiveness until a leader unites us. 

It doesn't seem that this President is able to do that."
2020-03-29 2:33,"Trump could best serve the interests of the country by self-exile into a comfortable room with lots of snacks and a big-screen tv. The “big kids” really need to step up now. A collaboration between Dr. Fauci, Governor Cuomo, and others would likely be of great value. The “pretend” president should be benched."
2020-03-29 2:35,"If Dr. Fauci is not appreciated in the United States, I'm sure other countries would eagerly welcome his expertise. On right-wing websites, a torrent of criticism is being directed at Democrats and the media, both of which are accused to hyping the pandemic to take down President Trump. As far as Trump's job performance, the comments praise him to the sky. There's no way to criticize him without being pilloried."
2020-03-29 1:26,"That there should be criticism of Dr. Fauci from certain elements in this country is no surprise.  It is part of the anti-scientific reactionary base that Trump has cultivated.

The public should understand that a significant portion of the physician workforce in the US is truly angered with Trump's response, the blaming, the lying, and the lack of proper action.  For a president to allow attacks on his most expert advisors in the middle of a pandemic is demonstrative of his inability to lead.  

What Trump is not openly asking is, to physicians, just what tools do we need.  The answer is PPE.  His job is to get that equipment. An answer is testing.  His job is to organize it.  Convalescent serum testing is also necessary.  His job is to expedite it.  

Certainly, his job is not to mock governors who are serving their states to the best of their ability.  Sexist passive aggressive comments about the governor of Michigan are out of line.  

I hope that should this virus catastrophe settle down into the summer months or early fall, that every doctor in the US will use each office visit to remind each patient that Trump let us all down."
2020-03-29 1:17,"For all we know the ""outrage"" on the right is being driven by Russian trolls and bots, and clueless people on the right buy into it because it fits with their persecution complexes.  Key to controlling this type of disinformation will be for Facebook, Twitter et al. to actively patrol their sites and take down patently untrue propaganda.

2020-03-29 2:20,"It breaks my heart to see Dr. Fauci treated so poorly.  He has dedicated his life to protecting Americans through science.  After forty years, he is mocked and subjected to lies regarding his integrity.  He too will become a fall guy for Trump."

2020-03-29 0:16,"At this point, generalizing the source of these type of powerful lies as the far right is not totally accurate; these are dangerous criminal acts often times by individuals who thrive on controversy and ""reactions"" to their lies, and their illusion of self-importance.

I don't what label is more accurate, but it's a more sinister and destructive identity than simply Far Right, albeit the people who are Far Right are often angry, small-minded people. It goes beyond the larger group identity, these are criminals destructive to civil society and ordinary families."
2020-03-28 23:57,"Any question that Trump and his cronies are a mob.  He is nibbling away our economy, international standing, our educational and scientific institutions.  It’s not too far before we become a second class country with a mob rule."

2020-03-29 2:13,"The wisest approach, even at this late date, would be to shutter the entire country for two weeks with the exception of food haulers and markets and trash collectors, medical facilities and pharmacies. Use the time to fast-track testing, treatment options and titres to try to determine who has antibodies.  Shut it all down, quell panicked behavior and enforce compliance with heavy National Guard and police presence. We're way beyond screaming over Constitutional rights to freedoms. We're dying.

It is not foolish to insist that the fall of America has been upon us since Trump took office. The narrative is black and white, my dear Americans. If anyone has provided us leadership during this crisis it is Dr. Fauci. And now it is all too late. We’re not prepared. Any action now is not heroic. Any action now is desperation and the guilt of the blood on Trump’s hands. He has clasped so strongly onto ego and irresponsibly prioritized image and selfishness over the lives and future of my family, my children, my country, my students, my friends, my neighbors. He is not my president. We, as a nation — and at this point, it is not a Democrat vs Republican debate — this is about being logical and responsive. We need to depend on the medical doctors and the scientists. Keep your integrity and hope at the center of moving forward. To side with the republican or democratic party over the real matter at hand is to surrender your humanity for false pretenses. We need leaders, dear America. And, of course, I write this as just another Second Class Citizen, here waiting for someone to move beyond these parties, to speak out, to break us out of this, and help us move forward from this terrible, terrible fall and failure. We could have avoided this my loves, with a Leader."

Let them go back to countries with almost no healthcare or at least certainly worse than ours. We have completely closed the southern border and not a peep from anyone...now its OK?
2020-03-29 2:40,"To Dr. Fauci:  please, please keep talking to us.  My husband and I, both high risk, have been following your recommendations. Listening to you keeps me from going crazy; I know we are being told the truth.   Andrew Cuomo gives us the policy, thank god for him, too - he is ethical, smart and determined.

We all knew it was inevitable that Trump would veer off-course into fantasyland and that when Dr. Fauci adhered to facts, he would soon be attacked, projected upon and smear campaigned. It happens to all those with morality, virtue, and ethics who offer Trump advice and who Trump doesn’t recognize as the gifts they are to him."
2020-03-28 22:14,"The far-right's obsession with Hillary Clinton borders on pathological - they need a therapist. But, since all of these organizations depend on donations and funds from true believers, it isn't surprising that they now troll Dr. Fauci and look for any sliver of a connection to Clinton.  Trump has created a world where facts don't matter and science is irrelevant. Too bad for his followers, the virus doesn't do politics."

2020-03-29 2:44,"The outright character assassination of Dr. Fauci for political gain is a travesty of monstrous proportions. That the Trump Administration allows these far right groups to act as its proxy for such a nefarious purpose  is even more disturbing. 

Dr. Fauci, although vested with certain obligations in his position as Director of the NIH,  must advise the President and the Coronavirus Task Force that he can not and will not, continue in his capacity as a member of the Task Force unless the Trump Administration specifically disavows these attacks.  

To allow these attacks to gain credibility will have the ultimate affect of undermining Dr. Fauci’s position and jeopardize the outcome of this pandemic."
2020-03-29 2:46,"Trump didn't just say ""Deep State Department"" he laughed to make sure people new this was his funny joke. People are dying, this is not funny.

2020-03-29 2:47,"The Trump regime is more interested in playing politics than addressing the pandemic.   

Some on the right have explicitly said it would be better to cancel social distancing and just allow the most vulnerable die.  They're putting economic considerations ahead of human life yet many of these same people have the unmitigated gall to call themselves ""pro life""."

Governor Cuomo may find himself at war with the Federal government-or at least embroiled in a legal issue which will consume the air in the room. All of this could have been averted at the beginning ,if like in most other countries, Trump has turned the direction of measures against coronavirus over to a public health person and kept himself off the podium."

So it should surprise no one that the logical result of 40 years of constant attacks on the very idea of good governance is a conservative party that sees science and competence in the person of the esteemed Dr. Fauci as the enemy that needs to be attacked and removed instead of the virus he is trying to contain.

2020-03-29 1:34,"I remember when Trump got elected, much was made about 'reaching out' to understand the 'other side.'

I hear less of that, now.  And this article highlights why: the growth of the far-right into followers of a cult of personality.  There is no regard for facts, no regard for reason.  I cannot respect such individuals who -- despite claiming that the left foments hate -- daily use shocking rhetoric, spite, scorn, and 'gut' feelings to stoke anger and fear.

Dr. Fauci, a part of some 'deep state' conspiracy to bring down Trump?  May I ask: what, exactly, are the credentials of individuals spouting this nonsense?  I am sure that they pale in comparison.  And the end goal is to push an agenda of falsehoods, to elevate Trump, at the expense of American lives.  That's not just 'right wing' -- that, to me, sounds like a criminal conspiracy.  Who do these people think they are?"

It's horrifying to watch Trump's polling numbers edge toward the best he's scored since becoming president, knowing that the great inland swath of red states is about to see all the sins of blind devotion to a debauched liar come up for payment simultaneously. Coronavirus knows nothing of state lines.

If the aftermath doesn't break this cult, analysis of America's doom will mostly be conveyed in the past tense."
2020-03-29 2:45,"Dr. Fauci doesn't need to put up with this.  He's not a youngster.  Other people his age and with his accomplishments have retired long ago.  He doesn't come across as someone who is guarding his turf, unwilling to give it up; rather, he seems to be someone who loves science and loves applying it to the public good.  At the moment, he is speaking truth to anyone with enough respect for science to listen.  Those who attack, dismiss, or vilify him do so at their peril.  What is wrong with these people?!  Must grandma die before they understand that science isn't political?"
2020-03-29 1:09,"These people who are down on anyone who questions or contradicts Trump are a minority in this country. In terms of trusting science and medicine during the coronavirus outbreak, they are a small irrelevant group.

The only problem is that although they are unable to spread their delusionary thinking to very many more people, they can spread the virus by not listening to the health and science experts."

They MUST be stopped - by any means necessary.

Also, it helps to talk to friends around the country, and email friends overseas.  I'm impressed by how many people are watching the Cuomo briefings and just skipping those of the president. Also impressive is the way Senator Sanders is encouraging his supporters to donate to causes that help those newly unemployed, or to healthcare workers, or to groups helping others in dire situations.
 This way, I am able to shield myself from the pain of watching a dysfunctional federal government during this time of global catastrophe. Maybe this method might help others weathering these difficult days."
2020-03-29 3:44,"The trend of Trump supporters attacking Dr. Fauci would seem to be a continuation of a trend in which Trump supporters and SuperPAC's are living up to the former California Governor Jerry Brown's designation of them as ""Troglodytes"".  Since Trump is able to play to their anger, no rational scientific approach will ever be seen as adequate for those who have been brainwashed by the propaganda and have in effect adopted Trump as their god.  

Nevertheless, I wonder if anyone has looked into the possibility that actual enemies of the USA might be behind this propaganda, such as Russian bots trying to discredit public confidence in the most knowledgeable member of Trump's Pandemic Team.  If that were the case, then it would seem that their goal might be to cause the maximum number of Americans to die, so as to weaken the country and also its leadership.  While I have no evidence of this at this time, It seems like a plausible hypothesis on the basis of various Congressional and Intelligence reports that have repeatedly stated that the Russians are not through meddling with our election process.  If their goal is to lessen the faith of American citizens in our own government, then one can at least safely observe that these PAC's that are trying to discredit Dr. Fauci are at least acting in concert with Russian political interests."

2020-03-29 3:47,"The way I see it, the president wants to be an optimistic cheerleader, and shift the blame to the governors, rather than own the uncoordinated federal response, which did not follow the National Security Council playbook for pandemics developed in 2016.

The way they see it: liberal New York's fate is it's own fault, and anybody that promotes more preparedness is an enemy of the president and all of the people who support him. 

Seeing people disregard their health, essentially in the name of loyalism, is scary.

And to see the number of Republican states disregarding public health pleas for broader shutdowns is awful to watch, like a car crash in slow motion: they are setting the stage for a more severe disaster. It's tragic and ironic that it seems to be in the name of their interpretation of liberty."

One can only hope that the people who don’t believe the science appreciate the sacrifice people in the medical profession are making by taking care of them when they contract the virus. Or, since it is “not real,” “not all that serious,” and definitely “not going to affect them,” they will not be bothered by the lack of supplies to save them when they get it."
2020-03-29 3:51,"At the handover of the presidency, Trump was told that pandemic preparedness was a national priority and given non pharmaceutical response plans developed by the Bush and Obama administrations.

Scientists have long been studying the microbial threats of zoonotic spillover. The NIH and other civilian and military agencies, as well as private entities, have been developing biodefense strategies to prevent emergence and mitigate impact. Dr. Fauci is the public face science in the service of healthcare. He is the tip of the spear. The Trump administration had a full quiver. Which in its animus towards  science and government, and its arrogant incompetence, it disdained, derided, and dismissed.

It is too easy to say, here was a failure of testing. Here is an unmitigated failure of leadership, in which the entire apparatus of the Republican party is complicit. The frivolous chaos of the Trump White House, the unconscionable inaction it promoted, and the predictable panic it inspired, caused the disastrous humanitarian and economic crises that have overtaken our nation.

It was inevitable that America would be Trump's 7th bankruptcy. Who knew how prescient Trump's boast was, that he could get away with killing people on 5th Ave. It's happening right now.

Science can explain and protect us from pandemics. Who can explain and protect us from the devolution of the Republican party and the cult of personality that has developed around Trump? Seriously."

None of this surprises me.  It was all out there in the run-up to the 2016 election.  My only rational explanation is they weren't paying attention and like all Republicans they wanted some extra money in their pockets.  My wife and I don't talk about it, but I do with my therapist.

These people a like flat earth thinker.  we are dealing with something deadly and the president has willfully refused to see this as something serious to the  danger of the citizens of the United States. Now the expert in chief is suggesting that we go back to work to get the economy back and he is refusing to give aid to those who don't praise him.  I would say he is a clear and present danger to the citizens and really should be removed from office.  I don't understand the Republicans who are backing him are derelict in their duty
2020-03-29 4:24,This is just left-wing propaganda.  They are trying to discredit President Trump any way they can.  President Trump has praised Dr. Fauci many times and has said he is excellent.  Dr. Fauci has said there is no tension between himself and President Trump.  From all appearances they seem to get along fine.
2020-03-29 4:25,"Any honest person paying attention will know there is no need to undermine Pres. Trump, as Pres. Trump is completely capable of doing that himself. In fact, he does a GREAT job of it, 10/10."

2020-03-29 5:58,"It's up to Trump to do something entirely outside his comfort zone, which is to put the interests of the American people as a whole ahead of firing up his base, and stand up for Dr. Fauci and all the other dedicated experts inside and outside the government who are trying to contain this viral catastrophe.  It's time for the  president to start acting like one instead of re-enacting his role as a reality tv host, posing for campaign photos with a departing hospital ship, trying to get his own signature on relief checks, spouting nonsense at daily briefings that out to be used to provide useful information and solid guidance to the people.  Of course I don't expect Trump to rise to this, or any other, emergency.  We're stuck with him until we can vote him out."

2020-03-29 6:15,"This is what happens in the American democracy when its chief executive officer, the President, actively undermines the agencies in the government and the hard working federal employees who run them.  He not only undermines them, but uses his bully pulpit to encourage the most heinous conspiracy theories, and turns ordinary citizens who happen to be Republican into raving conspiracy theorists.  In the case of Fauci this behavior on Trump's part has led many Trump cultists to ignore the doctor's warnings and recommendations and will result in deaths and those deaths will further strain our already overloaded health care system.  What can we do to stop this?  At this point I am afraid nothing.  The president has stirred up so much suspicion and hatred that it will just have to run its course as he cannot change his tune.  The result is just as bad for America as the virus as it has led to a lack of trust in the medical and scientific community as well as a lack of trust in our neighbors."
2020-03-29 6:25,"Have you ever considered the people undermining Fauci is probably not the Americans, but the Russians? They prey on our division between Democrats and Republicans. Think outside the box, it’s not us undermining each other, it’s something outside our country pretending to be us, spreading seeds of discord in the hopes we are divided in a time we need to unite."

And where does this law come from. The US parliament has had some 244 years time to pass and enact a fine fabric of laws to serve the country and the people. Has the institution managed well. I don't think it has. The Parliament, the most important public institution of the country is manned with gamblers whose only objective as a representative is to become re-elected.

So far, the ideological aspect has been played out in the 2016 ballot box (but *only* as construed by the Electoral College), and, since then, in djt's judicial appointments, budgeting renovations, and non-stop, in the media, ""social"" and otherwise. 
In the current media, the ""South"" is played by citizens who seem incapable of stopping, standing back and reflecting, ""Is that reasonable?"", ""Is what a Fox News commentator just claimed supported by any facts at all, or is it simply their way of grandstanding an unexamined faith in djt/gop, of twisting what the Washington Post reported into some 'conspiracy' against MAGA?"" 
Some might put it another way: Wall St has created a world in which many of us are simply too busy to educate ourselves with care, are too preoccupied to value clear thinking.  
If certain others of us hold to a belief in socio-intellectual progress, in the broadening acceptance of the critical, science-based consideration of claims, that belief will lead us to infer that the ""South"" will again, at some point, fail to prevail. But in these dire times, faith in intellectual progress seems harder and harder to hold on to."

2020-03-29 7:36,"Yes, the politicization of this health crisis, of the scientists, of the science, of the government itself, is a threat to us all and will result in more deaths. And politicized it is, all around. People on the left not only dismiss everything Trump says as either a lie or completely unfounded, they don't trust his appointees, either (with the exception of Dr. Fauci, who pre-dated Trump). Large parts of the population just don't trust the government. Trump is personally excited by one potential drug therapy, and media commentators jump to discredit it before it's even been tested. Trump indicates that some restrictions could be lifted in some places, and its interpreted as meaning he wants business as usual in two weeks. He didn't say anything much different from what Gov. Cuomo has said, or health experts in these pages -- don't have a lockdown of every person everywhere --  but when its Trump, its wrong. Meanwhile, people on the right ignore distancing and other guidance. People cherry pick based on their political worldview. This is no way to deal with a pandemic."
2020-03-29 8:03,"My wife was a biochemist with a Stanford MBA and COO of a Bay Area biotech company (Cetus Corp) in the 1980's. She was thrilled when Dr. Fauci, who was a board member and world-renowned expert on infectious diseases, was named to be on the Covid-19 task force and principal scientific spokesperson. She knew him to be outstanding in his field, above board. and scrupulously objective. I'll believe whatever he says about our situation and how we should cope. Let those who ignore his advice know that the body count will be on their heads, and we will remember."

It's one thing to allow freedom of speech, but these organizations and the courts must hold this type of disinformation accountable.

My hope for this country is this corny disaster movie plot. My fear is a scenario no screenwriter could possibly envision: political leaders deny the reality of a disaster while the disaster is happening in plain sight, and fire the only guy who saw it coming and knows what to do."
2020-03-29 8:55,"As I look back, I think the US really started to go wrong as a country able to self-govern and self-correct when cable and radio TV laws let networks become bastions of news propaganda (right Fox or Rush vs. left you-name-it) instead of news programs with a requirement to present balanced prime-time news.   Lets update our laws to make pre-80s media laws govern all paid (e.g. business) radio, TV, and internet news outlets.  Fox wouldn’t care — in the UK Fox was a major backer of New Labor in the past. I’m sure thus would be no magic cure, but I’m also sure it would help rather than hurt."

2020-03-29 9:12,"The science will speak for itself. There is a global pandemic. People will die, regardless of political affiliation. This pandemic does not discriminate. That it is politicized will help certain segments of the population, but not enough to avoid catastrophic loss of life. Tragically, we are not equipped to handle the scale of this pandemic and we started too late. Our country is enormous and we will have to deal with this pandemic for a long time to come."
2020-03-29 9:17,Dr. Fauci is no insult to anyone. His expertise is a valuable gift to us all. The only insult here is that Trump is our president.
2020-03-29 9:36,"It's really sad that in what is the world's only Super Power, in what is generally an advanced, i.e., ""First World"" country, we have such a segment of the population which hates and distrusts learning and experience (for that is what expertise is).  Among them, of course, is the ""leader"" of the nation, who both lacks leadership skills and thinks that he personally knows more than all experts no matter the field. That's dangerous, in our current situation, tragic. 

Beyond that we have a ""leader"" and many of his followers who live in resentment, a perpetual sense of being disrespected, and fear of being irrelevant. These insecurities make them perpetually angry toward all others, their ""outsiders,"" whom they assume look down on them - including the more educated. That is both sad and dangerous."
2020-03-29 9:59,"As a physician, the situation is appalling. 

However, politicians used the post 9/11 raw sorrow and fear of the American public to invade Iraq with use of fear, deceit and divisive rhetoric. Americans were told their support of the war was equal to loyalty to country and God. Conversely, even questioning politicians such as Dick Cheney, became characterized as being unpatriotic and even dangerous to America. 

This translated into many American finding islands of belief, places where those who embraced their version of emotionally driven, devoid of fact, schools of thought congregated. Thousands of young people who believed the politicians’ construct of reality signed up to fight. They bravely suffered amputations, death and PTSD while unknowingly fighting to remove the threat of the nonexistent elements of “yellow cake” and the Iraqi danger to America. 

Millions felt it better to push aside human reasoning and allow the deaths of brave soldiers and Iraqi civilians based on denial of facts and increasing devotion to tribal politics. 

Why then are we surprised that millions disbelieve credible information and tear down experts and other Americans all at the risk of others or themselves dying if they are wrong? If the war deaths of thousands and casualties of millions did not shake them, I doubt COVID19 will."
2020-03-29 10:04,It's almost (for the lack of a better word) comical to watch Trump and Fauci at these press conferences together. Trump is being Trump while Fauci is sliding between Trumps words  trying not to embarass him while trying to get the truth out. I think Trump would love to fire him so he can feed his adoring supporters but can't.
2020-03-29 10:22,"One thing this article does not address is the source of some of this conspiracy theory nonsense. Here we are in an election year, and what better way to sow discord than to paint Dr Fauci as another “Deep State” participant.  And this one would cut two ways, one obviously political but the other to further weaken our nation during a serious outbreak of a novel pathogen that can have broad impact (economy, military, government), the very reasons our intelligence agencies track the potential for such outbreaks. Are we being played for suckers again?  Based on the conclusion of 17 intelligence agencies that Russia was actively involved in cyber tactics during the 2016 election, it would seem to be warranted that we look to see where some of this is coming from."
2020-03-29 10:28,"The far right clearly thinks that conforming to Trump's pronouncements is far more important than responding  to the COVID-19 pandemic according to the recommendations of medical professionals and experts in combating contagious diseases.
      
As Trump's pronouncements have consisted largely of political posturing, false statements and medically unsound recommendations, we would be wise to disregard anything the far right says regarding this pandemic."
2020-03-29 10:41,"Attacks that undermine U.S. welfare in this crisis need to be made actionable. As in war, such undermining of the public welfare needs to be removed online, fined, and imprisoned if necessary. The online companies need to be fined as well for leaving it up. Locally it is a real problem with people making no effort to reduce human contact because of ""main stream media"".  AG Bill Barr will do nothing, of course."
2020-03-29 10:42,"Even without having contracted the virus (as far as I know; I've yet to avail myself of one of Trump's ""beautiful"" tests), I am beyond sickened at the concerted ignorance that surrounds us on all sides.  This is nothing that has not been said myriad times before, I know, I'm sorry.  I come to the NYTimes to lament because it feels there is nothing left for me to do.

My husband, an affable, chipper fellow if ever there was, yesterday arose from the fetal position he maintains on the couch to read something he'd just found on Facebook.  It outlined the ways the media have overplayed the pandemic, and as he read to me I found myself all to willing to buy into a sense of hope ... then it dawned on me that this bit of ""news"" was surely planted, the way so much misinformation is dispersed by Facebook.

Yet even as I realized this, I could not bring myself to disabuse Charlie of the optimism that swept over him.  I allowed him to believe the it's-not-as-bad-as-all-that messaging of the piece because it brought him a moment's relief.

So I've seen first-hand how insidiously the alt right undermines even the most sensible among us.  I wish I could personally thank each and every Trump supporter for the role they've played in bringing this country to its knees.  I hope they wear their MAGA hats the duration of the quarantine."

This is not only a threat to democracy, but a threat to our future health."
2020-03-29 3:14,"Trump's inability to not be divisive, personal, and tribal--""owning the libs""-- are his worst traits in this crisis. they are things that we all know he has had, as they helped him win the presidency: dividing people.

2020-03-29 5:55,"This is yet another cost of a demagogue presidency empowered by an extremist fringe. There can never be intelligent discourse and protocols practiced by experts if it threatens the worldview of Trump’s supporters.

2020-03-29 7:27,"We have to support our scientific and medical community. The challenge is having a president leading us in a crisis who lies, exaggerates, and is a narcissist who doesn't have empathy or sympathy for anyone other than himself & his own most at times. This is the worst kind of person you can have leading a country in a crisis. 

We have to depend on the medical & scientific community to tell us the truth. Any politicians with any ethics, backbone need to tell it as well. We know it isn't Trump."
2020-03-29 8:56,"Sad to say that these attacks won't stop unless these people are directly affected by COVID-19, either by them getting sick themselves or those close to them getting sick. The virus is not partisan, it doesn't care where on the globe it hits, no one is immune."
2020-03-29 10:16,"First, I do not know about dr. Fauci but, me, I would not recommend to no one to keep pushing `cause there is a some chance, after 4th time of pushing,  how they will get something.
Sounds almost as Harvey Weinstein, for Heavens Name!

Second, as an Expert in Crisis, he have some Rights to make some corrections of President words but, naturally, not even from Position of Expert he do not have any Right to correct it in style ""oh, he wanted to say These&That, not that"".
So, palm-reaction, even if there is some causal Nexus between of estimation  of President Trump about ""Deep State Department""  is something what is not nice to see, the Truth, but is acceptable in sense of silent disagreement about Situation, I think."
2020-03-29 3:55,"The animosity now being aimed at Dr. Fauci is truly a bad sign--it points to not just the mean-spirited partisanship; the presence of this is already in the deep divisiveness of our political culture.  It is worse.  A socio-cultural death wish.  It is a pathology to be fought, as it is indicative of a form of political morbidity.  We have had an anti-science sentiment in American society for decades, with roots in pre-modern anti-rationalism.  More recently the anti-science has been applied to deny the well-established empirical, fact-based science that has mounted an ever greater warning of how human activity is destroying the ecosystem (e.g. ""global warming"").   But in the midst of a bio-pandemic virus that is killing many thousands---what does it mean to have the life-saving, health and medical professionals who have made it their professional careers, to now be the brunt of political animosity?   To the extent that this is a growing tendency, it can only spiral to endorse and augment the virus itself.  Overt ignorance and the ""type"" of politics it draws on and feeds into can only aid and abet the probabilities of death.  In this case, the forces that would attack prominent medical scientists like Dr Fauci and his peers are not just stupid; they are nefarious fellow-travelers with--because they have morphed into--a new politics of social and human morbidity.  Or, in short, they foster a death wish??"

The Republican party has long attacked government and science, and nurtured a right-wing following of crazy conspiracy theorists and bomb-throwers who have gained mainstream acceptance within the Republican Party. That has led directly to government not functioning, the rise of 
Trump, incompetence at the helm.

It is very likely that there are some countries that may be taking advantage of our internal divisions.

Companies need to work harder to scrub fake accounts and at this stage, our country needs to get rid of anonymous posting on all platforms. In order to post, people should have ID Verification. The Wild West of the internet needs to go. It is becoming too easy for other countries to influence large groups of people. They know exactly where our divisions lie.

It has nothing to do with what's real, and they know it...but don't care, for them it is all about the evils of being ""liberal"" and conspiracy theories to explain away any and every semblance of reality are like catnip to them.

So when Covid-19 arrived Trump did what he always did; he misunderstood the gravity and made glib promises that it was a 'hoax.' Now he knows something must be done but his limited intellect cannot  grasp virology while his fragile, childlike ego cannot tolerate being corrected.

Dr. Fauci has corrected Trump when he was wrong; he didn't do so from political motivation but from the need to inform us about the known facts of this novel virus. Therefore he is at risk of being dismissed which would be disastrous for our public health, and so it falls upon the few people Trump 'respects' to ensure Fauci remains where he is, helping to direct our response to minimize the casualties from this virus. 

Otherwise, we will endure much worse than either the Italians or the Chinese."

He, of course, doesn’t seem to care. He cares instead about his PR campaign and is happy to have lies spread on his behalf.

Of course, since many of these stalwart believers are in exurban or rural communities with poorly-prepared hospital systems lacking sufficient masks and respirators to handle the outcome - massive numbers of COVID-19 infections, especially among their typically elderly followers - it would soon become quite the opposite of triumph.

In the meantime, my wife and I getting ready to sew as many cloth masks as possible to protect our health care workers, scientists, and first responders.

He clearly does not know what to do and I long ago stopped looking in his direction. I don't even listen.

The nucleic acids of this slow virus are ignorance and want, anger, hypocrisy, hatred, and racism, nurtured in the TrumPetri dish, transported by the Internet, now infecting thousands of others with their innuendo and lies, causing a vast national illness. 

Covid-19 RNA virus will have a vaccine against it some day, and while it will probably never be completely eliminated, it will likely be controlled.

The other infection in this country has no vaccine against it; no antibiotics or antivirals can stop it. Perhaps, however, their lack of belief in a rational world where they are far more dependent on science than they think they will learn when the first virus infects them.

Trump attacks the product of our Revolution- freedom of the press as he calls our mainstream news outlets ""lamestream"" and personally attacks reporters who ask rational questions that threaten his fantasy world of his cult of personality and his followers demonize people like Dr. Fauchi.

This right wing idiocy may lead to efforts to suppress his message, but it will not change the message.

The NIH, CDC, and all other scientific divisions of the government are there for a singular purpose: to give the public and legislators the best possible information with which to make decisions, and to promote scientific progress.    Ultimately it is they and their corresponding institutions in other nations that will pull us through.  That the far right would act to compromise their function is not only shameful, it is very dangerous and self-destructive.

Throughout this crisis far right politics have potentially done serious harm.  When Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro toldl millions that the epidemic is a hoax perpetrated by anti-Trump conspirators, we can assume that many listeners then dismissed alarms about the virus and went to restaurants, movies etc.  How many people got infected as a result, and infected others in turn?  How many who got infected then became critically ill and died, or will die?  We'll never know the answer for sure, but at some point we must hope that these purveyors of perfidy will acquire some sense of responsibility."

It is imperative that everybody has access to the internet. 
When I explained to her that a normal response to this pandemic on the part of the USA government would be to immediately step up and lead, she told me that she was pleased to hear a new viewpoint, and that she had never heard this before, and would present it to the people she regularly spoke to.

2020-03-29 12:15,"What an unfathomable folly. Dr.Fauci is without question in an elite class of physician researchers, with more knowledge and experience than most in the realm of infectious diseases.  He is precisely the person to be heading up the governments efforts. At the same time, he is a human being, entitled to his own reactions to what occurs around him. No one knows what his gesture meant, if anything, but given the contradictions and absurdities far too often emanating from trump in reference to this pandemic(and so much else), it should not be surprising that even a man with such gravitas had a momentary lapse. Further, this is not the time to be slinging barbs at the experts, people whose knowledge we(including trump's acolytes)will require to make it through this with some modicum of grace and sustainability.  This administration has made it a pillar of its m.o. to elevate division and internecine squabbles to high art, a well tooled plank of the party.  This is always intensely counterproductive, but especially in times like these where we must have all hands on deck to maintain a workable economy and a viable culture. Sadly, attempts to denigrate science and critical thinking have too been made primary in this administration's stance,a stance too easily embraced by those who choose to deny realities on the ground,whether it is with the coronavirus, environmental pollution or accelerating climate change. We are living in crisis times. A steady hand at the helm is indicated"

In Sweden's equivalent to our current Trump pandemic broadcasts, only the nation's counterparts to Dr. Fauci are present. Politicians are not. Sweden's leading epidemiologists simply present the facts and their implications in an utterly clear, accessible, straightforward manner. That is what you can get in a nation that believes in science and in having a heathy healthcare system for all of its citizens that is not managed by private insurance companies for commercial profit and excessive remuneration of corporate executives.

President Trump and the Republican party need an intervention."
2020-03-29 12:20,"There needs to be some consideration of the fact the way many on the left lauded Fauci and celebrated any breath he took that was not in concert with Trump as some kind of victory. It was AFTER that the partisans on the right started to react. You have to go 15 graphs deep in this article before you ever find that though.

The media also needs to take a look at how it presents Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci himself has said time and time again there's no wedge there, they have differences of view as a scientist and as a politician. Nobody wants to hear that though and we get daily articles on how there is one. Many need to make our battle against a deadly pandemic a partisan sport. That is a sport that also needs to be canceled right now."

2020-03-29 12:37,"When Pennsylvania announced schools were closing, my adult niece went off on a tirade screaming that it was all a hoax.  She has a high school degree and probably hasn't read a book or newspaper in years.  I calmly tried to explain it to her but she dug her heals in spouting Trump like views.  Usually, I just let her vent, but this topic is a life or death topic so I reminded her of the multiple advanced degrees that my husband and I hold - including a PhD in a physics - and explained that we've been following the stories since January.  Ultimately, my goal is to protect my 80 year-old mother who she lives with.  Her argument was still that it's a hoax.  She has no scientist to quote or data to support her stance.  It's maddening.  I suspect many people still have her view in my hometown.

I don't mean to suggest that folks who finished their education after high school can't understand the information in the news - there are many circumstances that prevent people from getting a college degree. But, it is incredibly frustrating when people spew their beliefs as if their beliefs have some sort of backing to make them credible.  

She wants to believe it's a hoax because she doesn't want to take care of her kids or put her social life on hold.  With people like her, it will be a long time before we flatten the curve.  If my mom gets it, it will be 100% on my niece and my niece will get no sympathy from me."

The weight of it all is very heavy on our shoulders but I’ve been trying to look at the bright side of it all.   How it is bringing many families together, bringing the world together with a common enemy, minimizing pollution for a little while, and encouraging people to spend time with hobbies they enjoy, Although it’s a tough time, I find it helps to remember these things.  Stay safe everyone!"

Is this doctor part of it? I don't think so. I think he's doing his best at a hard and thankless job.

However, in the poisoned partisan atmosphere of DC, of course there is instant suspicion of ""this guy too.""

That is the price of relentless attacks. Everything comes to be expected to be yet another attack.

This is the price of the behavior of Democrats after the 2016 Election, when on Election Night they were already talking of impeachment, only debating which reasons they'd use. And of course, they did. And failed too.

Right after that election, Bernie advocated a very different Democratic approach to toward Trump. He urged exacting a price for each thing Trump pushed, in Amendment King style. He wanted to maintain some semblance of functioning government, and get parts of what we need.

Instead, we got Her Scorched Earth conspiracy by Comey/Putin/whoever and undermining the election and legitimacy of government itself. So now here we are. 

It is Her fault, and Her partisans who led us into this dead end of non-government."
2020-03-29 12:53,"“ Many of the anti-Fauci posts, some of which pointed to a seven-year-old email that Dr. Fauci had sent praising Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of State, have been retweeted thousands of times.” 
This is the country Trump and his enablers have created. Fauci provides a glimpse of what America is like when it is actually great: committed to facts and truth and the seeking of them, and doing the right thing (on the basis of facts and truth)  without fear or favor. The hate for Fauci is evidence that he is the only person on Trump’s team who is completely committed to this truth-seeking version of America. No wonder the MAGA cultists hate him.
But he is a defining figure for this moment, Keeping Trump in offfice means making it much more difficult for the next Anthony Fauci to rise to prominence. So I say make America safe for Fauci again. Get Trump and his horde of sycophants out of office."
2020-03-29 12:54,"If Trump were half the President he thinks he is, he would call out these extreme right-wingers and let them know they're not doing him any favors and if anything are embarrassing him.  But Trump experiences their slavish devotion as well-deserved flattery and anything but embarrassing, so he continues to transmit an attitude of appreciation to them, which encourages them.  I'm still asking myself, are his children (Ivanka especially) blind to all this, overwhelmed by their father, or enchanted by his power and position?"

The truth is not something Trump handles very well: neither in receiving it or disseminating it. If there is no conspiracy to displace the President, there ought to be. The rest of us need Fauci, and Cuomo, and others who deal in cold, hard facts to help us understand what we are facing."

""You know, we’ve talked about the deep state all these years since Trump was elected, the Trump-Russia collusion, the FBI — well the deep state extends very deeply. And the American people did not elect a bunch of health experts that we don’t know. We didn’t elect a president to defer to a bunch of health experts that we don’t know. And how do we know they’re even health experts? Well, they wear white lab coats, and they have been at the job for a while, and they are at the CDC, and they are at the NIH. Yeah, they have been there, and they are there, but have there been any job assessments for them? They are just assumed to be the best because they are in government. These are all kinds of things I have been questioning. And I have been watching people routinely accept whatever the authorities say."""

You can call it tribalism. I call it civic responsibility."
2020-03-29 13:25,"Well, if Trump were truly ANY kind of a leader, he would publicly denounce the false claims propagated by these far right extremists, he would publicly support fully Dr. Fauci AND do EVERYTHING within the office of the POTUS to unite the country rather than allow the chasm to broaden by ignorance and false claims.

If the outcome is as bad as they predict serious consideration should be given to charge those who spread this misinformation or allowed their platforms to be used in the spread of these lies. To deliberately put out lies that undermine the very role of governments and agencies to save lives in a health crisis is not  only criminal its evil."
2020-03-29 13:33,"Dr. Fauci will stay in his position in this administration not because of the status it brings him, but because of his sense of ethics, and commitment to the American people. He knows that he's the most knowledgeable and experienced person for this immediate pandemic crisis. The experts in the medical and research fields trust Dr. Fauci far more than any politician trying to espouse their mythical knowledge of viruses. Dr. Fauci deserves respect for the very difficult gauntlet he is deftly coursing through."
2020-03-29 13:34,Trump should cede the mic to Dr. Fauci.  We don't need to hear Trump's mendacity every day.

The baseless accusation seems to be that Dr. Anthony Fauci is undermining the president; the reality is that he president is undermining the nation. We hear from the Right that the current situation allows no time for partisan vitriol while the Right sprays the walls with partisan vitriol.

Somewhere, there's another Presidential Medal of Freedom out there for the grabbing."
2020-03-29 13:37,"This will not end until we reinstate the Fairness Doctrine along with other measures to bring advocates of extreme and conflicting world views together in a public forum to discuss/debate the issues. I want to see Sean Hannity face off with Rachel Maddow, not Tucker Carlson or Glenn Beck. Ideological extremists are often only one step removed from the conspiracy theorists who are dragging us down with their paranoia.  To give them unfettered platforms to spew their hate and venom is a dangerous distraction from constructive debate."
2020-03-29 13:41,"So we're talking about mere thousands of haters who are actually on these conspiracy Facebook groups? We're not talking Alex Jones/Sean Hannity level numbers according to this article. How many people follow the guy on Judicial Watch? Just to keep a sense of proportion, far more people read Breitbart and the Daily Caller.

No matter what, I do agree I am so sick of the haters. Nobody has the right to express a different opinion anymore in the country of Free Speech without a completely hateful overreaction. And I'm also tired of hearing about haters. Every article about haters on either side of the political fence triggers angry visitors to the other side's Facebook and Twitter gatherings to get into flame wars and trigger more outrage. Before Trump, these haters were around but they were largely ignored. It was a pretty good approach - my life was a lot happier, anyways, and I certainly didn't feel as hateful towards my neighbors."

2020-03-29 13:45,"Will we ever be rid of trump? This pandemic is the nightmare scenario everyone feared that he would be unable to handle and he hasn't. And no response from the right. They're happy to pretend he's doing fine. What is gonna happen when he tries to cancel the election in November?? Will we complain ""oh, that is not fair"" or will we finally stand up for our country?? By then, it will probably be too late."
2020-03-29 13:46,"How can this level of ignorance exist in the the United States?

The internet may essentially be unregulated but are these things appropriate? Are they protected by the First Amendment?"
2020-03-29 13:47,Solving this equation is quite simple.  Trump has never had a political incentive to support science nor will he ever have one.
2020-03-29 13:51,"The attempt to crush and destroy someone like Dr. Fauci by what I call the cyber brown shirts is just another manifestation of decades of destructive activity by right-wing thinks tanks, the Koch brothers and likes of Grover Norquist. Rising from the ashes of Nixon's fall, they methodically created a political reality structure where power was to be gained by subverting the truth and destroying all that gets in their way.  Unfortunately, that includes not only the integrity of someone like Dr. Fauci but the health of our nation and planet."
2020-03-29 13:52,"Who needs Russian disinformation when we are perfectly capable of producing our own, it seems.  The native tradition of American know-nothingism has staged a big comeback among Trump's base."
2020-03-29 13:53,"Newton discovered the law of gravitation. Einstein refined the law and mathematically proved gravitation  was caused by the warping of space-time. Since our leader is a science denier, he and many of the republican science deniers in congress should go up in a plane and jump out."
2020-03-29 13:57,"Best I can tell this article does not cite any prominent Republican politician, journalist, policy expert or even pundit.  Instead it provides vague references to social media bloviators who trade on weird interpretations of events and who have long existed in disturbing numbers on both the right and left.  This is neither news nor analysis."
2020-03-29 13:57,"The politicization of medical expertise during this pandemic hurts everyone, so I was dismayed when I read the Science magazine interview with Dr. Fauci because the interviewer was so obviously urging him to badmouth the president. It was unnecessary. The mishandling of the crisis is so clear to people who would read Science in the first place, and it only added to the possibility of losing a voice of reason when we need it most. And for what? More clicks?"
2020-03-29 12:23,"A year or two ago a well known financial commentator  said that  T's 30 or 40% would stay with him until the first mushroom cloud. Now is it until a loved one dies of this virus? Our national knowledge gap and its exploitation by Murdoch and T's allies will finish our ""democracy"" unless people wake up."
2020-03-29 12:28,This controversy looks like typical Russian cyber intervention pitting people against people to create greater animosity and chaos in our country.
2020-03-29 13:22,"Sad, sad, sad.  This is all about hate and power."
2020-03-29 12:25,Note to the 'far right:' Trump needs undermining.'

2020-03-29 13:57,"Trump cannot acknowledge that Fauci is his superior when it comes to knowing how and taking steps needed for controlling this disease outbreak. That is a motivation Trump has....he must be the perfect, knowledgeable, effective one or he gets angry and sends out"" deep"" signals to his supporters. ""Don't listen to him, listen to me, I I I am the savior.""  It's classic narcissism.  Really, Fauci can see the character decay in Trump, and tries his best to mitigate it by sticking to the facts and truth.  I pray that Fauci continues to stay on the job and garner the strength to sustain this mental cruelty aimed at him by Trump."
2020-03-29 14:06,"There is a Darwinian aspect to all of this. Let the right believe as they believe and ignore the reality of the virus and its threat to them and to their families.  Let them ignore the life saving recommendations coming from the medical community, most notably Dr. Fauci and let natural selection prevail."
2020-03-29 11:52,"“I’m sorry. I was wrong.”  Wouldn’t that be a refreshing and frank admission by Trump?
Will never happen. The president is incapable of ever admitting that he he can make a mistake."
2020-03-29 12:30,"Wouldn’t it be wonderful if everyone would start to practice “Truth, Beauty & Goodness?”
This goes for Left, Right and Middle political groups.
If what you’re thinking or acting on doesn’t use the TBG safeguard, it’s probably a falsehood and will never help this planet heal."
2020-03-29 12:44,"We need new articles. How about an analysis of President’s comments in his daily pep rallies/press conference?  Isn’t he using incredibly vague, circular language with little real fact or news?  When he looks up from his written text which it seems that he has misread, what misleading or factually incorrect statements is he making from his gut?  Where are all those millions of masks and gowns he says are out there that no one seems to have?  How similar are his statements made in press conferences to the ones he made in his arena rallies?  Just a suggestion."
2020-03-29 13:01,We need unity civility and facts Dr.Fauci is an American hero; we need his honesty;his science; his direction
2020-03-29 13:04,"Dr Fauci is the only one who can appear on national television screens, thanks to Trump's press conferences, and say: ""the nation is in danger; the President is ignorant of basic science and has no idea of how to help you; moreover, he does not care about anyone but himself"".  Dr Fauci would be a national hero.  Show courage, Dr. Fauci.  (And this is from a country where our Prime Minister ignored his own social distancing guidelines and presides over a government which has systematically run down our NHS.)  You vote for muppets; you pay the price."
2020-03-29 13:16,"The lies, the venom, and the unwarranted attacks on decent people are deplorable. But they are established tools of politics. They always were, but now the speed of the digital age and its multiplier capacities make nastiness more effective. For long-standing divisions and nastiness, look at Northern Ireland with two communities that claim to worship the same god. Change, like peace, comes dropping slow. If this attack by Covid-19 can't give America pause, we have to conclude that the human race is a dead-end species. In that case, it's devil take the hindmost."
2020-03-29 13:17,"We should not be surprised that Trump’s avid supporters attack Dr. Fauci—this is exactly what Trump has required of those devoted to him: kill any messenger who dares to criticize the all-knowing Donald Trump. The head of the coronavirus task force, Vice President Pence, has an absolute duty during the daily briefing to state how important Dr. Fauci is in guiding the US response to the virus. Pence cannot be unaware of the attacks on Fauci—let’s see if he steps up."
2020-03-29 13:45,"Cases will eventually decline.  Fauci will, of course, council caution and recommend maintaining distancing and quarantine procedures.
At that point Fauci will be fired (and vilified).  The new yes-man will let 'er rip and the bad times will begin.  The companion horsemen of war and famine will inevitably follow."
2020-03-29 12:01,"The most competent, apolitical expert in the world who is trying to save our country by fixing the results of the highest level of incompetence from the Trump administration. Foot=dragging by McConnell who tried to hog the spotlight for solutions are hopefully seen by people as a pure political power play and to the detriment of the American people. ""There is not limit to what can be accomplished if it doesn't matter who gets the credit."""
2020-03-29 12:58,Dr. Fauci is a big fan and financial supporter of Hillary Clinton and the media loves him for that. Democrats were more interested in another attempt to impeach President Trump. The pork barrel additional to the latest bailout for Americans is a prime example of where their democrat values are.

This gives him more and more power over us, too. These people are a serious danger."
2020-03-29 12:22,Wow!  I think Fauci is even more popular that DJT. He is getting a lot of attention. and that must mean that he is a good guy---maybe even a great guy.  Hang in there Doctor.  You have more guts than most people.   (And remember not to shake hands with DJT.
2020-03-29 12:26,Hotels near hospitals can help by offering free rooms to people who need to quarantine from their families.  Restaurants and restaurant groups can help by providing free meals to these people.  This help could aid in the hardship that these people are dealing with today.  Everyone can help!
2020-03-29 13:01,"These are the kinds of people Trump has energized.
It helped him get elected in the short term, but for the future they are an accident waiting to happen
Remember that Trump is a fan of Alex Jones, who said Sandy Hook was staged.
Trump is as deplorable as the rest of them."
2020-03-29 13:35,The blind trust that continues to prevail among the supporters of Trump is now costing lives. The data states he did not respond to the looming crisis but instead used the time to continue to tell his people that he is doing a fantastic job in responding to the dangers. He gave himself a “10”. Yet the virus grew in strength exponentially as we now see supporters vilifying those stating the science. This is irrational thinking from what seems to now be the cult of Trump.
2020-03-29 12:09,"The attacks on both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Brix are absolutely appalling. They are two medical professionals that have served our country with distinction for many years and are doing their very best to help us fight this horrible virus. They are scientists first and foremost and deserve every single citizen's support. The triablism that has taken over our country is more than sad, it is dangerous and it has to stop. We need to be united against this scourge and stand as one nation, no matter our political beliefs."
2020-03-29 12:15,"I agree with some things trump says or does But trump drop the ball this time plain and simple, just grow up trump fans, you have to call and ace and ace .He's getting old and slow he and his advisor's were late .I'm not saying the other party would have done any better. But their not in office so their off the hook. This is  trumps failure and he has to own it."

They defend Trump which seems to be the main issue for them, not the virus.  They believe social distancing is an over-reaction.

I think they are insecure and Trump gives them boogeymen to demonize instead of owning their unhappiness - ironic because they all claim to be self sufficient.."

2020-03-29 12:13,"I think people that engage in these kind of attacks might be happier living in another country, where your leader tells you what he thinks is best for him to tell you, and any dissent is punished. That’s not the America I want to live in."
2020-03-29 12:14,"The coronavirus and its accompanying stress, limitations on movement, and anxiety create a climate for those who want to divide and conquer us. That includes political operatives whispering in Trump's tiny but receptive brain that 'They all want to destroy you'. He'll believe and react to anything put to him in those 'it's you or them' terms. Consequently, we see him flip-flopping all over the place like a goldfish out of water. Perceived threats everywhere. No one can be trusted except the last person he spoke to -- ARod and J-Lo, perhaps, or more likely Fox News.  We are, sadly, in a life-and-death struggle with a scared, mean-spirited, hysterical bully at the helm"
2020-03-29 14:09,"I am sure this wise old sage would not be dragged into the cultist struggles by this kind of reporting.  Would anyone not rather see him to be the point guard of the national coronavirus response team than sitting on the bench?  Same goes for Dr. Birx, who constantly reminded people that Dr. Fauci was her mentor.  She was trying hard to preempt manufactured controversy in order to serve the country by avoiding having a wedge driven between individuals on the team.  Smart heath care providers don't talk in viewpoints, as much as the activists want them to."
2020-03-29 14:09,"As a medical professional of over 50 years, I have long both followed and respected Dr. Fauchi. Of all the dedicated medical scientists on the planet, he is truly among the top 5 most respected and accomplished scientists on earth. He has lead an exemplary life full of dedication and self denial in order to conquer some of the most dread diseases of our lifetime, ie saars, mers, hiv, h1n1, and now covid-19. He has no political agenda or personal bias, he isn't in search of praise of money, and he enjoys a list of accomplishments and fellow science and medicine professionals like no one else. We are truly fortunate to have had him as our patriot. He has always been truthful speaking from facts and truth. By comparison, standing next to him at times is Dr. berx; what a contrast. He resume is extremely thin, her syncophany for trump is joined at the hip with trump, and she is just mostly confused about most everything. When she expresses opinions aligned with trump, you are seeing yet another trump team member selling their soul and out in public on TV. Unlike the esteemed medal of honor winner, Dr. Fauchi, Dr. berx will have a legacy to be ashamed of. Nothing she has done or will do will ever atone for the misinformation and failure to call out lies; she is doomed to nothing but character flaws in the annuals of history when it is written. I am ashamed that one of my own has failed so miserably without any attempt at redemption."

Trump gets up to the podium at his daily briefings with his grim staff behind him --  a silent chorus in a Greek tragedy -- while their hero recklessly blathers away.  Rachel Maddow is right:  why does the media cover this?

Trump inflames this grotesque, vitriolic partisanship.  We need to vote him out in November."

As they say, ""a fish rots from the head."""
2020-03-29 0:46,"The networks needs to stop giving Trump &  free airtime at his daily press briefings.  He is spreading confusion, lies and misinformation. If the journalists in the room cannot be counted on to ask hard questions, including follow up questions (from other journalists if necessary) then they should find another job. Don't laugh his jokes, don't let him off the hook. Don't be enablers. People are dying because of Trump's lies & inaction. The media can no longer be stenographers for his lies.

Fauci is the scientist. He is the adult in the room. Amplify his words, and only his words.  If people are too stupid to believe him, I have little faith in  this country."
2020-03-29 2:02,"If Dr. Fauci was a fraud, he has fooled six presidents and all those down the hierarchy of the CDC, whose praise he's consistently won. He wears authority humbly.

Will they continue to cling to idiocy if they (God forbid) find themselves on a ventilator?"
2020-03-29 3:03,"Soon enough Mr. Trump will get tired of Dr. Fauci and fire him. Another responsible person chased away. Hatred of science and those who are loyal to

How can clear thinkers weigh these fools against the reasoned, educated advice of an experience and educated person like Dr. Fauci and others like him? Are they that threatened by people who are trying to advise, and perhaps, save them? Shame, shame."
2020-03-29 12:02,"It is my belief that FOX News and the people who watch it and believe it started the destruction of the Soul of America more than 20 years ago. I will never understand why oh why we allowed these liars and conspiracy theorists to destroy the trust we had in our leaders, our State Department, our EPA, etc. Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch did all this just to make a ton of money, because they knew there were a lot of right-wing haters and racists out there ""who were not being represented by the media."" Now they own the media and it is tearing our country and our families apart bit by bit and day by day.  We must stop their cruelty."
2020-03-29 12:04,"After the coronavirus event is more or less behind us (until the next pandemic), I will be out of the good old USA.

I enjoyed my stay but it’s time to head on out. I’ll send postcards."

There are humans the world over that only respond to power as the calling card of human life, but America's rampant materialism and hyperindividualism is creating American Frankensteins. There are many where he came from. If you want a zombie apocalypse, you really aren't far off with Trump and his tribe. They've arrived."
2020-03-28 20:29,I am so sick of the hate and vitriol.  Trump is a horror show. Please republicans stand up to him. Our country depends on it. He is ill. Don’t feed the beast.
2020-03-29 13:32,"What happens after the virus is wrestled to the ground?
I assume the Republicans and their adherents will clamour to shut down all funding for scientific research. Shut down CDC,NIH and all funding to universities since none of these institutions were able to guard the American people against COVID-19.
Sound improbable? Hardly, it's the way the Trump base rolls.

The truth is anything that gets close to Trump gets soiled and Dr. Fauci is unfortunately no exception."
2020-03-29 1:57,"Trump should be corrected and undermined. And the Far Right is pathetic in their total disregard for truth and fact. South Korea has shown THE WORLD how to respond effectively. Meanwhile the richest country and its health care front line are facing unimaginable, life threatening odds without the unstinting, unconditional support of Trump and his sycophants. Innumerable lives are at stake Pure vindictive narcissism. Let the Far Right go back to work from Easter weekend onward. Congregate. And reap the bitter results of their partisan folly."

While he spews hatred and vitriol at every turn unchecked, insulting and cutting down anyone who disagrees, others with different political points of view are just not allowed - vilified and ganged up on for their sentiments. Freedom of expression, anyone? Separation of Church and State? No? Anyone? A Hard Rain’s gonna fall."

Trump followers want to turn the coronavirus epidemic into a casus belli to fight China. Ironically, their ignorance is what will give China global leadership in the 21st century. I’m not sure America will ever recover from these constant self-inflicted wounds. It feels like the country is drowning in this tide of ignorance."

Men and women of character always step forth in times of peril and thank god we have individuals like Dr. Fauci his colleagues and the many governors who are aggressively and incisively leading - in stark contrast to the savior of the extreme right, Donald J. Trump."
2020-03-29 12:35,"If only Trump had cabinet officers or staff who would correct his endless errors and counter his serial negativity. But, as we have seen, they would soon be fired. Fauci’s current high profile is all that’s saving him from the axe. When this ends, don’t be surprised if Trump has him sacked in revenge. Our psychotic president has already done far more harm to this country (in three years) than Covid19 will."
2020-03-29 12:36,"Unfortunately, there are several issues that combine in cases like this. First, we have too many Americans who are very opinionated, partisan, but also quite ignorant. Not helpful in any way, but man can they twit or hop on Facebook. Second, we have truly despicable radio and web pushers who feed these addicts simply to enrich themselves. Third, our current president is an enabler and eager for any type of publicity or support no matter from whence it comes. Fourth, it is obvious that some of this is also driven by Russians eager to promote instability and lack of common productive values among Americans. Just like the real promise of TV fell far short in reality, I fear the same has happened with social media and the internet. Yes, it allows for some very good and productive uses, but it also unleashed ignorant and destructive vitriol that otherwise would not occur because too many would otherwise not expend the effort needed to do it any other way."
2020-03-29 12:41,"Dr. Fauci should receive this nation's highest honors and gratitude.  Based on Trump's proven record, as soon as the pandemic abates he will probably fire the doctor because he gets more attention and adoration than Trump gets or deserves.

He's in a tough position - as a lot of people before him have endured with Trump - yet he chooses to tell the truth, state facts, and put the greater good at the forefront.

To the AMA/WHO/Red Cross:  where are you?  Why are you not holding your own press conferences and standing behind the scientific and medical communities?  When science takes a back seat to politics and attention seekers, the world gets stupid and people die.  

I bet if Trump got the virus, the entire narrative would change...it's all about him."

It's been a routine phenomenon in America and its politics. 

Ronald Reagan was one of the more facile demagogues in recent history and adeptly sold a bill of goods on behalf of his patrons the plutocrats and kleptocrats. (Gore Vidal said of Reagan that Corporate America, dissatisfied with Nixon, Ford and Carter, went out and ""got the best cue-card reader they could find."")

The Reagan Restoration is nigh complete. Donald Trump is just a cruder and more inept Reagan: same racism, same demagoguery, same corruption, same shilling on behalf of the plutocracy, same con job. Reagan just had the aw-shucks smiley face that for some reason fooled a lot of people, and far better handlers and PR."
2020-03-28 22:57,There is no bottom to the ferocious stupidity of Trump supporters. We can only recommend that they follow Trump's advice and return to work immediately without washing their hands. Everybody else shelter in place as instructed by  Dr. Fauci and the real and benevolent American medical heroes.
2020-03-29 2:21,"The right is one big, vicious attack machine. It has been for as long as I can remember, always angry, always paranoid, and firmly on the wrong side of history."
2020-03-28 22:44,"I just keep being astounded at the sheer number of willfully stupid, deliberately malevolent social misfits at loose in the world today, and the sheer havoc they try to wreak on the rest of us. But I shouldn't. How else to explain why Donald Trump got elected?"
2020-03-29 1:51,"Unfortunately, I do not think even this remarkable man will survive working for trump with his good reputation intact.  Trump destroys everyone he touches."
2020-03-29 1:59,"These people who deny the effect of COVID19, disparage the CDC, those who work to fight pandemics, people of service like Dr. Fauci are living in an alternate reality based on the garbage that is spewed by tRump. The staggering thing about their denial and the damage they are doing is that with one exposure  they could become very sick and die from it. Perhaps the true reality will make believers out of them at some point. In all honesty I think they know they are wrong but do not have the strength of character or the personal honesty to admit it."
2020-03-29 3:25,"Is anyone surprised this happened? Donald Trump campaigned on discrediting experts, the educated and the scientific world. Why would anyone be surprised his supporters react this way? Elect a clown, expect a circus."
2020-03-29 4:56,"This has become a struggle to determine whether the ignorant and hateful can wrest control of the government from what at least used to be the normal, average American.

The election will be a referendum on decency.  The outcome is not a forgone conclusion."
2020-03-29 12:57,"It is time to stop covering Trump’s so called “press conferences”. The media is being used. Fauci is being used. We are all being used by the super organism that perpetuates the Trump plague. If we stop broadcasting and listening to the lies and propaganda then the hollow sounds will just whistle off into he wind. The clown needs an audience. Without it he is nothing. 

The disinformation that he spreads in these media spectacles is deadly and dangerous. Of course, for the good of the country he should resign, but that will never happen. The best we can do is turn him off. 

Governors should create a coalition task force and coordinate the distribution of medical equipment and healthcare experts without the involvement of this, sadly, corrupt administration."
2020-03-29 13:30,"The right wing hatred/Trump supporters are what created this mess.

They are the ones that put an unstable, unqualified, reality game show host as leader of our country.

Do you honestly think these people respect a highly regarded, accomplished physician?

Do you honestly think these people want unity, healing and positive outcomes for this crisis and the American people?

No...hatred, corruption, dissension, greed...everything Trump supporters stand for.   It is what they elected. It is what they support. It is what they stand for.   They are enjoying this chaos and despair.

It is the rest of us that are suffering and grieving."
2020-03-29 13:37,In my lifetime our country has gone from a global moral and ethical leadership to the depths of evil dictatorship and the saddest thing is that the people of this country voted for it. I am disgusted.
2020-03-29 14:09,Dr. Fauci is trying very hard to help the American people in this crisis.  He knows how trump's ignorance is undermining his efforts.  The country is too busy now in this fight against the virus  to pay attention or even try to enlighten the ignorant supporters of a failed presidency.  History will tell the story of people like Dr. Fauci and all those heroes in the medical community helping the American people while putting their lives and reputations at risk.
2020-03-29 3:34,"The Trump administration is not functioning rationally, most of us know it. Most of the Republican Senators know it, but they worship money and power and don't give a hoot about their constituents or humanity. If we don't get rid of these Republicans we are doomed as a nation."
2020-03-29 9:33,"..., it’s no wonder that America is losing its standing, credibility and support around the world. And this vilifying of scientists and experts is an utter disgrace."
2020-03-28 20:40,This is ridiculous. Trump will do enough to ensure he will not be reelected. Fauci is just telling the truth. For this he is villified?
2020-03-28 20:43,"Donald Trump didn't invent stupid, but his presidency has unleashed it in a dangerous world.  Just as we were blessed to have Lincoln as president during one of our darkest hours, we are now cursed to have Trump in another.  I remain hopeful  that his comeuppance is coming, but with each passing day I grow less sanguine about it.  Cynical and opportunistic people like Mr. Fitton and Mr. Mitchell make bank on the backs of the gullible.  Trump is their messiah."
2020-03-28 22:09,Trump has been very effective in reducing the American people into his supporters and his enemies. History will view him as the most divisive President in our history.
2020-03-28 23:23,"Just when it appears conservatives have reached the lowest depths of stupidity, they come up with something to outdo even themselves.  It's absolutely astounding how their ideological inflexibility leads them to dismiss even the most obvious of scientific facts.

If conservatives are still running the country after the 2020 elections, I fear our democracy and our leadership position in the world is doomed."
2020-03-29 3:53,"Trump is undermining himself by his ignorance, misleading statements, ad hominems, lack of leadership.  Trump's supporters have no one to blame but Trump."
2020-03-29 3:54,"correction of inaccurate, misleading statements isn't ""undermining"" Trump. 

It's setting the record straight. 

What is undermining Trump is his waffling, indecision, ignorance and being devoid of any leadership skills.

He's lost, and he's going to kill a whole lot of people."
2020-03-29 11:57,It is a good thing that Trump is being undermined by reality.  He could do a tremendous service by keeping his misleading trap shut.
2020-03-28 20:54,The danger here is that if Dr. Fauci says what he really thinks he runs the risk of being sidelined completely.  And then no one will tell the truth to the American people.  So he bites his tongue and corrects the Presidents misstatements as best he can.  If Trump had an ounce of integrity he would publicly deny these conspiracy theories.  But these are the same sources that provide him with support so there is little chance of that.  I fear the virus but nowhere near as much as I fear the stupidity.
2020-03-28 22:39,"There is no saving these people from themselves, or from the rest of us. They are contemptuous of truth and decency and proud of their ignorance. They have dragged this country down to the lowest depths and have done their best to drown reason, civility, good will and self sacrifice in a toxic put of stupidity. It’s a sad reflection on the state of this country that they shamelessly attack those people who are actually trying to lead in spite of Trump and not because of him, but by now it should come as no surprise. Even during this cirisis, they do not want to come together and unite for the greater good."
2020-03-29 2:59,"This situation is pathetic!  Trump's bullying has progressed to the point that Dr. Fauci cannot provide information essential to the American people for fear that such information will make the president look bad for his lies, contradictions, and errors.  And Trump's fans have become so enamored of him that they have shut their minds to any possibility of learning and acting upon the truth, fearing it so much that they attack the very experts upon whose leadership their own lives depend.

The question is, which is more important?  The safety, health and future of the American people, or protecting the President's ego?"
2020-03-29 11:00,"The US is in abject decline.  This disgusting president, and the  millions who voted for him, are responsible for so much suffering around the world.  The pain is now to be revisited on his own country and people.  
The age of US exceptionalism and hegemony must surely be over.  I can't think of a time in the modern era when the US has stood so clearly alone, and it breaks my heart that this colossal fool might have another 4 years to wreak havoc on a world that had become used to benign and wise US leadership."
2020-03-29 11:12,"Far Right Trump supporters and irreconcilable Sanders supporters are determined to destroy the country out of their own arrogance. And, by the way, I don't mean AOC and the rest of the squad. They advocate policy. I mean those        who agitate for Bernie and know in the hearts that if Sanders is not  the nominee they will vote for Trump."
2020-03-29 11:53,"What Trump supporters fail to realize is that anyone who knows what goes on behind the scenes knows Trump cares nothing about reality or finding solutions to real problems.  His world only involves poking his base as he plays this life as a reality tv show to get reelected.  He cares nothing about actually trying to understand any other issue or actually leading.  So really anyone around him has to be a little bit anti-Trump because they understand he stands in the way of effective solutions.  I am sure Fauci has more on his plate than to try and oust Trump but I am sure in his heart he knows that America and the world would be better off without Trump's ""leadership"".   So yes, pretty much every person who steps back and looks seriously at Trump (other than self-serving politicians and billionaires who have their own motives) is, or becomes, ""anti-Trump"".  Dump Trump"
2020-03-29 13:52,"If Trump is allowed to get away with jettisoning Faci, then we all deserve what we get.  

We all either support Trump despite plenty of evidence for his incompetence and dishonesty or we have supported do-nothing Democrats like Biden who have stood back and let those who have become Trump supporters grow poorer and more desperate and less able to access education and opportunities.  

There's nothing else to say at this point."
2020-03-29 6:21,"It's a losing battle - stupid partisanship has permeated all of society, especially where anonymity let's people shield themselves from accountability for their statements.

Of all places - a fan board that follows the New York Giants football team is a blatant example of this behavior.  The owner is a staunch Trump supporter who goes out of his way to ban anyone who remotely criticizes him, while allowing other posters to call Fauci's statements 'fake news' unabated.

If NYers who find themselves in the middle of a disaster have to deal with this kind of brainwashing even while trying to escape the news, imagine how powerful it has become."
2020-03-29 11:17,"This is pathetic. 

There was a time - within memory for me at 50 - when being a subject matter expert was important. Where giving your best, honest effort to a life’s work was not only honorable, but honored. When being truthful in the face of hard times was considered character. 

How the Right went so wrong is something we all are paying the price for."
2020-03-29 12:42,"As others here have said, Dr. Fauci's reputation won't suffer. The far right, whoever they are, are apparently too stupid to understand the truth when they hear it. 

It would be nice, and the briefings would be infinitely shorter, if Mr. Trump would not attend in the first place.

I think that Mr. Trump NEEDS to go to these briefings, because he can't have his pep rallies or go to Mar a lago on our dime. He is so desperate for attention that he goes to these briefings every day, which, as I recall, were suppose to be headed up by VP Pence, and were supposed to be for the public to be kept informed.

Since Mr. Trump has decided to commandeer these briefings, I wish the press and the networks would not cover the briefings in their entirety - just write about, or re-air the statements made by the doctors or other professionals who are giving information.

If members of the press who are in attendance at the briefings would just NOT ask Mr. Trump any questions - none at all - perhaps he'd decide to stay away."

2020-03-29 14:15,"In a sane universe Trump would make a point of issuing a special statement (OK, probably a tweet) indicating his support of Dr Fauci and castigating those who are behind this insane campaign. Sadly I fear that this isn’t going to happen."
2020-03-29 14:15,"1692 was the start of the Witchcraft Trials.  For two years, over 200 people were accused of witchcraft and 30 were found guilty.  14 women and 6 men were executed and at least 5 died in jail.

In 2017, three centuries later, Trump in concert with the GOP started the Scientist Trials.  The science deniers, fostered by Trump's cult, has not executed anyone, but have tried to sully the reputations of thinkers like Dr. Anthony Fauci.  No torches and pitchforks this time, only our deadly social and broadcast media to do their bidding.

When Dr. Fauci is no longer allowed to be a part of Trump's inbred strategy team, I look forward to seeing his unabridged thoughts as a regular segment on several networks."

50.

Like that ""church"", these reported posts, whatever their source, make their way on to the pages of the Times purely for their perverse entertainment value. And I just lap this nonesense up. Ha! And so do you!

Their power originates not from truth, but from just being outrageous. Just like Rush Limbaugh, just like Sean Hannity, just like Donald Trimp.

It was Limbaugh who called this pandemic a flu. Then turnaround and blamed Obama for the colossal failure of the impeached WH occupant. 
For two weeks now Limbaugh and Hannity are doing everything they can to smear Dr. Fauci. Last Thursday Limbaugh called Dr. Fauci-paraphraing ""part of NYC elite club"" and cited his interview with Maureen Dowd as proof.

Why aren’t your radio listeners, your Judical Watch followers asking where you are? Hunkered down with hoarded supplies of protective products, or out there, showing us how ...extreme...our sheltering is? Come on, lead the way then.

2020-03-28 20:58,"This development should surprise no one. Throughout human history, ignorance and go with the gut theories have always triumphed over science and reason. The only person on the podium during caronavirus briefings allowed to speak should be Dr. Anthony Fauci. In another NYT article today, it was reported that Trump wants a total shutdown of NY, NJ and CT. Can this possibly be the same guy who just said everything is great and we'll be in the clear by Easter?"
2020-03-28 23:17,"Really?  Trump has been a target in the there-is-no-word-for-it despicable manner by the ubiquitous left media for 4 years now.  Fauci is a big boy, will survive a few harsh words from the irrelevant cowboys, especially since he is the idol of the left media as opposed to the permanent villain Trump.

That aside, and trying to be as neutral as possible, the narrative in the media is that Fauci (and people like him) gets all the credit and no blame no matter what, and Trump gets no credit no matter what and all the blame.

And all that for (Fauci) saying things that anyone with such experience would be able to say, nothing so ingenious at all."
2020-03-28 23:52,"The article leaves out that the Fauci facepalm became an instant liberal meme. Would his gesture have caught ""the attention of Mr. Trump’s supporters online"" if Mr. Trump's opponents didn't use it to score political points?"
2020-03-29 14:45,"""I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when... no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...

The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.""
-Carl Sagan, 1995"
2020-03-28 20:31,"This distrust surrounding Dr. Fauci did not come about because of any gesture he made, any words he spoke, or any email he sent.  It is the result of a president quick to promote conspiracy theories behind anyone that does not toe his line and some citizens who are gullible enough to believe him."
2020-03-28 20:34,"How and why did we get here? Partly because we stopped listening to reason and started designating everything that does not align with our world view as fake news. We disparage anyone with a different opinion and start character assassination. COVID was treated as fake news and the people who tried to raise the red flag were treated as enemies trying to take the President down. If that pattern continues, our demise will be signed, sealed and delivered."
2020-03-29 14:47,This could be remedied immediately if Trump would simply praise Dr. Fauci.  That would be something akin to leadership.
2020-03-29 14:48,"Drl Fauci is a hero and a courageous man who is helping because he is a physician and he took an to  DO NO HARM and to save lives.  He is also on the front lines even though his work is not literally in a hospital right now.   I cannot imagine the pressure you are under to serve and not cave.    Thank you, Dr. Fauci....I send you love and strength.  You are one of the better angels in this pandemic."
2020-03-28 20:33,"I look forward to Dr. Fauci's concise words of wisdom and miss him if he is absent.
As for the right-wing, let's see how the red states do in the pandemic.  The current denial of the seriousness of the pandemic (Texas, Mississippi) and the need to follow Trump's ""vision"" may yield a reality check when their states have their own hot spots (read about Midland Texas).
We are all in danger and need to heed the guidance of the professionals."
2020-03-29 14:51,"I work on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic and interact with the individuals who are infected. This brings an increased risk of catching the disease and passing it on to my family. I retired several years ago and I have enough money to ride the pandemic out by isolating at home. My community helped pay for my paramedic skillset at the beginning of career and I believe the right thing to do at this time of need is to return the favor and assist when they need me the most. I will stand and protect my fellow citizens because I believe in our countries values and it’s struggle for justice for all.

Those who cower behind the screens of their electronic devices and send missives to undermine the work of the people who on the front lines, like Dr. Fauci, need to be revealed for what they are, traitors. Their misinformation is helping the Coronavirus wreck havoc on our great nation thereby assisting the enemy. This crisis will be over someday and the patriots did their part to slow the progress of the virus will be recognized for their contribution. The spreaders of misinformation will also be judged and their reputations will be akin to Benedict Arnold’s."
2020-03-29 14:52,"If the Trump Administration completely opposes science, then why is the National Institute of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Food & Drug Administration (FDA). National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the Office of the Surgeon General, just to name a few, still exist? The Trump Administration opposes the pseudo-science behind so-called climate change, which is nothing but a ruse to enrich Al Gore and other opportunists and to eliminate jobs deeming to be environmentally incorrect. Thank you."
2020-03-29 14:57,"Dr. Fauci is to be praised and listened to. He is offering sound, true advice.  Go after trump, demand real facts from the pretend president. Go after trump, demand he take responsibility for completely mishandling this crisis. Go after trump to look out for the 99% and stop taking care of Wall St. before Main St. 
Go after trump, he is the problem, always."
2020-03-29 14:58,"Galileo was called a religious heretic and thrown in jail for insisting the world was round. in the name of progress and prosperity, the current world  desperately needs the expertise and veneration of the brilliant and esteemed Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-29 14:27,"Let's face it: Trump is a compulsive liar. He's heading to 20,000 lies in just the last 3 and a half years.

Trump has no place on that platform.

Dr. Fauci does.

I can no longer watch the ""press conferences"" because I know that they are simply Trump's new ""rally"" platform.
Not even there is there anything new: attacks on reporters, blame whatever on someone/anyone else, and whines and whimpers about Wall Street.

Been there, done that.
Let's listen to people who actually know something.

Thank you, Doctor. Stay strong."
2020-03-29 15:01,"I feel so sorry for my American friends in this time. The pandemic is now so much worse because of the dysfunction of American politics. I lived in the US for 10 years and saw the repercussions of brutal partisanship first hand. Here in Canada we are far from perfect in our response to Covid but our different levels of government, of different political stripes, are co-operating and we respect the experts. So our incidence and death rate is much less than half the US rate. Keep safe!"
2020-03-29 11:56,I'm sure Dr. Fauci knows absurdity when he sees it. I would worry more if he weren't tempted to laugh at times.
2020-03-29 12:50,"Dr. Fauci...Please hang in there. We need you. 
I can't imagine how exhausting it must be to work under Trump's self absorbed and cognitively impaired direction. My sympathy and prayers are for him along with the EMTs, Paramedics, grocery clerks, bus drivers, etc. Thanks to their selflessness, not the president's selfishness, we will get through this. And the crazy making far right...it's hard to have any hope for them, so I don't."
2020-03-29 13:05,"Before this organized movement to attack, undermine and remove the only voice in the Trump administration urging a reasoned and scientific attack on the virus the Far Right, evangelical neo-Christian, Trumpist movement was just as Hillary Clinton so correctly said a group of ""deplorables,"" now they are a real threat to the nation. It is time to deal with them once and for all."
2020-03-29 14:12,"The right-wing conspiracy theorists, and I use ""theorist"" lightly, for those who are accusing Dr. Fauci don't have enough thought to concoct a theory.  Like the President they ""go with their gut"" and spread misinformation.

These ""theorists"" are digging their own graves by denying Fauci's apolitical position in fighting the virus. Unfortunately, they, with their ignorance, are digging ours, too."
2020-03-29 12:40,The subhead says it all:  The President MUST be undermined!  It's the critical first step in controlling the pandemic.
2020-03-29 12:38,"The ignorance out there is appalling.  Some of the ignorant will themselves die.  Some of those actually listening to the experts like Dr. Fauci will simply be killed purely because of those making him a villain.

Somehow, in times like these, those ignoramuses exercising their ""freedom of speech"" must be held accountable for the lives lost due to their utter malice and total divisiveness."
2020-03-29 12:58,"Reporting like this doesn’t make things better. Fauci said it himself, trying to pit him against the President does no one any good.  His job is hard enough.  Let’s let people do their work without backseat driving all over them."
2020-03-29 13:12,"Politics should be sidelined for a national emergency, that's it."
2020-03-29 0:14,"It is too much for Trump to say something about keeping Dr. Fauci sage.  Trump is incapable  of dealing with those who are like him, ignorant, selfish, and narcissistic."
2020-03-29 12:12,"My fox addicted friends are buying up all the malaria meds they can. They are confidently taking them twice a week. They tell me how Fauci is a deep state HRC liberal and the flu is the real problem.  Even a virus can’t fight deep pocketed propaganda.  Just ask Xi and Putin. Trump already did and has his bet in.   intellectual liberalism has lost, we are firmly in the age of the oligarch propaganda. Ain’t no virus changing this, even if it kills us. In the end this disease is nothing but a buying opportunity."

God bless Dr. Fauci, we look to him for science based information.  Please keep up the important work."
2020-03-29 14:38,"Dr. Fauci. Please ignore the noise coming from the far right. There is nothing that you can say to them because they are utterly irrational.

What you can say to the rest of the world is truth, the unvarnished, unTrumped, unfiltered, uncompromised, scientific, truth to the American people. That is the entirety of what you are supposed to be doing and saying. It is unacceptable to merely say that Trump’s lies are merely “aspirational”. No, they are factually wrong and will result in dead Americans. 

Please use your position to say what the president says is wrong and here’s why. Here’s the simple truth. Here are the facts. Here’s what you are actually facing and what you need to do to survive this disaster. Otherwise, please turn in your medical license. I’ll remind you again. You swore to do no harm."
2020-03-29 4:31,"Dr. Fauci threatens and terrifies the Trump horde because he is an actual authority figure, not a faker like DJT.  He throws Trump into too stark a negative contrast for them to tolerate."
2020-03-29 14:04,"Sometimes, I have to wonder at the unique mental makeup  these Trump believers have. What is wrong with them that they cannot see a pretender?  Have they been slighted as children and bullied to the point where today, they follow the biggest bully in the land?
Fauci does not need this. He can go back to his work , sleep more hours and not have to keep standing beside the President. 
These critics and not normal. They seek attention to themselves in critiquing Fauci."
2020-03-29 13:25,"Call it what it is. Not misinformation, but a DISINFORMATION campaign: false information deliberately spread to mislead. With what aim? To undermine the public's trust in anyone who challenges and corrects the current occupant of the WH.

2020-03-29 7:33,"I'm an American living in the UK, my father passed away and because of this virus, I couldn't go home to be with my family. At home, my husband, a doctor himself, is living on the other side of our home because he is fighting kidney cancer and his treatment was abruptly cancelled, most cancer patients have had treatments cancelled because of the often necessary use of steroids. NOW... 

Dr Fauci, a man who himself is not young, and working in risky environments, has been trying to stand up and give us the information as fast as it can be obtained. He likely hasn't had a night of sleep, he's stressed, he's trying to keep Trump's comments honest while not inciting his wrath. Dr Fauci is exhausted. HE IS EXHAUSTED! He rubbed his forehead? Oh my gawd, call in the executioners to turn it into some weird anti Trump sign. The man doesn't care about anything but saving lives and winning this war against this virus. Trump is making false statements or presumptive ones at best and Dr. Fauci has been the MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE who very diplomatically, and without any criticism of the president every time.  Dr. Fauci would not hold his position without the required knowledge to be in his position yet people are so quick to defend a president who knows not of what he speaks as the saying goes.  In anthropological terms, I'm all about survival of the fittest and by fit, I mean between the ears. 

Please, don't be stupid."
2020-03-29 11:58,"Is it not a terrible  statement about the sad state of affairs in the U.S. these days that a good man like Dr. Fauci gets targeted by the nutbars of the far right for telling the Truth. If this is not a classic example of why the U.S. is now regarded in pathetically low esteem throughout the world. Trump`s alternative universe (dare I say it) ""Can`t. handle the Truth!"" Your nation really is up the creek without a paddle anymore; thanks to a man who will never face the reality of how horribly he has botched the job in protecting Americans from this pandemic in any real meaningful way; and his insane base that will obviously follow Trump right over the cliff every time. Never thought I would see the day where our cousins and neighbors south of the border would collectively lose their minds."
2020-03-29 12:31,Getting Trump to fire the leading expert working to fight this pandemic would be almost as disruptive to America's well being as getting Trump elected in the first place.  The Russian trolls may be at it again.

Look how he's already trying to correct history -- stuff he said a month ago, such as he didn't think the virus would affect the U.S., but then not too long ago, he says he knew it was going to bad for a long time. At this time, now more than ever, we need correct, truthful information so we can protect ourselves from this virus."
2020-03-29 14:08,Why no mention of Russian misinformation campaign here? Seems to be in line with social media campaigns designed to polarize the American people.  Would love too see more digital forensics about who/where created.  Of course this doesn't stop Americans from re-posting/sharing...
2020-03-28 21:20,"Trump is not worried about the virus victims or Fauci.  Trump is concerned that his net worth, and the value of his businesses, that he didn't not seperate from, is in the toilet.  His businesses in resorts and golf clubs have been particularly hard hit, and his being highly leveraged might be pointing to yet another bankruptcy.   Why else would he be so concerned about getting people back to work, over the lives of many Americans?"

These are insecure cowards who are so afraid of their own shadow, they stock up on guns, spread misinformation and live in

We see now how dangerous and destructive this can become. It's clear that ""belief"" in politics sits on the opposite shoulder from our better angel.

Religions are rooted in fundamental principles of respect, honor, integrity, truth...and being your brother's keeper. Religions hold our feet to the fire of our intrinsic humanity.

Politics does not.

Our founding Fathers likely never envisioned what we are now experiencing right here in this nation they so loved, but they knew the great danger of conflating church and state.

The sad joke on them is just how unserved Trump's so-called followers are.  By valuing disparagement and falsehood in their effort to give Trump what they think he wants, they are pawns in his blame-game who do not benefit at all by their COVID 19 falsehoods or by attacking Dr. Fauci.  

They put themselves at great risk to contract the virus.   Like those leading the fake news scenarios at Fox, the destruction they endeavour to lay on civic discourse in this pandemic will not bury the truth but only lead their viewers to viral exposure, severe illness or possible death from it.

Covid 19 is not another political ploy.  It's a real disease and people are dying.  Fakers deciding to not trust Dr. Fauci should take a hard look at Trump's actions that worked to put the nation behind the 8 ball in the fight to control the spread of this virus.

Imagination and reality. Both exist between our ears and we need to understand the elusive difference between them.
On several occasions on the podium, when Trump made outrageous and ignorant comments on the Covid-19, I noticed Mike Pence’s elusive smirk on his face. Imagination or reality?
No one undermines the president because there is no need for that. The online ‘conspiracy theory,’ is just that. Dr. Fauci does not have to - or need to - undermine Donald Trump because Donald does a heck-of-a-job undermining himself.

Donald Trump is profoundly ignorant in meaningful matters.  He is getting his ""facts"" from watching Fox News propagandists.  Listening to his wanderings are done at your peril."
2020-03-29 1:45,"We all knew that if Trump shot someone on Fifth Avenue at high noon, his followers would not abandon him. Now we know that if Trump shot THEM on Fifth Avenue at high noon, with their dying words they would defend him.

2020-03-29 14:11,"Trump's claim of being a ""wartime president"" rings hollow until he realizes who the enemy is we are fighting in the war.  

By allowing the attacks against Fauci, Trump enshrines himself as a President at war with his own people."
2020-03-29 1:50,"The Doctor’s Brooklyn accent,too ethnic 
last name,Uber competence and worst of all his complete candor when addressing the public make him no less than public enemy number one with Trump’s addled disciples."

2020-03-29 13:40,"Going after Dr. Fauci is like going after the Sandy Hook families who lost their children - it is all based on deep-seated ignorance and a desire to hate, to scream and hate with others, to actually cause harm to other Americans, even those who are already suffering. All this disgraceful behavior riled up by the empty little bully in charge who likes to hear people scream his name and loves to get people to hate others. His entire compass (no morals whatsoever), is based on - give me adulation or money. Nothing else, no empathy whatsoever, no wisdom whatsoever, empty of all human characteristics that make life truly rich, like kindness and intellect and caring for others.
Trump is killing Americans right now. Anyone who supports him, supports such behaviour."

Catching up to the world is essential for a successful life."
2020-03-29 14:25,The destruction of America will not occur due to COVID-19.  We will be destroyed because of the breach between those who see their neighbors as evil enemies  (or at least make those claims to inflame fear and mistrust) and those who see their neighbors as willfully ignorant.  We need a leader who can stand in the breach - instead we have a President who is blowing a big wide gulf between us.  Heaven help us all …. I don't see a healing leader anywhere on the horizon.
2020-03-28 23:35,"Thank God there’s someone willing to undermine the President, who essentially threatened the health and welfare of several states whose governors were insufficiently reverential toward him.   Have you heard him say one single word of empathy since the beginning of this medical catastrophe? Neither have I.  Thoroughly unable to think of anything but himself.  The man is obviously sick.  A deadly combination of ignorance and arrogance. The last thing the country needs at a time like this."
2020-03-29 0:03,"Let's face facts.  Dr. fauci is not the accomplished actor many in this administration are.  It's hard not to crack up at times at the utter stupidity of trump.  Dr. fauci simply failed to hold it in this time.  Must have been the utter fatigue of his efforts to overcome the gross missteps of this administration which made him lose the self-control needed to not outwardly display the natural reaction to the tragicomical antics of the person who, unfortunately for all of us, currently occupies our oval office."

Prove me wrong, America, but where we currently are is no place I want to live."
2020-03-29 14:25,70 tweets is not the entire conservative movement. I’m conservative and I’ve heard nothing but praise for Dr Fauci.

The smallest of facts threaten him."
2020-03-29 14:24,"I am sure Facebook is the primary source for the lies and threats.  Facebook is a cancer on our society as it is a monopoly  media company that has no morals, no ethics, no scruples beyond making sure that it has the biggest audience possible.

2020-03-29 2:49,"We see here with absolute clarity the intrinsic nature of the hard core Trump sycophant. These are not decent people by any stretch of the imagination, rather the personification of evil incarnate. They are indeed irretrievably beyond the pale and not redeemable. I scorn them as beneath contempt."
2020-03-29 7:00,Our president has spent the last three years calling fake news on any science that didn't go along with his agenda. It's obvious he is only partially in with the CDC doctors on this health crisis. I'm surprised he even consults them. So it's only natural that his followers would lash out at Dr. Fauci and that Trump would allow it. Don't like the outcome? Kill the messenger!

2020-03-29 13:11,It was candidate Trump who said he likes the poorly educated whom he polled highly with. Now he has a cult of made up of a lot of poorly educated people. Sadly taking ignorance as facts could lead to real deaths. I won't be surprised if some of his supporters start dropping like flies within a few weeks.
2020-03-29 14:30,As a health care professional I am disgusted at the ignorance of some people. Dr. Fauci has worked for the CDC since Reagan was in office. I don't know of anyone who is as knowledgable about infectious disease as he. I have had the pleasure and privilege of hearing Dr. Fauci speak at conferences throughout my 40 year career. Never has he been partisan or political. To accuse him of that during these times is not only ignorant but DANGEROUS!
2020-03-29 14:34,"Fauci's days  of working for the Trump administration are numbered For one, as the ""adult in the room"" he often contradicts the stable genius. For another, Fauci's popularity is rising to levels higher than his boss. So Don the Con will dump the good doctor at the first convenient opportunity (for Don the Con) -- just as he has dumped so many other appointees who earned his displeasure."
2020-03-29 3:02,"Do those dear benighted souls believe that the Coronavirus won’t make them sick? 

The president was not elected because of his medical knowledge. He did not run on his medical knowledge. He is not a medical professional. He, like the proverbial shoemaker, needs to stick to his own last. 

His followers should not start accusing medical personnel of being political enemies when they need to correct the politician because of his lack of medical knowledge. If the Trump supporters get sick from Covid-19, they cannot expect the president to be able to treat them. 

Let the doctors be doctors for all our sakes."
2020-03-29 14:23,"Dr. Fauci who is a man of science, able to speak plainly so that even the uneducated can understand him.

I think the main issue is not that he undermines Trump.  It is, rather, the opposite.  By him being on that platform (as well as Dr. Birx) Trump has been given a credibility that he does not deserve. 

Thanks to Trump's actions of disbanding the Pandemic Response team, and then dismissing the virus for weeks, we didn't just lose time.  

With barely no testing being done and certainly no advance preparation being done this is now the Trump Virus - with the explosion of cases, the deaths and economic damage that is the result.

I really wish that Dr. Fauci when asked why we are in the situation that we are in, would not deflect by saying things that we can't go over the past but need to move to go forward.

We need to do both.  Trump should be paying a massive political price for his callous, self-centered ineptitude, not the opposite."
2020-03-29 14:48,"We find ourselves in the coliseum fighting the tigers while the crowds scream their heads off. We find ourselves in the quiet moment before the waters rush into our room as the Titanic sinks. Weeks ago, we knew this was a coronavirus, and we knew to isolate ... through the weeks when it was denied, we thought through what was known and continued to recognize it was time to build the proverbial ark. Today we stay at home, not hoarding, running low on food but not going out at all, to honor those who are asking us to do so ... a small sacrifice to help the greater good, to help those who are medically knowledgeable and willing to care of the ill. We hope for palliative care in that space. Our humble thoughts presented in hope."
2020-03-29 14:20,"This is the NYTs so I suspect that Trump is 100% responsible for everything that has ever happened- ever.

But the CDC failed this nation as did the FDA.  Each State Governor, especially New York, has failed.  The Mayor of New York City has failed.  Hospitals have failed us. 

The idea that New York, which has experienced negative events before, was totally unprepared is outrageous.  Thousands of 911 responders had breathing issues- yet New York city and state have no supplies.  

Hospitals- which routinely force people into bankruptcy for payment, have no stockpiles of supplies.  All the wealthy they take from society goes towards the salaries of administrators.

New York City was mismanaged by De Blasio- and no they have skyrocketing numbers of cases.  De Blasio is responsible for that mismanagement.  Now New York is crying and wants to take resources from the rest of the nation- to cover-up their own failings.

The CDC dragged their feet, and along with the FDA, cost this nation a month.  They appear to have lied to the nation and appear to be incompetent.  

The failures were rampant and extreme.  Trump bears some responsibility but so do thousands of others who did nothing and put the public at risk even as they were paid by the public to do otherwise.

Shameful."
2020-03-29 14:22,"I used to have faith that no matter how wrong, evil or disgusting an idea or person is that most people are decent and have the common sense to do the right thing. The election of 2016 has proven me wrong."
2020-03-29 14:41,"Trump and his supporters are anti science so no surprise they do not support Dr Fauci.
Lets see if they think differently when the virus ravages people of all political persuasion.
The Trump  Admin are doing some good things however they are weeks or months late on everything and only choose the correct paths when   Governors and or medical experts prove the Admin is wrong.When fighting a war time,strategy and adjustment  is every thing
Trump should limit his daily comments to praising his team then shut up and let the experts talk.Its not supposed to be an election speech"
2020-03-29 14:19,"Trump has blood on his hands. He dismissed the virus threat as a 'hoax', dismissed its impact, and gave false hope to those who, in blissful ignorance, follow him blindly. Many will now see their loved ones fall victim and die. Having failed to take the initial tough measures that could have contained the outbreak Trump now has no choice but to push for relaxing social distancing and isolation measures. He can't increase or sustain measures because this would show, without doubt, that he got it wrong. But genius that he is, he never gets things wrong. Good luck America, you need it with him as leader."
2020-03-29 14:40,Dr. Fauci's only failing is that his message is not driven by Trump's reelection. The proposal that the health of the economy  is more important than the lives of Americans is appalling. Unfortunately there is no vaccine for ignorance.
2020-03-29 14:42,"Dr Fauci has no need to undermine this president, even if he thinks Trump has been doing a terrible job. Mr Trump has been doing a better job than anyone else of undermining any sense  of his competence, just by his public statements which he contradicts almost immediately after he makes them. Trump has undermined any confidence that we might have in his ability to think effectively and do the right thing. Only those with no working brains can continue to support the incompetence of this administration. To blame others for the failure of Trump's administration to get on top of this public health emergency shows just how desperate the diehard Trump supporters must be to continue blaming others for Trump's failures."
2020-03-29 14:45,"This is a shame. He is doing a good job. 

I am a conservative."
2020-03-28 23:18,"As others have said, Corona is Trump's Chernobyl. The lies caused the disaster and the fallout. We have the same scenario playing out here. Trump can't tolerate the truth if it makes him look bad or prevents him from keeping his followers hypnotized ... it's a replay of the folly of the USSR, a state that was, by its own reckoning, infallible. 

That turned out really well. We have the same thing here. Trump lies 365/24/7, creates harebrained, idiotic ""policy"" ...  rinse and repeat ... 

Dr. Fauci is the only person who has the guts to stand up to Trump. Even Birx became a head-nodding sycophant this week. 

Incredible how the most powerful country in the world can disintegrate into a hot mess in just a few months ... but Trump has been preparing for this moment since he was elected."
2020-03-29 14:21,Let's please stop listening to the far right and stop giving them the time of day. The best antidote to their poison is to let them remain inside their bubble of hate and know-nothingness and only pay any attention to them if they decide to rejoin the decent majority.
2020-03-29 14:24,"In a time of great uncertainty, I believe we should put aside political disputes in order to survive this pandemic. I think it is stupid that a simple gesture, will put hundreds in danger. As now these people have lost trust in Fauci and what he has to say. You should trust these experts because they are the best of the best, regardless of your political view. These people are trying to save you and you're not helping them, yourself and people around you by ignoring them. It's heartbreaking to see people put their lives in jeopardy just to say they're being ""American"". So please, listen to the experts, do what they tell you. It is in your best interests."
2020-03-29 15:04,"For the future (hope we have one!), we need to establish/require that any declaration of a National Emergency be supported and backstopped by a Bipartisan Leadership Group consisting of the Pres, VP, and top two leaders of both parties from the Senate and House.  These are the Peoples' duly elected representatives.  They should be required/encouraged to put politics aside and prove with every action they take that they are acting in good faith and from a consensus position."
2020-03-29 15:06,"I am 75 years old, a veteran of the Viet Nam conflict, and an American citizen who has voted in every election for which I was eligible.  I have experienced our country's good times as well as bad times, and have always been proud of my country.
It is sad to say that my belief in the American dream is peeling away.  How can Americans citizens question the work, expertise and heroics of an individual like Dr. Fauci?  He is the very core of what made America great.  For even one citizen to question Dr. Fauci, in favor of an individual who was a draft dodger and a tax evader. is beyond comprehension. While their leader and cronies are actually thriving during this disaster, the very people who support them are bearing the brunt of unemployment, homelessness and uncertainty. How can a reasonable person comprehend that dysfunction. They can't.  We are no longer the country of vision or opportunity.  I deeply regret that my grandchildren may not have an opportunity to experience the greatness of the country that I grew up in and loved."
2020-03-29 15:06,"Dear Dr. Fauci - without you on the podium the country will be at a grave disadvantage, more so than we are today.  We need you there and we need your wise views on the reality of our situation.  The majority of Americans, the real people of this country, want the truth even if it isn’t pretty. We are not living in a fantasy world. The people that want to dig their heads into the ground should get together with the WH and throw a big barbecue, have a Sunday prayer session and quarantine themselves in la la land where they can float over the rainbow together.  The rest of us are managing quite well sheltering in place and waiting out the storm. The needs of our healthcare workers should be tantamount at this point. Protective gear should be at the top of the list of needs.  Thoughtful support for the workers who are on the frontline needs to be managed quickly so that the suffering patients can be treated without putting the nurses, doctors, EMS and hospital administrators at greater risk.  Stand firm against the bullying (that we have come to expect for anyone on the podium who has intelligent opinions these days) and know that you have support.  We need you more than anything right now."
2020-03-29 15:08,"Yes, Fauci is a competent, articulate expert in the medical field. Because he has even ""appeared"" to have contradicted Trump in any way, Trump will fire him or get rid of him as soon as he is able. Trump is just waiting for this crisis to pass somewhat to do so."
2020-03-29 15:08,"The ""deep state,"" et al, conspiracy theorists should realize that their refusal to accept facts at face value is only going to bring down upon them (and the rest of us) the very sky-is-falling disaster, and consequent authoritarian takeover, they fear.

Sooner - rather than later - someone who is equipped to deal with reality will have to step in and take charge, and unfortunately it will not be anyone who has been democratically placed in power.  This is a tragedy but the American electorate has no one to blame but itself for shirking its responsibility to participate in choosing competent leadership.  

The nation has not had to deal with outright federal martial law in its history but it is becoming clearer by the day that the civilian administration in Washington lacks the foresight and competence to handle a national emergency of this magnitude - which is no surprise at all, given the level of ineptitude in handling even mundane matters we have been numbing ourselves to for nearly four years.

I hate to say this, but after listening to several military commanders in various services who have - at last - been engaged to assist in dealing with what has become a major humanitarian crisis, their clarity of purpose and singularity of priorities is like a breath of fresh air.

Contrast this with the daily reversals of recommendations coming from a White House reeking of political posturing - rather than concern with human suffering - and you begin to get the picture."
2020-03-29 15:09,"It's not very encouraging that a large number of those who voted for and still support Trump, the Evangelical Christians, are looking forward to the end of the world...  it's not very helpful."
2020-03-29 15:10,"As long as the functioning parts of this country continue to prop up the failed state that is Trumps America the longer we won’t be able to effect respond to the challenges of modernity.  

We can’t force the to fix their tragically fixed and false world view of superiority and rugged independence while we subsidize their inability to compete in the modern world.  The inability to respond to mass shootings turned out to be a minor consequence of sharing a government with people who take no responsibility for the consequences of their decisions nor efficacy in their futures because we keep paying their bills for them."
2020-03-29 15:13,"The denigration of Dr. Fauci by some Trump supporters provides President Trump an opportunity to actually act as president. At the beginning of his next press conference, he should say, ""Dr. Fauci has dedicated his life to the health of all Americans. I know him to be a man of the highest integrity. I call on all Americans who are smearing this man on line or via any other medium, to stop their actions. I need Dr. Fauci's wisdom and expertise. So, too, do all Americans.""

Or does he see the conspirators as another group of ""fine people"" - fine, because they support him. 

If Trump a president or a partisan?"
2020-03-29 15:15,I'm 87 and a combat veteran of the Vietnam war.  I know fear and what it is like to look to a strong leader when the chips are down.  When I see President Trump and others do the afternoon briefings I always look to Dr. Fauci for the facts that will make a difference for  me and my family.  It is not difficult to recognize a leader.  Pay attention to the Dr.
2020-03-29 15:17,"It is now more than 20 years since I first heard of Dr.Fauci. He has been giving very knowledgeable and competent advice to many president no matter their ideology. But, this is Trump he is now correcting from giving us sloppy advice he know nothing about. Trump's far right people now wants to attack Dr. Fauci. This is what we got for people like them backing an incompetent businessman. Let this all end after November 3, 2020. Vote Blue."
2020-03-29 15:18,"If the Far Right wishes to believe their cult leader, may they suffer the consequences. Yes, it will be dangerous for the rest of us, but we will have to find a way to deal with that.

No one in the health care industry is more trusted than Dr. Fauci. Sadly, Trump will NEVER achieve that stature."
2020-03-29 15:19,You want to bet that those who are making money out of criticizing Fauci are closely following his recommendations rather than Trump's.  It is only their followers who are willing to believe anything they say who discount what the good doctor is saying.
2020-03-29 12:38,"President Donald J. Trump is the greatest President our country ever had and will ever have and is also the greatest world leader our planet ever had and will ever have. Dr. Fauci (as well as all others) must understand, clearly and totally understand that everything that President Trump says or does is being inspired unto him by the Supreme Divinity and therefore President Trump is infallible in all fields of science and all ways of life."
2020-03-29 14:36,"There may have been a couple of conservatives who have criticized Dr. Fauci, his facts, his correcting President Trump’s facts but this is no where the number who are criticizing President Trump right now during this catastrophe.  Every day the liberal media is criticizing, finding fault and condemning President Trump during these very trying times.  Liberals and progressive are doing this too.  It is endless.

President Trump has been going before the American public every day and answering many questions put before him by the press.  He has his coronavirus team and they are also speaking about this pandemic.  He along with his team have done many things to fight this silent killer.  Maybe a bit late but he has made up for loss time.  He is getting the much needed ventilators to where they need to be.  He is getting masks to the medical facilities.  This was no small task.  These should have always been available for an emergency years ago but this was not the fault of the federal government alone.  Plenty of blame can go around.  He is also listening to the governors and giving them all the aid they request.  He is not sitting idly by while this virus marches on.

We are all in this together and fighting during these turbulent times does nothing to help our country or end this pandemic.  Let’s stand and work together and rid our world of this coronavirus madness.  We all must take a part.  We can do this.  We must."
2020-03-29 15:26,"Great article makes me distrust this man, Dr Fauci even more knowing so many Americans feel the same distrust. As allergies and lung disease has increased during his tenure it's truly time for change. Dr. Fauci as been in charge of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and people are much worse than they were 36 years ago.  Obviously the majority of people distrusts Fauci so why is he still there?"
2020-03-29 0:20,"It's easy to show how unworthy the opposition is. The difference between Fauchi and Trump is Fauchi an expert on epidemics and Trump was elected to the run the country. It's not an easy job for either of them.

I'm sure there's many people who believe god is in charge of the pandemic but there are those of us who Have legitimate questions for the experts. Those who were in charge and put us in a situation where there are shortages of masks and ventilators. Some of even ask why hasn't there been a better effort in finding cures for these viruses. Similar to what was done with AIDES.

We are also living in the era of post modern science where proof is in the model. Did you know there could be life on Mercury? There's some real fear of commissars taking over fields formerly held by experts. Experts are required most fields. Not MBA's and SJW's.

No I'm nor apologizing for Trump but there has to be some balance. In the long run Trump will have to go along with Fauchi. You might be surprised how much they need each other."
2020-03-29 6:05,"I am a supporter of both Fauci and Trump.  What I don't trust is the main stream media (MSM) to report anything accurately and without bias.  It is a sad state of affairs when we reach the point where anything published by the MSM is viewed with skepticism by a large sector of the population.  I believe both of these men are doing an excellent job in these very challenging times.  There are no simple answers to issues which surface surrounding Covid-19.  Less sensationalism and more cool-headed action, based in both science and economics,  would do a world of good at this time."
2020-03-29 15:32,"I believe the reason the far right criticizes Dr. Fauci is because he speaks from facts, evidence and experience, things that Trump, his Administration and his base of supporters are incapable of dealing with. 

As he has frequently demonstrated prior to and during this term in office, Trump's typical response when events don't go his way is to identify someone, anyone, with the immediate cause of his displeasure and launch ad hominen attacks against that person or persons. 

By example, Trump enables and encourages his supporters to also attack the designated scapegoat in an attempt to destroy their credibility.   

This strategy will not work against Dr. Fauci, because the facts and the evidence are painfully visible to all: The covid-19 virus is no respecter of persons or politics and certainly not Donald Trump's re-election plans."
2020-03-29 15:32,"B. Moschner,

New York, one of the bluest states in the country, has the most cases of the coronavirus and more specifically New York City to date.  The numbers are enormous.  People were not told to social distance until it had spread significantly.  People are doing a much better job and hopefully if people in other parts of the country do the same it may not spread so drastically.  

The people in New Orleans were celebrating Mardi  Gras which may result in large numbers becoming infected.  Time may tell unfortunately.  We must all follow the advice of the experts and stay at home as much as possible."
2020-03-28 22:21,"It frightens me no end this blind belief in Trump and how he is able to feed into what people want to hear, that to them facts are anathema and a left wing conspiracy. Hitler, Stalin, Mao, so many examples of leaders who were able to create an alternate reality that people ardently believed in and now believe in Trump’s case.

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.” Carl Sagan"

It is about time that the truth be told. The extreme right apart from the white Nationalists, are to a very large degree Evangelicals and Christians. They are Trumps base, the easiest to manipulate group of people as they believe their leaders.
No more hiding, they are out in the open and have declared Coronavirus a hoax, which they were sold is only meant to stop evangelicals and christians to go to church. 
No matter that in S. Korea as in the Philippines these groups (willing religious followers) have caused the death of thousands by refusing to stop grouping together, causing massive infection and death.
The power and money hungry Rev. Fallwell is ordering that his 100.000 evangelical students, come back to his college early, fully disregarding all warnings of infection in such a closed community.
Falwell doesn’t care, as Trump, he doesn’t believe that young christian students can get infected.
One of Trump’s favorite fans, he is risking 100.000 students for one reason only; to have more impact on his religious decisions in regards to abortion, gay and lesbian relationships, the role of women in society and a slew of other authoritarian demands. 
Historically it has always been religious leaders and their cultish followers who were the first to befriend new dictators all over the world, convinced they could use them, which again they do with money and easy predetermined votes.
It is time that all media start to inform the world of this new coup."

2020-03-29 12:55,"Bless Dr. Fauci. He is the face of reason and comfort to the majority of us, and now he must embody:“sticks and stones may break my bones but words should never hurt me.” Shame and worse to the vile who are trying to destroy him."

These theories usually start in the cabinet and are lateraled over the minions who will embellish and put pretty clothes on it and run it across the goal line. Fauci is too honest. It is a surprise that he lasted this long. He will be out in two weeks.
2020-03-29 7:03,Reading these comments of support for Dr Anthony Fauci give hope that he will be allowed to continue to do his job. Evidently the US President resents anyone not in full compliance trying unsuccessfully to cover his tracks going around in circles. This crisis needs everyone on deck.

2020-03-29 3:36,COVID-19 is a global disease.  Attacking science is an American disease.
2020-03-29 5:54,"Dr. Fauci may seem like a new name and face on the scene but this man is not only familiar to those of us who survived the devastating AIDS pandemic, he is beloved for providing a well lit path through the darkness when it seemed like there was no hope. Fauci led the way and helped to keep a generation alive after suffering countless tragic deaths in a country that not only  seemed not to care but which also seemed to take perverse pleasure in casting that horrible disease as some sort of divine punishment on deviants and undesirables. I fully understand Dr. Fauci’s strategy to stay inside the equation where he knows he can have a profound impact on how this goes from here. He knows fully what a totally inept and incompetent president Trump is, but he has chosen to placate and cooperate so that more lives can be saved. This man should receive a presidential Metal of Honor from the next president for what he is doing and for what he is putting up with. As far as Trump acolytes and loyalists leveling their bilious rantings at Dr. Fauci are concerned...who cares...those perverse voices ring hollow more and more with each passing day. This paradigm shift that we are currently in will hopefully consign that entire confederacy of dunces to the great trash heap of history so that we can rebuild and move forward without the total insanity that rules our days now."

2020-03-29 13:50,"The amount of ignorance and lack of trust in mainstream media is unbelievable. It is good to get information from a variety of sources to have a well rounded idea of what is going on in the world.  These conspiracy theories and a paranoid approach is undermining our democracy and society.

The sad reality is Trump’s base, who as a demographic class are largely more susceptible to this virus through no fault outside of hard living and diabetes, will bare the brunt of this pandemic.  It will be those who oppose Trumps views mainly treating the said “hard living” class.  It’s all fun and games until grandma dies."

This is ridiculous.  He deserves better but Trump is our President, and given the Democratic nominee probably for another 4 years.

2020-03-29 10:26,"As a conservative and former Republican Party supporter, I find this sort of poisonous campaign against Dr Fauci to be beyond disgusting on every level. The President or any politician is not close to being knowledgeable, much less expert, on pandemics. Clearly Trump knows little about what he is talking about, his rambling incoherent press conferences prove that. Just as clearly, real experts like Dr Fauci should be encouraged to be independent voices of analysis and possible options. How else, while people are getting sick and dying around the Nation, and with the USA now the epicenter of the disease, will the virus be put in its box to be defeated. As to the economics and business matters, America (or any nation) cannot begin to go back to ""work"" until such time as the virus is under control and on a downward trajectory! Spreading the virus, illness and death through a car plant, a computer chip developer, a school or mine will soon result in even more medical, financial and economic chaos.  Dr Fauci's political expressions, whether 20 years ago, 7 years  or yesterday are irrelevant. He is a globally recognized  expert in the field and is speaking as an true expert in tackling this virus for the benefit of all Americans and indeed the world.  He is not talking as a partisan lackey (ie #FauciFraud ) but as a concerned expert medical expert and should be valued as a National Treasure, respected and listened to and whose advise should be acted on while there is still time."
2020-03-29 11:26,"I have never seen your great country so divided, and at the worst possible time. You have had a massive head start on this virus as it swept right to left across the world, but I fear not many lessons have been learnt. Someone needs to step up and show leadership and the country needs to unite under that leadership."
2020-03-29 0:09,The people opposing Fauci need to grow up and get their priorities straight. My priority is staying alive. So Fauci is an ally. Erroneously ginning up vitriol against him can only hamper the fight to stop this virus.
2020-03-29 2:57,"My thought is that a scientist cannot serve a nation if he's reporting to a dictator. 
Stalin's edict to scientists was ""don't tell the people what I don't want them to hear."" 
Trump's edict is ""don't tell me or the people anything I don't want to hear or them to hear.""
Fauci can only perform his duties by quitting this wretched farce of a regime."
2020-03-29 12:15,"As Adam Schiff emphasized during the trial, facts matter, the truth matters! Unfortunately, there are too many people in the country who think their opinions are all that matter and the one leading that is our “very stable genius”. Nancy Pelosi, a devout Catholic, recently said “Science first, prayer second”. Oh, how I long for a president who believes that and one who would allow the experts to take charge! Wait! I see someone like that on TV almost every day- Andrew Cuomo!"

2020-03-29 12:55,"Just a thought...but if those who do not believe Dr. Fauci and continue to disregard his advise are they going to spread Covid-19 among themselves? 
My guess is that at some point after a number have got sick they will realize the truth that Covid-19 is real and not a hoax.
In the meantime, is not spreading a killer disease a criminal offense, murder or act of terrorism?"

2020-03-29 5:14,The comments complain about partisnship and tribalism which implies both sides are quilty. The fact is there is only one party and one tribe that consistantly denies science and facts. The name of the tribe is Republican.

If you have nothing of value to add, then stand aside and let the experts lead."
2020-03-29 13:25,"A few weeks ago, someone I know called Dr. Fauci an alarmest creating hysteria.......I simply responded by telling this person to go and tell that to all of the infected people in addition to the family members of those which have died due to COVID-19 and then I walked away.

2020-03-29 13:33,"Why are some Americans so consumed with getting even with those with whom they disagree?

Trump, his toady entourage and his base seem to love getting even.  This isn't Monday night football where your team might be better than mine.  The pandemic is real and it affects people regardless of size, weight, color, race or political party.  The sooner we all get smart, perhaps the sooner we can beat the pandemic and return to normal.   The more we remain divided, the more corrosive our society becomes.  The divisiveness and hate is greater than any pandemic.  It's a cancer stage IV."
2020-03-28 20:50,"This man is one of the few that gives people hope from the federal government.    He would have an easier job if Trump would quit talking about hunches and drugs with only anecdotal results.   Thank God for Dr. Fauci!  Trump doesn't need any help being undermined as he does it daily to himself.   President Trump, shut your mouth if you don't have anything that borders on honesty to add.   This is the biggest crisis in most of our lives and we need an adult not a used car salesman.

2020-03-29 12:36,"What is most scary is that these same people who deny the fact of a killer virus also breed.  It is Trump who creates the atmosphere that the Democrats are against him.  
The photo of Trump backed by Republicans when he was signing the relief bill was repugnant.  Not only was Trump horrible in not inviting the Democrats, but the Republicans were equally complicit in going along with this charade. Our so-called leader is the one who is to blame for all the mistaken facts and rumors that are surrounding this horrible infection."
2020-03-29 15:17,"Europe is experiencing the horror of coronavirus disease and obviously it, too, is being played up by American media just to make Trump look bad.  
Every person who is dying or died from this disease did so because it would add to the total dead and they did it to make Trump look bad.
Dr. Fauci should not contradict Trump because, as Trump has told us time and time again, he is the one with the best and most knowledge of every subject on earth."
2020-03-28 22:52,It's actually a medical issue. President Trump and his conspiracy-spouting supporters are allergic to facts.

In fact, he has, and is continuing to do so, even for those false fringe conspiracy theories.  

When some of those end up with CV-19, maybe then they'll revise their thinking which may be too late.

Remember, November!!!!"
2020-03-29 14:54,"This isn't about Fauci.  This is about anyone who disagrees with Donald.  Forty years of professional experience gives one no special dispensation for the sin of controverting anything Donald says.
 
If one must believe the leader, he is a dictator.  And a dictate is an order or principle that must be obeyed.  
 
And besides, can we be sure the misdirection isn't Russian? 
 
Still, nearly half of America supports Trump.  It's chilling."

They may bloviate all they want while purchasing more guns and ammunition, but their willful ignorance and stupidity will not stop the coronavirus which has already claimed thousands of lives around the globe. In short, they represent the dark side of the American character which, throughout our history, has repeatedly surfaced, leaving the rest of us to shake our heads in disbelief at the sheer idiocy of it all."

I think that we need to stop giving these people a platform. First step is to have all commentators in Facebook or whatever give their name and city of residence.  This should get rid of most of these folks for at heart they are cowards."
2020-03-29 15:31,"Adversaries of the United States would find it to their advantage to disparage Dr Fauci and support Mr Trump. Mr Trump is divisive, incompetent and grandiose; qualities that have already made the impact of coronavirus worse. He proposes to “open” the country, an action that if taken will increase transmission of the highly contagious coronavirus. The likely result of ending social isolation would be an overwhelmed medical system and a chronic shortage of hospital beds. 
I think Russian, Iranian and Chinese agents are probably encouraging the trolls to discredit Dr Fauci because Mr Trump is a threat to the American public’s health."
2020-03-29 15:32,One should admire the diplomacy of Dr. Fauci when dealing with a narcissist. He knows it is more important to get his message out than to ruffle the feathers of someone who removes people from their posts for his own ego.
2020-03-29 14:51,"It time for us liberals to stop trying to coax the intentionally uninformed into reason. If the conspiracy theorists believe that the doctors, the data and Fauci is lying, Let them. We DO NOT need to reason with them, just unapologetically hold on to the facts, truth and promote it as such.

They prepare the bed, they can sleep in it. We will need to save our energy to start up the economy when herd immunity kicks in and when the dust settles."
2020-03-29 15:23,"During the early outbreak in China, does anyone recall what was happening in the US at that time? Remember that the house and media were obsessed with impeachment proceedings and then is was drama over what the senate would do. Now everyone wants to blame President trump for not being prepared when the liberal left were busy pushing an agenda and creating a distraction. Not to mention we have the CDC, NIH, WHO, just to name a few agencies who had been asleep at the wheel. The WHO particularly seemed to downplay the virus early on in an attempt to help China save face. Dr. Fauci is not perfect, in fact he has ignored some biotech companies and has constantly pushed the name of Moderna despite there being companies like Inovio who have a much better solution. Fortunately Inovio was able to be at the table with President Trump and we should see some clinical trial results soon."
2020-03-29 15:46,"This campaign is simply one of the tools the President is using to promote his re-election.  He won't dismiss Fauci and he will continue to allow Fauci to speak, because firing Fauci will cost him votes.  However casting doubt on Fauci's motivation makes it easier for Trump's campaign machine to promote the idea that Trump is doing a good job. 
About thirty percent of Americans fall for the line that Trump is doing a good job and will support him no matter what he does.  It appears that another twenty percent are being convinced by the Trump election strategy."
2020-03-29 14:54,Dr. Fauci is our best resource right now.  And this proves why we need a new president.

The disease is  spread by its champions, Mr. Trump and his acolytes.  Finally, it is communicated over the internet.  Your article is only the most recent demonstration.
     The First Amendment concept of a market-place of ideas was born in the era of printing-presses, which restrained the publication and consumption of nonsense.  The internet lacks any such restraint."
2020-03-29 14:59,"Dr. Fauci specifically asked that the media stop trying to drive a wedge between him and the president.  Clearly, his words went unheeded."
2020-03-29 15:22,"At this point in history, anyone who actively undermines Donald Trump should be given a medal and a raise. Trump is, without question, the worst president the US has ever had. It is absolutely terrifying that, in this time of crisis, this mentally ill con man is in the position of highest power.

Nonetheless, there is no doubt that Dr. Fauci is doing his absolute best, and I trust his huge store of knowledge, his experience and his moral compass to give us the best advice available. He is certainly far too busy to be wasting time undermining anyone. Those who attack him are proving that humans also have the capacity for doing evil--because that is what this is. The rest of us must fight this with everything we have."

2020-03-29 15:13,"Donald Trump (Impeached) is a joke, which is a tragedy for America. Dr. Anthony Fauci is a highly respected physician with years of success in the field of infectious diseases, the person America needs most at the helm now to guide us through this pandemic. Trump can’t even keep America supplied with toilet paper."
2020-03-29 15:20,"If Dr Fauci inevitably resigns, then nominee  Biden could say that he would re-appoint Fauci.

2020-03-29 15:48,"Is anyone surprised that a voice of reason could come under attack from partisan zealots in Trump’s America? This is the new normal thanks to the great conservative era de-education of our country. 
Getting America back on path will be a long and arduous process that, at this point, may take generations. Generations that revere and insist upon a great public education for every American child pre-k through high school.

Should trump attempt to ""fire"" Dr. Fauci, he will fail. Trump's right-wing mouth pieces are a minute minority in this. When all is said and done, Dr. Fauci will be remembered as the voice of reason, and trump will be forgotten, brought out only when used as an example of what a president cannot be if we are to survive."
2020-03-29 15:58,"I wish the extreme would or could get off the ad hominem button and candidly just encourage individual spokespersons to simply be assertive if they think that social distancing is bad philosophy or ineffective policy.  In other words, put your ideas out in the marketplace and see if the scrupulous and knowledgable accept them. That I could likely respect even though currently finding Dr. Fauci and the likeminded more credible on the subject than any political appointees speaking for the current administration on this crisis.

Of course the resulting economic havoc is awful, and as one very affected by the Great Recession, deep empathy for those losing jobs and suffering extreme hardship comes to me very readily.  Mostly the educated guesswork seems to favor physical distancing until it is reasonable to allow people to congregate at worksites but then also monitoring recurrent outbreaks carefully to determine when it may be time to impose restrictions again.  People are of course not going to like the on-again-off-again routine, but resilience, flexibility, and adaptability are going to have to be the values that prevail into the foreseeable future."
2020-03-29 16:01,"Education is the key. Only education can open the door to the advances of civilization since the Enlightenment. A large segment of the US population is still frozen in time and fossilized to the extent of being unable to function in the modern world on an even and participating basis. This is a reflection of the ideologies of the past that are still enclosed in a stalled time barrier. Refusal to accept the amazing and revelatory advances of science means that they simply cannot participate in the modern world. Ignorance, fear and hatred almost always go together. The combination is a deadly mix. This is no reflection whatsoever on Fauci, but it is a sorry reflection of the far right. For them, confident competence,modern education, scientific ability are terribly frightening, and beyond comprehension They huddle in their familiar fear and spew hatred. Reminiscent of the  ignorant terrors of the Dark Ages, they are lost in a time warp.This is enabled and encouraged by the industrial complex of the US, which likes an ignorant populace that cannot fight back in the courts to combat their excesses. The Republican party is also tied up with this sorry situation. 
The corona virus itself, free of politics,independent of thought, has had a remarkable ability to fight climate change and pollution. On the other side of darkness is light, not far away. The earth can heal itself."
2020-03-29 16:04,Among  a  field of many discouraging  things is the lack of vociferous  response  coming  from  the medical  community in  support  of Faucci. This is  the  time  for  professional organizations  to  stand up and be  counted not  because  they are partisan  but  because  they  are the ones  on the  front  lines that have  the most to lose.
2020-03-29 16:05,"Social media is the single most destructive thing to happen- ever. Worse then a bomb, worse then a pandemic, worse then 9/11 - yes. It is the single most destructive thing and we allow it to happen. It gives voice to every fringe group as if they were the majority and people buy into it because it plays to their fears. There has to be a reckoning with these platforms. Just as NPR will not broadcast briefings live because they can't fact check in real time , the social media platforms need to start vetting - not censoring- vetting information. They can do it easily ."

He is just a medical ""scientist"" part of the deep state that worked for bush'a, Clinton and Obama and can;t be trusted to support a strong dictator lime Putin and X1.  They prefer to have yes men/yes women everywhere.  How can one dare to challenge DONALD TRUMP?  he.she must be fired. We should note the ""conservatives"" prefer dictators  who pushes their agendas, democracy is for the losers."

2020-03-29 12:49,"Publishing this story only buttresses the phony conspiracy, further undermining Fauci, and giving rise to further attacks. The media continues to indirectly give credence to Trump and his loyal-at-any-cost worshipers by televising his lie-filled news conferences, reporting on every insulting Tweet, and propagating conspiratorial nonsense like this. This is no longer a case of a simple duty of reporting. The media now has the duty to save lives above all. Cut the man's mouthpiece off. Show discretion in your publishing decisions. We are at war, and you cannot support the enemy, which is in this case is misinformation and outright lies."
2020-03-29 13:36,"Here is my suggestion to Trump supporters. Since this is all a hoax, lets remove all social restrictions within Red states, let them do whatever they want, open up stores, interact, etc., We'll  close their boarders and let them fend for themselves."
2020-03-28 22:05,"Oh, what a horrible man Dr. Fauci is. He recklessly believes science before rumor, evidence before supposition, and facts before imagination. He has the unmitigated gall to correct the president's flights of fancy by referring to actual medical experience. How can we trust a man like this?"

I am however ABSOLUTELY willing to die in favor of Trump's removal from office.

So, you GO boy....YOU GO!  And know that with each and every death you move one more  micrometer closer to your own political demise!"
2020-03-29 4:02,Dr. Fauci is a national treasure.  Those who criticize him or do not understand his intention to fight this virus are truly ignorant.  Shameful.
2020-03-29 12:52,"I do not wish anyone ill, whether or not they share my opinions.  But we all depend upon trust, and America has given us the privilege of deciding whom to trust.  I trust Dr. Frautschi, and for the sake of all of us, I hope those who are Trumpites will join me.  I am reminded of an early cartoon:  Aboard an airplane, a passenger stands in the aisle and says:  These smug pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us.  Who thinks I should fly the plane?""   Definitely, not  I !!!!!!!!"
2020-03-29 13:42,"Who would you rather believe? An ignorant President who has zero knowledge of medicine (whom called the virus early on 'a democratic hoax') or a man, Dr Fauci who has a distinguished career in medicine? I commend Dr. Fauci for keeping a poker face up there on the dais in light of all the false and ignorant statements this 'President' continues to make. I for one am glad he is there in spite of Trump as he may be the only voice of reason that guides this maniac from going off the rails completely. He must be defeated in 2020 for all our sakes."

2020-03-29 4:26,Donald Trump could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and tell them to stop attacking Dr. Fauci. They wouldn't.

 this divides truth into ideology,

2020-03-29 14:42,"Re: ""Some thought Dr. Fauci was slighting the president..."" Dr. Fauci's reaction was, to a reasonable person, quite muted. 

There are no more excuses for Trump's loyal followers."

Isn't there some way to shut off such a firehose of (apparently) bot-produced divisive rhetoric? Its purpose is to stoke anger into rage. It's also dangerously provocative for unstable individuals who consider themselves called to action. Why can't such nonsense be lawfully removed?"

How about calling what it really is? 

Sad, lonely souls, sitting in Mom's basement pounding away on their keyboards. 
Spewing hatred at a world that has probably ignored them justifiably.  

Most of us can not be as accomplished as an Einstein or as successful as a Fauci be we acknowledge and accept that.
We wish them well and then we aim higher, not at them."
2020-03-28 22:54,"Stop naming extremist white supremacists, conservatives.  They are no more conservative than Eisenhower was a KKK member. As in, not at all.

There is no mention of Russian propaganda being behind these conspiracies, but it wouldn't surprise me, as their goals are sowing chaos and disinformation to cause distrust in institutions and experts. 

As professionals always do, they ignore the noise and hate thrown their way and doggedly pursue solutions to problems, great and small. The US is so fortunate to have Dr. Fauci leading the experts, and I hope he is able to remain healthy so he can continue to deflect the toxic garbage strewn by Trump, GOP and white supremacists."
2020-03-29 10:22,"Per Trump's advice, I urge all his supporters and followers to jam the churches on Easter Sunday.  Follow his example and shake hands, embrace, and pack the pews. And don't forget the free, open buffet in the basement."

When the conspiracy theorists who distrust experts come down with COVID-19, I hope they go to their mechanics to ask for help.  Perhaps when their pipes break, they call a farmer.  Do they distrust pilots and would rather have a plumber fly the plane?  Would they have a barber defend them in court?

This is the man who deserves the medal of freedom,
As for the ranting right wing, the time may be coming when America decides it has had enough and start voting out the complicit GOP across the nation."
2020-03-29 11:30,"After this and after the election the American right wing needs to put straight into re-education camps. Like going back to middle
school with a new curriculum and taught reading comprehension, basic science and social studies. But more than anything they need to have daily therapy to get rid of their a) fear and paranoia, b) their unremitting hate of the different and c) their virulent greed."
2020-03-28 21:09,The Republican right are completely nuts. In this case they are playing to the choir. To the rest of America they just confirm the prevailing Trump craziness. So go knock yourself out guys. See how much good it does you.
2020-03-29 2:35,"There may be isolated tweets on Twitter that criticize and politicize Fauci.

However, there was a New York Times article today coauthored by Maggie Haberman that was very critical of and overtly tried to politicize Dr. Birx because she sometimes sides with Trump.

If you do not like a small fragment of conservatives who do not trust Fauci and try to politicize him which I agree is unfounded, then should you not be concerned about your newspaper doing the same to Dr. Birx?

 This was not an opinion piece today in NYT, but a news article."
2020-03-28 22:42,Of course he is. Because Trump Republicans are allergic to the truth. And there’s no vaccine for that.
2020-03-28 23:35,"Fauci should resign immediately and become an expert contributor to either CNN or MSNBC. If he tries to remain the adult in the room, Trump will pick him to pieces little by little until he throws him out the door. Just ask Sessions how it went down for him. Trump is only interested in Trump. It’s that simple."
2020-03-29 4:18,"If Trump fires every expert who makes him look stupid, we'll soon have no experts left. But maybe that's the point - Imperium a Stupidis.

Lead, follow, or get out of the way, Donald. Since you can't lead, and you refuse to follow, you'll be taken out of the way in November - and not a moment too soon."
2020-03-29 5:47,"The time has come. Trump is not mentally equipped to withstand the onslaught of science, courage and wisdom at beginning of this new age. One can see that clearly: Trump is disoriented, his sentences don't make sense, and he has become totally unaware. He should step down, so should Pence, and so should Barr and Pompeo. Enter Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo.

People of the world, Unite!"

He doesn't care about dying people. He truly doesn't care. A 5 times bankrupted business man doesn't care. He defaulted on loans over and over purposely. he doesn't care. I dare him to donate his Washington hotel as a hospital but he won't. because he doesn't care."

2020-03-29 13:18,The destructive power of anger and virulent hatred that Trump has unleashed on America is itself a toxic virus that will only result in even more thousands of deaths if it succeeds in muzzling the voices of experienced sober medical experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci who are trying to save lives of all Americans not just the political life of Donald Trump.
2020-03-29 3:04,"Mr. President, when some far-right Trump supporter issues a death threat on Dr. Fauci, are you going going to take responsibility and disavow it?"
2020-03-29 4:20,Trump is a greater threat to this country than coronavirus.
2020-03-28 20:32,"Fauci is a scientist. As he has said he reports the science and makes recommendations. If western science is to remain free politicians need to stop trying to manipulate it and to turn it into propaganda.

The right wing views scientists showing the real world to Americans as intolerable. This is sick.

The right objects to evolution, climate change and now epidemiology. 

Trump holds the record for lying and Trump is the worst liar I have ever seen. This has been made possible by a dangerous and sick Republican organization. Lies tell me lies, tell me more lies...it is their drug."
2020-03-28 23:14,Trump is concerned that after he amends the Constitution allowing him to run for a third term in 2024 Fauci will be his opponent. Therefor it is time for Trumpites to take down Fauci.Good long term strategic thinking. Got to be ready.

2020-03-29 12:16,"I had no idea that far right groups were mounting a campaign against Dr. Fauci. It has never appeared in my Twitter or Facebook feeds. I listen to NPR and Ben Shapiro. Obviously I am a NYT subscriber. It took this article today to spread this conspiracy theory. I’m not so sure that’s a good thing, or that it helps me through this global crisis. I trust Dr. Fauci, face palm or no face palm, for my science information, not any politician whether it’s Trump or Cuomo."
2020-03-29 12:18,"I was watching the news press release as it was happening.  I found Dr. Fauci to be direct and factual.  I watched his face as trump started with the denial of scientific facts.  When Dr. Fauci touched his face, I knew repercussions from trump would be more imminent than the virus itself.  Not surprised at all of the defaming of Dr. Fauci.  A friend told me yesterday that Dr. Fauci said this Vid (his word not mine) is just a common cold virus and we are overreacting.  Guess you won't be surprised to learn this friend is a conservative and supporter of trump.   Now who wants a donut!  Support Dr. Fauci and the truth."
2020-03-29 9:21,"The stupidity of this country is overwhelming. Its a sign that this country has gone as far as it could and the sun is setting. America apparently does not like its comforts challenged. When called upon to adjust it becomes a some left wing conspiracy. With the overwhelming evidence like his dangerous Russian connections, wanton violation of the environment, obvious solicitation of a foreign government for his own benefit, the debt ridden economy, and now the denied pandemic enhanced and accelerated by him and him alone, yet this country supports this. It appears America won't act even when it is in crisis.  I would not be a bit surprised that if this president is reelected, which is likely, you will see a mass migration of the people who tried to hold this country together. Then America will become a third world nation."
2020-03-29 1:01,"Trump was wrong not to lock down New York State and City. 
Cuomo wants to have New Yorkers travel and share the virus to others."
2020-03-29 2:01,"There is no room for politics. Dr. Fauci is a respected scientist whose wisdom and expertise are exactly what the country needs to get a handle on the ongoing challenge. Hope Trump continues to listen to advice of Dr. Fauci and other experts. Noisemakers like, Tom Fitton, Bill Mitchell, and the email fraudster Shiva Ayyadurai, need to be aware the invisible corona virus could be visiting them soon in mysterious ways and that will be their bad karma."
2020-03-29 2:57,"It is so tempting to suggest that those who embrace Trump's public health leadership (sic) should follow his prescriptions for Covid 19 while the rest of us follow Dr. Fauci lead.  Of course that would jeopardize all of us but those who demean Fauci's expertise and suggest sacrificing seniors to save the economy are a very virulent strain of social virus in their own right.  Debate the facts, debate strategies but for God's sake try to be part of the solution."

2020-03-29 11:16,"This discussion is so miserable; the only trustworthy person in this set of stupid kids is being discredited. What makes me even more worried than the virus itself is the chaotic approach your government takes; ranging from ignoring the severity of the situation  in the beginning, problems with testing kids making you driving blindly in the dark (and now crash with full speed against the wall) and last but not least an awful preparation. A country like the US - not imaginable, especially since I work for one of your Fortune100 companies. Now you pay the bill - a clown was elected to lead the government. The toll is an incredible number of deaths; from all I see in Europe the worst is yet to come for you guys. There will be pictures which will put your unity at risk. Coincidentally (?) the same happens in Europe and guess where? In the UK there is clown Boris getting himself infected and risking to need a ventilator which might be taken from someone else who may die because of his ignorance, stupidity and not following his own rules by shaking hands with infected. How unbelievable is that? Also he was simply ignoring the problems; not preperad for anything.  A country called United KINGDOM or British EMPIRE in ancient times just sounds like hollow words in my ears."

I really can't blame Fauci though. Trump is stupidly funny and to not laugh is not humanely possible. The CIA was more successful at training agents to resist North Korean torture and brainwashing than Trump 'FACTS'."

All anti-Fauci twitter accounts should be deleted, the same on facebook.  trump should also come out and defend Dr. Fauci, but I doubt that will ever happen.  Dr. Fauci will probably be gone after this covid19 pandemic is over with."
2020-03-28 20:35,"Anthony Fauci is an altruistic  hero.  Donald Trump is a narcissistic fool.

2020-03-29 0:42,"To the authors of this article, 
  I am a physician and I have relied on dozens of articles and books by Dr. Anthony Fauci. Anyone who wants to oppose him for his candor and advice either wishes irrationally that COVID-19 would disappear or they oppose any criticism of Donald Trump, whether it be as the POTUS or the individual. We also live in a time when women like to criticize men just because of their different genders, including these authors. If the New York Times wants to offer fair and unbiased reporting, let a man and woman do the writing, preferably with at least one health care worker. In the meantime, I applaud the work of Dr. Fauci, Dr. Neil Ferguson, Professor Jason McClellan, and Dr. Li Wenliang."
2020-03-29 1:22,"These right wing conspiracy theorists are horrific.  Of course, their best friend is Trump who has spent most of his adult life regularly concocting such garbage or giving fringe nuts more voice than they deserve."
2020-03-29 2:06,"I’m surprised you don’t mention Rush Limbaugh, Medal of Freedom winner, who said very recently, “We didn't elect a president to defer to a bunch of health experts that we don't know. And how do we know they're even health experts? Well, they wear white lab coats, and they've been in the job for a while, and they're at the CDC and they're at the NIH, and they're up, well — yeah, they've been there, and they are there. But has there been any job assessment for them? They're just assumed to be the best because they're in government. But, these are all kinds of things that I've been questioning.” How can we make any headway in our fight against the virus with leaders such as he encouraging us to doubt experts such as Dr. Fauci?"
2020-03-29 4:21,Not sure if this is possible but could the times run stories of his accomplishments?   The right wing news destroys decent people and as far as I can tell there isn't anyone who does articles pointing out their accomplishments.   Dr. Fauci is an very intelligent man and someone who we need on the front lines.  We need reputable news organizations to report good stories from their pasts (without calling the right wingers names)
2020-03-29 6:02,How can we help Dr. Falci?  I don't follow social media and this why. Lowest common denominator rules.  Is integrirty extinct?
2020-03-29 15:43,Primal fear is what stokes rampant ignorance and poor decisions.  Trump and followers are paranoid and addicted to the fear.  Reason and facts are upsetting to their lost minds.
2020-03-29 15:40,Amazing how the Dr. Fauci detractors expose their complete ignorance of science. Hopefully they will wise up when the virus knocks on their doors. But that is doubtful as they will likely still cling to the same false narratives broadcast by their incompetent leader. As the man said “Ignorance can be fixed but stupidity is terminal”.

They are trying to make the United States an ugly horrible dystopia where they pay no taxes and live in castles that they protect with their guns.  Trump is the president for the mean spirited of our fellow citizens the paragon of the selfish.
2020-03-29 15:42,"This kind of smear campaign is precisely the reason I am not on Face Book and Twitter! Who needs ignorant opinions based on political animosity at this time??? 
What we need are facts not fear and smear. And that goes for both political persuasions...
I think Dr Fauci is the voice of reason, knowledge, calm and professionalism. He is giving us facts as we learn them about this virus.
Trump supporters are blind and ignorant and a great disservice to the struggle to keep us safe."
2020-03-29 2:33,"Meanwhile Dr. Deborah Birx is now championing  Trump's ""leadership"" and endorsing at least parts of his fraud and disinformation.

Please just publicize the facts of the scientists and stop broadcasting the whole briefing, it is baloney. Trump is a danger to our health!"

And why?-- I suggest because they have no sense of self-worth and are desperate to feel like they have some power which in all likelihood has eluded them since childhood.  I know it's only an opinion, but I see them as mentally sick folks vilifying for their own gratification as medical practitioner trying to save the lives of medically sick folks.  Shame on them.  They should be shunned by everybody who gets a chance to turn their backs on them in all walks of life."

You don't need double blind studies to tell if someone's viral load has plummeted, and that's exactly what happened with a mixture of hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin in a study by one of the world's leading virologists in France, far above Dr. Fauci in reputation. And that's just one example of Fauci's staid approach to a virus which recent predictions show will be far less bad than the normal flu: <a href=""https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections"" target=""_blank"">https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections</a>  Trump,in his own clumsy, sometimes contradictory and semi-informed way, is just saying to the Big Pharma medical profession ""Not Good Enough!""

Of course we knew he was going to nominate  anti-choice, anti-labor and anti-environment judges for lifetime positions.  Of course we knew he was going to wage war on the environment.  Of course we knew he was going put his own personal interests ahead of those of our nation.  But, transcending all of these specific policy matters, we recognized that a vote for Trump was a vote for the most primitive and vile sort of conspiracy-mongering, anti-intellectual, anti-Enlightenment, anti-science worldview.  The lies, defamation, superstition and conspiracy theories that we are now seeing being promulgated by Trump’s supporters that are helping to worsen this serious public health crisis represent the quintessence of the kind of conduct, discourse and society  enthusiastically embraced by everyone who pulled the lever for Trump back in 2016."
2020-03-29 16:17,"I am beyond kind words for people who undermine Dr. Fauci and anyone else who is truly trying to address the pandemic and save lives.  I can't fathom a cult that thinks Trump is more important than anyone else and that he knows what he is talking about.  His long-term failure to address the issues of the coming pandemic weeks ago, while he blithely continued to play golf, is appalling. His refusal to help states whose governors he disdains is beyond the pale.  Conspiracy theorists need to give it a rest."
2020-03-29 16:21,"I don’t think even Trump believes he can fire Dr. Fauci and not experience public fallout unlike anything he has experienced so far. Despite the modest rise in Trump’s approval rating on how he is handling this crisis, Dr. Fauci is a key figure in who the public trusts for information. I imagine even Trump’s most ardent supporters are not willing to risk the lives of their families to support him."
2020-03-29 16:24,"Right-wing trolls - Russian gov't and otherwise - are probably a major component of these Trump-promoting tactics.  It's good to know they exist, but they should be criticized and then dismissed.  They detract from the Covid conversation.

Dr. Fauci, if he can, should try to absent himself from the Trump daily political rally since his mere appearance is being blatantly used to lend credence to Trump's political hype and misinformation.  If he has a choice, he should limit his appearances to far more credible reporting events such as those of Gov. Cuomo and others.  That change of venue would itself send an important message and discredit Trump and his troll buddies.  Dr. Fauci is far too important a resource to be wasted in rebutting Trump's idiocies with facial expressions and hand symbols."
2020-03-29 16:27,"Why does this surprise anyone, other than perhaps the speed with which this sort of disinformation campaign can be ramped up, and the number of people willing to swallow it?

I wrote the following several years ago in response to the carnage the political right in this country has been wreaking for decades now:

The GOP has spent the last 40 years or so carefully cultivating a voter base that is actively antagonistic to fact and expert opinion and trusts no one but the wild-eyed messenger of anger du jour. What we are witnessing now is the entirely logical result of cultivating a benighted mob and believing you can control same.

---------------------
It's only been becoming more and more and more true as time, and The Great GOP Disinformation Campaign, has marched on.   It will be the ruination of our nation, as you can't function when subject matter experts, facts, and science are considered subservient to ideology."
2020-03-29 16:27,"Trump supporters will change their tune once the virus hits their community and hundreds or thousands begin to die. 

I spoke to a distant relative in a small town in Michigan yesterday, a trump supporter. He still gets together with his dozen or so retiree buddies, one a doctor, every evening for drinks at a local bar. 

I suggested he stop, but he just chuckled. There’s absolutely no problem there, he said.

2020-03-29 16:37,"This flow of criticism and comments undermining Dr. Fauci, to me seems to stem from possible Russian efforts to undermine our society & our historical strength as a nation.  Because our 1st Amendment and free press have protected and encouraged expression from all parts of the political spectrum to be printed and discussed, we are not used to the ugly and misleading propaganda of the type that the former East Block countries experienced after World War II.  We are Babes in the Woods of disinformation. And, what's worse, we don't even perceive it. The internet is the perfect totally-open medium to use to interject fear and suspicion into our discourse-- propaganda the likes of which we have never seen. Right-wing sites and sites emanating from the dark web can easily inject chaos and fear.  Conservatives and Liberals must reach across the aisle and put a stop to this destruction. We need the John McCains and Joe Liebermans of the House and Senate to help us regain balance and perspective. Ironically, helping each other in this pandemic should teach us that we are all one, all in the same danger-- all in this together.  Show love, concern, consideration and open minds to this truth. Ignore the lies and fearful messages. Blessings on all who make this effort."

It is estimated that this painful end was inflicted upon tens of thousands of women ,simply because curing certain ailments was deemed sacrilegious by established religions.
 Hostility towards knowledge and science is proportionate to a type of rising ignorance our era of ultra specialization promotes.The bet of president Trump is simple: there are far more people that did not complete high school in the USA than educated ones, more professional sport fans than attendants to Ted Talks , far more people who fear foreigners than world savvy folks. 
 Dr Fauci and his life long service and world recognized expertise is an ideal target for the phalanx of fascist leaning MAGA troops. His knowledge contradicts their leader's pronouncements. Their blind follower mentality is akin to these children who followed the pied piper into oblivion, probably,happily so 
What America should fear as the november election approaches, is a coup d'Etat followed by a plebiscite to maintain mr Trump in power. The mistreatment and threats levelled against dr Fauci  are the canari in the mine for America's democratic institutions.

He has undermined the action plans against the pandemic from the beginning, not enough money, not enough equipment, not enough lockdown....The escalation of deaths, soon to be, far more than China, with 4x the population, are now because of Trump.

I firmly believe she was at the heart of keeping that hatred alive.  So those who voted for him do take that personally and fight back even if it has little foundation.  The revelation that Fauci fawned over HRC does not bode well for him, given her constant stirring of the pot.  So, none of this is a surprise to me.  Fauci made it clear that he does not appreciate the media trying to drive a wedge between him and Trump, so why this article?  Leave it be.  The NYT has more important things to report on."

The excellent opinion piece by Katherine Stewart ""The Religious Right’s Hostility to Science Is Crippling Our Coronavirus Response"" is a great example of how the religious right maintains control over their flocks' thoughts and support of their agenda.

He is a scientist who has to put up with the grossly erroneous and false statements on a day-to-day basis. Whether he is tired, aggravated, or simply fed-up, who is to say. The gesture means nothing and does not take away his competence. I am dismayed that a newspaper like NY Times would even care to give this type of news footage. It is far more important to focus on the work being done rather than indulge a few whiny, corrupt, inept individuals insistent on endangering everyone's lives and using a pandemic to push their own agenda. I would love to see more coverage and space given to articles discussing the challenges and successes by Frontline workers than waste my time reading about this nonsense."

White supremacist and anti-Semites, here and abroad, view Donald Trump as their champion.  The Russians have fostered this hate and division. 

Now, Dr. Fauci, an extraordinary public servant is being demeaned and threatened through social media.  When history is written, Trump's use of Twitter, his rallies and his moronic, rambling, daily briefings will result in an ignominious legacy.

Trump refused, initially, to acknowledge and accept the severity of this virus. He refused to listen to specialists in this field.  He refused to put into place, and or prepare for, supplies, personnel, and testing.  Weeks into this, he acts as if he is the savior and can rid America of this immediately.  He refuses to take ANY responsibility and insists he is not a “distributor” the localities need to deal with the lack of supplies.  He refuses to help leaders of each state when he is criticized, rather than praised, for his lack of leadership, obviously ignorant to the fact we are ALL Americans and in this together.  I can go on and on with the inept, incompetent, ignorant, stupidity, of this president and his constant craving to have his ego stroked but it gets us no where.  I draw the line when one of the FEW people on his task force that has the honesty, integrity, and more importantly the knowledge, of this virus is criticized and ridiculed for speaking truth to a country that desperately needs to hear it.  It’s a very sad day when one must constantly praise incompetence to save a country!  Im extremely thankful and a little less fearful to have Dr. Fauci speaking truth to America.  Thank you Doctor Fauci for having such courage!"

But I'm shocked again and my daughter was in tears when she heard that 50% of Americans think Trump is doing a good job.  The 38 - 40% who always support him will continue to believe.  Who are the 10 - 12% who recently decided he is doing a good job?  I'm shocked that anyone who isn't one of his super-supporters could think anything but that he caused and is causing our part of the disaster.  

My 96 year old mother has been saying for years that if lies are repeated over and over again, more and more people will believe them.  Since he uses these propaganda news conferences to tell us what a good job he's doing before and after his sycophants tell us what a good job he's doing, I guess my mother's theory is proving true.

So it’s essential that Congress unify in providing intensive over-site to ensure that these funds do not follow the partisan and crony capitalist trail blazed by previous economic bailouts.

The other has been Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York; who has given daily updates on the conditions in New York State, the need for ventilators, more hospital beds, the need for social distancing & especially the need for accurate information from responsible leadership.
On the other hand, DT has consistently bee behind the curve on every & all accurate information regarding this virus & its spread.
He is always either praising himself for being ""proactive"" or attacking any & all he perceives as attacking him in one way or another. He contradicts his own statements from one day to another & even one hour to the next. He can't focus on the subject at hand unless it's a way to praise himself.
His minions waste their lives tracking every tiny slight, real or imagined of their fretful feckless leader, to propagate misinformation without regard to the dire consequences of their actions.

2020-03-28 22:17,Perhaps they could all get together for a rally and hear the latest that President Trump has to say about this fake news.
2020-03-28 22:31,I wonder what the role of Russia is on all this.
2020-03-29 13:35,Unfortunately Dr. Fauci should receive Secret Service protection.
2020-03-28 21:23,"I like Fauci, but he doesn't make policy. His goal is to understand and kill a virus. Trump has to save a nation from economic collapse. So if he tries to sound optimistic, that's his job. Imagine if Obama said that? We'd be praising him for giving the country hope. It's stories like this, pitting one person against another, that lack the depth and understanding required to explain the duel roles. Instead it's just yet another of a thousand slights at Trump from the NYT. Another sad commentary for journalism."
2020-03-29 15:34,"Please do not post this photo - show him working at his desk 20 hours a day. trump said administration removed thousands of scientists, hid their research, prevented them from publishing their findings, and suppressed life saving information. The White House feminizes Democratic governors while secretly providing medical supplies to Republican governors. his stated policy - don’t talk to them if they are not nice. This is not the leader of the free world - this is life under an abusive man."
2020-03-29 4:35,"Fauci and Cuomi are examples of how to behave. Of how TRUTH MATTERS. Integrity and  a will of steel against all the falsehood we have been force fed by this administration is something we needed desperately.
Get a grip and let them do their work. It may save your life"

2020-03-28 21:12,"People are still getting and relying upon news from Facebook and Twitter? I thought these outlets were thoroughly de-bunked as credible sources years ago. If social media can be a useful source for ANY news, perhaps a NYT Digital reader can explain why? In the meantime, I'll stick with the NYT and CNN."
2020-03-28 22:32,This crisis will not be solved as long as the worst president in history and his ignorant supporters can successfully intimidate and silence experts.
2020-03-29 14:48,"Anyone too closely associated with Trump becomes fodder for anti-Trump rage.  Drs. Fauci and Birx are simply the latest casualties.

They are doing a great job.  The New York Times is simply using them to promote its own narrative."
2020-03-28 23:32,"If Dr Fauci is ""Fired"" by President Trump, I hope he will continue to give daily briefings. I suppose he will be muffled by a order to NIH but as a private citizen he could have a You Tube channel on his own time.  I was amazed that Trump actually put someone with Dr Fauci's credentials on the team. So unlike the president to not appoint a faux expert who is really a yes man or yea woman. I am sure with all the conservative blowhards having Mr Trump's ear, it won't be long before this good decision is reversed. Wonder who the replacement will be?"
2020-03-28 22:05,SMH. The ignorance of so many people continues to astound me. Their high school diplomas (8th grade diploma?) should be revoked.
2020-03-28 22:55,When did we lose the ability to think critically?  Dr. Fauci speaks the truth...Trump is full of rambling half baked panicked sound bites.
2020-03-28 23:35,I just want him to keep his hands away from his face.
2020-03-29 0:34,"While I neither share the opinions that view Trump favorably and disagree with those who do, those individuals who initiated the latest screeds against Dr. Fauci strike me as members of some fanatical cult who possess an agenda inconsistent with our democracy for goals I cannot fathom. They are every bit as biased as the Muslin clerics leading the government in Iran, which they claim to despise. Enough already. Knock it off."
2020-03-29 3:01,"50 years ago, a wise 10th grade English teacher told us that you can't argue with stupid. To all those naysayers, deep state proponents, and science deniers, I challenge them to walk into an emergency room in NYC without protective gear, and kiss the face of someone with a fever and a cough."
2020-03-29 6:12,This is a disgrace to all who are jumping on the only verifiable voice on Trump's daily dog and pony show. He is in campaign mode with the media suckered into running his usual non-informative garbage. Dr. Fauci is the only honest and authoritative voice on these distractions to try and white wash the reason for the hundreds being affected and killed by Trump's January failure to get on the ball and prepare the country for what he certainly knew was coming. He doesn't like the ads where his words are keyed to the lack of progress in fighting the virus as the virus savages our country. The exponential curve shows it all. He said all of the fluff in his own words with video to shows him actually saying it. He denies it now of course. I would suggest that the networks not run his lies an edit his word on the infomercials  he spews out every day. Extract any useful information what may come from Mr. Trump's words. Edit it and run the text only and pictures he puts out. No lying video words again as we can all have seen what the words actually meant and had they destroyed any effective efforts to ready the country so as to halt the pandemic' gaining a foothold in our country.
2020-03-29 8:45,"Every dictator has his sycophants. They’re the same people who went on the airwaves to foolishly deny that “SARS CoV-2”, aka “COVID-19” and “the Coronavirus”, posed any significant long term economic or public health threat in the first place.  President D. J. Trump, in their view, is the perfect American president given his narrow-minded anti-science attitudes and prejudices. Now, they seek to name some convenient scapegoats to shift any blame away from them and their far too public knee-jerk opposition, simply to reduce the overwhelming glare on it, on him and on them of being Judas Goats, for being dead wrong."
2020-03-29 10:32,Dr. Birx may be next to be ostracized.
2020-03-29 10:34,"America has problems that are even worse than this covid-19 virus.

When we get peeved  by our Prime Minister in Australia we can at least check on things in the USA and feel so much better. Right wing crazy gangs have a hard time here as we have so many vilification and freedom of speech laws. Thank goodness, I am not realising."
2020-03-28 22:56,"Articles like this unfortunately give more voice to the anti-Fauci authors.  Build up Dr. Fauci with facts and relay what he has to say to the American people, and relegate his distractors to a short dismissive paragraph."
2020-03-28 23:49,"Because that's what bullies, who are out of ideas and incapable of critical thinking, do:  they shoot the messenger."
2020-03-29 2:41,This is the danger of Fox News and talk radio.  The truth gets left behind.  It gives the demagogues and idiots a mouthpiece to cause mayhem.  They need to be shut down.  That is the equivalent of yelling fire in a crowded theater.
2020-03-29 5:42,"Those attacking Dr. Fauci could only be trump base supporters. Thus they are giving trump the excuse he will use - ""Many people say .....""  then use his vindictive side - one of his many ""lesser angels"" -- to blame the Dr. -- throw him under the bus. Now, many people say, most believe, lots of phone calls, word on the street, thousands convinced, lots of chatter, face-book postings, un-named sources indicate -- that trump is a Supreme Narcissist, afflicted with the Dunning Kruger Effectl-- not Presidential material - never has been, never will be. And, he cheats at golf. Tainted election = tainted president. Vlad won in 2016, America lost - never again."
2020-03-29 13:47,"This seems to operate on both sides. CNN commentator and Democratic operative Joe Lockhart, among others, has been nastily critical of coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, tweeting that Birx had ""drunk the Kool Aid"" because he viewed her as being insufficiently critical of Trump, or at least for her indicating that she thought Trump was being attentive to the science here. 

I think Birx is in a better position to say what Trump is or is not doing here than Lockhart. Calling her out and calling her a “Stepford Doc” for not bolstering your political prejudices is exactly what the Times is criticizing in Fauci’s situation."

And there is no point is disputing the conservative crackpots who are attacking Dr. Fauci. They are all as “sane” as Rush Limburger and their minds (what there is of them) are completely made up. They do not want to be distracted by FACTS.

BUT - - it is time for SANE, RATIONAL, THINKING people who understand that Dr. Fauci is just trying to present FACTS to stand up in his defense - in any forum and in any way that you can think of - and as soon as you manage to bestir yourselves.

In the absence of stalwarts such as Dr. Fauci, we are left with just “hand waving” and the vomitus being spewed by Fox News and similar media outlets.

We are in the midst of the greatest, worldwide health crisis since 1918 folks.

2020-03-28 22:23,"If Dr Fauci is fired, there needs to be a general strike and marches like never seen before. We seem to be headed toward a new Dark Ages era."
2020-03-29 14:36,"It's outrageous that the Right is promoting this nonsense about a renowned and respected authority on diseases like COVID-19. Dr. Fauci has been lauded for his work with many disease outbreaks such as HIV, MERS, SARS, and Ebola. He KNOWS what he's talking about. Those of you who are now accusing him of some kind of dumb conspiracy are just putting people who believe you at risk. He's NOT attacking Trump; he's just relaying facts. It behooves us all to LISTEN!"

God Bless you Dr. Fauci!"

There is no wonder there are many people like me who have lost any belief in what reporters, like those who wrote this article, say. What a shame, balanced perspective has been lost.

Taking them to task involves at some point teaching Fox news, and Sinclair Media and the like a lesson. Why fire Trish Regan, when Hannity gets away with espousing similar idiotic views nightly for Millions of Dollars? That would be a start we need to get the country back as one people. E Pluribus Enum again."

The evidence is never discussed.  It is just dismissed out of hand and/or vilified.

Nor can “immunity” from their inherent dangers be achieved, and sustained, as long as the “freedom” to choose to be willfully blind, deaf, indifferent to and ignorant of generalizable FACTS.

Current virus-related conspiracy theories appear to remain a basic RIGHT for individuals as well as ranges of systemic stakeholders in the same way that a toxic, contagious WE-THEY culture which violates, by words and deeds, created, selected, targeted “the other(s)” is enabled. Even promoted. Daily. All around.
The “basic” Constitutional right to bear arms - for non existing militias-is protected. Not prevented. 
The basic human rightS to types, levels and qualities of equitable, sustainable wellbeing, health and safety, challenged by viral conspiracies of misinformation, misdirection, and mantras, are not protected from the ongoing personal unaccountabilities of documented sources.
How many unnecessary deaths can be associated with the conspiracies and their conspiring sources?
How much of the current virus’ unnecessary and preventable incidence and prevalence can be associated with the ongoing conspiracies “virality?”

What are our options to effectively contain this pathogenic process in a democracy in which basic mutual trust, respect, caring and mutual help are being infected? FACTS are fictionalized?"
2020-03-29 16:45,These people should be ignored.They would see non-existent  threats in any situation and this president stokes them for his own personal purposes. He has done this across the board and this happens to the the crisis that cropped up. He gutted the federal government's capabilities in favor of his coneys and sycophants and substituted their knowledge and study for him gut feelings which are poorly informed and slanted to his personal gain to aggrandizement. I just hope there is enough left to coordinate an effective response. Listen to the experts and watch the data and forget the politicians.

In this environment, who is more useful in formation of public policy, the epidemiologists who have studied this and are experts, or the President's sycophants whose expertise is praising his wisdom?  Does the Vice President who tried to pray away HIV have a lot to offer?  Or maybe Jared has been studying infectious diseases while also arranging peace in the Mideast?

Why don't you all arrange a big convention?  Two or three days long at least.  With breakout sessions on the power of prayer, the liberal bias of facts, and the lost Clinton emails?  You could petition to rename this Liberal Democratic Hoax Disease or LDHD.  Much easier than SARS-CoV-2.  Airfares are cheap.  Venues are available.  Bring the whole family."

This, after their so-called hero calls Covid 19 a Democratic hoax, says it’ll be gone in a couple of days, claims he knew it was a pandemic before anyone else, demands personal appreciation from the Governors before he will send medical supplies, calls my Governor a snake, insults journalists who ask basic questions, and now says—against the advice of Dr. Fauci and every other medical authority—we should “reopen” on Easter.  If you want to see what a real leader looks like, one who cares about his fellow citizens and believes in medical experts and science, just tune in to a Governor Cuomo press conference.

Change a few words in it and you have a good idea on he might advocate today for dealing with Trump opponents of Dr. Fauci and
his orthodox medical science approach for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I repeat that it eases and soothes me to see them so prosperous, for they counteract the evil work of the so-called science of public hygiene, which now seeks to make imbeciles immortal. If a man, being ill of a pus appendix, resorts to a shaved and fumigated longshoreman to have it disposed of, and submits willingly to a treatment involving balancing him on McBurney's spot and playing on his vertebra as on a concertina, then I am willing, for one, to believe that he is badly wanted in Heaven. 

And if that same man, having achieved lawfully a lovely babe, hires a blacksmith to cure its diphtheria by pulling its neck, then I do not resist the divine will that there shall be one less radio fan later on. 

On the contrary, it seems to me that the current coddling of the half-witted should be stopped before it goes too far if, indeed, it has not gone too far already.... Every time a bottle of cancer oil goes through the mails Homo americanus is improved to that extent. And every time a chiropractor spits on his hands and proceeds to treat a gastric ulcer by stretching the backbone the same high end is achieved."""

I spend some of of the time that I have set aside for online discussion on other republican or far-right-wing sites.  I try to be civil and take positions that are based on facts but am vilified, accused of being a liar, communist, snowflake, etc. It is an alternate reality where the answers come first, and the process moves backwards to find the right facts, or lies if need be.  It may be futile and a waste of time, but if just one person starts to move away from the insults and towards actual discussions where different perspectives are considered, I figure it will have been worth it."

2020-03-28 20:37,"With or without Fauci’s gesture and in spite of his expertise and honesty, there would be or are countless “deep state” and “liberal media hit job” posts, and you the Times will only give them more life and credibility by doing this. Nobody’s hiding his head in sand, distorting facts, or exaggerating performance but Trump, his administration, the GOP and right wing media. Whoever thinks after over three years that Trump is even capable of absorbing another’s opinion without spinning things his way is more delusional than Trump. Whether Fauci lasts onstage with those sycophants or sheltering in place persists a day, a week, or longer the numbers and curve belong to the virus, and every single governor is smart enough to know that, with or without a focus of attention like this from the Times."
2020-03-28 21:18,Of course the Trump devotees don't like Fauci. He's smart. He's mature. He is well educated. He is compassionate. He is sensible. These are all traits lacking in their dear leader.

You can't turn this into alternative facts because the virus doesn't care what you believe or what your politics are (wave to Lou Dobbs in isolation).

The reason we care, to answer another commenter's question, is that the widespread view of many Trump supporters that facts are what Trump/ Limbaugh/ Hannity say they are isn't just a funny, harmless way to annoy the libs. Reality has slapped reality-deniers in the face, and so far many of them are still denying it as things get worse. And not only denying reality, but *actively campaigning against reality* and anyone who dares to point it out.

""If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) ...""

2020-03-29 13:13,"Imagine a football game where a player has been seriously injured and is lying on the field.  One team stops, takes a knee, and waits as the medical team and first responders attend to the injured player.  Many have concerned looks on their faces as they realize how severely the player has been hurt.  Some can even be seen perhaps praying.  
Now imagine that the other team sees all this, and decides it's a perfect moment to run a few plays and make some yards downfield while the opposition attends to the serious situation at hand.  These plays get run with no consideration of the danger they pose to the injured player and the medical team, not to mention the egregious flouting of all the concepts of rules or of fair play.
Now, I suppose that either side could say this analogy is exactly what the right or the left is doing any time they speak of the actions of the ""other side"".  But it's a false analogy and it's a false choice.  There is no ""other side"", and we are all in the same stadium.
All of that said, I'd much rather get my information from an American doctor than a soviet troll-bot. I'm talking to you Fox."
2020-03-30 21:28,I remember 'Circle of Friends' fondly. That's the only one I'd rewatch from all those mentioned. Outbreak is awful.

All movie buffs.

The guy in the White House apparently did not."
2020-03-30 21:04,"This was an idiotic Hollywood movie.
Amazing how the heroine recuperated so quickly!"
2020-03-30 22:14,"Outbreak was a good flick. Wish I could find the darn DVD for it online but no. It was a teeny bit over the top as to rate of spread being so rapid versus being so concentrated in a teeny town...that probably isn't the way it would work. 
Contagion is another worthwhile flick which I recommend. The bug was modeled after SARS 2002 with Asia to North America via airlines as a mechanism. Very high quality acting work. The overall pace is probably what you would see in an absolute worst case scenario, but the numbers they used were thin and poorly explained. Concentrated on the R Naught but didn't talk about Case Fatality Rates, duration/treatment/healthcare system stress, recovery rates and the degree to which population immunity would build up. It did show excellent representation of epidemiology and breakdown of the supply chain and panic in the streets, so by inference we are led to believe the case fatality rate was high etc. etc. The crazy guy touting homeopathic remedy was overblown but reminiscent of this chloroquine mania. 
Frankly all you have to do to scare the proverbial pants off society is to retell the story of the 1918 Flu Pandemic. We're nowhere close to that scenario even now; it killed an equivalent to 2 million Americans...and we got off easier than most."

2020-03-30 23:20,"Like many purveyors of prose, Wesley Morris focuses on the script of a particular movie, and not as much on the director.
Yes, Outbreak is a mess, but it's all well coordinated by an extremely talented director who, as Wesley points out, came from one hit to go on to another.  And it's far more a fun popcorn event than Contagion.  (While Contagion has a more ""realistic"" script, the movie is slow, poorly told, and the ending sequence describing how the virus started is out of place at the end of the movie.  It should have started the film so we know what we're dealing with.  Think how soon into the current situation we knew the bat origin of coronavirus.) 
As mentioned, Taylor Hackford can tell a good story, though creatively he hit his stride ten years earlier with things like Officer and a Gentleman.  Dolores Claiborne I don't remember much of -- not a good sign -- but it was certainly no Misery."
2020-03-30 23:06,"“Contagion” is far more informative of what’s going on now than “Outbreak” was.

The Reston based lab is less than 15 miles from Washington, DC and the virus nearly escaped. As George Santayana once said, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."""

Dolores Claiborne, on the other hand, is still the gut punch that it was when it was first released, which I also re-watched about a month ago. It remains Kathy Bates finest performance - and that's really saying something - and which, absurdly, the Academy completely overlooked. The film also boasted some very strange, eerie atmospherics - the way Hackford uses light in some of the sequences is absolutely stunning. Strongly recommended. Were the film released today, in this age of 'me too,' it would find a hugely appreciative audience. Claiborne was well ahead of its time."

It was a big seller for my dad.  He was looking forward to the upcoming film and the profits it would provide.  Then “Outbreak” was rushed out, based on the same concept but a fictitious disease, simply to beat the film version of “The Hot Zone.”  My dad wasn’t happy.  I also thought it was bad.

SPOILERS!: In The End they put the nefarious Donald (Sutherland) under military arrest, René Russo gets back her movie star looks within 5 MINS of getting the Life-Saving Serum and finally Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman save The World in the last few minutes, of course. Plus the helicopter stunts are great!

It’s the feel good movie we REALLY need now!!!"

2020-03-31 17:26,"""Dolores Claiborne"" is one of THE most stunning films about women's internal and external lives. Perhaps this film didn't do better nor capture people's attention because it IS so women-centric. 

I absolutely love it, on so many levels. It's surprising, unpredictable, beautifully shot, touchingly achingly acted, with powerful storylines and all too real characters and fine direction.

I saw it when it was first on cable. I remember it as if it were yesterday. 

I don't know how men feel about it. Not my concern. 

But IF you have been abused or gaslighted, if you do self-destructive things and not sure why, if if if ... if you haven't seen this unique, memorable, tough yet sensitive film, please watch it. 

Maybe you will relate to it, maybe you will be bored or puzzled. But for some of us, ""Dolores Claiborne"" remains an ""all to close to home"" film. 

Thank you for mentioning it and recommending people consider it. I often think about and flash back to many scenes ... I can't describe them, because I don't want to spoil the experience of this fascinating, well-constructed, well-told film."
2020-03-30 21:25,"Yes, John Sayles! Thank you, Wesley Morris, for putting him back in the picture of US indie auteurs, with films that take on issues of, as you say, race--and class and gender."

2020-03-30 23:05,"I'm so glad to see appreciation for Dolores Claiborne. I saw it almost by mistake - a snap decision of a large group; we were all shaken by it; and it has stayed with me. Unlike, overplotted-underwitten Outbreak."
2020-03-31 0:08,"Outbreak is a terrible movie instructive of absolutely nothing. It's just Hollywood garbage. I tried watching it a month ago and just shut it off when the mustache twirling military villain started shooting up white townspeople with a helicopter. 

The monkey plotline is super dated and corny. And the sick people's exagerated coughing, like right into other people's faces, is so contrived, just a cheap gimmick to rile up the movie audience... I could practically hear the director telling the actors, ""cough louder, make sure you get that little white girl right in the face! Yeah get down there and just spit on her yeah!"" Like a tacky zombie movie. 

Contagion is much much better. I loved Contagion since I first saw it back in 2011! It's a masterpiece. Outbreak doesn't deserve to be remembered."
2020-03-30 23:38,"Glad that 'ludicrous' was among the adjectives used to describe Outbreak. You can call it my bias that I do biomedical research, but the lab scenes, and specifically the lab behavior of the purported scientists, were phony as a three dollar bill. 

In Contagion, it was all spot on. I was surprised in the credits that the scientists had all been actors, not some grad students and post-docs that had been brought in. Every detail was there. 

I still remember in Outbreak the ridiculous way Hoffman reached his hand into a *spinning centrifuge,* distractedly, to splatter blood all over. Great visual, but SO ridiculous. 

You have to defeat a safety device or two to open a still-spinning centrifuge, and when you do open it, you have to look at what you're doing.  Outbreak was indeed ludicrous."
2020-03-31 18:47,"Perhaps the most outrageous and potentially prescient aspect of Outbreak as it applies to the current situation was the ability to instantly clone and replicate neutralizing antibodies to save the day.

My personal fantasy in terms of our current state of affairs is to do exactly that!  It wont happen in day or a week but could happen in a matter of months. Seriously.

Monoclonal antibody technology has advanced dramatically in the past ten years. Just take a look at biosimilars for example.  The scaling up of production and screening of antibodies is a huge advance in finding those rare variants that actually work.

In theory, if we could find and isolate the B-cell clones in  humans producing neutralizing antibodies we could clone, amplify and replicate their production in culture. I dont think this is science fiction.  I believe we have the technology.  At least all the pieces.

It would not surprise me at all that someone, maybe lots of someones are actively pursuing that line of research and technology.

That would indeed be a blockbuster ending!"

2020-03-31 21:15,"Wesley Morris:
FYI, Outbreak was by no means adapted from Richard Preston's article nor his book, The Hot Zone. I was the holder of those rights at the time, and its producer, Arnold Kopelson was in the competition to acquire them which I won and he lost.
He then proceeded to send the article which I'd won for Fox, and was putting together with RIdley Scott, Robert Redford and Jodie Foster, to all of his crew members and actors as if he hadn't been the losing party and changed names of characters to barely avoid being sued.
We raced to the screen with a better script, cast etc but he started shooting footage of monkeys to commence just weeks ahead of us without a script, something Ridley and Fox would not do. It was the worst experience of malfeasance in my career. Imagine if you were selling rights to a project you had worked on for years, chose your producer and found your article being stolen without your permission and made into it's worst movie version of itself for which you were not paid.
As a result it took me over 20 years, but I got The Hot Zone made last year on Nat Geo as a 6 part limited series with Julianna Margolis, Noah Emmerich and many others in the true story of the true heroes of the saga. So your piece today was a fresh slap in the face for all of us. I thought it was important to set the record straight in the paper of record where I once worked and learned my professional ethics.
Thank you

2020-03-31 22:37,"It is really not fair to compare Outbreak to Contagion. One is by an action movie ""hitmaker"" as you call him -- who also made an excellent German-language WWII thriller called Das Boot -- and the other by a director many (except Lisa Scharzbaum) consider to be an Auteur.

I actually thought Outbreak was pretty entertaining when it came out. Its kind of like Post-colonial criticism. It is easy to go back and criticize something based on today's standards. Its not a great film, but it is not nearly as bad as some of the comments say it is (dripping with a bit of self righteousness, unfortunately).

Thanks for Dolores Claiborne. I was stunned by the film when it came out, both because Bates and Jason Leigh were so, so good and because it was a film which took an excellent Stephen King novel and treated it as a serious, if not work of literature, at least a serious novel. King is a good, sometimes great writer, and Dolores is one of his very best novels.

Finally, yes, Sayles is under-rated. Probably because, like Mamet, he flies well under either the Art House or Hollywood System Radars. He just makes fine films, and Roan Inish was just that, fine.

The Madness of King George hast two things going for it: an amazing, you-won't-believe-it-till-you-see-it story that probably isn't well known even in England; and, Nigel Hawthorne. Note much more needs be said."
2020-04-01 3:22,"""Outbreak"" was a movie. When I went to watch it, I didn't have the expectation that the story would be sticking religiously to what was known at that time (1995) about viruses, transmission, hosts, mortality, vaccine development, and related issues.

     If the movie stuck to the science at that time, it would have been passed off as simple documentary. Why pay good money to learn science which is better learned in the university, labs, books, and maybe simply listening to the specialists? I go to theaters to be entertained, to be shocked, to be scared, to suspend belief, NOT to be a critic looking for science flaws. 

     Does anybody have any idea what year we first came across ""virology,"" ""infectiology,"" and ""vaccinology""?

      In 1995, the courses in the Institute of Biology of the University of the Philippines (UP Diliman), the premier school in this country, most likely subsumed 'viruses' under the more inclusive field of immunology.

       The only immunologist at that time in UP Diliman  was Dr. Gloria L. Enriquez who had returned decades earlier with a PhD in Immunology (U Maryland). I can't recall if she ever delved deep into viruses even in her graduate immunology class. 
       These days, 85-yr old Gloria must be cowering in fear somewhere in the US, home alone, in self-imposed house arrest. Who still remembers this very fine lady, except this student of hers in 1963?"

Unfortunately, our country’s leadership (and our heath care system) has already failed us.

2020-03-29 20:22,"I hope that those who have the data think long and hard about what they release, how, where, and when.  I have seen the most astonishing misinterpretations and fundamental mathematical and statistical error being inflicted upon perfectly innocent data.  I would generally sum it up this way:

Statistically, we have a denominator problem.  And mathematically we have a coefficient problem.  We only know in the vaguest way what the correct values for those little things are, and especially in the models of non-linear models, small input* errors are guaranteed to result in large (if not huge) output* errors.

And all this is made much, much worse by the widespread use of interactive computer graphics.  People believe pictures, especially moving pictures, especially when they have no idea of the grievous mathematical misconduct behind the scenes.

2020-03-29 20:25,"There is a difference between satisfying a morbid curiosity and providing useful information.

Do you want your local television news reporter at your front door if someone in your home is positive for the coronavirus?  Do you want the New York Times to identify you as an infected patient?  Probably not, but maybe.  

At the same time, if a newly diagnosed person is suspected of being at a gathering where others may have attended, it may make sense to broadcast the fact that people who attended an event could have been exposed, and should be tested.

So, useful public information only, please.  And let the patient decide if he or she is going to be named in the news.

On the other hand, we have lived with mandatory reporting laws for decades.  Doctors must tell their state if a patient has tuberculosis, for example. Researchers who explore contact information for epidemiological purposes should be given the information they need.  They just need to be careful about protecting the privacy of individual patients."
2020-03-29 20:29,"The protocols for dealing with medical information are clear and well-established. Individual patient information is confidential and must remain that way. Aggregated information can and must be publicly communicated, especially in critical situations like the current pandemic.
Where information about individual cases is made public, it must be scrubbed of any details that might identify that person.
There is no reason to modify these procedures."
2020-03-29 20:26,"Once again it painfully obvious that government was caught flat-footed on a major crisis.    What about the personal safety of the vast majority not infected?  If the government is hedging on protecting them, then it's up to the individual to enhance their own safety based upon informing themselves.  That means demanding access to more detailed local information on active Covid19 cases."

They used CCTV footage to identify all the stores, hospitals, and public transit lines that person visited. The text messages also indicate the person’s age and other relevant information, all but stating their name.

This absolutely infringes upon personal privacy and it is absolutely the approach we must take around the world to contain this, particularly as people inevitably return to work."
2020-03-29 20:31,"I think there's accuracy in both points of view. Delineating my county, and/or city might be helpful to those who still have to work or even those that want to go outside. Depending on the urban density, the viral load could theoretically be higher and therefore not pertinent to take one's dog for a walk. More information increases the accuracy (in theory) of a cost/benefit analysis. Being so accurate as to report the address of one infected is not, and definitely would/could produce some malicious results. 

The average person that's confined to their house should be doing exactly that. People shouldn't be avoiding one area over another because there is more or less cases. 

As to dissuade those that are prone to conspiracy, I'm not sure if having an abundance of information is going to solve anything. (Most) conspiracies are not predicated on rational reasoning, and more information would likely just serve as a moving goal post."

For is that not the sole purpose of the appartus of the State? Sometimes we forget. Sometimes we fall prey to fear. But our faith in Soviet socialism will always be rewarded. Now the State tells us the situation here is not dangerous. Have faith, comrades. The State tells us it wants to prevent a panic. Listen well! It's true, when the people see the police, they will be afraid.

2020-03-29 20:34,"Another ""what the public should know"" issue is whether information about the financial danger from weaknesses in our insurance system should be publicized, now that some people who were prior in good health, and oblivious to any problems, may need the system.

Should we remind people that they may a get a $5000 out-of-network surprise emergency bill if they go to a hospital with a coronavirus emergency?

Should we make an effort to let people know that their ACA plan, if they picked one up, may have a $3500 deductible with a $7000 out-of-pocket expenses, to be added to any surprise bill? 

Should we let people know, who have the ACA's expanded Medicaid, or another Medicaid,  for their health ""coverage"", that in many states, including many blue states like Massachusetts, all medical benefits paid out for people 55 or older are legally subject to Medicaid estate recovery?  That they have a loan until death for medical expenses -- not insurance of any kind?

Knowledge of any of the above may cause people to delay seeking treatment for coronavirus, hoping it will get better by itself.

Ditto some items on the complicated pharmaceutical-benefits system.  Do we let people know that if they price-shop carefully, and keep recalling their physicians to adjust to exact insurer specs, and call a pile of pharmacies, they may save a few hundred dollars or so, but tax the overburdened system?

2020-03-29 20:57,"A person tested positive in the town where my wife and I live. Initially, the Maine CDC reported a positive test result in my county. Then they reassigned that case to a neighboring county, leading people, the ignorant masses in the eyes of the experts, to assume that my town and my county are free of the virus. That is a problem because we have a very small hospital. Only when a local weekly paper reported this did my neighbors and I learn that a person has been among us whose symptoms were bad enough to trigger a positive test result. 
All over my state there is fear and hostility towards outsiders. I live on an island. On another island in my state armed vigilantes cut down a tree and blocked a driveway so that some people from out of state could not leave their home. But who knows, there could be infected people among those vigilantes or their families that they do not know of. Is this what we want to happen?

It took a few years but when the count started climbing to 30K and higher people started marching in the streets. Don't see them marching in the streets with the CV-19 count starting to climb but I wonder if history will repeat itself as more information is given to the public. Perhaps it is an apples/oranges argument but I advocate for transparency. It gives Americans an idea of where and what to do in their own lives to protect themselves and others. Perhaps it might lead to some revelation if not revolution. All I know is that when I give my own patients as much information as they can comprehend, they feel more at ease and better equipped to deal with their future health."

2020-03-29 21:03,"With the contagious nature of this virus, it seems if a neighbor tests positive, many nearby will eventually test positive (if and when tested). 
The stigma of being positive probably is related to that person being one of the few in the local area who got tested. Even asymptomatic people who remain untested will possibly ostracize the tested individual.
Plus, today's negative test result could be invalid in 24 hrs.

I don't see much validity to releasing all test results that involve naming individuals to the general public, as it will lead to unwarranted prejudice.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Another Monday morning quarter backing by Shear et al of what could have been done that was not done that China could do simply because of the authoritarian communists dictatorship. The draconian sky high regulatory hurdles due to US FDA are finally being recognized as an impediment to progress and being unable to step up to the never foreseen challenges. 

One of the primary reasons, I abandoned my plans to develop my innovative natural products precisely to deal with current and future pandemics is because I did not think I had another 30 years of productive life left to deal with finding financing and the herculean effort required to get FDA approval.

Weeks ago I had called the centralized testing at CDC due to the regulatory requirements of the FDA for COVID-19 as being ridiculous. While I will never disagree that the COVID-19 originated in China and China did not in a timely manner inform the world about the spread, China still deserves the credit for its action of containing the virus within China due to it being a one party communist country. 

US democracy and individual freedoms is the reason why."

2020-03-29 21:15,"The public does not have a right to know if someone has tested positive for HIV.  Coronavirus should be treated no differently (particularly since there currently is no treatment for it).  In some states an individual testing positive for HIV has a legal obligation to inform others who have been infected.   A similar law may be in order for those testing positive for the coronavirus.  In either instance, the individual who tests positive has a moral obligation to disclose that fact to others who may have been infected themselves."
2020-03-29 21:19,"If human beings had any real ability for risk assessment, providing detailed information to the public might be useful.  As it is, people are terrible at assessing risk and will then make behavioral changes that can magnify the problem.

in some cases (spring breakers), the sense of risk is too low; in others, EMTs and many health care workers for example, the sense of risk is too high (making them less likely to do their jobs well).

So how do you provide enough information that scares those that minimize the risk without causing a panic among those who are more risk averse? It is a non-trivial information problem when behavioral changes are important to contain the epidemic."

2020-03-29 21:18,"There can be good reasons not to release granular information to the general public. Granular information can be very problematic when it is incomplete (which due to lack of testing, this information certainly is), as it can lead many people to think that there is some certainty where the outbreak is and is not happening. 

If you know a case has been confirmed in your city, county, or town, you had better expect that there are many more cases, and you should take measures as if they told you it was right on your block.

Long of the short is this: If you are taking different measures based on whether a case is reported somewhere in your city, county or town, vs if it was reported as being specifically on your block.... you are doing it wrong."

Our government leaders at local, state, and federal levels simply do not trust us and do not respect us.  That is why they hide information.  That is why the CDC and Surgeon General both lie to the public and make the ridiculous claim that N95 masks will not protect the regular public from this virus while out of the other side of their deceitful mouths they both claim that the same masks do protect medical workers from the same virus."
2020-03-29 21:20,"The lack of transparency and information is what got us here - initially in China, as leaders tried to muzzle the whistleblowers, then in the US, by a combination of intent and incompetence, through a lack of testing: no testing means no confirmed cases!  Trump even said he didn’t want the Grand Princess on board because it would hurt ‘his numbers’, and he also tried to muzzle health agencies.

As for privacy - the concerns are almost laughable given that personal privacy is almost non-existent in this country, as its content is commercialized as probably the most valuable non-tangible commodity. ( we need much stronger privacy laws, but money will continue to win out)

Unless you are East Asian, the coronavirus has relatively little negative social stigma (the richest, powerful and most-well known have it), so unless the patient has strong objections, it is in the public interest to know (tho we should not need to know exactly what other conditions each person is suffering, that should be subject to HIPAA; Aggregate data is ok for underlying conditions). Individuals do not need to be publicly names unless they give consent.

If I were sick I’d want everyone with whom I’ve had contact to know, and vice versa."
2020-03-29 21:21,"Well, I suppose it all depends on the data and whether ""the public"" (a questionable generalization, but I won't deal with that now) actually needs to know.

E.g.  just who all the students, etc., exactly are (name, etc.) that were told to return by Kent State University from their studies abroad in Italy is not information that I or ""the public"" needs to know.  But whether those students -- all 240 of them -- landed in Cleveland (or wherever) and were in fact held in isolation to determine if they were infected, or *not*, well that seems to be information that the public needs to know because someone(s) screwed up big time, and there needs to be some discussion, at the very least, about such poor decision-making.

But there is also too much information, particularly of the prognosticating kind that really does no one absolutely any good. Statisticians abound in times like these, everyone hoping they can be the one to say, after the fact, they he/she was ""right"" in their guesstimate as to how many would die, how many were infected, when the ""peak"" hit, and blah, blah, blah.

Sometimes, silence is warranted, particularly when one has absolutely nothing useful to say.

But myself, I really would like to know if those 240 students recalled from Italy were just told to ""go home and self-isolate"", because more should have been done, and if some politician or administrator didn't have the spine to do the proper thing, then he/she/they need to find new employment."
2020-03-29 21:21,"We do not need to know who is positive, because if he is positive it means he got a test and he must keep isolated for 14 days. But we have the right to know, every day, the numbers.
In Italy everything has been transparent from the beginning, February the 21st.  Data are given by the heads of Civil Protection, every evening at 6PM. Twice a week we have the responsible people of National Health Institute explaining the evolution of epidemic in detail and answering all questions of the press. The site of our Ministry of Health is exhaustive. No politician is interferring with scientists/doctors/epidemiologist.  Dr. Fauci would be most welcomed here and would have an easy life."
2020-03-29 21:22,"This kind of secretive behavior will only breed conspiracy theories and distrust of experts and authority. We're not talking about naming patients or disclosing their home address. That wouldn't accomplish the point anyway. It's about getting the public on-board by keeping them informed. If certain areas are hot spots, you can more easily get people to stay away if you simply say those areas are hot spots. But the guidance from all levels of government - from the White House to local governments - have been inconsistent and muddled. You'll always get scofflaws, but you will also get more cooperation if you give people more clarity."
2020-03-29 21:24,"Confidentiality is one consideration, but there's another, not discussed here: responsible public messaging to avoid seeding misinformation.  For example, politicians and public figures help no-one by talking up specific drugs before science has had adequate time to test them.  Many compounds are under study right now, and vaccines and other treatments are under what is surely the most aggressive and advanced development in history, all over the world.  But it takes time--not because of red tape, but because of the nature of experiments and biological processes. And the nature of science is that there will be many false starts, some of which will end up doing more harm than good.  Science (and only science) will get us there, but there's no schedule.

The only thing worse than no hope or timeline is false hope and false timelines."

While we’re discussing “diversity of thought,” how about including more women and minorities in top decision making?

2020-03-29 21:26,"At the moment, society is completely shut down, everybody is (or should be) afraid of getting infected and the economy is at a standstill. Hopefully, in a month or two, current restrictions on businesses and social interactions will reduce infection rates well below one, at which point new infection numbers should drop rapidly.

What happens then? If we keep the current restrictions, the economy will not recover.  The same will happen if people remain scared. If we remove restrictions without a much improved way of limiting infections, we will get a second infection wave.

Therefore:

We need an effective way of identifying and isolating new infections. This implies periodic testing of everyone, including non-symptomatic people, as well as tracking of individuals in order to identify others that may have been infected by a newly discovered infectious person.  Several countries have developed or are developing phone apps for this purpose. 

We also need a way to make the public feel safe enough to return to normal life.  Make the danger visible and give the public a way to avoid it. Publish real-time detailed maps of infection probability / rate. I believe that South Korea is using an app that warns people about nearby infection danger.

Let's not get caught flat-footed again. Now is the time to prepare for the next phase."

All that citizens need to know is: stay home if you are not an emergency worker, shop as rarely as possible, wash your hands, don't touch your face, keep the social distance, listen to the experts. Do not try to armchair quarterback this. People can help themselves, others and society mostly by getting out of the way."
2020-03-29 21:30,"Actually since people can be asymptomatic with the virus, detailed information to the public should not change their behavior. People need to socially distance with as minimal contact as possible. I am a 55 year old gay man and remember AIDS in the 80s.

Practice safer social interactions and distance yourself from others no matter how prevalent the virus is in your community."

But US government already tracks who goes in and out at ports of entry. Every time I travel out of the country and back, the government knows where I am flying to and where I just came back from. I'm obliged to answer CBP officers about where I have traveled to. The federal government already has this info. The only gap is we don't have the capability to make use of it for the epidemic.

However, if Facebook or Google gather up our without our consent or knowledge, then the opposite is true.  That is, privacy, or protection of personal data, is losing when it comes to the private pursuit of profit.

We don't need father figures, or ""dear leaders"" to give us their pie in the sky views!

Finally, reporters need to start asking CDC and Congressional representatives and staffers why their Jan 24 Senate briefing was ""confidential"" and treated as a national security issue.

2020-03-29 21:41,"We know the greatest percentage of those tested are negative. We also know some among us are positive but asymptomatic. That means there are almost certainly those who are positive but don't know it because they didn't get sick so they never got tested.

That suggests the possibility that when we flatten the curve and life returns to normal, the negatives might be susceptible to being infected by those who are unknowingly positive. Which could spark a resurgence in the pandemic. There are signs that may already be happening in early hotspots.

It could be, life as we know it will not be back until they develop a cure or a vaccine. Preferably both because testing the entire human race is not feasible."

Restricting public access to data that would provide for the identification of individuals should not result in increased danger to the public because: 1) those who need-to-know (known/likely contacts) can still be notified; 2) at this point everyone should be behaving as if someone in their neighborhood/workplace/community is a carrier and 3) even if we had a list of the location of every individual known to have COVID-19, we'd only have a list of the known cases - a very incomplete, and potentially misleading, data set.  Some of the comments posted here regarding people's ""right to know"" so that they can act accordingly support my arguments.  We need to be acting responsibly now not based on our individual perceived risks (which, even with all access to all the data available, we'd be unable to calculate), but on the risk to all of us collectively.

Nonetheless, I think that de-identified data, aggregated to the smallest degree that allows for individual privacy, should be released consistently across the country for research and public information purposes.  It's interesting that nursing homes, churches and cruise ships have been identified.  It probably doesn't take too much investigation to find the names of the individuals most-likely affected by those outbreaks."

If the medical authorities had the resources and the gumption to do that I wouldn't care about the details of where and who. However, as it stands, knowing that the virus is spreading out from groups that in cultivated ignorance chose to ignore requests to behave, and therefore spread it deep within and beyond their own social boundaries, knowing this, I can understand why people would like to know where those clusters and groups are are to better keep a distance.  I like Andrew Cuomo a lot, but his and others' quarantining places not people was a big mistake. 

Some day we will know how cultivated ignorance fueled this epidemic. Why do we have to wait to know where that cultivated ignorance was concentrated?  Of course, I may be wrong, and this is all random. Don't think so. But there's another reason to have the facts.... the only way we will get back to work is to know something about antibodies/recovery, so some data is going to have to be shared and soon."
2020-03-29 21:52,This piece leaps/conflates protecting Patient Privacy with how much hand-holding the supposed dummy public should know. This situation is both tragic and ridiculous.

America: Let's get rid of the head of the pandemic preparedness office at the NSH, not wear masks because we don't ""feel"" like it's effective (even though medical experts around the world already proved it with SARS and MERS), not tell people wear infected people have been because their rights are more important than the rights of many.

2020-03-29 21:55,"The privacy concerns here are so misplaced.  The idea that HIPAA prevents infection statistics from being released by city, when those cities have tens of thousands of residents is utter nonsense.  It’s simply untrue.

We routinely let corporations, including some based in Santa Clara, steal all of our private information and sell it to the highest bidder, or use it to prey on our hopes and fears in order to sell us more junk.  You think Google doesn’t know your sexual preferences and how much you drink, who you associate with?  And yet now that we need to slow a pandemic, everyone is ALL CONCERNED about privacy, so much so that we can’t even release anonymized statistics?  

I keep hearing people, especially conservatives, saying you can’t trust the numbers coming out of China.  But it looks to me like they are being more transparent than the CDC..."
2020-03-29 21:56,"So it turns out the CDCs guidance that people shouldn’t wear masks is false and was based on the fact that they didn’t have ENOUGH masks to go around, and didn’t want an uprising.  Masks do help prevent transmission."

In the short term, say two weeks, these are very accurate. Yet with few exceptions, our leaders, doctors and media people are not telling us  the short term predictions nor the longer term predictions with their assumptions.  

Every day the NYT should lead with a box saying the number of confirmed cases to date, and the number expected in two weeks if trends to date continue. Thus would help your readers get a better feeling for exponential growth, and the depth of the problems we face. 

Although many of your readers may be self isolating, there are still large numbers of people who can't for economic reasons. It will take a concerted effort by society to reduce the number of essential workers we need  and make it economically feasible for them to stay home. The motivation for this effort will come from understanding the worst case scenarios which we are trying to avoid.

There can't be too much information available in our divided limited different power constitutional republic of united states.

Americans also need to hear freely and fully from American national intelligence security professionals as well.

Treating the American people like dummies who can't handle nor who don't want the truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth will only increase distrust and disrespect.

Full disclosure about how supply networks would work might have prevented some of the panic buying that has occurred. We need to track cases and infection rates. We need to gather and disseminate all data about transmission and spread from community to community, state to state. We are being told we may not have access to hospital care, or life-saving equipment. We deserve to know all we can about what's happening since we may not be able to rely on the usual social protections we thought existed.

Lastly, I wish that all these health car professionals would stop offering ever increasing estimates of mortality as a way to hopefully sway government action - who knows, maybe they even believe their figures.

Hide information on people in ICU that are actually intubated (guessing 50% of people in ICU) because that would display numbers showing that NY is only using 1000 of their 13,000 ventilators for covid-19 patients. Again, would not mesh with the public message of doom.

We have enough already, having people taking it as a joke and not caring they might be affecting others.

We have enough already, living in such a rich country and hospitals and states almost without essential resources to treat this epidemic.

We have enough already, some groups just looking at the political or wealth lost of the situation, instead of people healths and lives.

2020-03-29 22:19,"While there is no reason to release the names of individuals who have tested positive,  the refusal to identify areas as hotspots has led to  the spread of COVID-19.

At the same time, New Yorkers are being vilified   and are being stopped by the National Guard in Maine, so  identifying hotspots has led to  the outcomes that  those who did not want to disclose information  had feared.

Ironically, while Trump wanted to place a quarantine on New York, and while other states seek to bar New Yorkers from entry, COVID-19 is in those states. 

I suppose that Trump may start referring to the COVID-19 as 
""New Yorkers' Virus"" instead of ""The Chinese Virus."" if Trump believes that  doing so will help him politically.

I'm surprised that he hasn't called it the ""Coastal Elite Crisis"", between the outbreaks in Washington, California and New York.

After all, if it is the  ""Coastal Elites"" and not the man who dismantled the pandemic response team in 2018, covered up the threat that COVID-19 posed to the U.S.  and did everything  he could to ensure that COVID-19 killed as many Americans as possible, who are responsible for COVID-19, this would appeal to Trump's base. 

Given the vilification of New York, my feelings are mixed on the subject.Taking action to contain COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic  would have required identifying hotspots.

That ship sank long ago."

I live in the middle of said county, and I'd like to know why.  The sudden disappearance of this stat births conspiracy theories.

Why? Are they afraid of a litigious public? So afraid they let people die? Everyone touts South Korea's response to the virus but then refuses to implement it! This is just insanity!"
2020-03-29 22:22,Public should be kept right up to date on where cases are increasing anywhere in the world. That kind of trust in people will help to prevent wild conspiracy theories and other irrational behavior. It would also keep the attention on each citizen treating this pandemic as seriously as it needs.
2020-03-29 22:22,"I say it again.  As a nation, we need to develop the political will to  empty the DOD of all the scientists working on systems of mass destruction and put them to work designing systems of mass emancipation:  pandemic protection strategies, tactics, methods and systems, green new deal, energy products, agricultural diversity issues, air quality, electric vehicles, public transportation, sanitation (sewage), recycling waste streams.  These are the priorities of now and the future.  War is obsolete (as proven by Iraq and Afghanistan).  Trillions of dollars spent for nothing.

The obvious answer to this rather simply pandemic question -- which begs why anyone should believe that the ""privacy vs. protection"" is the correct way to define -- is this:

Simply create a national database and locate infected people *not by individual house number* but by neighborhood, say the closest 200 neighbors.  This would give enough specificity for people to realize how quickly pandemics are infecting people while also protecting people's people's.  I don't care who, exactly, is infected, only if there people in neighborhood who are.

The real issue here is why some fool like me on a blog has to propound the idea when scientists and governments are full of people who think properly like this.  Why does the private sector have to foment revolution in the public sector to do the right thing?  Bush didn't do it.  Obama didn't do it.  Trump didn't do it.  They all failed."

There's a deep, if often unspoken, concern that release of any info to a broader audience, no matter how mundane, might result in trouble down the road. I can only guess that such secrecy is a side effect of the defensive posture they've become accustomed to.

If the public is looking for someone  to blame for our current predicament look no further than a President who has downplayed  the severity of the pandemic right up until his precious stock market started to fall apart around him. 
In addition to  the fact that he has decimated our Health Care system blinded by his anger that Obama  was able to pass the ACA.  Coupled with  his tearing down or  disbanding  any  government agency that might have been in a position to actually do something to slow down the spread of Covid-19. 
If as he claims that he knew all along that Covid-19 was a pandemic and given how woefully inept he was in  addressing the problem , this President should be called to answer for his failure to do the one thing that All Americans have the right to expect of him, that is keep us safe.

2020-03-29 22:33,"Two points - this article is wrong about HIPAA and people who have been in contact with someone should know who that person is. 

First, HIPAA was not designed in the era of paper records. I was an Information Security (INFOSEC) Specialist for the DoN (retiring in (2018). I inspected, tested, and accredited information systems throughout the Navy and Marine Corps, and, often, other components of the DoD and federal government. We started developing procedures and practices to meet HIPAA requirements even as final drafts were being completed. Our goal was to ensure any data contained in any information system, not just hospital systems was protected but hospital systems were focused on particularly because their systems were particularly sensitive and also largely outdated. Most contained obsolete hardware and software. Everywhere that was so, the systems were replaced at great cost. Where the systems were adequate, we locked them down. In both cases, we educated the people using them on how to do so. Most appalling, the medical community largely was unaware of HIPAA or its requirements. 

Second, very public people, such as members of Congress like Senator Rand Paul, have publicly announced their infections and committed to self-isolation. That was not for sympathy but to warn anyone that had shaken their hands, etc. If the most famous can admit they may have put others in danger, why shouldn't we all. We all affect thousands of others whether we know it or not."
2020-03-29 22:37,"Pandemics increase paranoia and stigma,” said Dr. Rohan Radhakrishna, the deputy health officer of Contra Costa County, across the Bay from San Francisco, which provides only the total number of cases in the county on its website. “We must be extra cautious in protecting individuals and the community.”

Seems that, at this point, knowing which neighborhoods and local spots to avoid would also protect individuals and the community. If this much-needed data engenders prejudice, then we need to educate Americans better about what it means to be a member of this unique, diverse nation."
2020-03-29 22:39,"Is this actually a conversation? Of course there should be complete transparency on all levels, with the exception of the usual privacy for individuals we're used to."

2020-03-29 22:42,"I have followed how Singapore communicates health care information to the public. Simply amazing, precise, expedient, informed and informative, compassionate, showing care for the entire society. No one's personal identity is breached. Here is an example: Flight number 10 from........there were infected passengers in seats xyandz. If you were on that plane landing at 7pm on the 23rd of February please self isolate and call this number so you can be tested and taken care of. Or in the neighborhood of the Heights there have been cases associated with the ""B"" church, the ""C"" mosque or the ""D"" school.
Marvelous. No harm done, in fact this creates trust in a system that is in place and is reassuring. Our authorities can learn from Taiwan, Hong Kong, S. Korea and Singapore just by watching their television and youtube channels. Hint Hint."
2020-03-29 22:45,"The answer is not simple, and it's disappointing that the article doesn't stipulate the two key drawbacks upfront.  First, with some 330 million people, the nation is saddled with a large swath of uneducated, ignorant, anti-science, suspicious, superstitious and overtly hostile people.   Directives that are proffered for the ""common good"" are, therefore, met with resistance.  Second, public trust is an American fiction.  Example one:  vitriol against the even-tempered Dr. Fauci is already appearing in right-wing media, much like defense of Hitler during the final days of World War II continued to pillory traitors, even as Allied forces marched into Berlin.  Acceptance and understanding, in other words, are not easy to come by.  Transparency comes at a great price.  The solution is not an ocean of information, but rather a commitment to honesty and accuracy for whatever information does come out.  Lies and false nostrums are destructive, but every last detail isn't always helpful either."
2020-03-29 22:44,"People might make stupid misinterpretations if given too much data. But they'll make as many or more stupid misinterpretations without data. Better to have data.

People need to know that someone can walk around with no symptoms at all, for a full 2 weeks, and have this disease and be contagious. 

And facts aren't partisan nor religious, all this gameplay about denying that COVID is all that bad, that churches, hobby lobby, gun stores, hair salons should be able to exercise their rights and stay open - anyone who buys that should have to go work an Italian hospital for a week. Then go talk about how this isn't all that serious."

2020-03-29 22:46,"To paraphrase Bernard Lonergan, a Jesuit priest and philosopher (1904-1984):  ""Inauthenticity,"" that is, lack of being true (not just lying), lack of loving your neighbor,  destroys relationships, divides communities, and creates crisis.  In divided communities, people will diagnose the ""crisis"" differently, action is at cross purposes, deepening the divide and the crisis.  The road to recovery from the crisis an authentic promise of progress.  Not some rosy ""it will all be fine,"" but a real measure of what to expect, of what to do, emanating from a deep caring for others. 

In other words, not being truthful will only deepen the divided in this country, as people will make up their own truth to suit themselves without concern for how that will affect others."
2020-03-29 22:46,"I would think a multitude of privacy protections could and should be put into place but at the same time alerting citizens of numbers of cases - confirmed- in their location. That we all should presume there are cases where we live and act accordingly is an ideal. Or frankly, common sense...There is no need at all to publish names!  But physical areas (town, or geographical area etc) would probably encourage people to be more careful who otherwise might not be."

The Chinese have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of cases, and many multiples dead of the numbers publicized.

The United States constantly brags about its freedom of speech and individual rights, but then in critical situations we see the control and shaping and filtering of important information. The US is in fact far more authoritarian than most of its citizens care to realize. 

The question here is really whether the public should know all the information available or whether they should just be spoon fed a gloss of reality and allowed to cook up their own rumors, misinformation etc based on fear and uncertainty. I know where I stand."

Since we are far behind in testing, and people who are infected can transmit the virus to others for 14 days after infection, even if they have no symptoms, we should just assume that we are at risk whenever we are not socially distancing.  Even if the names of all known infected people were posted every day, we would not be safe in simply avoiding those people.  There are many others, not yet known, who are infected.  I don't see any legitimate argument for violating the privacy of those infected."
2020-03-29 22:56,"Should the American people know that according to a 2/7/20 press release from the State Department, that Trump ordered the State Department to donate nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.  You cannot make this stuff up. Its only true if he is trying every way possible to destroy the United Stares."
2020-03-29 22:59,"When it comes to medical and scientific data, it can be very difficult to present this complicated informational in a conversational style. Consequently, information is misinterpreted, misused or  taken out of context. It is ironic that liberals keep saying trust the medical and scientific  experts, but give us transparency."
2020-03-29 23:00,"You are asking 'how much information' should be relesed to the public 're' the current crisis?

Dear citizen, you’ve been monetized by Wall Street, Silicon Valley and the government."
2020-03-29 23:01,"As a former technology exec i find it amazing that the information that is available is old, redundant and organized in fundamental numbers that give no indication of the picture of this epidemic. Were I asked I'm sure I won't be. I'd like to know (and have presented) the demographics, age and at a basic level underlying medical problems by category of those reaching critical care stage and dying. It would be very helpful to understand where you might fit in the demographics. And IBM, here the heck is Watson:) when you need it?

All we get is the same ole useless data from government and the news. If NY leaders think they are delivering what is needed in information they are sorely mistaken. Watching the Mayor and Governor hold these painful press conferences with big fat claims and no detailed data to support the information is a waste. By doing this they are fertilizing the misinformation campaigns running wild out there as they are up for interpretation and subsequent redistribution."
2020-03-29 23:02,"Based on recent NYT articles about location tracking, it would seem that one could, if so inclined, reverse track cell location data that has dead ended at a hospital for 72 hours or more.

2020-03-29 23:04,"I read is that covid-19 has a low rate of death and that is regarded as a good. That is not a good thing. Firstly, that low death rate provides a sense of security which I notice people use to compare the number of deaths from covid-19 to other events such as traffic accidents, the flue, heart attacks and so on.
Secondly, and far more importantly, the low death rate, and in many cases rather milder symptoms in some people, means they are transmitting the virus. Perversely, if the death rate was higher, those transmitters would be removed from the environment and the rate of transmission would fall.

I feel the key message is that the low rate of death is in fact the cause more deaths unless people remove themselves from the environment."
2020-03-29 23:08,"I just spoke with my brother in NM. He works on a military base with a gov't contractor and years ago was fitted with a canister respirator mask he hoped to never need. He believes the virus is serious and things will get worse in the Land of Enchantment. He's healthy but his wife has a heart condition and her father is in his 70s. His stepson is a 20-something denier who thinks coronavirus is hype, thinks a few will get it, fewer will die--no worse than a bad flu. He doesn't take social distancing very seriously. He doesn't live with my brother but he visits them and his elderly grandfather. My brother doesn't know if he just refuses to see reason or can’t understand the numbers.

We must keep the information coming, but it needs to be relevant, and it needs to be made understandable. Some information can be confusing, like downward slopes on a graph that tell us the spread is slowing (second derivative) and does not mean that infections are not continuing to rise. It's easy to misinterpret vital information. Principles of health literacy can help make complicated information understandable, and we must use them. Making something understandable helps everyone. Telling someone infections are doubling every four days instead of two days can help explain those graphs.

For now I'm glad New Mexico has a governor who is reasonable, and also has a public health background. Hopefully her measures will help my keep my brother and all New Mexicans safe from people like his stepson."
2020-03-29 23:10,"They may think all Americans like a good story, complete with a happy ending. As Trump's administration has never been particularly transparent this is why we are where we are at present with US cases topping 135,000. It's time to tell all of us the specifics, number projections, and possible death rates. What can we really expect? Up to now the coronavirus has gone through a Trump metamorphosis much like tales told by Edward Bloom in the 2003 movie ""Big Fish""."
2020-03-29 23:06,"Make a place for people to voluntarily share so that those whom they may have come in contact with might be informed. How else will we know?  This is spreading unchecked.

We need to be KIND and HELP each other."

Obviously by a crucial gift of luck in the early years before visible cases and then before an effective test.  But after those early years I avoided it by assuming that everyone I met was HIV positive.  Do the same with Covid 19.  

The granular information about where the identified cases are located can be interesting trivia, but it's all rear-view mirror numbers because the person you're going to catch it from is asymptomatic and thus NOT in those numbers.  

Stop looking for a shortcut:  assume every person you encounter is infected and act accordingly.  There is no alternative."

We are well aware of the unknowns , the uncertainty of this virus. Transparency should not be a debate.

Try lying to us, and then have the truth get out, and you will see what happens when society is in free-fall. The fact this is even being discussed is bad enough.

We need accurate, upfront, detailed, and unvarnished facts, not placation. Because no one, NO ONE, has the right to lie to the American people about what's going on here. Period.

In fact, I would be all for heavy prison terms for anyone who was found to be knowingly withholding the truth.

Currently withholding information is too easily invoked by citing privacy laws without an understanding and a thoughtful application of the law.

<a href=""https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02513883"" target=""_blank"">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02513883</a>

Abstract : In the context of modern civilization, the ecology of infectious disease cannot be described by interacting populations alone, as much of the mod-eling literature presumes. As a matter of first principle, formalisms and their statistical applications must account for the anthrosphere from which pathogens emerge. With that objective in mind, we first formally examine strategies for controlling outbreaks by way of environmental stochastic-ities human institutions help set. Using the Data Rate Theorem, we next explore disease control regimens under asymmetric conflicts between agribusiness interests rich in resources and State public health agencies and local communities constrained by those very resources. Military theory describes surprising successes in the face of such an imbalance, a result we apply here. Abduction points to strategies by which public health can defeat agribusinesses in its efforts to control agriculture-led pandemics, the heavy health and fiscal costs of which multinationals routinely pass off to the public."
2020-03-29 23:28,It's interesting to read this NYT article after Steven Lee Myers's report on the failures of data-sharing in Wuhan in the early days of the outbreak. It seems local authorities in Chinese and US each have their own reasons for being cagey; arguably in both cases choosing secrecy makes it harder to understand the situation and respond appropriately.
2020-03-29 23:37,I understand that  a lot of academics are on the outside looking in and are frustrated because they want to help.  But there are a lot of academics already on the inside working very hard to understand the dynamics and are also bound by privacy laws.

The tug-of-war is between Truth and Lies. People want to know whether or not their government is crooked and whether or not their president is a crook.

4. We don't know if recovered people are immune, or for how long they retain their immunity.
5. We know that depending on the model, the death rate will range from that of a bad flu strain up to catastrophic.

What are we without truth, even if it is hard to face. This pandemic demands truth, especially while there is still time to face it."
2020-03-29 23:52,"The public is owed the truth.  There's a reason I haven't listened to the president's Corona Virus Daily press conferences.

So, now I listen to Andrew Cuomo (I don't live in NY, but I used to).  Because I know I great straight talk. It's honest assessment of what's going on there, complete with logical plans and a breakdown of what's missing.  And he speaks with empathy.  I am comforted by the truth.

Into this information anarchy enter scrupulous people exasperating the conflicting information making it deliberately political.

A coherent approach is really not that hard in particular since we had a 2 months knowledge accumulation advantage from China. We squandered this.

As a former Swiss citizen, I listen to the briefings there. Calmly it is explained that this epidemic can only end with “herd immunity”. Calmly it is explained that we want to get there balancing economic disaster with mortality. Calmly it is explained that the priority in the first month is not to overwhelm the medical system. Calmly seniors are explained to take precautions because they are vulnerable. I talk to my 90 years old mother every second day. She understands what is expected from her, lives without fear. Her Neighbour shops for her. She is not asked for self sacrifice either."

Mardi Gras is an easy scapegoat, but what about the concurrent Philadelphia Flower Show with thousands of elderly folks jostling through the convention center for over a week (and Reading Market at lunchtime tighter than Bourbon Street)? But Cantrell and Kenney are of the ""wrong"" party to be privy to high-level pandemic data.

DeSantis is another story. The man in charge not only of DJT's official address but also a major 2020 swing state likely knows more than most.

And this shouldn't be the case for even one person. How have we become so desensitized? Part of the cause, in my mind- has been the lack of the public really seeing, being able to see. Including those in government as well. Part of the thread of American life has been to promote distorted information.

2020-03-29 23:58,"A lot of people seem to forget that the tradition is that you have almost no rights when you are a public health danger.  This comes from tracing venereal disease.  The detective work of contact tracing i certain to expose embarrassing flings, affairs and prostitutes, but the work is essential.   When AIDS appeared, public health officials lost their nerve in San Francisco, New York and other urban centers.  Apparently being outed as gay was bad enough to allow people to die.  The fake concern about privacy described here is related to our mishandling of HIV.  Sorry, there is no reason to ""protect"" COVID-19 patients from being discovered, particularly at cost to their potential contacts and their families.  Public health medicine has lost its way."
2020-03-29 23:58,"First, let us commend the Wuhan medical team who, during the yearly flu season, were able to isolate and identify the cause of some flu-like symptoms as a new and deadly virus. They quickly determined the genetic sequence of the virus, meticulously documented their findings, and reported the data to health authorities and agencies in China and throughout the world.

Unfortunately, word of the new disease was carelessly leaked from early exchanges between medical agencies in China. This gave rise to rumors that resulted in panic and flight during a busy holiday/travel season. Before health authorities were able to recommend protective measures and quarantine those infected, the virus was spread beyond Wuhan to the world!

Medical and scientific findings and discoveries should be communicated to the public as conclusive and authoritative statements rather than rumor and premature speculation. China officially confirmed the new coronavirus disease December 27, 2019.

The nations of the world responded to the pandemic in many different ways, according to their leadership, preparation, plans, and flexibility. Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and recently, China, appear to have gained sufficient control of the infection rate to begin economic recovery. Italy, the US, and the UK are being overwhelmed by the lack of resources in identifying and treating those infected."

And sufficient PPE for all medical staff and careworkers.

Of course identities should be protected, but otherwise the more data virologists and public health experts have available, the better they can respond to this crisis.

The Other Point is that much of the scientific data has been gained using US tax dollars somewhere along the way, so the Public OWNS that information, and Should, by all rights, have full access to it.

Anything less is just one small group of people deciding what everyone else will hear, and that, as was shown in Wuhan, Does Not Work. It never has, and never will.

So lets get off that horse, give the data freely to the public, we already own it, yes, some will act stupidly, but as we have seen recently: They will act stupid no matter the amount of info out there and decent, solid data can sure help the rest of us.

Gearing everything to match the lowest common denominator has cost us too much as a society, lowballing what this virus can do by political types, yet the ones who did the most claiming there were no problems seem to be the ones who also sold most stock. Figure me that one.

Another would be how the virus was acquired. Was it through extended contact with an infected person, through being coughed at or sneezed at in an open or a confined area, or through touching the COVID 19 virus on a surface or someone's skin and then touching one's face, reportedly the most common method.

Right now most people in Los Angeles and New York can't get their hands on Purell and other hand sanitizers which are essential to use outside the home everytime you touch anything the public can touch as well.  This is a far more important means of personal safety than any mask.

But there is no public information released on where to get hand sanitizers, no local government  effort whatsoever to get them to the general public as a critically needed safety measure, nor public instructions on under what circumstances they should be used.

Might be a good time for folks to read up on Foucault's Discipline and Punish.

Case in point - Reporting that xx % of individuals with Covid-19 are ""between the ages of 20 and 64"" is a politically loaded statement. Without context, location, and disaggregated data, this statement is solely a means of control, predicated on fear.

""Historians of ideas usually attribute the dream of a perfect society to the philosophers and jurists of the 18th century, but there was also a military dream of society; its fundamental reference was not to the state of nature, but to the meticulously subordinated cogs of a machine, not to the primal social contract, but to permanent coercions, not to fundamental rights, but to indefinitely progressive forms of training, not to the general will but to automatic docility"" (Foucault, p. 169).

Travelers' agency was taken away without their knowledge and consent as a result. Now there are calls to repeat this mistake on a larger scale? On top of the minimization, ""a low risk to the individual"" is a statement that we have heard mouthed by government officials many many times.

Stop it and stop trying to infantilize the citizenry. Let the people have the information they need. People who want to believe it's a hoax won't be persuaded.

It is this kind of leadership that is lacking in Santa Clara. In Palo Alto, parent's and teachers pleas were ignored by the school board.

My ONLY recourse was to write to medical archives and wait 6-8 weeks. At that point, I hardly cared who else could access my result as long as I could.

Now via KP I can access my lab results and a whole host of other things online. I can even message my doctor. And he messages me back. It's all reasonably secure. The difference is unbelievable.

I didn't live in Canada for a long time, so I'm not sure of the exact motivations and political underpinnings for medical privacy so strict I couldn't even know what was happening with my own health. My point is not to go into that.

My point is that the experience really woke me up to the fact that too much privacy can be as bad as not enough.

I find this article very timely. Just today the community college I'm taking a class at, which is a commuter school serving a wide and densely populated geographic area, and which was among the last in my area to close, announced that an employee last on campus on March 17th developed symptoms of coronavirus on March 19th. That's all we got. What exactly are we supposed to do with this too late and most definitely too little information?"

Get clear folks: You aren't my parents, deciding what information I can or cannot handle. As a taxpayer, you are my employees. Much of the data you are gathering and consolidating, and all the complex systems required to gather it, is being paid for by me - and the rest of us that pay your salaries. 

How dare you?

Might should people have trouble digesting information? Yes. So handle that. But don't withhold information from the rest of us that CAN handle it as a tactic.

Total transparency."

2020-03-30 1:27,"The public has a right to know what is going on, and that should be what's going on both bad and good.

Yes there will be a climb in the number of cases and deaths, but at the same time there will be people that recover from the virus.

If all the news is bad the mood of the public will reflect that, so there has to be some positive news to lift that mood.

The world survived the Spanish Flu a hundred years ago, we need to keep being reminded that we will survive this."
2020-03-30 1:31,"There is a difference between medical privacy and public health. If your medical issues don't affect anyone else, no one needs to know, but for infectious diseases and pandemics, we need to track every case very granularly, including through cell phones and other records, at least as far as data collection by government authorities goes. 

Also, people will behave differently, and more cautiously, if they knew the virus was in their community, as opposed to it being the problem of some other remote community."
2020-03-30 1:37,"The healthcare system in this country is so fragmented (we're the only major developed country without a national health system) that even if localities wanted to be more transparent, there would be no way to organize the data. Compound that with stigmatizing information about disease in this country (we always hide our illnesses behind a smiley face) and there is little chance a national database will be compiled."

2020-03-30 1:31,"I’m of two minds about this... on the one hand, transparent information is definitely key to gaining public trust.

However, is it really going to help to know details about where a patient has been at this point? There are most likely many untested and/or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Releasing detailed location information could give people in areas with few patients a false sense of security.

The article states that people want location details to determine if they should “take more steps” to avoid contact...everyone needs to be taking precautions regardless of the case count in their particular area."

I'm sure we can protect identity at the same time.
2020-03-30 1:52,"I've come to rely more on the first-hand accounts of medical personnel and other front line people in the field, as being spread around on Facebook.

2020-03-30 1:58,"I don't think the individual data is that critical. Hospitalization numbers are. We are currently in 'stay home' mode because we are trying to minimize the impact on hospitals and other care facilities and providers. 

So we need to know how many are hospitalized due to the virus. This should be more reliable than estimates of how many are infected. But it's not information that is being released, anywhere. I'm not sure if it will be, either. 

At this time, some facilities aren't yet at capacity and authorities probably don't want people to think their concerns are overblown. But at some point, I think it would help to create public support if this information was available. Of course, it would need to be very local in scope. One part of town could be way over capacity but another, much less so."

2020-03-30 1:52,"For what it’s worth I made my career analyzing data on Wall Street.  The biggest challenge with data like COVID 19 is contextual based analysis.  Journalists are epically bad at this because they want to highlight the outlying data points to collect eyeballs.
Weighted averages, means, medians and categorizing data groups is boring and ruins a good headline.  Bottom line is we should get data straight from the data owner with a contextualized analysis and let them explain their interpretation.

2020-03-30 1:55,"I would like to offer the observation that the Main Stream Media (NYT & Washington Post, we're looking at you here, among quite a few others) have led us straight to this rather unfortunate situation. They are not the root cause, to be sure; that belongs to the arrogant ""data scientists"" who noted the possibility of deanonymizing data and built their curriculum vitae on papers reporting it. Nonetheless, the MSM have put forth a magnificent effort to whip up a moral panic about ""privacy"" (without, generally, having bothered to define what they are writing about, leading to absurd claims that a person's presence on a public street needs, somehow, to be regarded as ""private."" Indeed, to make the point they have sometimes deanonymized data they have obtained through unlawful acts of others and published results of its analysis.

As far as I know, what follows is entirely hypothetical. However, I would not consider that the fact I have COVID-19 should be kept from my neighbors or, for that matter, anyone else. Neither would I think fact that my neighbor had it to be private information that I must be kept from knowing, nor do I think they would consider it such, despite that all of them keep their private matters to themselves. We are, collectively, in a serious situation that can be helped by analysis of anonymized personal information. That overrides the small risk that it might be misused by some bad actors."
2020-03-30 1:45,"I guess I have to accept the fact that a dearth of vital information is made necessary by HIPAA, but I'm sure not happy about it.  HIPAA is a law that I hate, even though it was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton with the best of intentions.  Violation of patient privacy could mean all kinds of harm to the patient, so I get it.  Unfortunately, there are so many unintended bad consequences to HIPAA that if I had the power I would scrap the law entirely.  I know I have a minority opinion, but I'll take security over privacy every time."

2020-03-30 2:17,It is very simple. If health officials want any credibility they will release all information that does not impact patient privacy. Because of the pandering to big pharma and King Lear in the WH the credibility of the medical establishment is not too high.

2020-03-30 2:24,"""Residents are clamoring to see whether the virus has been detected in their neighborhoods so they can take more steps to avoid any contact""

Doesn't matter whether it has been detected there or not, they should be taking the same protective no-contact measures. Knowing who in fact is infected helps no one.

But it's morally wrong to withhold data from people. And dangerous."
2020-03-30 2:29,"The brilliant idea of our democratic republic is that a fully informed population corrects policymakers. We are not children, but are collectively more informed than a handful of ""health experts"" who might prefer to withhold information that could prove their opinions incorrect. We are their peer reviewers, but only with accurate information.  

""Expert"" policymakers' numerous mistakes in this crisis defy common sense that would saved lives. Policymakers' rosy assurances -- the virus will stay in China; the spread won't be bad here; we don't need to quarantine; a partial quarantine will suffice; there's no need to wear masks--have been shown to be wrong, deadly wrong. 

App makers worldwide have our anonymized location and shopping data, which they use to make money. Far better to use it to keep us alive. 

Maps of public locations visited by anonymized infected patients could be correlated to infection spread. That would usefully warn us away from certain locations, highlight practices causing infection spread, or urge us to or to take greater quarantining care. 

Which grocery store needs to do a better job of maintaining social distancing?  Which pharmacy has credit card reader systems that cause greater infection spread?  Which hospital is better at treatment?  

Data would tell, but the way this is being handled, we'll never know until it is too late."
2020-03-30 2:29,To suggest that it would be stigmatizing to release more detailed information on cases—while at the same time saying it would not provide useful information—seems like nonsense.

2020-03-30 2:40,"I work in data. In the NYTimes, Johns Hopkins maps of Covid-19, I can see the ARC geocode data - mapping the virus infections (Covid-19) to summarized geocodes.  In Santa Clara County, they are using Microsoft BI,  (I can't see it), and present multiple charts on one ""dashboard"" - excellent. 

Those working with data know that the display of data with maps and charts of disease numbers is a representation of  primary data (as in a single numeric piece of data representing a single infected person) however, the other related data is calculated, and is secondary data. 

I would like to see more primary data -The US Post Office  workers do too.  Instead of geocode summarization, the government should provide actual geocodes specific for where the diseased person was diagnosed and resides.  

For example,if an individual in a small town uses a post office box frequently but comes down with Covid-19, then I think it a duty of the Mayor and the town's County Health Director to inform the public that the person frequented that post office.  

Age data for the recently dead by this infection, could be misleading.  Age is not the ultimate determiner of whether the infection will prove fatal.  So, there has to be analysis accompanying the geolocation data.

We have to trust that people can be as intelligent about the infection as they can be."

They want to be told the good side of it like how many recovered, how many DO have PPE and u can even tell them that it'll be over in a few days. Don't forget to say something nice about the politician they worship.
Gov't should give people as much info as they have. I don't see any reason for not being transparent. Unless u have something to hide. The current administration is the most secretive gov't we've probably ever had. And they lie every time they open their mouths. People will worry as long as the trump regime is the majority."
2020-03-30 2:43,"What I’d like the reporters of the NYT to do is to find out, just as Trump suggested, finding out where all the PPE’s are going? On a normal day in the largest hospital in NYC they used 10,20 thousand face masks. But now they need 300,000. With no elective surgery, Patient loads and visits are small to none In our smaller town where my husband is a surgeon. Instead of seeing 50 patients in the office on a normal day he sees 5. The hospital here had to lock up all masks as patients were stealing them. People are even stealing the toilet paper rolls from the bathrooms. Any individual selling PPE’s in large quantities online should be found and arrested. That would be good investigative journalism!"
2020-03-30 2:44,"The only ones served by keeping the truth hidden are those in power. They use mis-information, and dis-information, and out right lies, to keep the people in the dark and confused, starved for the ""truth"", which those in power decide what that looks like to suit their purposes. We have a President who calls the truth ""fake news"" and ""lies"", and 40% of Americans believe him. If he said the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, 40% of Americans would accept that. 

The truth has been hijacked by those whose interests are served by confusion and doubt, because that prevents anyone from being unified in opposing them. 

For all of the ""top secret"" programs and information our government has created, are we safer? No, we are not. We would be safer if we had no secrets, and the people could see what was really going on. Does anyone really think that our ""top secret"" labels has prevented our enemies from knowing those secrets? In fact, our enemies know more than the American people. So, again, WHO is really served by secrecy? And can we really call ourselves a democracy when our ""leaders"" keep us in the dark to advance their own power and agenda?

There's a saying ""You're only as sick as your secrets"". This pandemic proves that in spades."
2020-03-30 2:44,"I have a hypothesis about the way the peak works based on the following reasoning.  For every 100 cases, 80% are fine, 20% get sick and on average 1% die (according to the NY Times model default setting anyway).  So, that would suggest for each death there are 99 cases of herd immunity.  Therefore, my theory is that as people start to recover from the virus, we get a peak before too long because as people recover the rate of herd immunity grows  99 x faster than the death toll.

Is there an epidemiologist or infectious disease expert out there that can debunk my theory?  I have not yet seen the herd immunity curve plotted against the model for the death toll."

We pay government workers salaries.  This has been lost on some individuals who have taken the position that the general public SERVES Donald Trump his family and the sycophants that surround him.  The America people need to know the facts, the science and the reality of what is happening with COVID-19.  Most of us do believe in science, mathematics and evolution."
2020-03-30 2:46,"The more accurate information the better. 

I reference the NYT article ""How South Korea Flattened the Curve"" of March 23. Lesson #3 in the article describes their testing and extensive contact tracing. They even send out messages to the citizens of localities when new cases are detected and where that person has been. 

Clarity and honesty is what I want from my government. 

I also fear the role of government that interferes to keep us from using information in order to affect the ""value"" of an area or business. That is dangerous in a different way."

For reasons we cannot fathom, the authorities refused to inform the public about what activities the couple engaged in during their visit or which restaurants they ate in or which stores they may have shopped in. Why? And now we have 7 cases (or more) and expect further increase, but are being provided little to no information about who might be potentially affected. Why? They don't have to give us names or other identifying information -- just the details about where infected people stayed and what they did while here. Just sayin'."
2020-03-30 2:52,"I think one of the main reasons (for me) in not wanting the results common knowledge, is that I would feel that I did something wrong. It is very important I believe with a virus of this much mystery, is its capacity to be transmitted so with unprecedented virulence. There is no way to even know how or when one picked it up.
       I performed in front of thousands of people for 5 weeks in NYC , in a theatre that does not get a flow of air from the outside. In a way a perfect petri dish, for one to become infected. So far, no one in our company , or audience member has been reported as having gotten it. I wish we could all destigmatize everyone else, and pretend like we all have it, as reports seem to suggest an enormous eventual number. This way we can treat one another with more compassion and understanding, for a bug which seems to transmit in a way that has never quite been seen before.

The general public does not need the name of a person who has the virus, unless there is a very compelling reason...like the need to track people that he or she may have come in contact with.

But the overriding thing for me is TRUST. If we don't have trust in the person or agency giving or asking for information it makes it very hard to cooperate.

They used drones in China to watch people and tell them to go back home and stay there.  My heart goes out to all the people of New York,  I want to see the city flatten the curve asap but more measures to keep people at home, reduce travel and more testing of everyone.

HIPAA exists to protect personal privacy not the untouchability of state and local officialdom.

There is no data question, except names, addresses and membership in ethnic groups that cannot be solved by releasing the information..

In the main, an informed public assures that most of us will obey public health recommendations.  There will always be conspiracy theory idiots who disobey but the best way to combat them is to provide more information."

As coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx noted at Thursday’s press briefing, COVID-19 isn’t behaving in the real world as it does in models. COVD-19 has killed just over 21,031 persons worldwide, not hundreds of thousands or millions as it would have if the models were correct.

 The epidemiologist are already backing off their worse-case scenarios. The often-cited British epidemiologist who predicted COVID-19 would kill 2.2 million Americans and 510,000 British now says U.K. deaths are unlikely to top 10,000. Two Sanford University medical professors said Wednesday that COVID-19 has infected mullions more than thought, but that its actual mortality rate is about 0.01 percent, which is about one-tenth of flu’s 0.1 percent mortality rate. According to the CDC, COVID-19 has killed about 2,400 Americans; it estimates that flu has killed at least 24,000 Americans this season."

2020-03-30 3:11,"I’d just like to see some data on the primary way people are being infected. Most people remember being coughed or sneezed on because it’s so gross. Why haven’t we read anything about a COVID-19 patient recounting the moment he/she got infected? 

Because most people who contract the virus likely weren’t coughed or sneezed on directly, but rather, probably just happened to walk through an area where somebody with the virus had coughed or sneezed within the past three hours, or had simply been talking in the area. Why are we not telling people that talking is a way that the virus spreads? 

If people could see a super gross infrared video of how much “spray” comes out of our mouths when we talk, they’d be completely silent when venturing into a public space. If we want the spread to slow down, we need to be much clearer about how this virus is spreading. Most people know not to touch their faces without scrubbing their hands down to a raw state, but people are still getting the virus. Let’s address that."

Health care:  Most expensive in the world with the worst outcomes per capita when compared to other first world nations.  Bitterly argued....nothing done.  Now when there will be tens of millions of people thrown out of work and their health insurance, if/when treated for the virus you'll have bankruptcy to look forward to...and yet another subject to argue bitterly and divisively about.

Gun control:  Most gun deaths of any nation.  Solution....more guns and blame violent music and video games because other countries don't have violent music or video game.  Laughably ridiculous if not for 40,000+ deaths a year.  When the hoopleheads (who all have guns) decide they don't want to be locked up in their homes for months on end with no money or health insurance...well...enjoy!

Pandemic:  This has been the most entertaining....no threat...end of days apocolypse...etc.  But, the most consistent part of this bitter argument, like with gun control and the health system is to do nothing.  As this article has carefully pointed out.  Don't track the virus...who wants to know where it is?  Don't test for the virus or trace contacts...who cares who has it.

What was striking over the first 50 or so announced cases prior to community transmission, was that even the specific flight time, date and origin for each case was published in news sites, so others on that flight or in the airport at that time were able to get tested themselves and reduced the rate of spread. 

Since the end of January, when 14 day quarantines were begun for arrivees with no homes to self-isolate in, they have been holed up in hotels for their 14 day quarantine. 

Since March 23, with only returning Kiwis allowed back, and self-isolation more rigorously enforced, some of these hotel-quarantined lacked food because only supermarkets are open since March 24 - and hotels tend to be in areas with restaurants, now closed the Red Cross was organized to distribute meals to them. Because the government health board was monitoring quarantines, these people did not fall through the cracks, so they got the help they needed.

Over the course of the last few decades, the United States has fallen into the dark abyss of secrecy: if truth is inconvenient, just cover it up and don't disclose it. The United States needs to implement mandatory real-time public reporting of the CDC's dangerous biological threats.  <a href=""https://cddep.org/blog/posts/the-untimely-reporting-of-drug-resistant-outbreaks"" target=""_blank"">https://cddep.org/blog/posts/the-untimely-reporting-of-drug-resistant-outbreaks</a>/"
2020-03-30 3:40,"It is really important to tell people told how many people have been tested in a given county, and on what basis they were tested (because they were first responders, admitted to a hospital, etc), not just how many have tested positive.   We need to know what kinds of people are being tested, and what percentage of those groups are testing positive.

(For some states, that data is readily available. )

No one will have the ability to make informed decisions if we do not get information to researchers.   

Obviously the biggest hole in our information is the ongoing paucity of testing, and the ongoing paucity of information about exactly when testing--in particular antibody testing--is going to be available.  People understand that for now, those of us who are not doctors, or NBA players, or first-responders, or admitted to hospital, still cannot get ourselves or our loved ones tested even if we or they have symptoms.  We understand that essentially, no one can currently help us figure out our risks in that realm.

At least give us what information you can.  No testing available to us plus too stingy of data is a recipe for disaster."
2020-03-30 3:32,"Whilst the experts deliberate on the subject of how much information to disclose, I say this:   AT LEAST STOP LYING TO US.

Health care workers do not have enough protective equipment.  If they can't protect themselves they can't protect you.  They can't provide care to you if they are dead.  

We are not testing enough people.  Persons without symptoms can be highly infectious.  

There is no law prohibiting disclosure of public health data - case numbers, case locations, anonymized hospital censuses, death rates.    With PPE and test kits in extremely short supply, such data are being touted as grounds for selective rationing.  

Whether we flatten the curve or not, the lee side of the curve will last much longer than the upswing (which is showing no sign of decelerating).  Things will not return to ""normal"" unless and until there is an effective vaccine, universally available, without direct cost to those receiving it."

2020-03-30 3:40,"Without giving personal information the transparency of the information provided on COVID-19 would improve greatly if, together with the # of cases, deaths, recovered, etc. we are informed of:

1) The corresponding # of tests.  For example, if 5000 tests are run the impact of 500 new cases is much different compared to only having done 1000 tests  -we, the public should be informed.

2) The RATE at which the # of cases are changing, for example the ""days to double the # of cases"" can be easily calculated and at least approximates an exponential rate of infection typical of such a virus."
2020-03-30 3:43,"There would seem to be no excuse for not reporting the cities where cases occur.  No we don't want to frighten people unnecessarily, but right now it is necessary.  The more people know, the better they can protect themselves.  it's not like with criminals, and yet I can get a map with every sexual predator in my zip code.   Why can't I know where -- in what city -- this virus is?  Of course, no one knows how many people in their city are infected, since even symptomatic people can't get tested.  We have to assume that everyone is infected.  What a way to live."

Yes, work from home and stay at home; but those of us with kids have to take them out to the parks to run/bike/play.  They will come into contact with other kids; that is fine.

We have asked our our 60 year old nanny not to come in, since if the virus got to her she could have a bad outcome - and we are continuing to pay her.  

But the country seems to have lost its collective mind.  I remember the 1990's when we were told that HIV/AIDS was an ""equal opportunity killer"" despite what the data actually showed.  I'm not giving my kids the same anxiety that was forced upon me, I tell them that they don't need to worry about Corona virus but we have to be careful to help grandma, grandpa and others we care about plus the elderly folks that the rest of our community cares about.

The data showing the vast majority of deaths are elderly people with comorbidities (diabetes, CHF, etc) needs to come out so we can start acting rationally again."

While the trend lines here in California are encouraging, more data would help be helpful if there is evidence of spread that is dispositive.

NextDoor could even be useful."
2020-03-30 8:13,"'In the perennial tug-of-war between privacy and transparency in the United States, privacy appears to be winning in the coronavirus pandemic.'

2020-03-30 4:37,"The most important information is unknowable at present.

Dr Fauci did say 100,000 to 200,000 deaths but he stressed the unreliability of such figures.

We cannot know the future with precision.

One contributor to the unknown is that we don't know how effective our social distancing policies will be.

Another factor is the lack of ventilators.  Unfortunately we have no idea how long the shortage of ventilators will exist.  The Trump administration has been opaque regarding its policies on producing the needed ventilators, if it has one.

In a worst case scenario we might be looking at a million fatalities in the US or even more.

At times like this we need leadership.

There should be a committee of industrialists and government officials, who are tasked with finding a way of producing ventilators fast, perhaps by collaboration between several large corporations like GM or Ford, or perhaps medical equipment companies, who can retool in a short time frame.

This is not an issue of lacking the appropriate information.  It is primarily an issue of leadership needed by the executive branch of government.

Sadly, we have a leader who is incompetent at leading when it is needed."

One's own genetic data, and non-contagious disease history, should be absolutely private except as the individual chooses to share.
One's own publicly contagious disease data, including Covid-19, should be absolutely public. This would include any disease one can acquire by normal public interaction. If one's neighbor or coworker has Covid-19 one should also be informed, and not have to ask for the information."
2020-03-30 7:36,"Since we currently have a dysfunctional and corrupt administration in place, of course they want to limit the flow of information.  Information is power and authoritarian regimes like to dole it out judiciously.

It's not possible to fully protect yourself from this disease without having all the available information at your fingertips.

The data suggests this virus is far more contagious than we first thought.  It also suggests that while it seems to be deadlier for older people with underlying illnesses, it's clearly also attacking, and killing, those in their 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's.

Since this administration both downplayed the seriousness of the virus, and lied about almost everything associated with it, the public has a right to total transparency and protection under HIPPA."

Today its all in the social distancing, cleanliness and careful protocols by now well-publicized. We must let the public health people do their jobs tracking down the links of connections, and we must be smart about doing our own -- staying home and being stafe by maintaining distance."

Even the smallest towns on the San Francisco peninsula have at least 7000 residents and most have many times more than that.  Reporting by town is not granular enough to allow identification, especially when everyone is staying in their house anyway.  How would I know if my neighbor is ill unless I knew them personally anyway?  If breakdowns by race or age result in small numbers, a threshold should be set below which these data are not reported.  Anything else leads to more suspicion and disbelief.  People are not going to cooperate with restrictions if they think they are being bamboozled."
2020-03-30 3:54,"Our public health department told us that the risk in our county was very low because there were no confirmed cases (when testing was almost completely unavailable). We were told that there was ""no evidence"" for community spread, ""no evidence"" that the virus could survive on surfaces, and ""no evidence"" that it could survive in the air. There was ""no evidence"" either way because the research hadn't yet been done!

Of course, this ""no evidence"" was most commonly translated as ""doesn't happen"" by other agencies and the public, at a time when common sense biology should have been used to make predictions that could have saved lives. And now that the evidence is in that all of these things are important in transmission, there are still too many people who remember and believe the ""no evidence"" (aka ""doesn't happen"") proclamations, and act accordingly.

Yes, we need full information what is going on, and about the limits of our knowledge. Officials need to trust in the intelligence and wisdom of our citizens, not herd us around like dumb sheep. We need proactive public health leadership with insight and courage to rise above their textbook learning and bureaucracy."
2020-03-30 3:58,"Santa Clara County has made a lot of life or death decisions based on prioritizing extremely liberal thinking over lives, and I say this as a very liberal person. They closed schools well after other cities despite having one of the largest outbreaks in the country at the time, because they didn’t want to harm any low income students (ironically, given how few low income students there are as a percentage in these schools compared with other areas). And they don’t want to give city infection numbers for fear of discrimination against racial groups, even though it’s hard to see how a citywide number could reveal anything about the races of the infected individuals. As liberal as I am, I would still prioritize saving lives over preventing potential (mild) discrimination or causing economic hardship (especially at the outset of this outbreak; long term economic hardship will have to be weighed against the health risks at some point). I think in the Bay Area the culture is so liberal that some people are willing to put lives at risk in order to maintain their liberal ideals. Ideals can’t always be met in an emergency pandemic unfortunately."

People that cannot make the switch to the new reality should be replaced quickly.

To get public cooperation, people need to know if their zip-code has cases, but not that their next door neighbor is positive. There is a balance between knowledge, disclosure, and outing an individual. We do not need to out an individual. 

If an individual tests positive, the medical community will do a contact tree and let those at risk know. The medical community does not need to list names in a public disclosure; that goes against laws of releasing personal information. 

After the president and pompeo used racist labels for COVID-19, we started seeing reports of attacks against Asians who were strangers to the attackers. Imagine how these same attackers would react if they knew John or Jane tested positive!

Yet imagine if an infected patient refused to tell public health officials where they’d been or who they’d had contact with, in effect saying, “It’s my privacy and the privacy of the people I’ve contacted so I’m not telling you.” 

Of course it’s outrageous, but the converse is equally outrageous. It’s a two-way street. Information is power that can enlist communities as partners.

My suggestion was to further describe in which villages or towns of each county there are active cases of the disease for the purposes of educating the public sufficiently to know when to curtail their excursions in town, thus acting as a preventative incentive to reduce the disease spread, while still maintaining the very necessary privacy of each patient.

Within the last hour, I posted a video on You Tube describing in detail a ventilator prototype weeks in the making and refinement to be shared with all respiratory focused industries to save lives. The video can be found by the search term; ""Gas Powered Ventilator""."

This knowledge would help me decide where to shop and what areas to stay away from.  If my health could be at risk, I should know.  Is the virus active in San Jose, Mountain View, or further north, Mill Valley, Sausalito, San Rafael. Having that information would not give me any hint which individual has the virus; it would inform me as to areas I need to even be more careful in.  Not knowing is creating a sort of paranoia.

Underlying this problem are the long term Republican efforts to undermine our government, Starve the Beast, sow distrust, and deliberately cripple its effectiveness for average citizens. Republicans are serving the Libertarian Agenda. That agenda is based on the principle that Greed is Good. Its inevitable aim is to enable Rule by Wealth as supreme over rule by democracy. ""Freedom"" and ""Liberty"" is the perverted rhetoric they hide the aims of their policy with. Make no mistake...the dissembling, the incompetence, the corporate pigs at the trough aiming to profit off of tragedy are squarely on the heads of the Republican party.

They ensure it spreads out of control, becomes impossible to contain, and that countless die who'd otherwise live.

America now has more known Coronavirus cases than any other country, yet the number is estimated at only approx. 5% of all actual infections due to a criminal lack of testing, most dramatically in red states. Millions of Americans are now infected, presymptomatic, yet highly contagious. Each infects at least 2.3 people, who each in turn infects at least 2.3 people, who each then…

It is why Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch stated infection rates in the US will be at least 40%, but closer to 70%. The question isn't how many will die, but how many millions will die. If the death toll remotely compares to Italy and Spain, we're talking about millions of Americans dying.

Where are the 3.5 billion masks we need, Trump?

HHS said we need 3.5 billion medical-grade N95 respirator masks over the next year, and we currently have 12 million, well less than 1% of what's needed. We also need a boatload (and I mean Titanic-sized) of surgical face masks, surgical goggles, gowns, gloves, and other personal protective equipment - with only 1% of that boatload in stock.

What, specifically, are you doing, Trump, to replenish, now, personal protective equipment that our hospitals only have less than 1% of to deal with this virus?

And, after doing everything he could to not act, Trump was forced to cut a deal with GM to build 100,000 ventilators in 3.5 months. After waiting over 3 months to get that kick started, and downplaying the virus for months.

100,000 ventilators in 3.5 months.  That's it.

Who does your math, Trump.....you?  The American Hospital Association estimates 960,000 Americans will need mechanical help to breathe during the coronavirus pandemic.

We need a million ventilators, Trump. Not 100,000.

In an epidemic, good information slows the spread of disease. For example, if you know there is an outbreak of measles in a region, you might not travel there with a newborn child.  
Individual health decisions to keep a safe distance will reduce the stresses on families, employers and hospitals. 

Knowing locations of outbreaks is not a personal attack on residents of an area. Surely we understand that every human being looks the same to viruses and we are all vulnerable. 

In my region, one of the first known cases was a bank employee who had travelled on a cruise.  Her age and gender was reported and her line of work.   Her employer temporarily closed two branches where she had worked and this was reported. The health authority contacted people with whom she had interacted. 

Releasing information other than a person’s name and address seems reasonable to me.

I don't care about names. I will find out if it is someone I know. What is necessary is that an infected person was at Name of Place between the hours of A -B. That way if I was there I can self isolate, contact a doctor, watch for symptoms, and so on. It also allows the place to be properly cleaned."

Such information is critical in stopping the spread. Yes, some people will get worried, but for most it is reassuring.

2020-03-30 10:49,"It’s been painful to watch deaths go exponential here despite our heads-up early lockdown. Hospitals are about to hit capacity and we will soon be facing the grim realities of making probability-based treatment decisions. 

Yet we are on an isolation island here in Louisiana. None of our neighbors have implemented meaningful stay-at-home orders that in any way resemble the rest of the world’s demonstrably necessary measures (should lockdown be one’s chosen method of suppression). The notion that *any* information at all should be kept from the public stings extra good here in Nola and surrounding municipalities, where we just threw one of the world’s biggest free parties. The party where we throw millions beads. Would’ve been nice to know that the perfect ninja-virus was using doubloons and Krewe cups as vectors fo sho, y’all."
2020-03-30 10:27,"When public figures - Tom Hanks, Boris Johnson, Prince Charles, Justin Trudeau and others - didn't seem to mind admitting they had contracted COVID-19, they had showed the world that there's nothing stigmatic about their predicaments. 
It's time to get this privacy issue straight. It may be too late to contain the current pandemic, but at least there'll be a guideline for future cases."
2020-03-30 10:55,why is this even a debate?  information informs decision making.  how many more Americans are taking distancing more seriously today vs a week ago because they see numbers climbing?   people mistrust the government enough already.  dont make it worse by hiding things.  don't sugarcoat it either.

In a matter of hours the needed info will become an essential bottom line priority and offered up. In addition, Trump has declared war on Covid-19 and made winning that war a reelection priority. Therefore, no need to worry about pesky laws because AG Barr and the Roberts Court will bless anything big tech or Trump does. Sarcasm intended."
2020-03-30 10:59,"Sharing of accurate, original-source data is critical for good decision making. Keeping data private greatly empowers the holder of the data to manipulate it for nefarious ends. A person like Trump would love to control all data so that he could manipulate public opinion and allow his family to profit. Much as sunlight is the best disinfectant, original source data is the best protection against demagoguery."
2020-03-30 10:51,"Deborah Birks, the chosen W.H. data expert, refused on Meet the Press yesterday to share estimates of the time frame for closures and distancing, saying she only reports to trump so therein lies the idiocy of what is going on in the U.S. The patchwork response around the county is costing lives and the impulse to secrecy displayed by too many is costing us our democracy."

2020-03-30 11:03,"The primary public health objective is to slow/stop the transmission, and location would be helpful to that end. I hold that it is possible to maintain confidentiality and patient privacy while providing some location information.
 A simple formula based on population density could give an approximate location--If a patient with a positive diagnosis is the only person in a 25-mile radius, for example, then the population density value would make the reported location larger than that of reporting an occurrence in a densely-populated area, which could be more exact. Anonymity in a crowd. I'm not a statistician but someone else could easily figure out a formula that allows the public to make decisions about where to go."
2020-03-30 11:04,"We all have the right to know if we're in danger, been in contact, worked with, etc an infected person. period. While China did try to hide this virus initially, they also did eventually take people's cellphones and trace where the patient had been. in South Korea, you received texts if your neighbor had tested positive. 
This is not the time to be secretive and elusive. 
I do hope they revisit and clarify outdated HIPAA restrictions."
2020-03-30 11:11,"""Frustration over the dearth of data also extends to epidemiologists trying to understand the dynamics of the spread of the virus.

Joseph Lewnard, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, says researchers are hamstrung in the United States by the lack of specific data on testing and on the symptoms patients show.""

I suppose there's always next time to get it right."

Those who are listening to Trump and trusting in him are
foolish.  And the media should simply state that Trump has
been untrustworthy and proven to be simply incapable of telling the truth.

I suggest listen only to those we can trust.  And my hope is that The New York Times will simply state that Trump is not
to be trusted."
2020-03-30 11:26,"There should be a waiver for HIPAA and release the data for those who test positive, and especially those who test with immunity (when serological testing is available) since the public health need outweighs privacy. It’s the simplest way to save lives."
2020-03-30 11:33,"It seems fairly obvious that our lack of testing facilities is at the root of minimal regional and localized data.  Once an infected person becomes a patient, HIPPA takes over, and we get only perhaps patient counts and death tolls.  

In less democratic societies, like S’pore, the PRC, and South Korea, data is more readily available, at a cost of privacy.  Would you want your health insurer to know you were infected?   Or your bank, where you were negotiating a mortgage?   

Since the first US case was at a nursing home in Seattle, I would like to know if they’ve been able to identify patient Zero, and how the virus found its way into the facility.   Clearly, somebody transported it there.  I don’t need to know who it was...but circumstances surrounding their travel might be nice."
2020-03-30 11:39,"This conundrum highlights one of the downsides of a nation that is so used to people having choice that any hint of restriction of that privilege, and it is a privilege, is seen as a denial of our rights. We HAVE to have rules and guidelines in order to preserve public order. But as with everything in America, we take things to an extreme, and we also often do not stop to look at the possible consequences before we act. That is Trump’s appeal to millions of Americans... he speaks first and considers later. As to the issue in this column, the amount of information and the manner it is delivered to the public is a delicate balance of truth vs. what the public will do with it. The first thought should be to not feed the panic machine button while at the same time not minimize the dangers we have to face and mitigate."
2020-03-30 11:13,"How plausible is it that privacy is winning over transparency in the US? This is the country that leads the world in allowing sale of the most private information. The US has repeatedly and expressly rejected privacy protections that European nations have legally protected. 

It is far more plausible that states and localities are keeping info private for political reasons — particularly to guard against politically embarrassing facts, or worse. It seems very likely that local coronavirus hotlines correspond to areas with higher population densities and with poorer health care — poorer neighborhoods. 

Everything — everything — to date about this pandemic's rampage across the US reflects the barbarian profiteering of violently greedy health industry companies. Why provide care when you can profit by offering something that you do not provide? For decades, with the rise of right-wing, neo-fascist Republicans, the gap between rich and poor has grown. Life expectancies have grown for the rich and flatlined for the middle class and poor. 

It is likely that the pandemic is highlighting gross inequality in the US. Politicians who have abetted those crimes of inequality do not want us reminded of that."
2020-03-30 11:14,"Amazing to read this piece and get a clear idea of where your subscriber data tells you your audience lives. Ohio has been nationally praised for its response by an otherwise largely awful Republican governor. Online and easily available daily press conferences would allow Times reporters to gather information on the state’s disclosure without actually having to be there physically in the diners they are normally obsessed to speaking to Trump die hates in, and the difference between state and local boards of health would be instructive to the story - Cuyahoga County with the most cases in the state has begun releasing data by ZIP code. 
But nope, New York, California, New Jersey and Connecticut, and Florida. Wonder how Chicago and Illinois or Michigan are doing in this “nationwide” debate. Or if Texas has even noticed it’s happening. Guess I won’t know unless I look elsewhere."
2020-03-30 11:28,"Information is power, and those with the information want to keep their power. And, it has never mattered if lives are at stake. We need more granular demographic information, where are the pockets? What are the ages of those being infected? How many recoveries are there? Where are they? Withholding information for the “public good” is a smoke screen for those who covet their power. Open the doors!"
2020-03-30 11:48,"Providing more specific information also might make many people less careful. If their town or neighborhood does not show up with infections, some might see that as a sign that they don't have to distance so much or at least not yet. We do not have anything near widespread testing, so many places which might appear not to have any spread may, indeed, have many with minor symptoms or no symptoms at all. 

We are confronting this struggle in my 5 high-rise apartment complex. As far as I know there are no infections (again, testing is scant all over), but some residents are getting more insistent on the online community demanding that management alert them to cases, if they come to light, and even where they are so that ""I can protect myself and my family."" My response to that is that they should simply take all the recommended steps to protect themselves even if they never hear about a case in their building. Period."
2020-03-30 11:33,"I would welcome pertinent data, especially hot spots.  It would enable folks to avoid these areas of infection - I know I would.  I have to work (essential worker) I would like to know where NOT TO GO.

I am older with underlying conditions - I need to stay away from these areas.

Hiding details that could enable people to make a conscious decision is just wrong. 

I see so much information on COVID-19.  I have pertinent questions that no one has published answers for.  The answers are THERE!  No one is willing to speak about it.

Here is one serious question I cannot find any response to:

COVID-19 can become AIRBORNE.  Coughs and sneezes can carry it a fair distance INDOORS!
SIX FEET?  Okay.

What about OUTDOORS where people want to go!

Why do I say this?  Based on incubation (7-14 days) and the usual routines of people, they GO OUTDOORS!  

Let me finish.  

How did so many people contract COVID-19 without being exposed to any confirmed cases?  SERIOUSLY?  OUTDOOR winds could carry COVID-19 considerably further from someone who is infected and sneezing or coughing.

The good doctors and scientists have had to conclude OUTDOOR PREVAILING WINDS can increase the SIX FOOT distance.  

I have not found OFFICIAL reports stating how long COVID-19 lasts OUTDOORS in NATURAL SUNLIGHT.

UV-C lamps.  These lights can destroy or disable most viruses – HOWEVER – MUST BE USED WITH CAUTION and CARE.  If you choose this light, read the directions carefully."
2020-03-30 11:36,The only way to win the virus is to intelligently share as much information as possible while protecting personal data and identity.
2020-03-30 11:36,"I still don't think we are getting real numbers.  And this allows there to be an ideological difference in response - which will hurt everyone.  Here is a table only based on previous data.  However, in this country, we have no idea what the % infection is/will be.

2020-03-30 11:41,Hippa should have been suspended for the corona virus and should be for any highly contagious disease.  Post there name and photo on the news and on web sited so we know who to avoid or if we should ourselves self quarantine due to interaction with someone contagious.  Privacy has to take a back seat to safety.
2020-03-30 11:42,"A month ago I wrote the CDC and suggested that a minimum we should have the Census Tract of every patient. Every address has genocides for nearly 2 decades.

It's a highly contagious disease, with no cure and no vaccine, and with a high lethality.

Had the names and census tract for every confirmed case been available we could have a chance to effectively contact trace and effectively socially distance.

We should release it now. The census tract information does not violate HIPPA and there is a specific public health emergency exception to allow the release of names.

Do it now to aide containment and mitigation."
2020-03-30 11:42,So the overlords of siphoning and selling OUR personal data on the daily are upset they can’t have all data all the time. Karma.
2020-03-30 11:35,"News outlets have reported that gatherings of more than 50 people were seen over the weekend, particularly in churches.

Maybe the names of those persons, where known, should be released to local authorities so that law enforcement can issue summonses.

Such persons are breaking the law. They are not entitled to the privacy afforded persons with known medical conditions."
2020-03-30 11:54,I don’t understand Americans. What kind of country do you want? Who on earth ARE you? Do you remember how this virus surged out of control? Because of censorship in China! And now you’re doing the same thing? That this is even a headline or a debate is horrifying.
2020-03-30 11:48,"We live in a NYC apartment building with 16 floors and 5 units per floor.  We have be told that one of our residents tested positive and has quarantined with 3 family members.  We have not been told where in our building the quarantine is taking place or what specifically the quarantine means with respect to how the family receives deliveries, disposes of trash, or otherwise interacts with outside environment.  In the face of this pandemic, I question whether that lack of information is a good idea.  Seems to me that such information would be very helpful to the building’s other residents so that we can adjust our behavior appropriately and have confidence that all appropriate actions continue to be taken.  For example, if the quarantine is taking place on the first floor (which may very well be the case, I’m told), residents might chose to avoid that floor and come and go through the basement entrance.  Are we to simply trust that all delivery persons and building staff are interacting with the quarantined family and space using best practices?"
2020-03-30 11:49,"The identity of an  individual who dies of Covid is less important to the general populace than knowing where he or she lived and worked. Knowing more is not a bad thing.

We live in a small town, about 12,000 people.  It’s big enough that one doesn’t know everybody, but small enough so that most of us are about  3 times removed from each other. It was much tighter when our kids were in the school system.

Most of us are doing the social distancing thing and getting groceries once every 2 weeks or so.  But if someone dies —of anything—chances are none of us are more than a couple people away from that person.  But because we may not know the deceased personally we don’t know the details—like they casually knew our next door neighbor. So it might be nice to know that this person passed due to Covid. 

It seems that Covid fatalities should be provided by zip code. There will be some places where deaths are more likely and forewarned is forearmed. And it makes sense without breaking the veil of privacy."
2020-03-30 11:53,"I can't see, feel, identifiably touch the killer in our midst. I can't plan, share, or act responsibly and safely without information. I can get a hundred opinions from every kind of self-appointed (and actual) expert contradicted by the next speaker at the podium. Give me the data to make my own choices - or what's the data for? (and who paid for it to be gathered?)
My state is recognized in the article as having broad and deep public information. It's sad that other states are not forthcoming - but also disheartening that our state legislature has been whittling on our Sunshine Law for three decades and made the law a shadow of its original self.

2020-03-30 12:09,"Aggregate data is used everywhere, all the time. If you think that allowing your Tile and/or Facebook and/or Google to see your location doesn't completely violate your privacy, you're dreaming. Public health depts, in this age, need to be completely transparent. The only way the importance of something like social distancing can be shown to certain people (conspiracy theorists, adolescents and MAGAts), is by showing them how many people in THEIR town, THEIR neighborhood, THEIR local hospital, have this disease. The MA DPH has been better than some in some respects, but persists in not identifying cases by town. I personally know of five cases in my small town, but this information isn't widely available. If you drive around MA, you'll see groups of people congregating, especially on the coast. Keeping this information from the public doesn't ""calm"" fears, and it doesn't protect those who are infected, it just perpetuates the myth that this is media-propagated hysteria. Same for the status of PPE for health-care providers....pretending there isn't a shortage doesn't help or protect anyone! Share this information widely, be completely transparent! What, exactly, is the downside? A better informed public?"
2020-03-30 12:28,"Working as a chaplain in a hospital I have found that people would rather get complete honesty from their health care providers. It's the not-knowing that causes the greatest anxiety.

2020-03-30 12:30,"The need for transparency is one of the major lessons from this pandemic. America is broken from leadership to every system. Withholding information combined with mishandling priorities in an effort to make America a superpower has literally altered the most important values of humanity. America's foundation needs to be rebuilt...with a balance of feminine and masculine energies to include humility in leadership, compassion, truth, love and a broad understanding of human needs. We need to stop operating like an oligarchy and be the country it was created to be...individual freedom, an intrinsic feeling from within so we find meaning in our work and have the power to pursue happiness through work and other means. A collective society and less selfishness."
2020-03-30 12:32,"Reminds me of the popular 2019 film, “The Farewell”. Many folks loved it. It was well acted. However, the premise of the doctors and family denying the cancer riddled matriarch the knowledge of her life expectancy was paternalistic and unethical.

Anyone, any group, any entity, and any government which suppresses information which suppression does not innure to the benefit of people, must be held accountable and dealt with in accordance with the laws of the land.

We know that from a public health standpoint testing is needed for tracking and decision making. Hospitals need to know where supplies are and will be needed. Governor Ducey has declared that hair and nail salons along with gun shops are essential services among others.  He refuses to declare shelter in place even though the people and municipalities are pressuring him to do so. People want the truth, not artificial numbers.  They want to know they can trust our representatives to make the best decisions for our communities. Right now we don’t."
2020-03-30 14:42,"Two weeks ago there were five confirmed cases in my county. It would have been useful to know if those five cases were on my block or five miles away in an exurb. Two weeks later, there are 172 detected cases in the county. Telling people that the virus is concentrated in one area might have been useful two weeks ago, but now might create a false sense of security -- if the virus has only been detected in the exurbs where I don't go, aren't I safe? Of course not. I might not venture beyond a five block radius, but someone who shops at the same grocery store as I do does travel beyond the neighborhood. The virus can be spread by people who aren't symptomatic. Wisconsin, like other states, have had limited tests to use, so have only been testing people who present severe symptoms, knowing that the virus would spread through mild cases that they could not spare a test to detect. Revealing more specific info on the location of detected cases could create a false security because they data doesn't reveal all the very many undetected cases that are out there and are causing the virus's spread. Specific info two or three weeks ago might have been useful, but at this point, it would probably do more harm than good. The virus is here. Per the emergency alert we received here Friday, if you go out, assume you've been exposed."
2020-03-30 15:05,"Public support for limiting information is tied to our ability to find reasonable insurance.  With Medicare for All that disappears.  My Honda Accord has better tracking on its ""health"" issues.  Wouldn't it be great to follow genetic lines so we could anticipate health needs?

Not sharing data, or sharing data that is incomplete or wrong, will kill people. I think being dead is a tad worse then being “stigmatized.” And as pointed out several times in this article, data can be anonymized (done all the time in research), with no names or street addresses provided. If we have cases in “College Hill, Providence,” that urges people to be safer and does not brand any individual. SO tired of bureaucratic missteps and misguided political correctness killing people!"
2020-03-30 14:46,"Why don't we have enough test kits? Because if you don't test, you don't get a positive result, and the number of cases stays low. I know people in Idaho, California, and Alabama who had symptoms (in one case true pneumonia and fever that required treatment) and who were told there were no test kits for them. I believe they all had COVID-19 but they will never be counted. Trump wants to keep case numbers and deaths attributed to this virus as low as possible, so he doesn't look as incompetent as he is. That's why we don't have enough test kits and that's why information is limited."

When you see that there are 4 in your zip code, you realize it’s here, too.

California sought to protect the identities of any sufferer of AIDs.  That privacy right has extended into all areas of life, however, it is a Constitutional Right as opposed to a statutory or a US Constitutional Right under the penumbra of multiple Amendments.  California's Constitutional right is exact, whereas the US Constitution infers medical privacy."
2020-03-30 14:53,"Remember this virus can be spread before people know they have it.  If you disclosed the identities of patients, people they had contact with would know to self-quarantine to reduce its transmission to others.

I'm willing to allow that if I get sick (and have told my condo's board.)  Aren't you?  It could literally save someone's life. 

Why not start collecting people's permission in advance to disclose this information, at least within multi-resident buildings?  This theoretical debate is just wasting time."

As an elderly male, I have little concern about being sexually offended. But a person with coronavirus could live next door to me, or across the street, and I would be deprived of knowing that unless somehow I was informally made aware of that person's condition. Something is wrong here. Privacy laws result in harboring persons who, admittedly unwillingly or not through their own fault, are serious hazards to everyone in their community. We should be made aware of their presence."

2020-03-30 15:36,"Here is a case where congress could help.  Having worked as a lawyer in healthcare, I know how stringent the requirements of HIPAA privacy (a federal law protecting individual medical info are).   The penalties for violation are significant.   It is a well intentioned law that makes sharing any data that could be tracked back to a sick person very risky.   Congress could suspend all or part of this law during this pandemic.     Having also been involved in the defense of a lot of lawsuits against healthsystems, I can tell you that plaintiff lawyers will have no compunctions about suing medical providers when the current crisis has subsided.    In fact, I think the next relief package should have legislation that limits medical malpractice suits for care rendered during this pandemic.   Otherwise the doctors and hospitals will have performed lifesaaving services at great financial cost only to be bankrupted by a waive of lawsuits concerning who got care and under what circumstances.    In hindsight, many of the decisions made on the current virus battlefield will be subject to a lot of second guessing by lawyers with much to gain."
2020-03-30 16:02,"Whether or not you know who in your neighborhood, community, or city has Covid19 or has tested positive should  make no difference whatsoever.  It shouldn't change what you do or how you live - stay in place, wash hands correctly and frequently, keep at least 6 feet from others except for who you live with.  Anyone can carry this virus and have no symptoms.  You cannot, at this time, just assume only those that test positive have it."

The whole country needs to assume that their neighbor could have it already, and could pass it on BEFORE it is testable!  It's much harder to encourage social distancing when everyone feels fine and they don't think the bug is here yet."

It is ironic that the U.S. is slow compared to other countries as our notion of ""privacy"" runs counter to the urgent needs of the public health community.

  * bypass privacy laws and publish epidemiology data, 
  * cease all flights from infected areas, 
  * control public gatherings and meeting places, 
  * provision hospitals with personal protection equipment, etc. 
The various measures can be introduced according to a rule-based assessment of the seriousness of the infection. This way we can learn and progress and avoid the current situation where we seem to have learnt almost nothing since the 1918 flu outbreak.

When I was a kid, if there was a contagious disease in the house, a notice was posted next to the door with big red letters warning of contagious disease. That was so others could stay away if they wanted, or if they approached, they knew what they faced. It was an attempt at control of contagion.

Medicine was different then, few vaccines, less effective medicines. What your doctor would normally keep to himself was announced to anyone who passed by the notice, because of the very danger of those conditions. Now we have an equal need, and a greater danger.

There is a danger of discrimination that is real. But as information spreads and the widespread nature of this disease is made known, then it will become evident that it can and does strike anyone anywhere, and discrimination against those who have it will be impracticable. With that in mind, the faster the information spreads, the greater it is in volume, the better."

Their older sisters should be here by next week. We’ve had chickens before so the coop & run are all set. They are wonderful pets,  but if you want delicious eggs they need to be protected, take work & need a place to run around."
2020-03-30 16:34,"We get chicks every spring, to keep our flock productive.  We stood in line for two hours and watched some breeds we had wanted sell out before it was our turn.

Established producers are probably better able to make efficient use of this now scarce resource. For those just getting into this, I hope it goes well for you and that your feed supply stays stable and you can get it when you need it."

I'm glad this story pointed out that it will take up to five or six months (this time can vary) until chicks start producing eggs and also that egg production declines after the first three years or so yet chickens can live quite a long time. I've kept and adored chickens for around 30 years and they are engaging, beautiful animals, but it's important for people to know what they're in for before making this commitment. Please--do your research first. 

A few other important considerations: On-going feed/predator-proof housing costs (there's no such thing as a free egg); rodent and odor problems--chickens are messy so you'll have to be vigilant about cleaning to keep these under control; time and work commitment--chickens require daily care and chicks especially require a lot of nurturing."

How sadly true.  Especially people who are novices at doing this  I used to watch a vet show on Natl. Geo. about a large animal vet in Michigan. The degree of neglect and cruelty displayed was sickening and this was from mostly farm people who grew up around animals most of their lives.   Getting Chicks and Pigs and Goats can be hard work and when folks get tired of the work they just take these animals a distance from home and drop them beside the road.  The Everglades didn't get full of pythons because of immigration but because when they the cute little snake got to big to handle they were dumped.  Here's hoping the same thing doesn't happen this this years favorite pet."
2020-03-30 15:37,"This is appalling. Most of these chickens will end up dying, as people with no idea of how to keep them will fail to do so. It's bad enough that thousands of chicks are bought for Easter and then abandoned or killed after the holiday when people realize they don't actually want to take care of them. Many people don't even realize that chicks are alive and need to be fed and cared for. This is a disgusting, cruel and inhumane practice. Shipping these live birds should be banned."
2020-03-30 16:04,"People buying chicks for the first should be wary of buying what is called “straight run” chicks.  This means that the sex of the chicks is unknown.  (Hatcheries have methods of determining the sex of many chicks while the average person selling on Craigslist does not.  And while you can buy sexed chicks you can also buy them straight run from hatcheries.)

 I have hatched my own chickens’ eggs in past years and gotten up to 80% roosters in a batch of a dozen or so. This is a big pain to take care of in a few months when they start crowing, unless you are willing to butcher your own."

People...please realize that even if you get chicks it will be months, five or six months, before they start producing eggs. These are living creatures who need more attention than you are probably willing to give them. Leave it to the people who know what they are doing and buy eggs from them.

But a question (and not at all saying those living paycheck to paycheck aren't worse.)  There are those of us who have retired, or have a major change in status, with a bigger income last year and a much smaller one this year.

What would it have cost to have just sent a check to everyone, no matter your status?  The hot air that was spouted early on about not giving the rich any money was pure rhetoric, and there will be some who were caught in this middle ground.  

How many extra $1200 checks would have been sent if everyone were sent a helpful amount?  Would perhaps a few million have gotten paid out (a drop in the bucket) to have tried to accommodate those with a need, but what looked like a rosy past?"

Denmark is a great example. Although 2 trillion dollars sounds like a lot, it will only help for a brief period for most people and especially small businesses. I co-founded and then owned a quite successful small business in Manhattan; it is flourishing 30 years on, although I don't know what they are doing now, since I am no longer associated with it. My point is, I know how little $1200 will be to them."
2020-03-28 15:58,"Where does the money paid to landlords go?  This has been a question I had for a long time in the small town I live in.  For years businesses have struggled and the reason is that the rents are too high.  And I've always wondered who was setting those rents so high and where that money was going.  Understandably some of it is used on maintenance, salaries and loan payments.  But how much keeps trickling up up up and then sits accumulating in some billionaires' bank account?  This is now the question I have about rents across the nation - maybe right now we need to focus on rent payments that actually go towards things like repairs and staff salaries, and sacrifice the upwards trickle to benefit the 1%.  Sadly, I don't think this will happen.  In fact, I expect the opposite to happen and any money that is squeezed out of people will just be funneled into the bank accounts of the rich where it will sit and give them a sense of security while the rest of the world burns around them.  How much happiness can their money buy them in such a world and for how long?  What a pathetic condition this country has been reduced to."

All people should have been given a large monthly payment  for the duration of the virus - starting immediately. Instead the corporations have been bailed out again in full with this Bill with only a few crumbs given to workers so as to get this Bill to pass. The stock markets have been happy the last few days knowing that they have successfully pulled off their heist. Pelosi turned over the House to the Senate to negotiate between Schumer and McConnell who both represent corporations - so that is how the Bill turned out - bailing out corporations now while giving crumbs to the people at some future date

The $500 billion for corporations is really just to absorb the losses from an $4.2 to 6 trillion bailout to them. Now corporations can buy out small business at fire sale prices with the FED’s money, just like in 2008 the banks took over 5 million peoples houses."

Any person working for a check to check living or small business owner is not going to care too much if the airlines and cruise ships have to struggle along with everyone else. When this virus finally fades away will the American psyche fade with it - I don't think so. It is going to be a long time before we have to lament being herded like cattle onto airline transportation to walk the gang plank on to a cruise ship again. Possibly never. 

Get real American leadership!  The problem you're dealing with now has been festering for years in plain sight and now that it has ruptured onto the surface it can't be wiped away with nonsense and platitudes. Try some soul searching and honesty. You might be surprised."

2020-03-28 17:12,"The problem with ""Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, [calling] for moratoriums on rent"" is that she mixes apples and oranges, myopic ideology trumping [sic!] reality. There is a world of difference between a company or individual who owns hundreds of units and a retired couple who rent out the other half of their duplex, with many gradations in between. If there is no rent payment made to the latter, perhaps they can't buy their meds or groceries. Perhaps they can't pay the Wi-Fi  bill for both units.

Simplistic, bumpersticker solutions are attractive, especially for people who don't want to think or deal with complexity in general. We have enough of that coming from the ""build a wall"", ""it's a Democratic hoax"" White House. If we are actually going to solve problems, the rest of us have to better than that."

2020-03-28 16:42,"While well intended, the trillion dollar bailout will not be effective in stemming the recession that’s in full swing now. Families can not afford to wait 3 weeks for a check that will barely be able to pay rent in most parts of the country. For a reference, the median monthly rent in the USA for December 2019 was $1,343 (1). The stimulus may help people through the month of April but it will be very difficult to afford housing when unemployment continues to rise. 

In addition, we are projected to have a hot summer coming our way in the U.S. (2). Will people have enough money to afford cooling in their home? Will there be more people out and about due to a heat wave? No matter how you look at it, we will all be in for a rough couple of months. Our government needs to address the economic impact of this virus outside the norm of traditional bailouts. A one time payment of $1200 is a bandaid to addressing the problem that people don’t want to go out and spend on services when they are afraid of losing their job. As you read articles on the NYT, you will see that a lot of businesses affected are from the service industry. There needs to be relief for people when it comes to essentials like housing, energy, and food. As a nation, let’s work together to solve these issues and help those impacted by this virus.

And the answer is, there’s a bunch of stuff in there — and, you know, there are people on Wall Street chattering about how it’s actually going to be $10 trillion, because, you know, what’s another four?

2020-03-28 17:27,"When are the banks going to announce they are suspending all credit card payments, interest & fees? Also, everyone should cancel their Spectrum accounts & find a cheaper provider or find another alternative to cable until they lower their rates. They are a rip off, especially in NYC."
2020-03-28 17:28,"My small live events / meetings business (single owner S-corp) income has evaporated overnight... including cancellations where I have to pay back clients out of my zero cash flow.  I don't qualify for the cash payments (made too much last year, but will have a loss this year); cannot get unemployment since I'm a sole-owner S-corp; won't be able to get any forgivable loans because I don't have any employees... so the only ""help"" I can qualify for is  a 4% SBA business loan.  Why would I take on more debt now when I don't event know if I'll have any clients for the rest of the year?  There are a lot of people in situations like mine... small businesses that are receiving no help and will go under."
2020-03-28 17:29,"If Trump had acted like a leader we could have had a strong head start on this virus. Death, Anguish, Heart Break, Economic Chaos, all would have mitigated much more than they have been. 

Trump failed miserably and is still failing. If the Pentagon could, they would relieve the Commander and Chief from duty and court marshal him for gross negligence of his duty and command. He would be lucky to avoid prison in view of the mounting deaths and disruption his inaction and denial of the crises created. 

Throughout January, February and until March 11th, Trump dismissed the virus as being ""under control"". His quotes regarding the virus were very immature and self glorifying.

Elsewhere in the world, the high degree of contagion in the virus was evident to all. Trump ignored this, insisting that he had it totally ""under control"". This went on for 7 weeks when we desperately needed to be preparing and gathering equipment needed to address the emergency.

We have never witnessed a leader so ill equipped to lead. Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to The United States and the world beyond."
2020-03-28 17:30,"It is very difficult to even think this will end.  Maybe this will help a tiny bit.  It was 1936.  In a little mining town in the Southwest (single employer town), a family of 8 lost the home the father had built .  The oldest had to quit college, the youngest was 3.  The following year the 19 year-old daughter was killed in an auto accident caused by a drunk driver in the other car.  The wake was at home, the grave was without a headstone.  Food scarcity was everywhere.  Most houses were lighted by coal-oil lamps.  It was only WW2 , and the programs enacted by FDR that finally began the recovery. 1941.  Five years.    We survived.  Some did not.  I hope you and your families will.  Try not to despair."
2020-03-28 17:30,"It depends ...

""Where does the money paid to landlords go?""

Some landlords indeed are coupon-clipping billionaires, but most are not. They also are paying large bills -- mortgages, utilities, maintenance, etc. Many rental units are owned by people just like the people they rent to."
2020-03-28 17:45,"It's going to be very difficult for most of the American people to pay bills with this stimulus check.

39% of Americans cannot afford to pay a cobined $400 a monthly payment towards anything.

I wonder how many besides these 39% are living above their means due to FOMO, Keeping up with the Joneses, etc?

On the flip side, nature and the Earth is happy that humans are in their homes. A puny virus took out the mighty human. A warning sign for things to come that our short existence most likely will not have much of an existence and the Earth will continue to do its business."
2020-03-28 17:54,"In my opinion, the responsibility for this devastating outbreak lies with China’s leaders, who permitted unsanitary and horrific wildlife markets to continue even in the face of predictions that an outbreak such as this would happen again after SARS.

I would love to send the bill for our trillion-dollar government bailout to Beijing. In the meantime, I imagine their economy will overall hurt from our recession. Maybe only then will China’s leaders understand that their lack of regulation over these markets ultimately affects everyone’s health and financial well-being as currently demonstrated. If we aren’t employed because we’re sick, quarantined or our employer has shut its doors, we can’t buy clothes, shoes, toys, household goods and widgets made overseas either in China or elsewhere."
2020-03-28 18:00,Well…It looks like the corporate class has won again. I see this as an opportunity for big business to devour up small to medium struggling enterprises who will most likely never recover from this calamity. This biologically inspired downturn may affect our economic structure for at least a generation.
2020-03-28 18:03,"What is going to happen to people with employer paid health insurance?  Those who have been fired/laid off are no longer eligible for their employer paid health insurance as of, typically, the end of the month that they were let go.  They may then become eligible for COBRA coverage but this is significantly more expensive, since the person has to pay the full cost + an administrative fee."
2020-03-28 18:04,"The stimulus bill is classic disaster capitalism (Naomi Klein). 

There are crumbs tossed to vast numbers of struggling Americans facing disaster and a huge pay day for corporations. 

Of course there should have been two bills. The first and most critical to protect the health and financial stability of our citizens. That should have been done immediately and with far more support and for much longer than is currently stipulated. 

And then a critical debate about if and how much corporate welfare ought to be doled out. 

But instead many, many Americans will suffer as corporate giants line their pockets. This transfer of wealth puts wealth inequality on steroids with a downside that will last for years. 

Outrageous."
2020-03-28 18:28,"The situation appears worse.  The pandemic Trump due to inaction and ""chaos"" on purpose are delaying the checks being mailed for up to 100 days.  In normal times, I'd be content to call the delay red-tape (how appropriate) but this delay becomes part of the national death sentence in progress.

I can't ask the fed. gov't to review the exponential explosion to see the number of deaths and positive covid-19 people who may not be around to get the pittance while bailouts for corporations (like Boeing ... JHC) and Trump telling us he's going to steal money from the package makes this all the more fruitless.  I do see the atrocious-happy murdering crime family at play with American workers."
2020-03-28 18:30,"I want to ask a question to all readers of NY Times. Many of us - and I am one of them - would receive a check from the government, and to be honest with you, I feel uncomfortable to receive it. I still have a job so far, but many are without jobs, struggling with their rents, mortgage payments, unpaid medical expenses. 

Is there a way I could personally refuse to accept such a check, or alternatively, direct the check to any organization supporting these needles? Any thoughts?"
2020-03-28 18:42,"It is becoming obvious that in the case of Covid-19, the cure will turn out to be worse than the disease."
2020-03-28 18:45,"The problem with ""Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, [calling] for moratoriums on rent"" is that she mixes apples and oranges, myopic ideology trumping [sic!] reality. There is a world of difference between a company or individual who owns hundreds of units and a retired couple who rent out the other half of their duplex, with many gradations inbetween. If there is no rent payment made to the latter, perhaps they can't buy their meds or groceries. Perhaps they can't pay the Wi-Fi  bill for both units.

Simplistic, bumpersticker solutions are attractive, especially for people who don't want to think or deal with complexity in general. We have enough of that coming from the ""build a wall"", ""it's a Democratic hoax"" White House. If we are actually going to solve problems, the rest of us have to better than that."
2020-03-28 18:52,"All rent, mortgages, taxes, credit card payments, loan payments...all payments that are not for food or medicine should be suspended indefinitely.

I know, I know, some of you will scream about the economy.  Well I can scream right back at you that people matter more than money.

This is not the time to confuse what's real with what's not.  Money is a made-up thing.  People's lives are real."
2020-03-28 19:17,"This is  going to be a learning exercise in planning for a bio pandemic.  Practically no one creates even a ""Plan A"" if, for example, everyone stops paying rent, and the government orders a ""no evictions"" order.  So, what do landlords do?  They stop paying on their bank loans, duh.  

So what do banks do?  It doesn't take a genius to figure that they do same thing as in the financial crisis of 2008....they foreclose.  But by the time the foreclosures go to court, hopefully, the pandemic will be over....

And if the pandemic isn't over, guess what....EVERYONE loses....like in the black plague or the ""Spanish flu"" or  a nuclear war....."
2020-03-28 19:36,"I have been fortunate to have a steady income, with some to spare. Where will my dollars be best used? I want to help however I can, even if it’s modest."
2020-03-28 19:56,"For over 50% of Americans, triaging the bills was a daily activity before CoVid-19 and the associated unemployment, or risk of unemployment.  With no social safety nets, community support of family resources, many Americans are feeling cast aside to die.  Wouldn’t surprise me of CoVid-19 emerged as a catalyst for a successful 3rd party bid by Bernie Sanders."
2020-03-28 19:16,"Courts should copy Florida's foreclosure courts to save debtors.  They should blatantly favor debtors the way Florida's courts blatantly favored banks.

I saw it myself when I handled a deceased relative's case.  The court there routinely denied motions for continuance in case after case while I waited for my case to be called.  When I caught the bank's lawyer unprepared and unable to respond to my arguments, the court issued a continuance sua sponte (on its own without a request from the bank's lawyer).  When I objected, Her Honor glared at me and made it clear I should say nothing more.

Florida courts routinely failed to punish bank lawyers who submitted fraudulent documents, such as robo-signed affidavits.  They failed to punish bank lawyers and witnesses who perjured themselves.

When challenged, the Florida Supreme Court made it clear they cared only about bank solvency, not justice or the rule of law.  

Fine.

Let courts elsewhere do the same, but in favor of debtors.  Make creditors redeposit seized funds until final closure of the case.  Don't worry about the language of the contract, just as Florida courts did not in foreclosure cases.  Let debtors perjure themselves with impunity.  Let them submit forged and fraudulent documents willy-nilly.  

Then let the banks whine and whine and whine while the courts care only about debtor solvency, not justice or the rule of law.

What's wrong with equal justice under law?"
2020-03-28 17:43,"Hmmm a $2 trillion relief package...
Why not give each person in the USA ( man woman and child) 
$1 million?
That would be ~ $340 million with plenty left over from the $2 trillion relief package for other needs/uses etc
Imagine an economy with everyone having $1 million...BOOM!"
2020-03-28 18:36,"I never thought I would be this happy to be a divorced male with no children living alone in a studio apartment with a small cash savings. Two months ago I was what America would consider a loser, now I look like some sort of genius."
2020-03-28 18:30,"This horrible situation should make it clear, even for the previously affluent who pushed Biden through, the necessity of nominating Bernie ASAP."
2020-03-28 17:28,"I blame the short sighted knee jerk reaction to the COVID-19 more so on the local and state level  that has caused businesses and personal finances to be hit hard. Those whose wishful thinking is that there is going to be a recession or that there will be a justification for Trump to lose his reelection bid, keep dreaming. America is a country of dreamers and the US derailed by COVID-19 response will be back on track again. The tough will get going and those who lacked resilience and nerves of steel will have hard times. Those who did panic selling at a loss, bear the loss. You have no one else to blame but your own decisions.

Governors including our own, who made draconian calls that destroyed businesses especially the dine in restaurant businesses should appropriately compensate those who got hit hard because they were forced to be compliant with the shut down. Politicians cannot eat the cake and have it too. You live by fear you die by fear. Have no shame for ignoring one of the most consequential president of the 20th century, FDR? There is nothing to fear but fear itself. When politicians don't use sound logic or  judgement and just try to please the media and their political base, the end result is what? ?The patient is dead not because of the virus, but the operation was successful for political browning points. Well after this pandemic has left our entire planet and the next arrives within 5 years, we will assess the response that killed jobs and damaged the economy."
2020-03-28 17:35,"Liberals in coastal expensive states! There's lots of cheap housing in the flyover states. If you are going to hunker down with no job, it'll be much cheaper in Trump's heartland than in the don't-tread-on-me state. Last date to register to vote in the general election is generally 1-oct."
2020-03-28 17:31,"Two trillion dollar stimulus and yet many people won't qualify for even one penny of that, let that sink in, 2 Trillion dollars of future money that has to be payed back and many people don't even get a lousy 1,200 bucks, only in America."
2020-03-28 18:37,"I'm a long-term self-employed white collar (not gig) worker. With my income in the last three weeks down 80-90%. I called our mortgage servicer (SLS) today to ask about options if I couldn't pay in April or May. The rep instantly offered a ""90-day grace period"" on payments.

I asked, ""what happens on the 91st day?"". ""Well, sir,"" he said, ""all the payments you missed are going to be due right then, along with your regular monthly payment.""

If I have next to no income for the next 90 days, a giant pot of money is not going to magically appear on my doorstep to pay for four months of mortgage payments all at once. And I'm sure I'm not alone in worrying about that."
2020-03-28 17:51,"While a lot of people will suffer because of this pandemic, I feel particularly sorry for people in the medical profession.

I take this opportunity to thank all those doctors, nurses, and other wonderful people who are saving lives while contracting the disease themselves.

I would do this in person but am not allowed to go near them!."
2020-03-28 18:06,"It’s easy to ask from the armchair, why didn’t people save while they had the chance or why didn’t they do this or do that. We actually don’t teach this stuff in school and many people didn’t have the parents to model it. Give. people. some. grace.

I was caught in a financial crisis a few years ago, was very scared and couldn’t make my financial obligations. I knew things needed to change. I eventually recovered after two years of scratching and clawing my way out. I set many things in place. I do a monthly budget every month, I got out of debt except for the mortgage, live on less than I make, and established an emergency savings. BUT it took a crisis for me to finally wake up.

This sucks. It’s hard. You will get through this and you will be stronger. But,  it’s going to take some time."
2020-03-28 18:39,"Why don't we have debt forgiveness for the months that we are all sidelined by coronavirus?  We should forgive rent and mortgage, student and car loan payments without expectation of repayment -- just simply forgive those months altogether. For those who are unemployed, add no utility payments (within normal usage). I'm sure there are more examples, but instead of giving $500 billion to banks and corporations for discretionary use, give that money to help citizens, ie, loan forgiveness for everyone unemployed or earning less than the same amount of income used to determine the stimulus checks."
2020-03-28 18:21,We are one of the many trying to figure out how to pay our mortgage on April 1st. We have -or had? - a successful art business that the rug has been pulled out from under. We don't qualify for many of the small business programs as self-employed artists so we're scrambling to say the least. We called our mortgage company to discuss the forbearance relief mentioned on their site only to be told that the 3 payments would be due in full at the end of 90 days - almost $9000. Not helpful and now super stressed.
2020-03-28 20:17,"not to offend or blame anyone, but i do wonder if this experience will permanently change the spending, saving, and working habits of the AVERAGE American?

People make choices and as we see now, when a problem arises, many of those who may have made questionable choices scream for a bailout or handout

other than the absolute poorest of the poor, most have some amount of disposable income and free time.

i can name over two dozen people with degrees who ""prefer"" to drive for Uber or GrubHub instead of working a regular job.

every last one is now on social media demanding that other people pay their bills or void contacts/debt that they eagerly took on.

we have people who chose to be stay at home spouses and or parents now demanding that others pay their bills for them.

every one who works a forty hour week but lived paycheck to paycheck needs to reevaluate their choice to NOT take on a part-time job to improve their own financial situation. 

to set aside money and let it get dusty for just such emergencies.

The grasshopper and the ant parable has come to life on a global scale....which will you become once this pandemic burns out?"
2020-03-28 20:25,The best answer is 3 months forgiveness for those who don't pay and three months free rent/mortgage/lease in 2021 for those who do pay now.
2020-03-28 20:27,"Here in the contractor realm (I work with federal agencies to improve infrastructure and restore land) we've got around four weeks before our industry collapses. Seems to me the GOP wont accept the scale of the problem and simply don't care about the working class. The dems have no power to freeze debt or extend a payroll lifeline to small businesses. Where the heck is Biden btw? Its like he's in a cave somewhere, great time for a complete lack of leadership. With leaders like this, I'm glad I've got a good local community. This is definitely on the scale of the Great Depression, whether our politicians accept that or do anything to fix it."
2020-03-28 20:28,One thing that has become clear is that many businesses - mostly small but some midsize ones - clearly have not been running with appropriate margins.  They literally don’t have the cash to fund a month of operations.  I saw in some states the restaurants wanted the state to allow them not to make their monthly sales tax payments - taxes they already had collected from customers!  They’ve been using the lag from collections to payments of sales taxes to fund their business!!!
2020-03-28 20:29,"The US government doesn't care about the people. 
Government Of the Rich, By the Rich and for the Rich.

2020-03-28 20:04,It feel like some sort of denial of service attack trying to get through to unemployment.
2020-03-28 20:37,"Some people and companies will be unable to pay their bills, others will have the wherewithal but will be unwilling to pay. Persons or companies able to pay their bills should pay up, it is their civic duty in a national emergency.

Denmark’s Idea Could Help the World Avoid a Great Depression

2020-03-28 20:57,"It is late in the process, but it is time to look closely at the effects that a medical ""shelter in place"" has on the economy. It is not a left v right issue because the problem will affect everyone. This has never happened with such suddenness. 3 million out of jobs last week. It could become catastrophic. What is needed besides a National Medical Emergency is a simultaneous National Economic Emergency.  That will allow the most severe consequences to be avoided.

The goal would be to shut everything down simultaneously and start back up when medically possible in a controlled manner to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. In the meantime to avoid financial disaster, only essential activities continue (food, utilities, Internet, phone, health care, basic municipal and state services, etc.) on a cost only basis. 

Emergency support for free basic community health care clinics. Public support for critical health care when needed. National support for tertiary health care. Support for adequate staffing and supplies for all health care needs not otherwise covered by insurance. 

All interest and principle payments cease. Wall Street closes. Banks are financially supported by the government with all salaries and benefits  capped. Level to be determined. Basic income guaranteed. When National Economic Emergency is declared and verified to be safely over, all employees must return to prior work status as soon as asked unless deemed unsafe at which point their benefits end."

It is amazing how quickly they changed their messaging from ""we are the best in the world"" to: we are now the epicenter in the US (and now the world).  Vote this parasite out in 2022!

If the banks foreclose on properties there will be a glut of houses on the market. We had this during the last housing crash. 

The MAGA dream of a citizen owning a home will be over. The only folks who will be able to own real estate will be corporations."
2020-03-28 21:58,"None of this should be surprising to anyone who was paying attention back in January as China shutdown their economy to stem the spread. The fact we as a nation did nothing for two months was insanity defined, I don’t think Trump and his C and D team players were even capable of planning a wedding let alone a pandemic response. This is not going to end well for America."

2020-03-28 22:08,Here's some insight into the mortgage industry. This morning I got an email from my mortgage company apologizing for the long delays people are experiencing when they call. Folks are jamming the phone lines to say they won't be able to pay their mortgage next month and stressing about what to do.
2020-03-28 22:13,Did you read the stimulus package before writing this? The stimulus package for small business will allow for all costs to essentially be paid by government. Smart business will keep employees on salary during quarantine. Rent will be covered too for these business.
2020-03-28 22:14,"Most mortgage lenders (not all) are waiving payments and penalties for April, May and June. But that will just postpone the inevitable. Come July, borrowers must pay a much larger amount, consisting of three months' payments PLUS accrued interest at the loan rate."
2020-03-28 22:16,Consumers in need should do what banks do. Phone the Federal Reserve and tell them to buy their hypothecation paper. Promissory notes that are arranged through bank originators and that include participation in an industry bonus program are particularly attractive to the central bank as its officers and staff are very familiar with these industry reward structures and with the use of income from these bonus streams to offset the debt service of personal financial obligations.
2020-03-28 22:16,"“...governments of all sizes have proposed some measure of relief...”

What a cosmic joke. The “relief” is ordering businesses comprised of humans to offer relief to other human who owe them money. I have yet to see a single public agency lay off a single employee. This self-imposed recession doesn’t seem to extend to the ones who actually imposed it. Which is why I had my business diversify into the public sector after the lessons learned of 2008, when the only major housing market to escape the crisis was Washington DC and environs. We’re doing not-so-surprisingly well."
2020-03-28 21:31,"New lows especially for balance sheet rich companies!  My Fiancé told her Fortune 10 employer she was pregnant 2 weeks ago.  Thursday she was ""let go"".  Way to go America!"
2020-03-28 23:08,Our profoundly immoral Trump and his corrupt  leaders all love to see  this happen.  They will buy up the properties that these people are evicted from and sell it for 100 percent more. In Seattle when Amazon moved in and the rents skyrocketed and so did the homeless it took a Democratic state government to be elected to to put rent caps on apartments and mortgages.  Until this happens to more of Trump supporters they will keep supporting the corrupt business man. That is why i am a Democrat to help people afford affordable housing and health care.
2020-03-28 22:46,"I am amazed. The economic consequences of the virus have thus far affected Americans for 5 weeks, tops. And yet I’m reading about the self-described “successful” businesses that can’t make an April 1 mortgage payment. If you’ve got less than 90 days of cash reserves, you are in no way, shape or form a successful business. I have six months, but, then again, I’m one of those evil conservatives."
2020-03-29 0:05,"It's good that there's some of the $2 trillion in Federal relief directed at helping individuals.

I'm still disappointed that the only relief for medical expenses is that the $50 test for the coronavirus is free.

We have 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid, leaving millions of people out of any affordable health insurance.  They are eligible, under the Federal EMTALA law, for treatment to the point of stabilization at the ER, covid-related or not.  They are legally responsible for the bills for that stabilizing treatment, so they get a likelihood of medical bankruptcy and the joy of a life with a bad credit rating.

The ACA itself, for people covered, has many unaffordability issues.  There are problems in the ACA called the ""subsidy cliff"", as well as the ""family glitch"", bringing premiums plus copays up to over 30% of income for some people.

Further, as people's incomes vary up and down over the year, many states are inadept at handling this, and flail people back and forth mid-year between the ACA's expanded Medicaid and on-exchange plans, with even coverage gaps in the transition.  (This happened to me several times last year in Massachusetts.)

As well, much of the ACA ""coverage"" isn't even insurance.  In many states, including ""blue states"" such as New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Maryland, all medical bills paid out by ACA's expanded Medicaid are subject to Medicaid estate recovery for people 55 over.  The people have a loan until death -- not insurance."

2020-03-29 2:02,"How do you identify where you want money to go and, more importantly, how do you get it there and keep it moving? The idea of paying out this mega-money is to grease things, not for people to sit on it. 

Even getting the money to some people will be very difficult, as well as risking serious unintended consequences. How do you get the money to homeless people? And, with no bank account, how will they turn a Fed I.O.U. into cash, and once they have cash, what will they do with it? And what of people who have a home, but no bank account?

I would ask readers two questions: if you were in that position, what should you do? Much more relevantly, if you were in that position, what would you likely do?

The problem with ""Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, [calling] for moratoriums on rent"" is that she mixes apples and oranges, myopic ideology trumping [sic!] reality. There is a huge difference between a company who owns hundreds of units and a retired couple who rent out the other half of their duplex, with many gradations in between.

2020-03-29 5:37,"Thank goodness the cruise ship industry is being bailed out!

Whatever would we do without those kind souls?"
2020-03-29 11:02,"One thing we know is that major retailers and restaurants will have no difficulty at all in deciding not to pay April rent, no moral qualms at all.  They are not like us.

This will send ripples throughout the economy and up the chain to the 1% who will get their bailout from Trump, piling up 2 trillion in debt of top of the 2 trillion Trump had already piled up in tax breaks to the 1%.  Debt for which we will pay for years to come.  So in the end it's us working stiffs who always pay, whether we pay April rent or not, we still pay in the end."
2020-03-29 12:05,Restaurants are not economical to begin with.   Only way they stay in business is artificially cheap labor.   90% of them go bust in good times and the winners are the landlords.   Maybe this will finally put rest to the big lie as 99% go down.
2020-03-29 12:41,"I am flabbergasted by the number of middle to upper class people in their 40s and 50s that my wife and I know,  who have in recent years confided to us that they have little or no savings,  let alone a rainy day fund.   We live in an apartment complex where monthly rents average over $2000, and just among our 5-6 neighbors, all in their 40s or older and all but one still employed, only one or two will be able to pay their April rent on time.   Part of the national conversation here coming out of the pandemic must be how we as a country so many so badly managed our fiscal households,  to the point where we barely have enough in reserve to cover more than a month or two of household expenses after we lose jobs.   I'm sanguine that this is fact of life for millions of the poor,  which must be a part of this discussion.   And I get how this is common among young people just starting out.   But in the middle class let alone the wealthier still, by the time we reach middle age, how can we possibly justify having little or  no funds to tide us over for more than a month or two? This is something we can't blame the government for, other than its egregious decades long refusal to hold the financial services industries to account for their anyone with a heartbeat can borrow money lending practices."
2020-03-29 12:53,"The single largest expense weighing down many households, and a ball and chain on the economy,  is student debt.  Why not forgive all student debt permanently and create a special exception so that the forgiveness is not counted as income by the IRS."
2020-03-29 13:20,"How about the federal
Government give every American $1,000,000.00 to get through this ,
Instead of a measly $1200.00. That’s only $350,000,000.00, an number the government can handle, ( if they can handle a 2 trillion  relief package which will not help the individual as much as it will corporations)  Makes sense instead of the  $1200.00 that will last maybe a week ."
2020-03-29 13:30,I think it would be reasonable to ask landlords to forgive payments over and above their taxes.   But their idea of forbearance being 90 days to pay all rent in full?  That is no forbearance at all.  It is so sad to read about the Boston artists below who will lose their business.
2020-03-29 13:49,"I know a few people who filed for and were approved for bankruptcy due to this situation. What is really sad is that the trustees for both folks (who are in different states) are also not putting a forbearance on the garnishment of these people's wages.

It is bad enough from what they tell me to be in chapter 13 in the best of times from what I can tell."
2020-03-29 14:09,"I am considered high risk for the coronavirus & recently used a credit card to pay for my last trip to the grocery store for the foreseeable future. It was the most expeditious way to escape the crowd (the alternative being to wait for assistance from a harried store employee), & also the most courteous to the mass of people waiting behind me (also anxious to be on their way). My credit rating went down 8 points because of this 1 transaction. People need to be protected from credit reporting agencies that are evidentally oblivious to the current situation. As for student loans, good luck with that. The .gov website seems to be on permanent overload, so unless any adjustments to you acct./s are automatic, you may just be out of luck."
2020-03-28 22:38,"Timeline:

Thursday 3/26 Task Force @6pm:Trump brays he will talk to Xi later Thurs night.

Thurs 3/26: Trump brays on Hannity that we don't need no 40,000 vents. All fake.

Thurs 3/26: Trump has call with Xi late PM.

Fri 3/27 Trump begins hysterical demands to GM and others to make vents NOW!!!! Desperate tweets over the whole day.

I think Xi told him: ""We had many many more deaths in China than we said....tens of thousands. If you -Trump- don't lift teh remaining tariffs immediately, we will make sure US knows as of today, 3/27, you knew of this danger. Many will die in US. You will never get re-elected. We will let you save face by taking tariffs off no later than Sunday, you can make a show of it, or we spill it that we told you of this danger coming to Americans.

I saw article earlier this week about thousands of urns in Wuhan to be picked up by relatives after cremation...seemingly a lot more than what we've been told.

This is what I think. Would some reporter please ask Trump why he suddenly changed his mind about vents AFTER he spoke to XI on Thursday night, after Trump was on Hannity's show???

PLEASE!!!! We need to know."
2020-03-30 11:05,Thank you for a nuanced and fascinating look at the internal politics in China in the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The medical professionals on the frontline did everything right except defer reporting power to the local bureaucrats who silenced them in the name of petty politics. The virus does not care for anyone’s politics and is making that point across the world.
2020-03-30 10:51,"So Trump was right, in this aspect. In addition to this delay and hiding of data, the Chinese government has also not banned the trade in exotic animals that the population usually consumes. This should have been banned since 2002."
2020-03-30 11:23,"NY Times starts a good discussion on this topic based on facts. In the beginning, I had the same thought that these mistakes caused a disaster for Chinese people, and now the world.
But after seeing how other countries deal with it, I had some different ideas:
1) It takes some days to confirm the model is exponentially growing. At least it took Trump and Johnson several weeks to take more serious measures even if the virus is already known.
2) When tackling such an unknown situation, it is hard to see the real danger lies in the exhaustion of medical resources in the beginning, since this virus is less dangerous than SARS for an individual.
The real mistake is that the wildlife trade should have been banned, many years ago!"
2020-03-30 11:22,What is the use of a government putting into place 'smart' reporting when the culture says otherwise. Culture is what wires human beings to act most efficiently. I do not blame the doctors and healthy officials for their caution. Proof of their need for caution is that a prominent person disappeared shortly after he voiced criticism of how the problem was handled. A doctor who was at the forefront of informing his colleagues was taking in by police for questioning and probably tortured. China needs to recognize that if you repress your citizens you lend them incapable of acting 'smart' despite of millions spent in sophisticated mechanisms.
2020-03-30 11:02,"The Chinese planned extensively for an epidemic and created an effective system subverted by the fear of ""upsetting"" Beijing.  The US didn't plan.  It chronically underfunded its health care system and allowed whatever system it had in place to atrophy.  In Beijing, the leadership probably--probably--lied about the numbers affected.  In the United States, the leadership has consistently lied, and continues to lie, with President Trump first telling citizens to ignore warnings, in order to buoy the stock market.  And then the President has lied about the availability of tests, the timetable for a vaccine, and, most recently, the extent of testing.  The takeaway?  China should be roundly condemned for its lack of transparency."
2020-03-30 11:24,"The unacknowledged elephant in the room is the inherent drawbacks to the iron fisted, centralized control exerted by Chinese Communist Party leaders in Beijing. The Hubei provincial officials and medical hierarchy weren’t stupid. They had learned how bad news sent to Beijing could swiftly lead to demotion, imprisonment or execution. Their hedging and obfuscation - it is horrifying to now reread news reporting from the first two weeks in January, during which Beijing assured the world this new virus was nothing to worry about - was, as we can see, a worldwide catastrophe. But that minimization was sensible within China’s tyrannical governance model cemented by Xi. This disaster should be Exhibit A for why transparent democracy may be chaotic and inefficient, but in the long run it can be vastly superior to totalitarian regimes like China’s."
2020-03-30 11:10,The WHO also failed to address the problem while it was starting. Taiwan alerted them while the virus was becoming a major threat. The WHO did not listen to Taiwan because Beijing has kept the island nation out of the organization. Taiwan now has a low case load because they started precautionary measures early. They knew China was covering something up. The WHO continues to see Taiwan as a part of China and does not listen to them at the behest of Beijing. China making everything political has made this catastrophe much worse.
2020-03-30 10:41,"It would be nice if Communism was really about people in society working for the common good.  However, it never happens that way.  There are always authoritarian types who take charge and who insist on controlling everybody else."
2020-03-30 11:14,"China did failed, however, America seemingly has no such a reporting system at all. Even worse than China."
2020-03-30 10:48,"Communism at its best. The officials were to scared of XI's and the Chinese Communist Politburo reaction to present their findings. When they finally did, the were either castigated or arrested.
Perhaps those calling who suggest the Chinese Coronavirus terminology racist should re evaluate their positions. Perhaps they should call it the Chinese Communist Politburo Coronavirus. After all, it was XI and his fellow leaders who shunned the doctors in Wuhan, and, covered it up."
2020-03-30 11:04,"1.4 billion people and ZERO new COVID-19 cases reported over the last few weeks?  Yeah, right."
2020-03-30 11:36,"An excellent expose by your reporter Myers. It would have been  informative had he compared how politics in China worked to conceal information from the public and thus minimize the damage to the Party-- and how President Trump's response to the outbreak in the US was driven by the same political motivations (it was a ""Democratic Hoax"" designed to minimize his re-election chances, etc.).  I do not sympathize in the least bit with the political culture of China, but at the same time I cannot hold up the US as a shining example of political purity in this time of crisis.  The one difference-- a very big difference-- is our culture of a free press backed by the 1st Amendment, a factor that our President constantly attempts to undermine.  Keep up the good work NY TIMES; truth matters!"
2020-03-30 11:55,"Certainly the way that the Chinese local government handled the crisis was wrong. However, it would be remiss not to point out that the way the central government responded was quick, efficient, and admirable. 

With the way that the Chinese government is run, I have no doubt that the leadership in Wuhan will be replaced for allowing this fiasco. But what about the US? With the crisis exploding in Itlay, the UK, Spain - what do we say to governors who allowed Mardi Gras? To those the elected officials who continued to allow spring break students to party on the beaches of Miami? Where is the outrage there? 

I keep reading comments on how a democratic system is 'far superior' to the 'tyrannical despotism' of China. Okay - so tell me - how is the US's response any better than China's response? I see an overwhelming refrain that ""if only the Chinese government had the correct information earlier, this could have all been prevented."" Okay - did the US not have the data from Itay? UK? Spain? China squandered a month with political subterfuge - no doubt. But we had a month's forenotice. Have we orchestrated a response any better than China's? How now is democracy any better?"
2020-03-30 11:51,The reason local authorities held back information was because they were afraid to anger national leaders . This is exactly the tone Trump has established! “I don’t want the numbers going up” he said when there were plans to bring infected people from a cruise ship to shore.
2020-03-30 11:56,"There is a HUGE lesson to be learned here, one that Trump and his supporters should pay very close attention to.  When your subordinates try to withhold information from the higher ups so they will not get mad or angy, this is what can happen.  And this has happened under Trump many times where people withhold the truth from him as they do not want him to have a spell.  So who suffers?  We all do, every single citizen suffers when bad or incorrect information is given out.  And worse is repeated by Trump.  The man cries WOLF all the time, and I for one am very tired of his lies and evasions."
2020-03-30 11:48,"Political aversion to sharing bad news? Isn’t that exactly what happened, and continues to happen, here in the good old USA, the land of the free where the administration continues to distort the news through its propaganda outlet, Fox News and government officials were so concerned about their portfolio they unloaded it after a briefing in January?! 
I fail to discern any large difference between China and the US. Oh wait,"
2020-03-30 11:43,"Looking forward to look at the enemy mistakes don't make you better, in fact, all the OTAN/EU countries will become into a disaster.
There is no god to save us.
Capitalism will generate economic disturbances in our economies.
Eeuu was lucky because (even with Trump) can make money virtually inexistent destroying the latinoamerican countries (like many other times).
China will save EEUU economy because all the industry they have are intended to serve as an occidental toy shop.
Luck for everyone and greetings."
2020-03-30 12:07,"There is no mincing of words here. China is responsible for this and they should be held thoroughly accountable. The world should not give them a free pass. At the same time, we should start getting manufacturing back to this country and be less dependent on China. The 500billion the corporations are going to get should be tied to getting that manufacturing back to USA."
2020-03-30 11:59,"I don’t want to hear anything about China’s failings when the US has one quarter the population, one month head start, but now has more cases than China. 

Results matter. 


I don’t want to hear about how great Cuomo he has the power to shut down NYC early but didn’t. And now NYC has 30,000 cases compared to 300 in Hing Kong, which has a similar population and shares a land border with China and was attacked a month earlier. 

Results matter."
2020-03-30 11:58,"Bad things happen when those in charge cannot handle the truth. This holds true whether in a cockpit,  battle ground, or government body.  All the more reason why, in our current age of ""strong men"", whistle blowers are so important.  Are you listening Republicans? Can you handle the truth?"
2020-03-30 12:08,"The US has become, alas, too dependent on China. American companies need to place less emphasis on cheap labor and start coming home. China is not a friend. China does not mean well. China steals our intellectual property. China is engaged in a disinformation campaign to discredit America. China is a quiet bully."
2020-03-30 12:06,"Nothing can escape the watchful eyes of NYT editors and reporters, when it comes to China, Russia or Iran.
No stones can be left unturned to find some dirt, real or imagined that can yield a story, that shows the gross incompetence and haphazard handling  of this global epidemic. 
After all, since ""we"" don't have enough hospital beds, masks, and ventilators and ""we"" were and are completely unprepared and unfit to deal with the crisis, ""we"" cannot just let THOSE people (especially China) to be shown, as successful in countering this immense challenge, can we?"
2020-03-30 12:15,"Communism caused this pandemic. Perhaps Wuhan is China's Chernobyl. When Communist Party members have the final say in reporting instead of doctors or scientists, disasters happen. No local official wants to report bad news out of fear of reprisals because if they are wrong, the punishment is harsh, certainly a demotion or worse. The free world comes with its own set of unique challenges but downplaying bad news is not one of them. Be thankful for our federal system of government because here sometimes the states take the lead. Also, our 4th estate keeps a check on government as well."
2020-03-30 12:26,"Perfect system with imperfect bureaucrats always creates imperfect solution.  And vice versa is true.  It happens in China.  It happens in EU, and it happens in here.

China as a developing country, she has more room to grow especially the population education.  Chinese education is less populated than in here.  People are less educated, thus less analytical, informed, and easier to manipulated.  The Covid-19 crisis has brought up people's awareness & attention much faster than anything else.

Our problem is less problematic.  We are much better educated in general and better informed.  The only thing we need to do is to modify the election system, thus a better and able person to be the president."
2020-03-30 12:24,"I get it. This is swiftian satire. 

It would offend too many people to show the outrageous flaws in our own system, so we disguise them in the guise of writing about far-away ""China."""
2020-03-30 12:21,"Apparently, reporting truthful statistics is also something people aren't doing for fear of upsetting Beijing."
2020-03-30 12:32,"And what effect are fears of upsetting trump causing in the US?

I'd say a lack of truth from those around him, and a fear by agency heads to tell the truth, and thus far 2,490 deaths."
2020-03-30 12:15,China failed for their leadership wanted to enjoy their February holidays. They also did not truly understand the depth of the virus. They need to investigate the Wuhan bio testing site and reveal what really happened.
2020-03-30 12:41,"Trump*s dithering, avoidance and dissembling had similar effect in the USA. Vote. Him. Out."
2020-03-30 12:49,"Steven, please explain the gap between Xi issuing orders in early January, continuing censorship, silencing and closing of any private or government laboratories that sequenced the coronavirus in late December in multiple provinces outside local government control, and national government inaction until the shutdown of Wuhan and Hubei. Your narrative is misleading: this is NOT a disaster made only by local officials to the disappointment of the great leaders in Beijing."
2020-03-30 12:52,"Like Climate change, the Corona Virus is going to disproportionately affect the poorer nations, whose progress and economies are going to be ruined.  Come Fall 2020, we will enter a New World set up by the China virus."
2020-03-30 12:44,"All dangerous viruses have originated in China and Africa. WHO and CDC should not have allowed China to monitor its viruses.  This epidemic has ruined the World as we know and the when the dust settles down more countries would be pushed to the Fourth World, losing all their progress as Third World.  Trump has always been right calling it the China Virus."
2020-03-30 12:17,As if we did any better.
2020-03-30 13:08,"Somewhat different problem in our country: The reporting system works, except the administration hinders the generation of data by reducing staff and resources. When data is generated that paints an accurate picture, the President chooses to replace it with his ""feelings"" and disregards his scientists and advisors. Finally, he tries to distort news through his Fox New relationship."
2020-03-30 13:10,"This article brings added depth to China's response.  However,  the constraints facing Wuhan's physicians were many.  

1) Confucian culture where it is a loss of face to admit ""I don't know.""  2) The political culture of sacking anyone who reports to a Party Boss ""I have bad news."" 3) The absence of a free press to report government malfeasance.  4) The absence of elections where citizens can demand better action.  5) The lack of public information about the spread of Covid-19 to other cities.  

In early January one of my staff came to work looking as white as a ghost.   Her mclassmate's husband was a pulmonologist and that weekend had died in Beijing at the age of 40.  Nobody really had the facts.  Without the facts, no leader, hospital or citizen could clearly see the situation and take action.  

Chinese official and unofficial reporting on the disease was like blind men feeling an elephant, bureaucratic denial here, personal panic attack there.  Chinese citizens didn't want either, but they did want guidance.   When city shut downs became established, they welcomed them.  

Also, for various cultural, historical and political reasons, outside investigators were not welcome.  There was a sense of national shame and even disgust over eating wildlife.  China's leadership wanted to solve the problem on their own.

Right now, this pandemic is a global health issue.  Let's move forward by collaboration and compassion.  Learning from our mistakes is what makes us human."
2020-03-30 13:12,"At this juncture I’d be more worried about the American response and lack of preparation. Look at the photo of the medics and nurse in this feature, see what they are wearing - and American health professionals  are pleading for a simple effective face mask."
2020-03-30 13:14,"This article focuses on China as the starting point of the epidemic but it must be noted that similar events occurred in many countries during the early days of the outbreak. 

In the US, President Trump repeatedly dismissed the epidemic as trivial and refused to ramp up testing so that he could keep pretending that the numbers of cases were small in order to limit the impact on the economy. 

Here in France (and elsewhere in Europe), something similar happened. In the very early days, governments limited testing to very narrow cases so they could keep their numbers down to prevent economic impact. They only started taking serious action once it was apparent to everyone that containment had failed disastrously."
2020-03-30 13:25,"The US seems to have a similar lack of transparency, whether in the name of patient privacy or through a lack of centralized planning. 

It would appear that during our own critical early phase there was a dearth if potentially life saving information that could have been organized and shared. 

The real problem now is that we haven’t seemed to improve on this matter."
2020-03-30 13:29,"I am still not seeing one discussion. Should human beings begin to think about placing restrictions on what animals can be eaten by humans, and also on not using animal parts for preparing so-called traditional medicine?"
2020-03-30 13:25,"Good reporting which brings clarity to
the problem of information disclosure.
Chinese political system is flawed
allowing too much control to the
local party hacks.If the information
system was allowed to operate the way
it was intended the problem would have been contained. China should constrain
the power and control of local party
officials and let the experts on health,
economics have more say. Much damage has been done by the party
intrusion into every sphere. Communist party in China acts similar to the
republican party here, suppress and stonewall the unfavorable information,
Being a democracy the leaders like
Mitch McConnell issues some sort
of statement usually to mislead and
point fingers at the democrats."
2020-03-30 13:14,"When dealing with an authoritarian government that killed 50 million of its people and committed the massacre at Tienanmen Square, it is understandable why the average Chinese would not want to anger their government.  Another factor is the role of the Communist Party, which has a political angle on everything.

Here' we've enjoyed a democratic government with not too much power, which in earlier times encourage people to be empowered and speak up.  But that too will change in the face of rising corporate power."
2020-03-30 13:21,"In our so called leadership in this administration , we are seeing a group of power hungry, barely literate individuals who would act in exactly the same ways as the Chinese bureaucrats  to control the the sharing of information.

Will this be a lesson or will we we see ever more attempts to strangle the voices of scientists and medical personnel?

If China can change its culture, it will be a miracle. Ours is supposed to be open to improvement."
2020-03-30 13:09,"I've been tracking the rate of infection and recovery since early March.  The drop in the number of ""continuing cases"" in China, and the rate of change, is too rapid to be believed unless ""deaths"" are vastly under-reported.  If we are to look for a benchmark, it's probably going to be South Korea.  

China ""continuing cases"" fell by 50% in two weeks.  South Korea has not yet fallen by 50% although their peak number of continuing cases took place almost three weeks ago."
2020-03-30 13:13,"The number of fatalities in China , according to a Chinese investigative report , appears to be at least ten times the official numbers . This report was based on the number of funerary urns being distributed now to the families , 3200 per day until mid April.
The present American administration during the last three years appears to have reduced the CDC epidemiologists , monitoring the situation in crucial areas in China , by two thirds !
This administration was lethargic during the sound alarm coming from China at the end of 2019 , testing kits were defective, now they are still scarse .
Florida with its high population of elderly , lack of rules and dismal amount of testing , will be another epicenter for this pandemic."
2020-03-30 13:33,"China's top-down political system foredoomed the reluctance of local officials to report bad news to the central government, hence the China's fault at the beginning cannot be neglected. However, after 2 month's warning scenes and so much lessons and experience in China, the disease still broke out in the wetern, even much worse, the western world's negligience and complacency to the virus weeks ago is stunning,  and this is the main reason why it lost control."
2020-03-30 13:36,"China may not be alone. During the previous administration I had a chance to see how the Federal government was working to devise a single measure of problems at the southern border. The process involved gathering hard numerical data along the border. Each data element was then multiplied by a weight factor, determined by agents and administrators working on the front lines. Before adding up all these products, each separate element was to be multiplied by one more factor, chosen, line by line at some office in Washington. Rather than control the situation at the border, central administration  wanted, even more,  to control perceptions of it."
2020-03-30 13:10,China failed miserably and the UN needs to monitor the emergence of deadly viruses from China. Unfortunately COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic originating from China. As I have said before there could be another pandemic within 5 years. The global role of China needs to be diminished. China no longer should be a permanent member of the UN and its veto power should be withdrawn.
2020-03-30 13:31,"Here we go again: when the people of the world should be coming together the same old phobias are still alive and well - Chinese, Russians etc. are being demeaned - their systems of government are not up to our high standards - they are morally and intellectually inferior. We are one species on one small planet. We need to grow up - be polite - make friends."
2020-03-30 13:03,"Basically, this article confirms chinese data is flawed as cases began as early as december 12th if compared to more reliable data from western countries. Chinese must have had between 5x/10x more cases/deaths than reported it."
2020-03-30 13:40,"Make no mistake, China floundered big time in the early days of reporting and containing the virus that's now become the biggest problem world-wide in a century. But given the lead time some other countries have had, their response have been abysmal as well. Seems like a kettle meets pot kind of situation to me."
2020-03-30 13:40,Local governments' fear of repercussions from national governmental response is obviously not a Chinese phenomenon. I listen to our chief executive's daily briefings.   One conclusion I draw from everything I've read about COVID19's spread everywhere is that COVID19 had spread significantly before it was labeled COVID19.  People thought to have died from the flu and from congestive heart failure may have died as a result of COVID19 related conditions.  All improved numbers are based on a prior numbers which might not include all initial infections in the rising tide of COVID19.
2020-03-30 13:41,"""Another study found that if China had moved to control the outbreak three weeks earlier, it might have prevented 95 percent of the country’s cases.""
As pointed out in yesterday's NYT report, the same applies to the US - there but for the testing fiasco, our failure to value public health preparation and the administration's magical belief that the  virus would just away. The human and economic pain we find ourselves in now sits squarely on the shoulders of a group of cowboys at CDC and with Trump and his political minions at DHHS and FDA."
2020-03-30 13:14,"Putting aside the “interference” does the USA have a comparable or better state of the art reporting system?

Many countries, differing political systems and ideologies yet the same delay, “missed opportunities” and literally deadly consequences. . . 

100 years since the “Spanish Flu” and more similarities in governments inabilities and human behavior generally. . . A behavioral case study for the ages. . ."

2020-03-30 13:49,"The National Institutes of Health in the US noted in 2017 that China has historically been a “cradle of zoonoses.” “Wet markets are frequently under-regulated, have unhygienic environments with inadequate sanitation, and are subject to poor surveillance and little biosecurity.” (Woo et al. 2006). The spillover of H5N1 and H7N9 into human populations in China has been closely linked to these wet markets.

2020-03-30 14:03,"It just goes to show, it really does not matter what system you put in place when you are about protecting your economic engine and staying in power.

Italy suffered the most from this disinformation campaign with flights from Wuhan still landing in northern Italy.  Children coming back from holidays in China and attending schools, using mass transit.

But then again, what good would the lead time have done anyway?  All of the manufacturing of masks, ventilators, pharmaceuticals etc are in China, which was shut down and cut off.

If this wasn't the world's biggest wake up call as to the dangers of putting all one's eggs in one basket, I do not know what is.

The world has become reliant on the country that exported the plague on selling them the cure."

The first infections were noticed in November. 
As late as January 15th, the Chinese government told the World Health Organization there was no human to human spread. 
Jan. 18: Tens of thousands of families participate in Wuhan's Lunar New Year banquet. Millions later travel out of Wuhan. The March 6, 2020 WSJ article: ""How It All Started: China’s Early Coronavirus Missteps"" clearly reports the facts.

The sick, disgusting practice of Chinese wildlife markets provide and endless cauldron of contagion. As long as the Chinese government does nothing to discourage the Chinese people from their belief that eating this nasty stuff will cure impotence, cancer, etc, the world will continue to be exposed to ever more virulent and fatal diseases.

The Wuhan virus is brought to you by the same people who brought us SARS in 2002. This was both preventable and predictable. Notably, this is also the same group that keeps the world well supplied with illicit fentanyl. The blame should be placed squarely where it belongs - on the Chinese government.  Thousands (if not millions) of lives lost, trillions of dollars of damage to businesses, trillions of dollars in healthcare costs - the world should DEMAND accountability and justice.

I do hope this gets better after Xi Jinping reaches the presidential term limit. Ah, but that would be a problem too, since he removed term limits and declared himself president for life."
2020-03-30 14:14,"What nonsense.

I have been following the problem since December 31, 2019 when the World Health Organization was informed of the pneumonia cluster found in Wuhan.  The international press was informed.  The Chinese press covered the problem from December 31.  The United States was expressly and additionally informed on January 3, 2020.  By January 3, the Chinese had decoded the COVID-19 genome which was made public on January 10.

The Chinese tracking system worked from the beginning.

The Chinese performed a critically important service for the world as listening to the WHO and looking at the experience of surrounding countries clearly shows."
2020-03-30 14:14,"I agree ben,  even what has been said is true about early reporting in china, but what is the execuse of other countries mainly europe and US to not taking the threat seriously untill the epidemic becomes much more catastophic than china. I donot understand why in US still not enough test kits and ventilators to cope with the level of threat. till now people who came voluntarily because of symptoms they had are being turned away. they need to be almost dying to be eligible for testing. this is insane!!!!"

And four, have an independent agency run it who answers to no politician.   Since we have the model (yeah, we may even look at another country to get inspiration), we have great tech, we have an agency set up to deal with these situations (CDC perhaps?), we have a history of [relatively] independent institutions not needing to answer to the President/politicians on a daily basis, be it in legal (Supreme Court) or monetary (Federal Reserve), this, for the greatest nation on Earth, should be the equivalent to a slightly complex Lego project for a young child.  Unless, of course, the politicians, on both sides, can't get out of their own ways.  (Enough blame to go around so no need to even start.  Let's start fixing instead.)"
2020-03-30 14:37,"I would take greater comfort from knowing that the source of new coronaviruses is being addressed than from monitoring and reporting mechanisms, as vital as they are. It seems the best scientific information we have right now is that the wildlife trade and live animal markets were the conditions that allowed SARS and COVID-19 to emerge. The governments in countries where these conditions are prevalent have not stepped up to address this problem. The same Chinese government that can lock down most of the country and grind its economy to a months-long halt can also stop the wildlife trade in its tracks and permanently stop live animal markets. They do not appear to be even open to considering such steps. I want to know how to unite with Chinese citizens and citizens in other countries around the world to demand that governments take action to end conditions that encourage these zoonotic diseases. The silly name-calling and blaming needs to stop and we all need to come together to take the evidence-based steps to stop this from happening again in the future."
2020-03-30 14:30,"The reason why the infectious disease reporting tech tool developed to deal with the SARS failed to report cases of coronavirus infections is simple: centralised authoritarian regimes rely on secrecy and fear around that discourage free communication and feedback from below. It is this opaque decision making, iron clad execution of rules, and fear psychosis around that impedes free communication. Things come to surface only when impossible to manage as to be seen with the current coronavirus havoc, initially denied then firefighting."
2020-03-30 14:56,"Credit to China, their leadership saw with clear eyes the magnitude of the problem, and took drastic measures to stall the advance of the virus. Now China is reawakening, life is returning to normal, and they're sending aid supplies and doctors across the world to lend assistance. This is what superpowers are supposed to do."
2020-03-30 15:02,"A new world order post Corona virus needs to be in place.  The UN Security Council and other mechanisms were put in place to end the conventional wars and mayhem.  The new world order needs a new international body to monitor diseases, calamities,  climate change effects, and migrations of people.

The difference is that while the private sector in the US is much stronger and can therefore keep functioning in spite of the disfunctional public sector, China still awaits a civil society where people can take the lead. We should all help China cultivate the birth of a Chinese civil society soon. Otherwise, Covid-19 will not be the last global threat coming out of China."

I also caught this little snippet, and couldn't help but think of Trump repeatedly berating specific journalists and bashing the media:
""During a rare burst of relative transparency early in the epidemic, Chinese journalists did much to expose the problems, but censors closed that window.""

Looks like this virus is just one of many danger signs we're seeing in the Trump presidency. We must vote him OUT in November."

""...so did fears of upsetting Beijing.""

My lord, the US is no different from any totalitarian regime you'd care to mention, including Communist China. Anyone who dares confront Trump with the truth is ridiculed by Trump and his base. Don't doubt for a second that Trump's politically appointed sycophants are scared out of their ever-loving gourds about telling the truth if they think he'll be unhappy. Day after day we see and hear Trump spewing happy talk and listen to him obsess about ""ratings"" as opposed to reality.
Everything we're experiencing right now has its origins in the fear of speaking truth to power. There is one big difference, though, according to this reporting: The leaders in Beijing didn't know because, well, they didn't know. Trump did know but didn't want to hear the potentially unpleasant facts.

Answer: Everyone who pays attention to Trump and his behavior, that's who!"
2020-03-30 15:06,"This article highlights a key point: The responsibility for this new virus (SARS-COVID) getting out from its point of origin (Wuhan) lies not with ""China"" or ""the Chinese"", but their incompetent leadership. The decision to suppress the early warnings and keep the airport, train stations etc open allowed this contagion to spread to the rest of the world.   In fact, the  people there are just as much victims of the ineptitude of their Executive leaders as we are of the ineptitude of our current Executive. A key difference is that we can change ours come November!"

A global task force should be constituted to counteract any such emerging contagious infection in the future. It should be overseen by the UN/WHO.

2020-03-30 15:12,"BLIND MEN DESCRIBING AN ELEPHANT.  Certainly, the beginning was not reported in a timely fashion, because of political fears in an authoritarian government system.  Once recognized there was a domestic travel ban, large numbers of tests were strategically performed, Wuhan was locked down, comprehensive contact tracing was performed.  It is hard to call this a failure.  Certainly when compared to what has happened in the US, the Chinese program was more successful. 83,000 cases in China so far and 140,000 in the US."
2020-03-30 15:11,"Just heard an interesting theory:  This was China's, i.e. Xi's, payback to Trump for his attempt to bully Xi.

I'm not one for conspiracy theories but after reading this, it seems that the outbreak was allowed to get out of control.  And this from a government that controls everything.

Also wondering why we're not hearing much from Russia about outbreaks. Is there any connection between Xi and Putin as they maneuver to become global power brokers?

Just wondering."
2020-03-30 15:10,"Why are we still talking about China when our own systems have failed us and continue to do so? The lack of masks, PPEs, testing kits, and more importantly a President who can convey a sense of confidence and calm instead of that buffoon we have in office. We’ve had several months to learn from the mistakes of China, and a few weeks’ lead to avoid the unimaginable catastrophe befalling Italy now and we’ve squandered it. So before we start being critical about other countries, let’s start with our own."
2020-03-30 15:12,"This is a very important and brilliantly researched article, though incomplete. Why has there been so little attention to the source of the pandemic--initially, an animal-to-human virus transfer that appears to have originated in a wet market where wild animals are slaughtered and sold to be eaten, and then (as Myers reports), a politically-ordered delay in reporting the dangerous new virus, which led to four weeks in which it spread in Wuhan and abroad, as thousands of Chinese traveled to Europe and other countries? Certainly there was a lack of preparation in countries outside China, because such a pandemic had not been experienced since 1918. But not to focus on the CAUSES of the virus emergence (related to the use of local or imported wild animals thought to have magical properties) is to ignore the source of the problem and insure that it will happen again. Indeed, the viral pandemics from 1918 through 1957, 1968, and 2002 had similar origins in autocratic countries with peculiar food practices. Unless we want to repeat the current experience with illness, death, and economic catastrophe, we must somehow persuade autocratic, information-suppressing countries where animal-human relationships facilitate new viral illness in humans to stop those practices.
Focusing all the blame on unprepared democratic governments far from the origins of the virus guarantees repetition of our current misery."
2020-03-30 14:35,"So let me get this straight. China caused the issue and then neglected/ignored and jailed the people who raised awareness of the issue...and now we're seeing articles on how well they handled it. NYT, you do understand that it's easier to handle these things as a dictatorship than a open and free democracy, right?

When are we going to get rid of the PC culture and talk about the real issue?! China has caused massive amounts of deaths, despair and economic hardships on the rest of the world due to their negligence while spreading false rumors that the US military started this disease to cover their mistakes. However, all I read about on NYT is how well they managed to close this thing down and how poorly we're doing everything. 

Thank you for the boost of confidence in this time of despair and fragility NYT. Doom and gloom really does sell better no matter what the social implications are on our society, right? You have no social obligations as a massive media outlet during this time of crisis, correct?"

China has rightfully taken criticism for squelching attempts by scientists to report information during the outbreak. Now, the United States government is doing similar things. Informing Fauci and other government scientists that they must clear all public comments with Vice President Mike Pence is unacceptable. This is not a time for someone who denies evolution, climate change, and the dangers of smoking to shape the public message. Thank goodness Fauci, Francis Collins [director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)], and their colleagues across federal agencies are willing to soldier on and are gradually getting the message out.

While scientists are trying to share facts about the epidemic, the administration either blocks those facts or restates them with contradictions...."
2020-03-30 15:53,"Rereading the headline - only that: Their reporting system was crackerjack, and there's no evidence it failed.  Humans inserted their fears, biases, and political aspirations,  along with  a dollop of wishful thinking, ignoring what was in front of them. Kind of like Boeing did with their test results on the 737 systems."
2020-03-30 15:37,"Hmm, a government trying to keep the reported number of infected down. Where have I heard that before? Oh, yeah, our President saying he'd rather keep the infected onboard their ships instead of entering the US because he likes the low numbers.

Any government that is concerned with staying in power over saving lives will do this, no matter its nominal political system."
2020-03-30 16:28,"A very detailed, enthralling reportage which has put into evidence how China's top brass politicians in Wuhan, had cared about their careers more than their citizens' health. Because of this, and for political reasons, also the alarm to WHO by federal government, was postponed too.

Fantastic behaviour of  the Chinese medical personnel and doctors!

Which renders the term ""Chinese virus"" very pale after this reportage. The term was incorrect anyway: viruses have no nationality. Saying Chinese you blame, most, this laborious and peaceful people, not the ""apparatchik"" which had to forbid, after SARS, therefore well in advance, the selling of exotic animals.

I'm also confident that this epidemic will cause  a new healthy ""contagion"" in the Dragons' Country: much more democracy, and at a speedier pace than Covid-19 itself.

But what hasn't turned pale yet, in USA, is the virus warning of Intelligence Agencies, submitted to Potus D.J. Trump, already in mid January 2020. 

In that study had been foreseen United States of America being hit, by March 2020, by a vicious virus. CIA officials had reiterated to the Potus this warning at the end of January and at the beginning of February 2020. In other words, a Pearl Harbour replay could have been easily muffled or avoided altogether.

Now the Potus seems a bit transformed, in better, by the stark reality of the first 2,000 American deaths, but the alive ones, should not forget how the true narrative of the virus spread in USA, unfolded"

2020-03-30 19:18,The big difference between 2002 and today is that the Communist Party that controls The Center of Everything (China in English) installed a Social Credit System which ensured reporting failure.

There will always be a chance of a virus outbreak in China or anywhere else. However, the chances of that happening in China is much greater because it is run by an inexperienced and hubris authoritarian regime who only wants to hear good news and praises"
2020-03-30 21:05,"The fact is, even after Jan 3 when Covid virus was reported to Beijing and the virus sequence released by a Shangahi Lab on Jun 6, which was closed down later by authorities for releasing such information to public, the Chinese central government and the Chinese CDC still lies to its  people. The Chinese version of Doctor Fauci is Dr Zhong, a scientist and communist party member still are Telling the public that the virus is no more than a flu and there was no human to human transmission UNTIL JANUARY 22!

2020-03-31 0:21,"This is one of the most nuanced and objective articles on how the initial cover-up happened. It is also important to note that in China, the CDC doesn't have the same authority as that in the US. In this case, the CDC sent a team of experts to Wuhan as soon as the director, Gao Fu, heard of the incidents. However, they were subordinate to the National Health Commission, which was probably manipulated due to political motivations. For those who read Chinese, the article by the economist, Hua Sheng, cited in this article, will shed more light on what happened."
2020-03-31 2:08,That the Chinese people had such experts and such an extensive reporting system in place is a credit to their ability and compassion. Millions of People are moving across cities and across the globe at every second of the day. It is wishful thinking that the virus could have been stopped at Wuhan. Maybe 18 years ago. The rise of maga-citiies and industrial parks has come at a cost. The picture of Wuhan shows a skyline of smokestacks and a river without fish. China’s emperor system is not working in the modern world. There are plenty of rights lawyers who could lead China to a safer and more friendly future.

People need to wake up and realize that this is the truth. We would not even have Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid if not for the hard work of Democrats fighting against Republicans for all of these programs that we depend on today!

'Wet markets' in Asia where the deluded imagine healing properties from consuming wildlife like bats and pangolins.  Chinese government officials who react first by seeking to hide anything that might be considered an embarrassment to them or higher level communists.  A megalomaniac  President who has no clue about what leadership is beyond constant grifting for himself and his friends and family.  Let the Albany community recall a true leader, Obama who led the winning world fight against Ebola and who then handed to Trump his team of experts, his office on global health security, which Trump disbanded in selfish efforts to erase all things Obama.  But also in a much smaller sense anyone in Albany who trusted religion over science and who might have ignored warnings from medical authorities to avoid gatherings.  God does not protect them - an understanding of science does.  Learn this and remember this come election time.  Every future election you can vote in."

We are a Red State that continues to follow the administrations approach in lack of communication & in leadership.

It seems like something like what is described in this funeral home situation could have been contained if he was more aggressive in his advice.
2020-03-31 14:17,"Yet another example of why it's critical to have solid leadership--in the White House and in governor's mansions. We all take our cue from elected leaders, who get information from experts that the general public usually doesn't have. If those leaders don't take warnings seriously and act quickly to inform their constituents, the rest of us go about our lives unaware that we're in danger, and then the virus spreads, and people die.

It is not unfair to suspect the largest gathering centers in a rural county as the most possible sources of infection. It is logical and reasonable to look at the commonality of those affected by the outbreak and draw conclusions. In fact that is the job of public health agencies. 
Instead of complaining, this pastor should be doing all he can to reassure his parishioners while encouraging social distancing.
Just as a single choir practice in Washington elicited a huge outbreak among attendees, the cause of this outbreak was very likely the funeral. Acknowledge the dangers inherent in conducting daily business as usual or accept the lethal consequences. There are no other options."

2020-03-31 11:46,"My heart goes out to the many people affected by this tragedy.

One particularly disturbing part of the article lies in this description of people's attitudes:  “It created fear: Who will be at the gathering that I’m going to on Sunday, that funeral, or that wedding? Do I go? Do I not go?”

The very fact that anyone was asking that question at all, even after people were dying merely highlights how badly as a nation we have failed to educate our people about the need for distance.

The virus is as apolitical and as neutral to religion as things come.  It doesn't care whether you are attending a church service, a funeral, or a rock concert.    It does what it is designed to do--seeks out new hosts in which to replicate, and in the process, create immense damage."
2020-03-31 11:50,"Rural America is underserved medically and once this virus finds its way to them it will be devastating. In more normal times they would look to the nearest city for better care, but that option won't be available now. This is just a taste of what will happen over the next few months as Corvid-19 spreads through areas with too few health care workers and too many people without medical insurance. 

Now is when we start to pay the price as a nation for not providing everyone with access to medical care, as every other advanced nation on Earth does. Imagine how bad things would be if the Republicans had managed to kill off the ACA? Unbelievably they are still trying to accomplish that even today!"
2020-03-31 12:16,"The detective story involved is intriguing, the personal stories tragic,  but the utter failure of political leadership to get the word out early  - their resistance to allowing the information to guide public advisories - their playing down of risks - - despicable.

I was thinking as I read: so if they identify THE individual who was ""responsible"" for the outbreak and he becomes a pariah, is that fair?  

There was an utter failure to stake steps to protect people -- when the dangers WERE known. None of them had to die of COVID-19. 

The President*  - his advisors - and everyone  - state or local - who treated this as a joke, a hoax, or a little political problem that could be exploited to their gain,  ought to have to stand before a national commission to account for themselves and their decisions.  Who enabled spread of a deadly disease virus in the early weeks and months?: they did.

The other sad thing, of course, is that most of these folks were also more likely to die of other treatable conditions - and thus more susceptible to this infection -  because of the county and state  they lived in. 

Dougherty county demographic data ( US Census Bureau, 2018/19 ):
Median Household income: $37,633( NYS: $65,323 ; Persons in poverty (est.) 29.5% ( NYS 13.6%); persons without health insurance (est.) 14.5% (NYS 6.3%) Alabama is one of the states which refused to participate in Medicaid expansion under the ACA."
2020-03-31 15:08,"This sad story, coupled with another shows the limitations of our knowledge of what’s going on. In the story running right above this one there is speculation that high tech thermometers linked to the internet may be a good, reliable way to track the pandemic. When you look at the map generated by the thermometers, Dougherty County looks like everyplace around. Nothing alarming.
Could it be that there is not a single one of those high tech thermometers in the entire county? Could it be that all the afflicted didn’t have a fever? Is it that all the high tech thermometers are in wealthy households that have not been exposed?
We just don’t know."

In any case, viruses do not respect the Bill Of Rights. 

Besides, this is not about the infringement of rights.
This is about the spread of contagious disease.

Stop treating this as a rights problem, and start treating it like the pandemic it is. Maintain social distancing. One of the lives you save may be your own, or your loved one's."

They severely down-played CV-19 as a Democratic hoax and remain, to this day, criminally lax in both ordering and enforcing social distancing.  As just oen example, only seven days of quarantine is not sufficient

Though I understand the desire of the mother and relatives to be with the daughter who died, that the hospital permitted them to be present is absolutely astonishing!  Visitors in hospitals exponentially increase the likelihood of medical staff and the visitors themselves becoming infected and then exacerbating community spread.  It is gross neglect for the hospital to allow it.

My 90 year old mother lives not far from Albany.  Up until yesterday, a niece who lives nearby and who had planned a giant community Easter Egg hunt was still gung-ho on the project.  She finally called it off, but not without grumbling.  That politics and religion have been utilized as a means to ignore civic responsibility in the midst of a pandemic is reprehensible.  At least my mother gets it and has self-isolated for 31 days to date."

2020-03-31 16:16,"Race, ethnicity and economic status are always factors. Just think early on there were people loudly exclaiming publicly and on social media that Black people or people with melanin cannot get the virus or ‘apparently recover quickly.’ 

I’ve heard countless seemingly intelligent people lose all their brain cells to say such absurd things and so much more, and then make plans to go to church events, bars, cruises, birthday bashes, baby showers and even Madre Gras. 

Now the “new thing” is to blame the spread on 5G technology. Most people don’t have a clue what it is or how it functions. Over the years, people’s ability to critically think has deteriorated to caustic group-think and the insistent repeating of unfounded yet easily fact-checked non-sense and lies cloaked in tidbits of pseudoscience. What happened to asking critical questions? Cross-checking information? Consider who is speaking and their qualifications.

All this lazy thinking and incompetent leadership is killing us."
2020-03-31 15:17,"Why does Trump  not issue a nationwide decree for shelter-in-place?  Politics?  Greed?  Profound Ignorance? Or his lethal sadistic zest for cruelty?  The virus does not stop at one border, one state, one county, one town.  Medical experts are calling out about the madness of NOT instituting a nationwide plan. I cringe at the thought of citizens going to group functions, not observing social distancing, etc. because their ""leaders"" have allowed business as usual in their areas.  By inaction, citizen's leaders are ensuring that their constituents will become infected, possibly die AND risk overworked medical personnel lives.  How did our country's ""leaders"" become so dumb, so very stupid?  The ""leaders"" are not immune to the virus...what does it take to get them  listen to pandemic experts?  Shameful beyond words."

You never know who might have been exposed to the virus while remaining asymptomatic.

It just reinforces the need for red state governors to get far more serious about the threat to their rural communities."

When one of us dies needlessly, we all die a bit. Take a quick look at how Germany has handled this crisis. 

Pitting half of the population against each other is never going to get a result we all like. My hopes are that funerals will be replaced by delayed Memorials just before November elections. But since this is Georgia and election process protection was the first thing sacrificed by the current regime, I have no great expectations.

Given congress actions to protect the November elections, expect more of the same.

I can only pray that those future generations will have the opportunities that I had. We need to learn lessons fast or become just one more 3rd world country."

2020-03-31 17:08,"Like many commenters, I'm furious at the Trump administration's failure to prepare for this pandemic. My city is in shambles, I can't visit my mother who is in hospice in a nursing home, and my sisters can't get here to say goodbye and grieve with my father and I.

What is even more heinous though, is that the scenario laid out in this heartbreaking story is destined to replay itself over and over again in small towns everywhere, as a result of CURRENT failures of this administration.

We can make our anger known at the ballot box next fall, but the focus now needs to be on getting the whole country on board with a plan to defeat this virus. It's not going to disappear, so it's imperative that we all work together to avert disaster of an almost inconceivable scale.

I doubt many people in Albany read the NYT. If they did, they certainly wouldn't be questioning whether or not they should attend gatherings! People in small towns everywhere should be scared out of their wits that they will be next, so that they will take the draconian measures that are necessary to slow down the leviathan that is hurtling their way.

Tragically, the one person who could accomplish this, who could tell this story and and have it reach the ears of virtually every person in the country, won't do it. Pathetic."

2020-03-31 18:12,"This heartbreaking story continues to underline what's gone wrong with America, and though we're repeatedly told to avoid ""politicizing"" the conversation about it, the finger of blame points only in one direction.  Republican priorities for decades have been to attack government, close scientific agencies whose regulations are ""bad for business,"" lower taxes to enrich the already wealthy, 
maintain power by suppressing minority voting, cripple the public school system because it teaches science and humanism.  Did I leave anything out?   Probably.  

But the result of ""draining the swamp"" is a national government staffed with inexperienced and ignorant Trump loyalists supervised by evangelicals like Mitch McConnell, who have no idea what to do and few tools to do anything even if they had a clue.  This plague has been made much worse for America by Trump and his cronies on Fox News refusing to listen to scientists until it was way too late, and comforting the public with lies.  

And what's most ironic is that science, which is politically neutral, even after decades of attack and reduced funding, is what will save those of us who can survive until a vaccine is invented.  Blaming the current American catastrophe on Trump misses the point--he's only the front man of a party that thinks only of money.  By the way, if these deplorables knew history, they'd know that it was science that made America great in the 20th Century."

Hint: look at their track record over recent years with nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections. Yes, they are overwhelmed and yes the staff are heroes for walking into this hospital every day. But this does expose a systemic  problem at this hospital that those of us in the medical community have known about for years. Maybe this will actually result in change at this hospital. The death rate in Albany should not be so dramatically higher than in Atlanta."
2020-03-31 18:11,"Even as cases were ramping up in Washington State, no national oversight or leadership was deployed. The President made a judgement and blocked travel from China but refused to acknowledge any other responsibility to prepare for what was inevitably to come. He was informed by his intelligence early on and still laughed it off. We all witnessed him literally laughing it off.  At this late date no national order to restrict social distancing measures has been made. No national organized approach to providing medical equipment needed has taken place. It is piece meal and people in small towns have not had any guidance against congregating at funerals, weddings, parties and other events. Testing in America has been nothing short of a debacle. Every rural area which will become a casualty of this pandemic is also a casualty of an administration which has not demonstrated a dedication to American lives. When asked about testing problems as voiced by healthcare workers, doctors and Governors of endless cities, yesterday the President replied ""I haven't heard anything about troubles with testing""."

I agree with what you say about the danger of faith based belief over belief in science, but I don't think it has anything to do with the tragedy described in this story.  These people were exposed before there was knowledge shared with the general public about a potential novel viral disease and the need to take precautions.  They were the victims of those running our Federal government who chose to remain silent (except to warn their rich buddies to divest in some stocks and buy others) and allow the current epidemic to deeply root itself in our communities.  

The poor and powerless continue to be victimized by the rich and powerful.  It doesn't matter if you are US citizen, an educated voter (like myself) living in CA, or living in a Republican state - if you don't have money you are essentially powerless in this nation.  We need to stop lying to ourselves about that, and start changing things, to stop this kind of tragedy from happening again."
2020-03-31 19:49,"The jist of this sad story is everyone must practice self isolation.  If you don’t think it will infect you because you’re at a church service, think again. Self isolate to protect yourself, loved ones, friends and strangers. If you don’t get this idea, there’s nothing more to say,  but Ill advised behavior will spread the virus.  You have a choice, just do the right thing."

2020-03-31 22:09,"The spread of this virus could have been manageable had proper actions taken place in both the private sector & local/state government. They closed schools on the 13th, switched to distance learning, yet many jobs remained open until yesterday. They closed the library at which my husband works to the public, yet employees are required to come in on alternating shifts. This same library had a positive case, yet nothing was mentioned to the employees until the test results came back, only then was the building closed for sanitation.
The local government issues ""shelter in place"" mandates, but doesn't apply it to their non-essential workers, & now we see how quickly this virus is spreading amongst those many departments. Shelter in place mandates which they have no intention to enforce. This hasn't been taken seriously by citizens, with people shopping as families at the local Target/Walmart/Lowe's/Home Depot. Barbershops & hair salons were just required to close yesterday (3/30/20), & every other day is a new press conference ""asking"" people politely to practice social distancing, followed by the updated positive cases and death numbers.
It's gotten so bad, you've got the majority of our citizens BEGGING for a city-wide shut down, only to fall on deaf ears. Because if we attack this virus proactively, we won't be the center of national attention anymore, we won't be able to request all of those GEMA/FEMA recovery dollars. It's disgusting, truly disgusting, to live here."

Some have a pocket for a disposable filter such as a paper towel or disassembled sanitary napkins. These masks provide substantial protection from an infected wearer who is infectious from spreading the disease. They also provide substantial protection for the wearer to inhale infectious droplets. You can find YouTube videos on how to make several types of masks. Of course frequent hand washing is essential. I wear my mask whenever I go out."

Fourth, delay or cancelation of election(s).

It's a Trump word salad.  It sounded good to him saying ""enforceable quarantine.""  THe word combo sounds decisive. Gov. Cuomo is right to say ""I don't know what that means.""

No such thing is possible. It might be possible to quarantine *Manhattan* by closing off all the bridges and tunnels.  If you could withstand the blowback and also solve for getting all the goods and groceries and supplies into the borough.

But, it's really nonsense. Put up more walls! It sounds like Trump's wall down south, or his sealing off China. Now he thinks he can do an imaginary wall involving New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 

It's really the story of Trump's mind. It's one that truly cannot cope with, or even understand, an ""open-systems"" world using closed-system thinking."

I'm glad the Civil Rights Division issued its statement against state and hospital policies encouraging tiered care based on age or disability.  This never would have been issue if not for the extremely slow start our government had in taking the virus seriously.

But the corker is Trump's suggestion of quarantining of an entire tri-state area.  Given his other ideas, I'm pretty sure this has less to do with solving the health crisis than stigmatizing a region he loathes and seeks to punish for their lack of ""gratitude"" for all the wonderful things he's done for them--as in, not."

This is just a patently political idea to help Florida and the Republicans there as well as the Republican governor.  Due to Trump 6 weeks of denials and dithering, America is already showing the most confirmed cases of any country in the world and it is still in the upward phase. On 20 January, 2020 the first case appeared in America and Trump later appeared on TV declaring it would disappear soon.This Trump ""hoax"" seems to be devastating America."

There may be some logical causes like appeasing Florida's governor who fears his spike is not of his own making but rather represents fleeing New Yorkers. But the major reason is completely consistent with what we know of Trump. Cuomo is getting too much good publicity and may well be right in needing 30k ventilators. Its time for distraction and no distraction works as well as blaming NYC for the growth of virus elsewhere. We may see it being called the China/NYC virus. Cuomo has been quite clear that he feels shutting the subway and cabs will be disastrous given the need of medical professionals to get to work. Thus Trumps ""order"" will not affect those, just national guards (or maybe martial law) to post troops on the borders of the much disliked NYC, NJ and CN."

Trump's base needs a wake-up call! Everything we utilize in the world--everything successful or even close to it--is science-based. 

Trump's base must set aside their own fear-based rhetoric to embrace the very thing that makes the can-opener, the kitchen stove, the 4x4 350 what it is and the Husqvarna chainsaw purr. Science, not the magical thinking of hysterical politicians like Trump make the world work.

2020-03-28 21:01,"Interesting, how, the federal government has known this was coming since January 15th and Donald Trump keeps taking actions that are counter productive to stopping the spread, which are conveniently hitting metropolitan areas that voted against him in the election and will again in 2020.  So were already hearing about delayed primaries and him imposing illegal federal quarantine in hot spots which will obviously hinder voters.  

It would seem to me, he stands to benefit this from this electorally if it drags out to November which would possibly explain why he's strategically delayed testing and made it difficult to stop the spread by taking weak actions that are much too late.  Meanwhile, his statements from day to day do little but erode public trust in the federal government he's set out to hollow out and destroy since the day he took his oath."

2020-03-28 21:29,There is a possibility that Trump is referring to his powers through the public health emergency measures available for up to a 90 day period. The Secretary of HHS can declare this emergency under present powers.  There is logic to lawfully quarantine a region of the country in dire circumstances with or without a Governor’s request.

It carries Huge political risks, but potentially rewarding, especially if the numbers start to come down as a result of the natural progression of the virus.

2020-03-28 21:32,"I have a crystal ball. I live in Italy, northern Italy specifically which has been hit hard. I have watched the US make almost every mistake the Italian government and people did here. The difference was that this happened in Italy over several weeks ago. We are in day 17 of a fairly severe lockdown. There are no people partying on beaches or in parks here. 

Our two week lockdown has merely stopped the growth in new cases and has seen them level off. Would the US  accept a similar severe lockdown? And a screeching halt to the economy? I am not sure that two weeks ago they would have, given they had barely a few thousand cases. Italy was once there as well. And now look where we are. And now look where New York is. 

At this point finger pointing is a waste of time. Either shut people in homes or watch the numbers grow exponentially. Like the terminator it doesn’t stop. It’s only programmed to do one thing. Hard choices to be made. Italy is your future unless something is done. And we have seen how this movie ends. We here are living it."
2020-03-28 21:43,New Yorkers are fleeing to Florida and neighboring states and they bringing the virus with them. I understand the fear on both sides (New Yorkers and host states). How effective can this measure be is anyone’s guess. I do know that neighboring states are terrified of New Yorkers causing outbreaks in their communities.
2020-03-28 21:44,"Great idea! That should prevent it from spreading to other states!

Oh wait, there are already 70,000 cases in other states. And none of these are doing as much testing as New York.

This is just Trump setting the stage for blaming New York when other (red or swing state) places will see their numbers climb, rather than having to blame the lack of federal leadership on testing and directives for social distancing.

Yes, we should prevent this from spreading. The way to do that is to enforce social distancing. In New York and everywhere, including Florida. And then it doesn't matter whether that person in Florida originally came from NYC or not (as long as they - and Floridians - effectively practice social distancing)."
2020-03-28 21:51,"Thank you for sharing the state and county level data. It is clear from the data that all states are having a similar exponential increase in cases, so stopping people from traveling state to state would have minimal effect in ""seeding"" new areas since it already everywhere. It might actually help ""flatten the curve"" of impact at the individual city/hotspot level to encourage people to travel away from areas where the hospitals are overwhelmed."
2020-03-28 21:58,"Setting aside the ""Privileges and Immunities"" clause of Article IV of the US Constitution (which allows citizens of one state free travel to another state, among other rights-see below), one state baring another's citizens from entering its state is a war that Rhode Island (who suggests that it will bar NY'ers from coming into its state would lose (both in court and in economics). New York's border runs to the Canadian border (now closed) and to the Atlantic Ocean. So if New York closed its border to everyone else, then New England would be shut off from the rest of the country. That is why the US Constitution specifically bars this conduct. 

As for the federal government locking down a state, that has not been tested and surely would require a court decision (part of the checks-and-balances of the executive by the judiciary). Unfortunately, the judiciary is also shut down these days. 

""The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."""
2020-03-28 22:01,"NY had a study done in 2015 about the need for ventilators in case of a pandemic.
It was recommended that NY purchase 16,000 ventilators to have enough in case of a severe pandemic, like we have now.
The decision was made by the governors administration to not purchase them due to a shortage of qualified personnel to operate them.
Instead of raising taxes or fees to train or cross train the required personnel, they blew the study off.
Now, we have a pandemic that requires about 16,000 extra ventilators for NY and they are not available.
The lack of planning and foresight of the NY government has endangered so many lives now.
Why? Because of money.
This failure, for NY, lies square on the shoulders of Mr. Cuomo."
2020-03-28 21:38,"We have seen quarantines of movement work in China.  My friends in Rome tell me that as soon as they walk outside they get hassled by police ensuring they are only going to the store.  Why don't we do this?  Its insane to me that people who may be sick and not know it can go to LaGuardia and hop a flight to anywhere in the US.  Any area with a massive outbreak, be it New York, California, or anywhere else, should reasonably be forcibly quarantined if it has been proven to work in other countries.  The other option is testing, everywhere, at any time. We know that's not happening."
2020-03-28 21:38,"Since we're being cut-off from the rest of the country, does this mean we don't have to pay federal taxes?"
2020-03-28 21:38,"I think this action President Trump is weighing  serves to highlight the total failure of leadership and planning in the face of this crisis.

On the one hand we have the President saying he's considering quarantining for 14 days people who travel outside the New York metro region, perhaps by driving down I-95. Yet on the other hand, we have the Department of Homeland Security, as reported elsewhere in the New York Times, deciding that people recently evacuated by the US from cruise ships overseas where there were confirmed cases of the virus do not need to be held at government facilities for 14 days quarantine, a couple of days are fine,  before they are let go to travel home on regular commercial aircraft. DHS's apparent reasoning for this is that there is also already community spread of the virus and people will likely get it anyway, so who cares if they let a possibly infected person on a commercial flight?

We desperately need leadership and planning."
2020-03-28 21:48,"It's going Trump's way.  As Katrina partly depopulated New Orleans, COVID-19 will do so to other major cities.  I look for an effort to call off or postpone the election in November, not because it can't be done legally or logistically, but because Trump has no comfortable future outside of the White House.  Meantime, the white supremacists try to go mainstream and the uber-wealthy try to ensure that inequality increases.  Americans should form local networks while we can."
2020-03-28 21:52,"Trump acts like he is a king.  I can’t believe his comments of yesterday have not gotten more attention.  He stands at a podium and tells reporters that he told Mikes Pence not to call back governors who don’t show appreciation.  He has at least twice referred to the governor of Michigan as “that woman.”  Somebody should let Trump know that he works for us.  The taxpayers are paying for all that is being done and he should not be allowed to pick and choose.  Peoples lives are at stake and his only concern is how much credit is he getting and how nice are people treating him.  I am sorry, but this is not normal and should not be tolerated."
2020-03-28 21:53,"Trump’s just mad that most New Yorkers saw through him for decades, and that New York has done great work investigating him. 
He’ll never understand that we’re all in this crisis together and need to take care of each other. It isn’t in his DNA to think that way. 
Thank god for Cuomo. His briefings are the only ones I watch."
2020-03-28 21:53,"I agree with Severino that the Alabama and Washington plans are discriminatory. People with mental retardation, traumatic brain injury or dementia are not necessarily less likely to survive a respiratory illness, and it is clear that whoever made that rule considers such people of less value and less worthy to live. Washington’s rule could apply to all kinds of disabilities, also really  unrelated to the current epidemic. I happen to have a chronic illness that limits my physical energy as well as often causing cognitive impairment, and I am not planning to drink the koolaid of such attitudes. Some people with disabilities are incredible. This is not the way to measure the value of a human life."
2020-03-28 21:42,"The past advice by medical and government officials on the use of masks (no need to wear a mask unless you yourself are infected) was always, to anyone with a grain of common sense, wrong-headed. Now, the big shots in charge are saying ""maybe"" their past advice needs to be reconsidered.

Of course masks do not offer total protection against the COVID-19 virus. Of course there is a shortage of PPE -- and that's the fault of those big shots put in charge of planning for emergencies.  

But it only makes common sense that an N95 mask, if worn properly, along with surgical-type gloves, reduce to some extent the chance for infection if you must go out. Xi Jinping, who almost always wears a mask in public, knows that, and so do most regular Chinese citizens. Visit any major Chinese city and note how many citizens are wearing masks."
2020-03-28 21:53,"Why didn't Trump quarantine Florida and Florida airports during spring break?  Oh, because the state is a swing state?

I'd like to believe that's a plausible theory, that Trump was playing politics, but there's no rhyme or reason to what that man does.  We have a mad emperor leading a pandemic response.  Luckily, some, not all, local officials now understand the severity of the situation and are acting accordingly.

Regardless, I'm living to November to vote for Joe!"
2020-03-28 21:56,Well the entire country needs to be quarantined and acting as though we are in Wuhan in January. But Trump is going to be behind on every reaction to the virus. We need every governor to start enforcing quarantines or we will be stuck in our homes for months.
2020-03-28 21:38,"Donald Trump is clearly overmatched on this one, and if we can't bring cooler heads to bear, this is going to be a very rough ride indeed.  He shows every sign of cracking under the strain of his own intrusive, needless micro-management, which from one day to the next is producing wildly different, kneejerk reactions that can't possibly reflect measured and strategic thinking about the crisis.

It's no pleasure to come to these conclusions--but to me, this country cannot successfully manage the challenges we face unless Trump acknowledges his own incapacity, and turns the keys over to competent managers.  The United States HAS to bring real expertise and ability to its biggest crisis!"
2020-03-28 21:58,"The Coronavirus Pandemic is the biggest challenge for American leadership since WWII.  Trump is a complete failure in this role, and should resign immediately “for health reasons”. No progress can occur if Trump is involved.
Then, President Pence should announce that he is a caretaker president, and immediately appoint a bipartisan commission of senior experts in health, finance, and technology, together with retired political leaders, to address the international crisis.  This Commission should include:
President Obama
President Bush
President Clinton
Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke
Former Fed Chair Janet Yellin
Former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden
NIH Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Tony Fauci
NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins
Health Philanthropist Bill Gates
This Commission should prepare a bipartisan report with a specific plan within 30 days, and it should be endorsed by both Houses of Congress, as well as by the President.  This is the only way to proceed.
But in the real world, we have Trump, and he will not step down voluntarily.  Unfortunately, nothing positive will be accomplished until after Trump leaves office in Jan. 2021.
Let us hope that America and the world can survive till then!"
2020-03-28 21:41,"He’s simply pitting blue states and cities against red. Next? He’ll start threatening Chicago and LA. He doesn't stand a chance of winning those states in November, so why not? Wait for it."
2020-03-28 21:45,"Chaos. That is what this ""leadership"" style promotes. I dealt with this 2 weeks ago, when I had my son in Europe. Presidential address stated that USA was going to start screening incoming flights from Europe. Mass panic, confusion, people booking flights as President speaking (me). Absolute chaos. No coordination. ""Look at me"" aggrandizement. I feel I am living in a Black Mirror episode."
2020-03-28 21:59,He shuts down NY and he basically shuts down the entire US financial markets which is the flip opposite of what he was trying to do in the first place.

2020-03-28 21:48,"In South Korea they had an actual plan. They were serious, methodical and knew what they were doing.
When you saw the people lining up they looked beautiful and purposeful. Everyone was in it together. I have no idea what needs to be done. Except what I do know anything the big fool touches instantly becomes toxic. These big I'm in charge  gestures without any  serious plan or any kind of understanding of much of anything are as ludicrous as they are dangerous.  To totally ignore a looming catastrophe, then make some grand  gesture of being in control are really two sides of the same dangerous coin."
2020-03-28 22:03,"I think Wuhan style quarantine is a good idea.
But it has to happen quickly. Also New Orleans and LA should be taken to a strict quarantine."
2020-03-28 21:45,"To protect our country from corona virus, we must first remove Republicans from office.  Republicans have declared themselves to be the enemies of government, and so our government cannot respond effectively until Republicans are no longer in charge.  It is our job, as American citizens, who value honesty, truth, justice and compassion, to get organized to remove Republicans, who have proved to be dishonest and acting in bad faith."
2020-03-28 21:49,"Why does anyone think this will actually happen? The federal government can't find 40,000 ventilators, but somehow is going to be able to swiftly coordinate & enforce a quarantine on 3 states that have a combined population of 40 million? All this ""tweet"" achieved is scaring folks and ensuring that some will flee to other states (probably in their cars right now!) and bring the coronavirus with them."
2020-03-28 21:43,"There are communities with higher rates of infection (both total and new daily), than the states of NY, CT and NJ.  Aside from the legal and practical problems with this, it's not going to work.  

But it is a wonderful statement that will get all the ignorant people in the Trump cult to adore what a decisive leader he is.  Just like the previous statements from Trump it will give him PR and with Fox news backing him up it doesn't matter that what he says doesn't and never will be connected to reality on the ground.

Asking people to do self-quarantine for 14 days if they come from specific areas with high incidence and high growth rates would be much more effective.  If he had not botched the testing capacity we could even ask for a test of all such travelers to sort out those who need to be put in actual isolation (and not bother the wast majority)."
2020-03-28 21:46,"Trump might just quarantine New York because Cuomo doesn't 'appreciate' Trump.  Trump is on record telling Pence not to communicate with governors who don't appreciate him.  Whatever Trump does, and it is all reactive rather than proactive, he will do after the damage is done and say that others prevented him from doing it earlier, that he knew how bad it was way before anyone else.  He has already gone on record saying that he knew it was a pandemic, when he was saying that it was nothing.  Why doesn't Trump partner with hotel chains to repurpose empty hotels into light care hospitals?  This could be a way to funnel tons of cash into an industry very hard hit.  That way hospitals could continue doing elective and other than coronavirus stuff making money, etc."
2020-03-28 21:53,"If people are fleeing New York City to more sparsely settled areas to avoid the virus, should they be allowed back in when they need New York City’s health care system?"
2020-03-28 22:01,"Trump is running behind the wave.  Much too little, much too late.  It is impossible to quarantine a pandemic if we cannot trace its movement, and we cannot trace its movements because we don't have enough tests. If it was six weeks ago, his actions might have done some good, but he was too busy screaming ""hoax"".  His early inaction and missed opportunities will haunt this nation for decades."
2020-03-28 22:03,Shelter in place. Stay home. That should be the legally enforceable quarantine everywhere.
2020-03-28 22:10,"Trump cannot constrain himself from expressing whatever comes into his head before he’s considered it in a reasonable manner. The virus does not produce significant symptoms for many infected and only relatively mild ones for most people and it can take up to two weeks for those infected to show symptoms. The time one to restrict travelers from the tri-State area was weeks, ago. Now it’s pointless. When it might have helped it would not have been useful to discuss it until it was ready to be implemented because it would have caused people to leave while the leaving was possible."
2020-03-28 22:19,This is a perfect example of how Trump is an expert at turning us against each other. He continues to stoke tensions between red and blue. Trump will never be a unifier.

2020-03-28 22:20,"The other states, particularly the “takers” (the states that receive more money from the federal government than what that same state contributes in federal taxes) should remember that the federal subsidy they have been receiving for a very long time is funded with money from the “givers” (the states that receive less from the federal government than what that same state contributes in federal taxes).  And the “takers” (primarily Southern states by the way), should also remember that New York and Connecticut are among the states that are “givers” so think twice before breaking the country apart in separate casts."
2020-03-28 22:30,"This is good for New York and good for the nation. It slows down the spread of the disease, allows other states to take less drastic measures, and allows resources to be diverted to New York to help people there."
2020-03-28 22:30,"Quarantining the New York region won't stop the spread of the virus, which is already present in virtually all major population and industrial centers. The numbers of infected people will continue to grow exponentially, because that's how the epidemics work. What quarantining the New York region will do is please Trump's base, which is why he's proposing to it. We need to listen to the experts and have a nationwide shutdown."
2020-03-28 22:34,"Will this apply to the 1%ers who are fleeing NYC to their 2nd homes across the globe or are they 'exempt' because of their wealth?  I'm betting the latter, but they won't have to pay taxes because of the massive tax cuts in place for them."
2020-03-28 22:17,"Why is this even up for debate? Just because it's the Trump Administration weighing it?

NYC is the epicenter of a public health crisis. New Yorkers shouldn't be allowed to board trains/planes/automobiles to escape the city and transmit the disease to other enclaves the wealthy tend to flee to.

How can you support social distancing but object to it on a larger scale for NYC?"
2020-03-28 22:16,"The word EMERGENCY means the usual is no longer in place.

I'm already seeing a lot of ""Oh No - you can't do that!"" comments about quarantine.

But 3 weeks later, we will be seeing the same people saying, ""Why did Trump take so long to do that"".

Can't people understand that this is a major emergency, and there is no room for partisan politics, or hind-site powered back seat driving?

When the situation returns to normal, the rules will return to normal."
2020-03-28 22:09,"I don't like this idea of quarantining entire states, which amounts to treating them as leper colonies.  It's both cruel and pointless, since the negligence of the Trump Administration has already permitted this virus to spread throughout the country.  I also notice that Trump only suggests this for blue states that he will lose in November.  Funny how you don't see him suggesting this for Louisiana, which has become a real epicenter for the virus, but which Trump plans on winning.  And he himself said that the quarantine on New York would be partly  in response to complaints from Florida's governor about New Yorkers traveling there.  Florida, of course, is another state that Trump hopes to win in November, so he's anxious to please."
2020-03-28 22:18,"Trump is playing political jiujitsu.

By taking the extreme position and talking about a lockdown on NY, etc., he’s forcing his opponents to fight him and push for opening things up.  Which is what he wants."
2020-03-28 22:29,"Remember when it leaked that Italy was enforcing a quarantine the next day and  everyone set out for their preferred destination that night?

That's what's probably happening in NY, NJ and CT right now with the same disastrous consequences.

The difference -- in the US it's not happening as the result of a leak - Trump is saying it outright."

2020-03-28 22:30,"Trump is not really interested in arresting the virus.  Nearly everything he has done, and not done,  can be understood in the light of his desire to have the virus reach a large enough point that will seem to require drastic political action.  Actions which will lead ultimately to what Trump is really interested in; instituting marshal law.
Some of these moves have already been made:
""As part of proposed legislation being pushed in response to the coronavirus, Trump’s Justice Department has asked Congress to allow the indefinite detention of people during emergencies, according to a Politico report published Saturday.""

2020-03-28 22:28,"Please, if there is anyone reading these comments with any authority, or influence, Mr Trump is desperately ill.  I did not understand all the claims in the last years that he is ""narcissistic"" or otherwise mentally limited.  But his behavior is becoming quite clear during this pandemic: he is very, very, very  (nth degree) ill.  He does not have the authority to call this quarantine, and he is not the source of the rescue checks going to Americans.  The money that runs the government is from American citizens and business, not Mr Trump.  People with his psychosis have suffered some deep psychological wound and cope with it by attacking everything and everyone else.  His attack on the governors in Michigan and Washington - that unless they are nice to him, he will not release essential supplies for Americans' health - is the most clear example of how truly sick he is.  Because the rest of us are reasonably sane, not perfect, but somewhat reasonably sane, we think he has some rational motive for how he acts.   But we are wrong in not recognizing how truly truly truly ill he is.  He should not be allowed to lead anything.  I implore people in leadership to remove him from office and allow more rational and calm leadership to lead this crisis.  I do not want to die for his illness."

This President truly seems determined to undermine or take down our democracy by literally dividing the country (although it makes zero sense) and I’m starting to believe his motives are less personal gain, which initially seemed obvious, but more so an underlying ideology, his or adopted, about how he truly feels the world should play out - which  is immensely frightening because it’s probably beyond tangential. That said,  I have an idea - our states will get through this, even with the lack of help and disdain from our federal government, and will survive for the better, just like nyc did after 9/11 and as a result I’m all for N.Y., CT, and NJ to secede all together. Crazy idea but why not - let our tax money stay here. Let’s fund our own schools, roads and healthcare.

That disconnection is coming from two different fronts.  One front: Trump himself who believes he is the only smart person on Earth and therefore doesn’t need to exchange ideas with anyone, be those scientists or other Presidents or Prime Ministers.  The other front: the rest of the leaders of the free world that already had it with Trump’s uncivilized, uneducated, vulgar, uninformed, rude, repugnant attitude and treatment of them.  Had Trump acted, before and now, as the first Ambassador of the United States, as the President of the United States should always act, Trump would have received valuable advise and information from those that already visited the scenario that Trump is visiting now and will visit in the upcoming weeks and maybe, maybe Trump would have been able to do a slightly better job.  But, since Trump knows the correct answer for every question better, far better than anyone else in the planet, Trump “knew” that the virus was a “hoax” invented by his political opponents to hurt him, Trump “knew” that we will have just two or three cases only."

We ignored the early signs, reacted late, have no health care system with tests, inadequate haz mat suits for our medical staff, let millions of people become unemployed, our youth party during the plague, we let the minimum wage folks with no health insurance serve us while we sit at home protected and with health insurance, and many americans don't comply with common sense rules. (This has nothing to do with Trump.) This is about you and me. 

Let's hope that the corona will help us to change things about ourselves."
2020-03-28 22:33,"Regarding Trump's Kremlin like idea of a blanket quarantine; He cannot quarantine healthy people, only sick people. There is no argument and his idea is the difference between Communist control of lives and American freedom. I'm still waiting for people to be taught how they will stay alive if they self isolate.

Just tell everyone their chances of dying are far greater if they are mingling outside their homes.

The bottom line is Trump has zip credibility in this situation. Please tell the opportunistic society damaging cameras to stay away from Trump. His past messages were harmful to our nation.

We have a medical crisis. We need the medical field running the country. If it was a real estate crisis, then maybe Trump would know what he is doing."
2020-03-28 22:03,"If Trump thinks it would benefit him somehow, he will soon start calling this the ""Cuomo virus""."
2020-03-28 22:27,"Since when are state borders a defence against a pathogen? The state borders are entirely arbitrary. The outbreak in NYC isn’t even the biggest in the US when population and population density are taken into account. The numbers upstate are statistically inconsequential, but a license plate and a zip code are to define rights of movement? This is just a very nasty, corrupt little man seeking new ways to punish states he can never convince to elect him whilst pandering to the worst of those in areas that unaccountably will. He is criminally responsible for the bungling of the Covid-19 crisis. He must be held liable. It’s quite obvious he is again trying to spoil the integrity of an election."
2020-03-28 22:05,"Trump would love to quarantine—and economically damage—three blue states.  Not only that, he will also withhold aid from them. They will never vote for him so he doesn’t care about their welfare. Worse, he wants to inflict damage and take his reprehensible revenge on them for being blue.  This unAmerican conduct is what a dictator would do. Not an elected President. 

If the three states were Mississippi, Alabama, and Kentucky, he would not even be considering a quarantine. 

I expect Trump to find a way to extend blue state quarantines past Election Day in November. Having the Russians interfering with the election is small potatoes compared to what Trump is no doubt planning."
2020-03-28 22:39,"After just 450 cases were reported, India put the country on lockdown, grounding all flights for at least 3 weeks. Despite the complications with such an extreme measure, it was intended to stop the spread of the virus.  If the US was serious about flattening the curve, wouldn't  we be restricting travel for everyone, in all states? It seems, singling out NY, NJ, and CT would be largely symbolic...to further vilify northeastern, liberal ""elites"" as ""infecting"" the country."
2020-03-28 21:44,"everything Trump has said since long before his Russia backed election to the presidency until now serves one purpose, to bring the US to civil war. It serves one person, Vladimir Putin. It is Putin's payback for the fall of the Soviet Union. What is in it for Trump? Trying to put those who didn't vote for you under some type of military dictatorship ---- now that oughta do it."
2020-03-28 22:39,"My thoughts are that Trump will try to put restrictions on states/areas where he isn't liked or doesn't get the votes.  He doesn't want New Yorkers coming down to Florida?  Of course not, those are his diehard supporters down there and he spends most of his time there.  Florida just confirmed 500 new cases of the virus.  Why would anyone want to go there?  Except for our Canadian snowbirds who spend money down there for months as a time and are now scrambling to get back for their free health care.  Trump will do anything and everything to protect the red states because he needs their votes.  A few less elitist or leftist leaning Democrats is of no concern to him.  Maybe if they are all sick, they won't make it to the polls in November....but can't have him infecting members of his base."
2020-03-28 21:36,"The Feds are out of their league on this, they should team up with Nintendo and create a Pokemon Go like game to catch fleeing New Yorker's. Gotta catch them All!"
2020-03-28 22:28,"A day late and a dollar short.

Any lockdown of the New York area should have taken place weeks ago. Probably around the time of the New Rochelle lockdown. As things stand, we are going to see viral eruptions in Long Island, the Hamptons--and especially in Florida."
2020-03-28 22:41,"And once again, Trump focuses on the wrong issue. He finally enacted the DPA aimed at GM, but not to other manufacturers. GM didn’t even know he ordered it on Friday. Why isn’t he treating it like his bankruptcy litigation? Only our nation’s population & livelihood is at risk."
2020-03-28 22:10,"Every day he suggests crazy things, this morning it was that he would gag the overseer of the stimulus funds, today it’s martial law in NY, NJ, Conn, tomorrow it’ll be nuking NYC from space, on and on. What you have to be vigilant about, by reading the NYT perhaps, is what he’s not saying, and what he’s doing under the table. That hidden agenda is most dangerous, proving exactly what Bernie said: Trump is the most dangerous President in the history of the USA."
2020-03-28 21:53,"What New Yorker of means is going to stay put now and try to help their communities? They've either already fled to FL, CA, NC, MA, or the like, or they're heading out tonight based on Trump's message. It's a poor person's problem now in NY. Remember Trump telling us he could walk down 5th Ave, shoot people, and still be loved? He'll just let the weakest die, as he believes they deserve to. And he knows they can't fight back. He's not stupid and this is his chance to flex. PS, to those of you leaving, say goodbye to your stuff. There will be looting."
2020-03-28 21:53,It’s too late but we must acknowledge that our president is a total incompetent and nothing he does now will help.  Period.
2020-03-28 22:21,"Reading the comments it sounds like NY folks now think quarantining is a bad idea.

Why this sudden change of mind?  
Oh, let me guess: because Trump thinks quarantine is a good idea."
2020-03-28 22:27,"It has the optics of blaming NYC because governor Cuomo  is getting good ratings. It's about as good an idea as spending billions to build a wall on the Mexican border, or replacing a Pandemic Response team with the Space Force. ie. it's all show and zero science"
2020-03-28 22:33,"Trump doesn't want New Yorkers going to FL.  He's also trying to stick it to Cuomo over the ventilators, make him look bad."
2020-03-28 22:03,"Trump and Kushner are a couple of shady real estate guys with no qualifications to manage a Pandemic. Their utter arrogance and ignorance has turned a very difficult hard to deal with pandemic into an out of control disaster. Previous administrations have dealt with AIDS, SARS, Ebola and developed techniques and processes managed by the federal government working with the private sector.

Despite what Trump says his administration has done about as a poor of a job as is possible. Trump is railing on governors and withholding supplies and support because the governors aren’t deferential enough to him."
2020-03-28 21:54,"There is absolutely no doubt on my mind that Trump has a very substantive volume of blood on his hands because of his ego and ignorance; blood of fellow Americans.  Trump, the Commander-in-Chief of our country, didn't create the enemy for sure but Trump neglected his duty as Commander-in-Chief by lying to his troops telling them that the enemy didn't exist, that the enemy was the macabre invention of fifth columnists that wanted to hurt him.  Now is too late Trump!"
2020-03-28 21:07,So you’re get people going door to door to breathe on other people and get breathed on in a time of self-isolation as you try to limit contact?
2020-03-28 22:43,"I live about halfway between NYC's two airports, in Queens, which has possibly the highest concentration of coronavirus cases on the planet at the moment. It amazes me to think that flights are coming and going even as I type. We have this ""shutdown,"" but there are a thousand exceptions and while pedestrian and vehicle traffic out my window are down, I'd say it's only by 50%. Today I had no choice but to venture out ... there was a significant wait in the bank, which had just been scrubbed and had quarantined its regular staff ... everybody stood several feet apart in line and were wearing masks ... had to shop, and they were just letting two or three people in at a time. I see people taking care, but hard to say whether it is enough. So I also have a plane ticket for April 7, bought in November. No way am I flying, but some might, especially since the airline is still clinging to its $125 fee to ""redeposit"" the miles I used for the ticket.  Think the country has a good way to go before you could say it is dealing seriously with this."
2020-03-28 21:08,Oh if we can’t get them protective gear and tests let’s keep the trucks that deliver food out.
2020-03-28 22:28,It's amazing how fast socialism gets popular when the fate of the stock market depends on it.
2020-03-28 22:10,"All New Yorkers need to remember that the Governor of Florida does not want New Yorkers in their time of need. Snow Birds, remember that when you spend your money in Florida. Boycott Florida after the quarantine."
2020-03-28 21:36,"The cat is already out of the bag.  Where do you think all the tourists to New Orleans and Florida beaches went?  Back to AL, GA, Miss and Texas.  In three weeks their governors will be scrambling and will be behind the eight ball. You cal wall off NY but that will not stop the virus.  Stay home, wash hands and expand testing"
2020-03-28 22:14,Trump wants to get everyone out and working beginning on Easter.  And he wants to quarentine New York.  But he won't help New York.   Aren't these contradictory plans?    Has anyone else noticed this?
2020-03-28 22:46,A somber reminder that a country should be as much prepared  for a pandemic as it should be prepared for war. The underlying reality is that we’re reacting and improvising while the virus continues its march.
2020-03-28 21:19,"If the president and the Florida governor want to play that game, then this summer when Florida people want to escape the unbearable heat and humidity in Florida, New York will test arrivals for tropical parasites and other tropical diseases before they are admitted to New York.
New York can either establish inspection stations in Florida or quarantine stations at the New York airports, train stations, bridges and tunnels."
2020-03-28 22:17,"The entire country needs to be shut down. This means NO air travel and no trains. NO interstate driving either. The only persons that should be traveling right now are people delivering food, supplies and medical care. A quarantine on NY is ridiculous. The man in the WH doesn't get it - the cat is out of the bag. Time to shut the entire country down."
2020-03-28 21:37,"This is a blatant populist tactic: Blame the other. In order to throw cover to his horrendous mismanagement of this crisis, he looks for scapegoats. In the past, the other was caravans; Mexican rapists; the Chinese; the media. He has now set his sights on demonizing people in the urban centers of the northeast. People whom [he contends] spread this to several parts of the country. People who, incidentally, did not vote for him. Trump's actions are not, those of an American president. His actions are more akin to the tin-pot dictators of old."
2020-03-28 22:38,For Trump all that counts is getting re-elected. Fighting the virus which he thinks is another type of flu is just a sideshow to his political ambition. A Republican Governor of Florida wants to keep out NYers and folks from NJ and Connecticut. This is a state that Trump must win.By contrast New York is heavily Democratic and is led by a powerful governor who could potentially be Trump’s opposition. The merit of the quarantine and its legality do not Influence Trump.Trump believes it helps him in Florida. Ergo here comes Quarantine.
2020-03-28 22:37,"I absolutely loathe Trump and most everything he has ever said and done but honestly I do not understand why this idea is so terrible.  If isolation is the key to prevention and spread of the disease wouldn’t a short term lock down of the worst hit spot make sense?  Everyone said we would be unable to accomplish the results of China through a draconian lockdown, but I am fearful our patchwork, state by state, 1/2 in 1/2 out approach is not quite enough.  Rip the bandaid off."
2020-03-28 22:28,"This is Trump's payback for governors not showing their ""appreciation"" of him.  If things are so honky-dory, Mr. Trump should go back out on the campaign trail and let all of his minions come to his rallies.  From Trump's daily photo ops, he doesn't believe in social distancing.  He puts his hangs all over the microphone and has his doctors and staff standing shoulder to shoulder behind him.  This president all about what's good for him and retribution is good for him."
2020-03-28 21:37,This should have been done ten to fourteen days ago. Better late than never.
2020-03-28 21:13,Can't this guy think of any way to solve a problem other than building walls?
2020-03-28 20:58,"So, ""pro-life"" trump country would rather start eliminating those they consider “life unworthy of life” than to pressure their ""president"" to use his executive powers--which he could, that's what Executive Orders and War Powers are--to increase medical production and medical services.  Are there no Christians in Alabama, just trumpsters?  God forbid they should offend dear leader; better to start down the slippery slope of determining who deserves to live and who doesn't."
2020-03-28 22:36,As my old Dad would have said about a guy like trump - he’s a real piece of work.
2020-03-28 22:25,Republicans are fine with insisting on repealing health care for girls and women (no abortion even for incest) but are fine with Not providing care to seniors and people with disabilities.  Nice.
2020-03-28 22:26,"Trump, the Commander-in-Chief of our country, didn't create the enemy for sure but Trump neglected his duty as Commander-in-Chief by lying to his troops telling them that the enemy didn't exist, that the enemy was the macabre invention of fifth columnists that wanted to hurt him.  Now is too late Trump!"
2020-03-28 23:02,"Quarantining N.Y., CT and NJ hotspots, sadly, is the only acceptable thing to do.  

This is also needed around the country, as it can improve appropriate hospital supply transit hubs and position faster distribution lines to small rural areas.  

Additionally, these hubs are needed for distribution and providing care to essential workers, the front lines who’ve been ignored, such as taxi, rideshare and delivery drivers, as well as medical support personnel and volunteers in training.  Think of these also as potential hubs for innovation.   

If the response isn’t going to get serious now, plan on spending trillions over and over each time this happens.  Very large emergencies will happen again."
2020-03-28 22:40,"What Trump is really thinking.....""Perfect. Finally, an opportunity. They didn't vote for me. They don't like me. Hillary lives there. Now, I get to lock 'em up.""

What Trump forgot to think about....Equities markets are going to crash on Monday morning.

What Trump's friends and family didn't forget to think about....Preparing in advance for more short sales of stocks on Monday. You see, Trump ran the idea of quarantining the New York metro area by his ""family and friends team"" yesterday to see if they liked it. Of course, they knew that he had already made up his mind.

What Trump also forgot to think about.....The Trump Organization is headquartered in Manhattan.....On the other hand,....Or maybe not. Trump people are exempted. All will be free to travel anywhere, as required."
2020-03-28 22:44,"The problem is people aren't going into quarantine.  

They think quarantine means they can stop at the stores, gas station, go to bank, hang out with their friends, go the dog park and hang out, etc.

Quarantine means NO CONTACT. You can go into your yard, or take a walk or run or bike AWAY from everyone, but that it is.

I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but I find it more than suspicious that the most liberal states are the hardest hit.  Trump's failure to respond since January it directly related what states are asking for help."
2020-03-28 22:45,Enforcing a quarantine at this point when things have already gotten out of control obviously makes little to no sense.  What this does indirectly tell other states with blooming cases of covid is to not test for the disease (on the level like NY did - hence the highest levels of the virus) or else their states and local economies will face a similar threat of federal mandated quarantine.
2020-03-28 23:00,I fail to see a real difference between China’s  slow initial response to COVID-19 and Trump’s underwhelming assessment of the danger to the United States other than that attributable to pots and kettles.
2020-03-28 23:02,"If it’s needed, I’d rather the Federal Government set up such a quarantine among the states than the hodgepodge actions of states like Florida, Texas and Rhode Island.  States don’t have the power, most probably including the legal power, nor the practical wherewithal to effectively pull something like this off.  

Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution (the “Commerce Clause”) gives Congress the sole power to regulate commerce among the States.  Way back in in 1824, the commerce clause was so interpreted and upheld by the Supreme Court, in “Gibbons vs. Ogden,” with John Marshall writing for the Court in a unanimous decision at the time.  States only have the power to regulate commerce that is solely within the state."
2020-03-28 22:41,"I just watched Gavin Newsom answer questions live submitted by reporters. It was like an oral exam.  He had a remarkable grasp of detailed figures and statistics related to this crisis and California’s response to it. 
Nothing partisan about it, just what we need and should expect to hear to inspire confidence that plans are being made to address things as best as possible. 
As with a patient heading into cancer surgery and chemotherapy, we anticipate suffering, but we want to know that everything possible is being done to give the best chance of coming out the other end."
2020-03-28 23:02,"Today, there are 63,478 cases between New York and New Jersey. The total population of both states is 27.75 Million people. That means there is one person out of every 437 that are infected. Trump can't justify a quarantine of all those healthy people because of the minority. I'm guessing we are all victims of a battle of the network stars, Trump and Cuomo."
2020-03-28 22:40,"Trump appears to be unable to think about this pandemic except in terms of borders. But the virus is already in every state, and it is capable of spreading regardless of such measures."
2020-03-28 22:42,What we are seeing is the breakdown of civil society. It is the most fateful crisis in American  history.
2020-03-28 22:43,"Wow. Trump has gotten his wish. Even coronavirus is helping him achieve his aims of getting rid of people he feels aren't worthy contributors to society. I'm starting to wonder if our medical equipment shortages are intentional. I do not believe that our federal government is unable to order masks, gowns, test kits, and ventilators shipped to medical teams. Where is this equipment? It obviously can be made and shipped. So why isn't it?"
2020-03-28 22:44,"We all knew and expected Trump to react in exactly the way that he did. But NONE of the states did much to prepare themselves. Even with experts warning for several weeks. Sure, Gov. Cuomo seems like the better leader compared to Trump, but the fact that he didn’t give the “Shelter in Place” nearly 10 days after SF did is just terrible decision-making. Especially since NYC is by far the densest place in the US, he should’ve been leading the efforts to mitigate the spread. Looking at how he called “Shelter in place” as a violation of American rights is just cringe-worthy. I feel so bad for all my friends in NY - this country’s (and this administration’s) priorities with the economy over human life is so sad to witness."
2020-03-28 22:54,"That pesky Republican Governor of Florida and that inadequately progressive Democratic Governor of Rhode Island are both already taking substantive measures to block access for New Yorkers trying to enter their states.  And as the Times itself has reported, many areas around the country are also trying to turn away those looking to flee to less urban environs.  So it seems that Trump is not terribly out of synch with much of the US on this, and many in fact do not think that restriction of travel from a documented hot zone is problematic.  However, from reading the comments, it seems that many NYers and urban types would prefer endangering others over agreeing with Trump."
2020-03-28 22:49,"If we're going to go somewhere as extreme as a quarantine of NYC, then we might as well go further and enforce a nationwide stay-at-home order for 1 month.  Sure it would kill the economy.  But we can resurrect an economy.  We can't resurrect people."
2020-03-28 22:53,Some many sad stories all around. Nor being able to be there to care for the people you love. Not being there to pay your last respect. Then you have those dying in absolute solitude. This is as sad as it gets.
2020-03-28 23:02,"I dedicate this poem to all those affected by this pandemic. Hang in there and keep fighting. 

“The ship of my life may or may not be sailing on calm and amiable seas. The challenging days of my existence may or may not be bright and promising. Stormy or sunny days, glorious or lonely nights, I maintain an attitude of gratitude. If I insist on being pessimistic, there is always tomorrow. Today I am blessed.” 

Maya Angelou"
2020-03-28 22:52,"Everything Trump says and does, it’s done in the light of the re-election.
He is now bashing NY, NJ, CT for “spreading the plague” and bringing it to Florida. It is obvious that is goal is to gain a few votes in Florida sacrificing NY, NJ, CT where he already knows he is not getting any. 
The real problem is that testing was done too late, and still we are not testing enough.
Do you think Florida is safe? Let me tell you. It is not, they are just not testing enough! Once all will be said and done I expect Florida to count the most casualties, due to the high percentage of senior population."
2020-03-28 22:54,"What Governor Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island is doing does not seem right in my opinion.
Going door to door, looking for New Yorkers, allowing people to be stopped and questioned simply because they have a NY license plate does not seem okay. 
How is this constitutionally allowed?"
2020-03-28 22:53,"Trump announces he might order a quarantine of New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.  How many 10's of thousands are now packing up to skedaddle because this ill-advised 'warning' of the use of a potential tool in the fight to contain the virus?  The complete lack of foresight displayed by the White House continues to be simply staggering."
2020-03-28 22:57,"I'm not a fan of Trump and his early comments on the virus were not what I wanted to hear , but I'm fair minded enough to realize that there were gov't officials at HHS & the CDC working furiously behind the scenes. 
  
The media and many others love to pile on and blame Trump for the outbreak and shortages , but don't want to say that there is plenty of blame to go around. How about just a few examples:

- Late Jan, when Trump bans travel from China, Joe Biden accuses Trump of xenophobia
 - Feb 2nd, NYC Health Comm "" The risk to New Yorker's from the virus is low, no reason not to take the subway or bus, go to restaurants and bars and the parade.
  - Feb 2, State Sen Lu - "" no need to panic or avoid activity
  - Feb 2 , State Sen Brian Cavanaugh encouraging people to go to Chinatown to celebrate the Chinese new year “the media have been covering this issue as if it’s a terrible plague”
 - March 2nd, Bill de Blasio – “I’m encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives and get out on the town”
 - March 11th – Bill de Blasio “If you’re not sick, go about your daily activities” 

And now these same leaders are blaming Trump (and by extension everyone on his team) , but ignoring their comments and behavior."
2020-03-28 23:03,"Lots of people are complaining about Trump, and while he deserves a lot of blame, we should also criticize the Chinese government. I must say not the people, but the government specifically since they lied as much as possible about the impact of this disease. If the world knew the truth about this disease from the start, we would have prepared. The reason why so many flout the countermeasures and why we do t have enough equipment is because the Chinese government said “it’s fine, we’ve locked down the outbreak centers and almost no one died”. As a result the world was put in a false sense of security to placate the Chinese government’s desire for population control. This highlights the severity of misrepresenting situations by autocratic governments around the world."
2020-03-28 23:03,"Right, Mr. Trump, and why not throw in California and Washington State to quarantine?  Or how about Michigan and Louisiana?  Once again Donald Trump is misusing his executive powers.  One would think that if he were really concerned about the people he is supposed to lead, that if he had any compassion at all for the sick and dying from COVID-19, he would have ordered without hesitation much needed ventilators and PPE for our health care professionals on the front lines.  And yet his base refuses to see or accept the follies of his ways.  He does not care about the health of his people.  He only cares about himself.  When on earth will this nation understand that?"
2020-03-28 22:53,"This isn't going to happen.

Trump is probably upset that Cuomo  is getting so much attention and good press. And that the attention has moved away for him today.

We all know he is that petty and a big baby."
2020-03-28 22:53,"Trump makes policy on the fly.  It's why his base, in their ignorance, regard as him being ""authentic.""  No consulting with experts, especially with any science background.  Media gives him all the oxygen he wants.  Yet, public health policy cannot be created on the fly. He's responding to impulse.  He doesn't know what he's doing."
2020-03-28 23:03,Anything that stops the spread of the coronavirus should be utilized.  This virus is spreading like wildfires and we must not make it worse.  People traveling from state to state may be taking the virus with them and infecting others.  New York has had the most cases and people are afraid.  More people have died.  Let’s give it a try and if it does not make a difference then we can stop.  Nothing ventured nothing gained.

2020-03-28 23:11,"Before they passed away, I took care of my elderly parents who lived on Cape Cod. Have you ever been to the emergency room at Cape Cod Hospital during just normal times? I doubt they are prepared for large numbers of people that might suddenly flood the hospital (singular). What's more, Cape Cod merchants depend on large numbers of summer tourists, who eat out, go shopping all over the place, and stay in hotels. They're now telling second home owners not to come to their homes, but perhaps they should start thinking more about how they are going to deal with the influx of summer tourists and the ramifications of that."
2020-03-28 23:14,How would the federal government enforce this order without the cooperation of the states? Bring in the army?
2020-03-28 23:14,"This is always with Trump too little and too late.
A national lock up policy will have mild mitigation effects. But the viral pandemic will only end when there is herd immunity and widespread vaccination.
This involves not only the entire country but in a modern global  economy the entire world.
This may take months or even more than a year.
Testing must be much more extensive. The question needs to be asked  what percentage of COVID exposed  patients do the diagnosed positive COVID cases  represent. It may be that 50000 confirmed cases actually represent as many as 500000 people 
which is a frightening thought indeed!"
2020-03-28 23:16,"I was texting family members three weeks ago telling them I think we should be shutting down airports and putting state police/national guard checkpoints on interstates to slow down domestic travel and contain the spread.  They thought I was overreacting despite their concerns about the virus.

Now, states are starting to do that and it is probably too late for it to make much of a difference."
2020-03-28 23:18,"I was quarantined when I was eight years old. My younger sister had been taken to Hamitt Hospital in Pittsburgh and diagnosed with polio.￼ 

The town constable and a policeman came to our house and posted a sign on the front door that we were not to leave and that no one was to enter our home. We were - myself and my 14-year-old sister.

I remember it well. We lived in a small rural town in north western Pennsylvania and we were treated with fear."
2020-03-28 23:18,"I would appreciate any advice on which hospitals in Manhattan would be the best to go to in the event of needing treatment related to the coronavirus, and how one can guard against the risk of being transferred (or, if possible, how one can refuse to be transferred) to a public hospital or to a less desirable hospital. I have seen the makeshift hospital in the Javits Center and would certainly not want to be there or to have any of my relatives there."
2020-03-28 23:19,"Just because Trump says his plan will not affect trade ""in any way"" doesn't make it the most accurate way to cover the story. 

If I have an empty glass labeled ""Perfect Plan"" and I tip it over above a bowl of water, it's true that I did not affect the bowl of water in any way. But, if the bowl of water is toxic and I'm the president of bowls of water, it's probably fair to emphasize the emptiness of my ""perfect plan."" The take away isn't ""Details of perfect plan remain unclear, but plan author says it in no way will increase toxicity"" it's ""president's plan fails, water still toxic."" 

Trade is already disrupted. The economy is already upended. He should be affecting trade! When you're the president, inaction counts at least as much as action. Whether the best plan is to disrupt movement including trade or let trucks keep on trucking, he should be the manager of this crisis and nothing he does can accurately be described as having no impact."
2020-03-28 23:24,"Problem here is, this is purely Trump trying to upstage Cuomo after heaps of praise and admiration for Governor Cuomo's straight talk and administrative efficiency and compassion. 

 There may be a need to quarantine the tri state area or make other critical decisions - but it should come from the joint governors, not the flip flopping president who hasn't gotten through one announcement without backing and filling and spreading chaos and bad information."

His proposal to quarantine New York and New Jersey essentially is a move to draw attention away from those states, and especially from Governor Cuomo. His narcissism is a force that demands the spotlight must be on him."
2020-03-28 23:04,"Too, too Trumpian.

Ideation of a ""solution"" chasing a problem (or monofocus on one aspect of a larger situation), then threatening to use a non-existent power to achieve it, with the threat itself  being used like a tom turkey's fighting feathers to show he's the BOSS.

And of course, aiming it at three states whose Democratic  governors have been competent in the crisis  lets Trump show that he OUTRANKS them, particularly Gov. Cuomo.

If this served a legitimate public health purpose, Trump wouldn't be ""weighing"" it; the respective governors would be discussing it with the CDC, their own health officials,  and such action would be jointly decided and announced as it happened.

Really shameful way to enemize states against each other."

All this pain caused by the whim of President Trump, with his throw away narcissistic way of thinking. There are real people at the end of these whims, real lives, hopes, dreams, and sadly fears. Our President does not care for the people of this country. To say that he lacks empathy, is a joke unto itself. Sorry New York.

2020-03-28 22:55,"In early March, the college our son attends in NYC shut down and sent everyone home. He and his girlfriend have been with us ever since. None of us are sick, and we have been successfully self-isolating. Today, Trump throws another wrench into the works by announcing a quarantine for the tristate area, and the girlfriend's parents, who are in full-on panic mode thanks to Trump's announcement, are demanding that she return home immediately, before the quarantine goes into effect. She doesn't want to get on an airplane, possibly exposing herself, only to fly back to a hot spot and have to be quarantined alone. But her mother insists, because Trump's declarations are freaking her out. We don't want to put her on an airplane, when she is safe here, where there is less density and no reason to rub shoulders with strangers. I wish Trump would just shut up, so we can continue to shelter in place in peace! Every time he opens his mouth, more confusion and worry ensues. It's a hoax, it's not a hoax; those fifteen cases will be at zero soon; we can open the country by Easter; nobody needs 30,000 ventilators -- wait, we need 30,000 ventilators, why aren't they making them ... the list of contradictions and obfuscating statements is endless. Just take away his tweet machine and put Trump in media quarantine, already."
2020-03-28 22:50,"Of course Trump is saying he wants to quarantine New York! It plays to his red state base, trying to blame the spread of the virus on liberal NYC. But it’s already spread to every state, weeks ago now. They’ll see the cases spike soon, just as Seattle, Northern California, and NYC did. 

Most obviously, people should self-quarantine if they leave NYC. And Cuomo has been saying that since the beginning. Unfortunately, it’s once again the most affluent with their second homes and travel options, who think the rules don’t apply, along with locals fear of “the outsiders”: first Chinese, now New Yorkers, that are coming into play here."

PLEASE ignore him."
2020-03-28 23:51,"First, what an awful way for Trump to announce a drastic measure.  Governors of NY, NJ, & CT were not part of any conversation. 
Second,  I don't trust the motives behind the quarantine of 3 democratic states that have been vocal in criticism of Federal lack of policy.  It would not be beneath him to hit back at what he sees as lack of support from all of us who work for him (in his mind).
Third, probably best to ignore it until he gets the news cycle attention and photo op that he wanted at which time he will tack in a different direction."

Showmanship aside, he drags his feet on giving places like New York federal help, but shoots his mouth off about a China-style quarantine because his base in Kentucky or Kansas are worried about blue state germs. Even the aid package comes out more as a red state bribe. $1200 is of limited help to people in expensive big cities, but stretches farther in rural areas where there may not even be a lockdown on businesses."

2020-03-28 23:08,"While there is a lack of work on the subject, I hypothesize that there may be two or or strains of COVID-19. One strain originated in China and may be less deadly and cause weaker symptoms. The other strain may have emerged in Italy and is a bit more deadly and aggressive. I think the US was hit by the weaker strain first, and now we are starting to really feel the affect of the more lethal strain. I am sure a scientist somewhere may have found something like this out already, but hasn’t published it yet."
2020-03-28 23:25,"This looks like a fairly transparent act of partisan politics. Trump needs to win states like Florida and Pennsylvania and will never win the three states he wants to quarantine, NY, NJ, and CT. I live in northwestern NJ and can tell you that all of the talk in eastern PA is about keeping NJ and NY residents out. There are calls for closing the Delaware River bridges, and others calling for cars with NJ and NY plates to be pulled over and told to return to their home states. I live close enough to the PA border that my doctors and even the place I get my haircut is over the border. I often shop in PA and there has been comments I’ve heard that no one with out of state plates should be allowed to buy supplies from PA stores. Even talking about quarantine (which I assume means we are not allowed to leave our states) is very popular in PA right now. NJ and NY residents gets blamed for every crime and every piece of trash on PA roads. Trump is earning support in eastern PA counties like Pike, Wayne, and Monroe, which he needs to win to win PA in the fall."

Also, we're still very dependent on food industries, to truck food to grocery stores, food handlers and stockers as well as grocery store staffs.  They should definitely be getting protective gear as well as health care workers.  

Really, nothing systematic is being thought out, or so it seems.  Just Trump reacting after the horse has left the barn.  He seems to be hogging the conversation.  Wish we had a panel, that does not include him, to provide coordination, giving updates as needed.  This panel would have national emergency powers.  Too much needless political bickering dragging us down, too much favoritism for wealthy or special interest groups.  Trump not good for us at all."
2020-03-28 23:17,"Why is Governor Cuomo still resiting stricter lockdown?  Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Cuomo are trying too hard to make their political point and risking the lives of people. When President Trump says a word it does not have a conventional meaning to it. We have learned that all along. When Trump says ""Quarantine NY"", he does not mean total isolation. It just means stricter lockdown. We can shut down the stock market for 2 months and shut down all of NY and other places for 2 months. We will be better off with that amount of shutdown than what coronavirus would do to us."
2020-03-28 23:38,"I have heard Trump-voters complain about how many New Yorkers are fleeing the city and spreading contagion everywhere else.  I wondered about what sort of point that was supposed to make and now realize there is some kind of specific connection.  It's too late, baby."

Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on CNN talking about the need to be able to obtain resources like ventilators from states not yet hard-hit to places like New Orleans (which may be at crisis level by Thursday).  Given that Florida’s Republican governor Rick DeSantis seems to have had some role in triggering this notion of a Greater NY quarantine, I’m fearful that Trump is going to show that what is behind his remarks about how to treat governors who are not singing his praises endlessly.  Is this the beginning of a move by Trump to divert resources from blue states to red states?"
2020-03-28 23:17,"President Trump titilates the masses by hinting at quarantines with no mention of timelines or details and without so much as a peep of outreach to the three governors involved.

This way, of course, he squanders any prospect of cooperation, and sets up another fault line pitting regions against other regions when common planning and effort is so critically needed.

Into this toxic mix he injects his self-absorbed pique, refusing even to speak with other crucial political players who question his political decisions."
2020-03-28 23:17,"There can be no such thing as a real lockdown when truckers, essential workers, and healthcare workers must come and go. Social distancing and self quarantines must be adhered to in every community in the US with the guidance of local governments. This is the only way, not pitting communities and states against each other."
2020-03-28 23:43,"The virus has it’s own schedule and path. Aggressive, widespread testing with fast results is the only way for any city, county, state, or region to know what to do next.

2020-03-28 23:07,"This is what Trump does. He announces that he's going to announce something non-specific at some time in the future. Then he doesn't do it. 

Still waiting for that nationwide Google testing website he made up.

And that ""amazing"" replacement plan for Obamacare.

And the release of his tax returns to closed sessions of Congressional committees.

Some are so gullible they actually believe that if he says he's ""thinking about"" doing something, he's actually done it. They're now learning the hard way that reality persists, no matter what Donald Trump says he ""believes."""

Why do these people feel that they have the right to endanger fellow Americans?"

He is silencing the governors who have stolen the spot light from him as he has silenced Dr. Fauci and turned the so called pandemic response team into another arm of the re-election campaign.

Joe Biden needs to be careful not to over step but there is only so much longer he can remain in his basement before Trump has, through the force of personality alone (and the obsequious, obligatory, free 24/7 media coverage) flips this entire narrative and resumes his bid for a 40 state landslide re-election even with 22% unemployment and the Dow at 2008 recession levels."

I think that we all should decouple our religious and political assumptions from our scientific thoughts ( if we are capable of having those).
I would though trust group of scientific experts like Dr Fauci to enlighten me what options we have. Let's be serious, we are at the damage control level, not containment anymore!"
2020-03-28 23:18,"So the governor of Florida is concerned about NY and NJ residences coming down to Florida. Interesting that he's concerned now, but had no problem with the spring break students coming down. Is that because they brought more revenue into the hotels and bars than the more senior residents of NJ and NYC will bring now? In addition it seems like Trump is more concerned with guaranteeing states with a predominately democratic  population.
Exactly how does he plan on enforcing it? Will there be national guardsmen stationed at the border checkpoints? How about supplying more test stations to give all citizens the covid-19 tests instead so we really know how widespread this virus is and then act accordingly?"
2020-03-28 23:37,"It is completely unclear how he will accomplish this, or be able to enforce this plan.  There are reasonable restrictions on the deployment of federal troops within the borders of the United States, and for very good reason.  There are 2 relevant laws that come to mind that he would have to consider

Posse Comitatus Act; federal troops cannot enforce laws within borders of the United States unless the Insurrection Act is relevant, OR by act of congress.

Insurrection Act; Federal troops may be used to enforce state laws IF the state government is unable to enforce them (and other conditions are met, epidemic is explicitly mentioned).  The wording is very clear that violence or oppression is necessary for this act to be relevant.  ""... any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law...""

If federal troops are deployed to enforce a quarantine it is unclear how this can be pursued legally.  I encourage you all, and the NYT to follow this situation carefully because we could be stepping precipitously into illegal, immoral and unconstitutional waters."

We don't have national healthcare, most of us live paycheck to paycheck, and there is little in the way of a social safety net for those in need (and no, $1200 does not cut it for most people). The solutions offered by those in charge are very binary. You're either left or right. Yes or no. Most of the world is not binary. Answers to big problems are not simply defined by being a Democrat or Republican and following the appropriate mantra. There are many of us who want change. We want a kinder society. One where we care for each other, where the government supports its citizens (and not just the corporations) and we know they have our back. The USA in 2020 is a cold, hard Hunger Games reality."
2020-03-28 23:57,"This is Trump's fault. He never thinks ahead and plans. He doesn't believe in science. And so his reaction to this when it first started was, Nothing to worry about. Then he didn't do anything to help the states with needed medical supplies. He invoked the wartime act but never used it. All he and his followers care about is his precious stock market. While the economy is important, human life is more important. And he lies so much you really can't believe what he says."
2020-03-29 0:02,"A clever move on Trump's part. This way he can play to his base -- he can blame the spread of Covid-19 on Democrats Cuomo and de Blasio and put the onus of blame on a state that will never vote for him.  This shifts the focus from the red states where cases are growing now at a fast rate.  

All this to deflect focus on the real problem -- the failure to ramp up testing.   If we could test, we could then know the full scope of the problem.  Instead, the issue of the shortage of tests has been left behind.  Trump's strategy is to shift the focus from the real issues.  This may serve his political ends but it means more people die."

This failed leader did not heed the warnings of national intelligence and he has put us all at risk while also wrecking havoc to our financial lives.

It’s supposed to be antisocial. Cuomo has already failed NYC by not shutting everything down earlier. That’s why NYC has 30,000 cases. 

In comparison, Hong Kong, which faced this earlier with a similar population that shares a land border with China has only 300 cases.  Results matter. Cuomo is 100X worse

But boy, mention the stock market and the economy, he's suddenly all ears, aggressive and taking almost overnight decisions and actions to secure HIS wealth and that of others in his backyard.

His priorities have always been about money and the stock market.  This Covid-19 is simply a pesky distraction and annoyance that is getting in his way of getting re-elected.  That's the primary reason why he wants everything and everyone back to work by Easter.

From bailing out conglomorates to throwing crumbs to the real people who have been affected by this plague, Trump shows no understanding of the scope of this disaster or how to be a leader in a disaster. Trump plays politics with using this catastrophe for his political gains (big money to big companies), and he refused to issue orders to produce the equipment necessary to battle this horror until hundreds of thousands were affected with the disease. Trump is the absolute worst person to have as president of this nation in this crisis!"

Our governor has been clear that we are in this together with NY and NJ, and that’s how it should be. If you come here from out of state, please self quarantine. 

What is terrifying is that people in the states that are not taking this seriously, and buying into the President’s concept that we’ll be rating to go by Easter are going to get this virus.

Quarantining a region as large as N.Y. metro is pointless at this point and probably not even possible. More than half the counties in the US don’t have a single ICU bed. I’d be far more worried about that if I lived in rural America. 

The a Trump administration badly fumbled the response to this virus. If they had any brains or foresight they would have begun preparing as soon as the situation in Wuhan started spreading exponentially. Instead the stable genius said this was a hoax and would all magically disappear and yesterday, had to be shamed into procuring more ventilators. Hospitals around Boston have one N95 mask per week to give to healthcare workers. This is horrible situation and represents a failure of federal leadership from Trump and his appointees."

This would be an incredibly thoughtless, rash choice on Trump's part, unfortunately not the first.  To point out the obvious, this is all one country.

The other front: the rest of the leaders of the free world that already had it with Trump uncivilized, uneducated, vulgar, uninformed, rude, repugnant attitude and treatment of them.  Had Trump acted, before and now, as the first Ambassador of the United States, as the President of the United States should always act, Trump would have received valuable advise and information from those that already visited the scenario that Trump is visiting now and will visit in the upcoming weeks and maybe, maybe Trump would have been able to do a slightly better job.  But, since Trump knows the correct answer for every question better, far better than anyone else in the planet, Trump “knew” that the virus was a “hoax” invented by his political opponents to hurt him, Trump “knew” that we will have just two or three cases only.

Here's the thing - if NY Times had endorsed this measure a WEEK ago, then we could have slowed the flow, although still unlikely that it would have made a difference in the long run. The point is, we need government official - state and federal - and the press to start to think about the common good. But this might impact their own self-interest. Thus the dilemma. Democracy is not prepared to take dramatic measures. That is why the press wanted to ""shelter in place"" rather than take on rational measures that would have addressed the issue - such as mandate that all individuals over the age of 60 remain inside and not go out at all. And then have tested/clean individuals work, deliver food, and maintain society. There was a solution, but folks in power (press, officials, many over age 60) would not do this.

In any case, we are talking about interstate travel. With so many states under stay at home orders, how is failure to meaningfully restrict interstate travel amount to anything other than a huge oversight, even if like every other measure it would have been more effective if applied earlier?

That you may have at least tens time the cases in the community as confirmed as only 10% are sick enough to come in...at that moment those folks may not even feel that I’ll, so perhaps isolated, perhaps not. What we see is doubling rates of tested/confirmed cases at 4 days, if this continues, this is soon 1 day, then a few hours.

While it may actually work for Trump's base, WashPo fact checkers just reported coronavirus death figures are massively understated, especially in red states.

""The daily tracking number for covid-19 is substantially below the real figure of deaths that can be attributed to the coronavirus. It represents only the bare minimum— confirmed deaths reported by hospitals, medical providers and state health authorities as caused by covid-19. The actual number is substantially higher.""

There is already ""evidence that many deaths that stem from covid-19 are not being recorded as such. Doctors and nurses told BuzzFeed News that deaths in the US are not being correctly reported"". Doctors are seeing thousands die from covid-19, yet a total lack of test kits in red states mean they aren't tested. 

The fiction exists because Trump wants the number of recorded covid-19 deaths kept artificially low. As covid-19 causes those infected to die of pneumonia or heart failure, without a positive test, doctors cannot list the actual cause of death: covid-19.

The conclusion is chilling: ""The numbers so far for covid-19 are only laboratory-confirmed deaths."" Studies already ""indicate that the official lab counts are missing as many as 9 in 10 deaths.""

He trivialized(""the China Virus""), in his xenophobic manner.

He deflected & diverted (""the economy""; ""over by Easter"") as only he can.

He delayed (the Pandemic preparedness renewal sent to Trump's desk ... on June 05, 2019; failure to invoke the Defense Production Act).

He is in denial (""I am not responsible."").

Now, all Americans are in reactive mode.  We are following in Trump's footsteps."
2020-03-29 1:53,"It is obvious tha Trump is looking for ways for this country to open up again.
With things deteriorating  hourly in the greater New York area the logical step for the rest of the country is to avoid New York and New Jersey. From today’s presentation  it looks like Cuomo has lost control of the situation."
2020-03-29 1:56,"Some people are saying President Trump is not doing enough.  When he starts to take positive actions, they say he is doing too much.  The man cannot win.  He should just continue doing what he has been doing.  They will find fault any way so he should do what he thinks is right for America.  His poll numbers have been outstanding.  So some people are happy."
2020-03-29 1:06,"Trump’s sole purpose is to grab a headline, be the focus of media, make himself the center of attention. He is incapable of empathy, unable to genuinely coordinate his actions with governors of these States, and has zero interest in understanding the issues or whether they are practical or effective. It is all about him, nothing else."
2020-03-29 1:10,"Like the plagues of previous centuries, this plague  can't  be controlled by democratic government.  Then and now,  only authoritarian governments had and have enough  power to quarantine large cities and districts and forbid people to  come and  go.  Tyrannies provide more effective government; that has been their justification through history.

Today, the U.S. is edging towards such  a tyranny.  A solipsistic, self-absorbed president is  hastening  the process, and  governors like Andrew Cuomo are pushing back, but the  process would be happening regardless of  who is  in charge."
2020-03-29 1:10,"It should be obvious to everyone by now that Trump has no idea what he’s doing, he’s just making it up as he goes along."
2020-03-29 1:13,"The big question in hindsight after we actually know whether Covid 19 is 10 times more lethal than the normal flu is if shutting down everything was the right thing to do?

A recent Stanford U. study claims the reason the death rate is so high is because we have no idea who is carrying the virus. The number tested indicates there are many who showed little to no symptoms and they believe there are countless numbers who carry and recover with no medical intervention.. Weird virus to say the least with symptoms and degree of illness all over the map.."

2020-03-29 1:42,"Once again, Trump speaks without knowing what he's talking about. The federal government moving against three states? Is his aim to start another civil war? Is there no one in that government with the guts to ever tell him to stop talking?"

2020-03-29 1:31,Trump could not have quarantined the New York region. It would have required US Army and/or Marines to enforce it. US military forces cannot be used against US citizens unless they are in open rebellion against the US government. That is Constitutional law. If we had a decent president they would have known that.

2020-03-29 1:01,"The messed up part of this stimulus package is that Trump will use this to his advantage to buy votes and ultimately the presidency. It will look like he swooped in and saved the country by signing this into law. In turn voters will look on him favorably for doing the right thing. Thus insuring a groundswell of votes in November. Meanwhile,the Democrats are being silenced by this virus. Primaries are being shut down.The 24 hour news cycle is all about the virus.They are fighting  for any kind of coverage to get their message out. And for Trump he will turn this whole tragedy into votes to get reelected. I read an article that the Treasury Department is ready to start printing as much money as is needed to shore up the economy. And do you know what the new bills will have printed on them?  Instead of In God We Trust. It will read In Trump We Trust with his face on each and every bill."
2020-03-29 1:08,We are now under a 2 week requirement to stay home here in Ireland. It is crazy to have some states and not others in a stay home order. It is absurd for the Florida governor to allow Florida beaches open for spring break and then complain about New Yorkers travelling to their holiday homes in Florida. There has to be a consistent strategy for all Americans to cooperate in dealing with this pandemic. Having the states compete against each other for supplies and things going to the highest bidder is wrong and wasting time and resources.
2020-03-29 1:25,"Many comments here all saying, ""Hasn't that horse already left the barn?"" NO, IT HASN'T LEFT THE BARN. Large parts of the country remain relatively unaffected. Why is quarantining right for Wuhan, but not for us?

It's not punitive, it's an empirically valid way to contain the contagion. Just because Trump proposed it, doesn't mena it's automatically wrong."
2020-03-29 1:34,"Why not quarantine? It's proven to be the only way to isolate the virus! We won't quarantine forever, it would be a sacrifice for only a few weeks. Isn't the experience of China and Italy enough? I live next to Central Park and to this day the park is crowded in the morning and in the evening. I have 3 friends who recently traveled by plane. Two went to Italy, at different times, just 3 weeks ago: NOBODY checked their temperature in JFK, nor asked them any questions about their movements in Italy. Another friend got back 2 days ago from Hawaii and again NOBODY asked her about her health. Why isn't there a system of screenings in place yet? People are still coming and going with no restrictions, within and outside the city!  Are we waiting for more people to die?"

2020-03-29 1:02,"This is what happens to those who fail to flatter and praise him.  Now that he has declared that the $2 trillion emergency funds are his to give out as he sees fit, our governors and mayors had better be prepared to approach him on bended knee if we they want to help their own people.  I weep for our nation."
2020-03-29 1:01,"Like most actions Trump takes, this idea he is floating is all about appearances and utterly lacking in any substantial benefits for anyone other than him. The virus has been spread outside of NY for some time now. Where is the threatened quarantine on Louisiana?  On California? 

This is page one of Trumps playbook - find someone to blame. In this case it's New York. It might play well in many of the rural Trump-supporting areas of our country where people are inclined to dislike us New Yorkers, but at this point it would do absolutely zero to protect anyone - anyone except our President who seems more concerned with saving his own behind than he is with the well-being of his countrymen."
2020-03-29 1:02,"While reading some of the articles, it raises the question if anyone fact checks some of the claims and decisions of our political leaders.

By requesting 30,000 ventilators, the governor must expect that 3,000,000 New Yorkers will have the COVID-19 at one time since only 1% requires it.  Being that one is on the ventilator for 2-3 weeks Mr. Cuomo must expect that everyone in the state will be infected within 4-6 months.  I have not seen any projections of that magnitude.

The quarantines also seem to be poorly thought out.  In China only part of the country was quarantined with travel restriction to and from the infected areas.  The approach seems to have worked (if you believe the numbers).  The EU closet the borders to prevent travel.  Wouldn't it make sense that we learn from others:  quarantine  the highly infected areas, such as NY, NJ and restrict travel to and from these areas.

It would also help if our leaders explained the rationale behind their decisions and not provide impulsive replies to reporters questions."
2020-03-29 1:41,"The entire episode is odd.  There’s a major press to keep everyone home.  NY’ers stream to Florida and no one wants to stop them but at the same time we don’t want them to go and Florida doesn’t want them. Yet they go anyway.  At the same time, everybody is complaining about spring break college students and people playing basketball in NY parks.


Good grief, Pol’s need to make up there minds in public policy and stick to it."
2020-03-29 2:01,"This virus is everywhere. It's not coming from one particular location. The ""hot spots"" are where there are more people to get it and where the counting is better. We're just going to have to socially distance, boost the capacity of our medical system to treat people, and hope to god for some vaccine or prophylactic or efficacious treatment just as soon as humanly possible. Meanwhile, the federal government is going to have to meaningfully fill in the blanks for the millions of people whose income has suddenly vanished. In a year it will probably be safe to partially close the spigot."

2020-03-29 2:13,"Comparing numbers in various countries or states can be useful --
but only if compared on a per capita basis --

Comparing the number of cases (or deaths) in California to the total number in New Jersey is highly misleading unless the numbers are reported per capita -- or per thousand or per million. California has  twice the population of New York, four times the population of Michigan and nine times the population of Louisiana.

Likewise, comparing the number fo cases (or deaths)  in the USA to the total number in, say Germany, is highly misleading unless done on a per capita -- or per thousand or per million. The USA has four times Germany's population and nearly five times the population of the UK or France and more than five times the population of Italy."
2020-03-29 2:13,"So let me get this straight...Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida talked to his buddy Trump and whines about wealthy New Yorkers going to their second or third home in Florida during a pandemic. He already imposed a 14 day mandatory self isolation for visitors from the Tri-state area of NY, NJ, and CT. The CDC has issued a travel advisory on Florida's behalf cutting non-essential travel from those three states. But there is no law in the land that prevents someone from the Tri-state area from going to his or her home in Florida. So this advisory is useless. This is another form of cronyism."

Also, asymptomatic people (people who don't know they are infected) can spread the disease. And I have heard that just breathing can shed respiratory droplets (but probably not as much as coughing or sneezing). For these reasons, everyone should wear a mask when around others, as soon as enough masks are available (after enough masks are available for health care workers). In the meantime, makeshift masks (handkerchiefs, bandanas, scarfs, etc) should be used, and there should be no social stigma for wearing a mask."

Far more could be done if the government provided sufficient PPE to the entire populace, if we were voluntarily organized to implement health measures, and if the government started mass construction of hospital facilities as was done in China. Instead the US government is testing new missile systems, carrying out war maneuvers with the Gulf regimes to threaten Iran, and tightening inhuman sanctions including food and medicine against Cuba, Venezuela and Iran.

(Discuss . ..) There is a least a logic to it. But as usual he goes about it in the worst possible way. In the first place,  by kinda sorta announcing it before it is real, he guarantees that anyone in the city  who's  was thinking of bolting to their summer or weekend residence or some kind friend's place, is doing it right this second. Escape from New York, not the movie, the reality.  Then he blindsides the three state governors without a single word of warning, not to mention millions of people who are naturally confused and on the edge of panic. He and his shambolic administration have clearly not begun to think out the complicated logistics of such a lockdown, let alone ways to implement them. And it is laughably clear that the whole notion arose from the last conversation he had, with his most assiduous bottom-kisser, Governor DeSantis. 

This president is an ever larger threat not just to our health, but our sanity. We are all living in a nightmare of his devising, and we may never wake up."

Someone is getting to Trump. He shoots off his mouth without thinking, creates a furor because his pronouncements are poorly thought out, not consultative, and frequently are divorced from all reality. They are the equivalent of ravings from barflies shouting at the television at the end of a bar. 

But someone has been getting him to walk the crazier dicta back much sooner than in the past three years. Walking back a quarantine of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut (an insane idea!) is one example. 

Whoever is getting to him,  I am glad they are able to exercise some control over Trump, because thus far it has been largely impossible. Like an elephant in a china shop, he trashes everything in sight, creating chaos, then having to walk his actions back, frequently demanding praise for ""solving"" the problems he himself created.

He probably will come out tomorrow with some statement like: ""a lot of people told me to quarantine New York, but I told them that we had to think of the American people"" or some other garbage statement.

I think telling people not to leave their homes is far more intrusive upon individual liberties, even though it may be justified in dire circumstances such as these. Is there no public health circumstance where we can prevent people from traveling between states?  And why would another state be less justified in telling citizens from outbreak areas to stay out than in telling their own citizens to stay home?"

Yeah, that's what America and the world needs right now: the US president nonchalantly floating an idea like a three-state-quarantine that would affect millions of people without mentioning any concrete timeframe nor any details how it would be done nor talking to the people on the ground (plus lying that he did). Like with the sudden ban on European travel: no tought behind it; he just puts it out there; completely irresponsible; let other people figure out the details - what a leader!

I fear, that with president knee-jerk at the helm, the recently passed $2 trillion relief bill won't be nearly enough to cover all the damage Trumps ill-advised, too-little-too-late-decisions have brought upon the country's economy.

Italy's response was too far behind the curve, and we've seen what happened there. That's what every state in the US is looking at if this epidemic isn't slowed. Quarantines/restricting travel is a proven way of slowing the progress of this epidemic."
2020-03-29 3:12,"Meanwhile, in Oregon, you hear reports from nurses that at some hospitals they aren't even testing patients with the usual symptoms of COVID-19, nor are they testing people who die at home with similar symptoms to determine if they were positive for the virus.  Might partly explain why Oregon infection numbers are so low?"
2020-03-29 2:56,"The facts are-new cases in the U.S.:
Yesterday-19,452
March 27-18,691
March 26-17,224
The trend is obvious nationally- the outbreak is slowing.
But New York had 7,131 new cases yesterday.
Cuomo has lost control of the situation. 
This can’t be covered up."
2020-03-29 2:56,"It’s not the time dealing with the politics, it’s the time we all together make concerted efforts to fight this virus, no matter where you are or what political stand you hold, otherwise many more people will be infected and die. Know about the serious situations here, be rational about the science and mathematics, for a infectious disease like this (knowing that its capability of transmission is really high and people carrying the virus without any symptoms can be infectious, so seriously, wear mask if you have to go out, no matter “you think” you are healthy or not), no other better ways than ISOLATION will stop the virus from spreading, so “stay home” literally means stay home, minimize the outdoor activities, travelings, visitings as few as possible, assuming everybody has the virus (if a lot of people come out for hiking and jogging in one place, they are taking the risks of getting and spreading the virus). We are all a little part in this, do our own little parts or contributions, not forgetting those medical workers are working so hard to save people’s lives on the overwhelming frontlines, so our ordinary people should do at least our much more simpler part, STAY HOME ! Those states with much fewer cases than the hot spots are not safe at all if people are still traveling from other states, and the situation will getting worse, it’s just the matter of time. What had happened in China, Italy should teach us lessons on how to act now, we’ve already wasted a lot of time."
2020-03-29 3:02,"A quarantine is only necessary if people aren't careful enough and ignore the requirement to keep their distance to each other. While most of the people here act responsible, there are still some that are not, and risk not only their own health but everyone's he gets in contact with.

Europe is shut down, it's been two weeks now, and we wouldn't do that if we weren't afraid that many people could die - despite the fact that it kills our economies. People that travel or gather on a beach - it would be unthinkable here. We can only hope that the pandemic won't be stronger than out health system, in Germany the amount of people that were tested positive rose 15% in a single day. If this trend continues and the number is doubled within a week, it's only a matter of time until we're unable to care for all the sick people, especially old people are in danger, even more so if they already suffer from another disease. And it doesn't look better in the US. Just remember, you're not alone, we all suffer from the same problem.  If we can, let's help each other, Trump was - again - disgusting by trying to get a German company that is researching a vaccine to develop one that is available only for US citizens. Don't be selfish in these difficult time, do the best you can and care most of all for old people, keep them save, and do everything to stay healthy yourself. I wish you all the best."
2020-03-29 3:03,"I got a friendly email from my Australian  Prime Minister yesterday.

I donate $2.00 monthly to the Australian Liberal Party.

""This global health pandemic has also become an economic crisis, the likes of which we have not seen since the Great Depression.""

Perhaps he will do a Trump and:

Always deny responsibility and blame someone else.

Always obfuscate and never ever admit fault.

Morrison has refused to give medical data to independent clinicians or the opposition.

He refuses to release independent Treasury analysis to the public.

He has closed parliament for five months.

""This global health pandemic has also become an economic crisis, the likes of which we have not seen since the Great Depression.""

Be clear I quote dear leader Mr Morrison the censor of scientific and economic data.



How to crash an economy without scrutiny."
2020-03-29 3:12,Can our leaders quit badmouthing each other and focus on a coherent strategy. We’re being led by eight-year-olds.
2020-03-29 2:22,This is yet another example of why it's especially critical in a time of crisis for a president to be trusted and have credibility. The travel advisory could be part of a petty power trip Trump is playing with Gov. Cuomo.
2020-03-29 2:56,"So President Trump gets a brainstorm, announces that based on his brilliant insight he's going to do something, and then later that day or the next day he has to announce that no, he's not going to do it, or it's going to take some watered-down form. HIs NY and NJ quarantine can now be added to his list of that kind of rollback.

Here’s an idea, Mr. President—check with your advisors, your experts, and others who are affected (in this case the state governors)  BEFORE announcing your decisions, so you don't have to roll them back later on. But I'm not sure he's capable of changing this or any of his dysfunctional behavior."
2020-03-29 3:05,"My guess is the “strategy” of the moment is to see how you can cordon off the worst area(s) so that you can get America back to work elsewhere. Trump’s only hope for a win is based on the performer of the economy - so he’s really grasping for straws. Unfortunately (for him), this virus is going to continue to foil him for the foreseeable future. A better leader would confront the situation head on and aggressively for the public health and, ultimately, health of the economy. Sadly, we don’t have that kind of leader. So his equivocating, delaying, denying, blaming will just  continue to make things worse than they would otherwise be. Very sad state of affairs and unfortunate that America voted for someone intent on dismantling govt in a time of greatest need."
2020-03-29 2:23,During this time that we are forced to stay at home I believe it is great that we have Trump.  Otherwise it would be too boring.  With Trump at least we have free entertainment.
2020-03-29 3:01,"Translation of Trump’s backing off a NY tristate regional quarantine: here’s another random idea that popped into my head and which I did zero talking about to anyone who knows anything before spouting off about it.  Once it became clear that it is probably impossible, I announce it wasn’t necessary.  With a normal President, this would be a huge story of policy failure.  With Trump, it’s just Saturday.  We’re unfortunately going to see just how bad it is to have a President with zero credibility with about 50% of the population in a major crisis.  Thank God for the governors.  Never thought I’d be such a states rights advocate."
2020-03-29 3:17,"A sensible zoning policy is ""Disease Control 101"". Zones are defined by epidemiological factors (prevalence, risk, etc), have different control measures within the zone; and movement control from one zone to another is managed in some way. There can also be within-zone sub-zones and some modifications for particular sub-populations e.g. health workers, aged etc,"
2020-03-29 3:20,"Airing the discussion and backing off to strong advisory, presumably to be backed by the three Governors,  was exactly the right way to handle this matter. Were not out of the woods yet and stronger steps may have to be taken yet."
2020-03-29 3:34,"I almost never agree with Trump on anything, but this is one thing where I agree. We need to get medieval on this like China did. People in northern Minnesota don’t want city-folk up there and I agree. People need to stay put and stay home. Shutdown interstate travel. Let’s get this under control."
2020-03-29 3:40,"We should do a federal lock down for EVERYBODY for one month instead of this slowly increase while hoping that some places will be spared. As long as some people don’t adhere to this, we might as well all not do it.

Look to China - everybody did and they are out of the woods after 6 weeks without a 2 trillion dollar package. The US will still be in this on Christmas at this sluggish pace of containment."
2020-03-29 3:48,"Many wonder and ask ""when is this going to end?  In all likelihood we are probably closer to the beginning than the middle or end.  Foot dragging in DC has exacerbated the worst aspects of this problem."
2020-03-29 4:45,"There are several governors out there who haven't gotten any attention for the hard work they've been doing and how far out front of this virus they have been.  One is Governor Cooper of North Carolina.  He was one of the earliest voices speaking up about the danger of the virus to his state.  He shut down schools over two weeks ago and has ordered shelter-in-place, alone among his Southern neighbors.  North Carolina has had 4 deaths, and has just today crossed 1000 cases.  Not too bad for a state of nearly 11 million.  The other top 10 largest states all have cases over 2000 with double and higher digit deaths.  Charlotte is the largest city in the Southeast.  It has just over 200 cases.  My own Governor, Ned Lamont in Connecticut deserves credit for working with adjacent states to help limit the spread of the virus in the face of Trumpian denial.  Kentucky's new governor also deserves a shout out.  A few bright spots in landscape of political paralysis."
2020-03-29 4:50,"I am in Bucharest, Romania now (2.2 million people) now and we have had a complete lockdown for a week, and Bucharest only has had 30 deaths from the coronavirus to date. It has been a big pain in the neck, the lockdown. But thanks to this policy Romania, which is the size of NYS state only has about 160 new cases of COVID per day, 4500 per total, which is far less than NY State, albeit over 2 million Romanians live and work in highly infected countries like Italy and Spain. Trump and Cuomo should have put politics aside and agreed on the Quarantine. The numbers are staggering!"
2020-03-29 2:13,Trump said that clearly: Don’t speak to state Governors that are not nice (nice = subservient?) to me. I remember in fifth grade we had a classmate that told us the same thing.
2020-03-29 4:44,"What reason has been given that quarantine in New York City, NJ and parts of Connecticut is not necessary?
Douglas Ritter in Bassano, Italy ends his comment with:
""At this point finger pointing is a waste of time. Either shut people in homes or watch the numbers grow exponentially. Like the terminator it doesn’t stop. It’s only programmed to do one thing. Hard choices to be made. Italy is your future unless something is done. And we have seen how this movie ends. We here are living it.""
Cuomo did not want the quarantine. Would it push him out of the limelight? QUARANTINE IS NECESSARY! It should be done now before the medical professionals die along with their patients!"
2020-03-29 5:00,I thought I was going to like winning. I don't think I like it so much.
2020-03-29 5:13,"I find it absolutely appalling that Trump makes comments on national news that he wouldn’t return calls or answer requests for aid from governors he doesn’t like or who are “whiners”. We are talking about the lives of healthcare workers and first responders, patients, citizens of the United States. There are no words left to describe the reprehensible character of our president."
2020-03-29 3:53,It’s clear that Trump has no clue what to do. He's just floating up balloons in a wind storm. I wonder what ARod told him to do.
2020-03-29 4:40,What's the point in doing that now? Most of us with the means already left.
2020-03-29 3:18,"Could we possibly have a less competent president? It doesn't even occur to him not to carelessly announce whatever pops into his head during a crisis.  If he wants to discourage travel there are  plenty of places in the country with still relatively low numbers where stronger presidential encouragement actually could make a difference. But, let's see if he says anything about N and S Dakota, WY, AK, NE, MT, etc."
2020-03-29 3:40,"I gather Trump is reacting to the governor of Florida who complained that New Yorkers are bringing the virus to Florida.  However, Florida already has over 4,000 cases.  It's widespread in the Florida community.  Banning New Yorkers will not help, but social distancing for the entire state of Florida might."
2020-03-29 3:45,"Given the president's utter failure of leadership, the responsible governors and mayors of this nation will have to step up to the plate for the REAL long distance planning.

Even if a successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed and distributed, the virus will keep mutating, like other virus particles, and a new, infectious strain will be back in a year or more. Just like the flu, but much more deadly.

The virus is here to stay, and we WILL need those ventilators, Mr. President."
2020-03-29 3:51,"Just a week ago, Mr. Trump was setting the Easter as the date he wanted to see everyone back to work and the US economy up to speed. Now he is pondering imposition of a quarantine on New York area for an extended period.  Why 180-degree course reversal?  What did change his mind? 

Since almost everyone agrees that winning the next election is Mr. Trump's main preoccupation, it follows that this decision must be also election-related.  But, how? Two possible explanations come to mind.  

The first one goes like this: Mr. Trump has now become convinced that he will be losing the next election. So, he is thinking of cancelling the election altogether.  But he needs a good excuse for doing that.  Imposing quarantine on New York and a few other states can give him the pretext he needs.  He could claim these states were cut-off from the rest of the country for many months and, as such, neither parties could hardly conduct any election campaign there. Hence, in the interest of the US democracy, he is cancelling the next election.

The other explanation is also based on the assumption that he believes the Democrats will be routing him in the next election.  For a narcissist, such a public defeat will bring total humiliation, unless he can blame it on something or someone else.  In this case, he could claim that he imposed the quarantine on these states for their own good, but the dishonest media misrepresented his true intention to the public, causing the public vote against him."
2020-03-29 4:25,"We almost made it through Trump's administration without any serious issues. Yes, he had already set this Country back decades with his attacks on the Judiciary and just about every good thing President Obama put in place. This Country is on the precipice of a disaster that dwarfs 911. Maybe just maybe, after all the loss we will suffer, we will learn to respect Science, All people, and Good well run Government that puts it's Citizens first."
2020-03-29 4:18,"The virus has shown the inequality in America.

The upper class took off for their second home in the countryside. The middle class is staying inside their comfortable homes, feeling antsy. The lower class stuck in low wage jobs without health benefits and barely making the rent are on the front lines serving the public in grocery stores, as health aides, and garbage collectors — out their risking their lives."

""A symbol of Spain’s troubles was the purchase from China of tens of thousands of diagnostic kits which Madrid hoped would allow it to ramp up testing. But much of the consignment had to be returned to China after providing inaccurate results."""
2020-03-29 4:23,"Is it a form of treason to deny aid to certain states, especially when Trump’s inaction is risking lives? Hasn’t Trump abdicated his role as president of the United States?"
2020-03-29 4:41,"To be honest, right now, a quarantine doesn’t necessarily sound like a bad idea, even if it’s from Trump. Uncontrolled travel, ignored voluntary sheltering, and even blatant vacationing is spreading the virus to unimaginable numbers. Even if it hurts our economy in the short-run, we owe it to preserve the lives of our elders, parents, disabled, and perhaps most importantly, an entire generation of nurses, doctors, and other medical workers that are throwing themselves into the path of this virus without sufficient protective equipment."
2020-03-29 4:51,"Somehow NY is in love with Cuomo, though he's the one who has exacerbated the spread in NY. He fought with De Blasio over shelter at home and lost valuable early time. 

Even though no one should be count the chickens, the early shelter at home order in CA and especially the Santa Clara county has really slowed down the spread significantly.  

Now, Cuomo is fighting a quarantine, while we know that it worked in other countries."
2020-03-29 6:51,"Trump has cut the CDC's budget by around 19% every year he's been in office.

His 2021 budget contains another 23% proposed cut.

In 2018, he fired their entire Infectious Disease Prevention team (because, you know, it was just over-regulation and waste).

So, why is it that we taxpayers have to pony up so much money for the airlines and hotels and restaurants and such to continue to do their jobs?  Apparently, money is not needed to carry out your work?"
2020-03-29 3:45,It may be a tad late to make this move but better late than never and every day we wait the situation gets worse.
2020-03-29 5:08,"I really think that New York should look at what the province of British Columbia in Canada is doing. All stores, restaurants, bars, theatres, schools, parks, playgrounds, etc., are closed. Stores have cut their hours, and the first hour of every day is reserved for seniors and those with disabilities. Stores have limited purchases to 1-2 identical items per customer. Stores are enforcing the 6-feet distance between individuals with security guards. People who are reselling hoarded supplies are being fined from up to $10,000 per incident. Everybody is requested to stay home and only go out for essential supplies. Period. And almost everyone is doing it. I don't know anyone who isn't staying at home for days on end. Anyone who does not obey the 6-foot distancing rule can be fined up to $25,000 and go to jail. Almost all of the few deaths in Vancouver, BC, are due to long-term care home workers moonlighting, thus spreading the virus from one care home to another. There are now 12 long-term care homes with outbreaks. Thus, 17 people have died in the province of British Columbia to date. 

I hope your state and city leaders will stop squabbling and begin to take charge with an attitude of cooperation and coordination. This isn't the time for competing egos. This is war against a virus that kills faster than any other. We are all watching the US. It looks like chaos down there."
2020-03-29 4:23,"Can N-90 masks, critical and in desperately short supply, be quickly disinfected and reused?  I think they can.

1.  Soak the masks for about 20 mins in 99% ethyl alcohol, (which can be bought by the gallon by any lab, if they do not have it already).   Alcohol at this concentration should quickly destroy the virus.
2. Remove the masks and the alcohol will evaporate quickly (has to be done in a well ventilated environment, no flames or sparks).
3.  The now-dry masks (with ventilation they should dry in under 30 mins) should be clean and ready for reuse.  

As good as a new N-90 mask, maybe not, but better than none."
2020-03-29 7:04,"it's unfortunate that you missed the one piece of news which points to a glimpse of hope for everyone. Italy rate of diffusion has slowed dramatically. over the last 3 weeks it went from some 20% daily, it persisted in the low double digits for a while and it's finally consistently around 6.x% and going down every day. This is huge and it also shows that the quarantine there is working. as this number nears zero the deaths will slowly but finally cease."
2020-03-29 13:51,"So, we accept federally imposed, state lockdowns. How long before that turns into a martial law order?  And we stand by as electoral voting is postponed.

 Apparently, not long."

And Trump has to be on TV everyday telling us ........"
2020-03-29 1:47,"Trump’s limitations have gone way beyond being inept and corrupt.  He is not only incapable of designing a strategy, he is incapable of acknowledging that he is fallible.  His confusion about what to do is increasing, and so are his lies about what he is doing, and most dangerously, what everyone else should do.

He is a clear and present danger.  He is not a cheap imitation of Putin, he has become much more like Jim Jones or David Koresh. 

Many of Trump’s followers are as dedicated to him as were the followers of those cult leaders.  They will willingly drink the Kool-Aide.  That was often used metaphorically, now it has become a direct threat.  Trump would rather lead them to their death than admit that he is mistaken. 
Trump will continue to blame others, deny responsibility, and issues irrational, often fatal solutions unless someone stops him.

It is time for Dr. Fauchi, the Surgeon General, and all other political, scientific and medical leaders to stand-up and shut Trump down.

This is no longer political.  Trump has become the biggest threat to the health can safety of this country since Pearl Harbor. Sadly,  I am not being hyperbolic."
2020-03-29 2:10,"At Trump's recent signing of the $2 trillion stimulus package did we notice how all the men standing behind him were elbow-to-elbow? Clearly showing no social example, no sense,  in _failing_ to practice social distancing? Mr. Trump says a quarantine is not necessary. Heck, he still thinks social distancing is not necessary! This president is slow to react and seems always to be following rather than leading. A quarantine should have happened a week or more ago, but might yet prove helpful."

Or is Trump’s lackey Governor going to try and blame New Yorkers rather than the lack of urgency from the President and the even worse lack of urgency from the FL governor?

Meantime the US government is testing new missiles, retooling the Marine Corp to attack China, carrying out ""war games"" with the Arabian Gulf dictatorships, and tightening sanctions including medicine and food, on Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. Meantime the Cubans have sent dozens of doctors to help Italy. Has the US sent even one doctor to actually assist any other countries? Disgusting."

More Trump stumbling and bumbling through the greatest crisis of his presidency, and that’s saying a lot. This was mostly a publicity stunt to get himself at the top of the news. Otherwise he’s worse than useless. 

Just saw Steph Curry’s interview with Dr. Fauci, and he was magnificent. Of course Trump can’t handle competition for the limelight, so I expect Fauci’s days are numbered on the CV19 task force. 

But I think most Americans would much rather have Anthony Fauci instead of Donald Trump leading America through perhaps another year or more of CV19 life-or-death drama."

Now since lock-down is the only bitter pill to be prescribed to prevent further spread of disease through forced social distancing, the same should be administered with better preparedness and minimum disruption of essential supply lines and as an opportunity to address the deficiencies of the crucial public health infrastructure. It shouldn't be a diktat of an arrogant and ignorant leader who avoids functioning through institutions and experts."

2020-03-29 3:11,"What is that saying, ""It's insanity to keep doing the same and expect different result""?

It started with Wuhan where 5 millions had left the city before it was locked down.

Then Italy. Due to misguided EU solidarity, European countries refuse to close border with Italy for a long time, until it's too late.

At the same time as the Italian outbreak, the Iranian government refuse to lock down Qom, a city with increasing number of infected and dead.

We isolate individuals, so why can't we isolate a whole city, state or even country? China complained about the ban of travelers from China, now they ban the whole world, literally!

With contagious disease there is really no other way. It's nothing personal, don't make it personal. It's just smart to keep physical distance from a communicable and deadly virus in order to keep the disease from spreading. NY and other hot spot should voluntarily quarantine themselves. 

Governor Cuomo is being selfish and foolish stopping the quarantine of New York City and the surrounding area. It should have been done already at least two weeks ago."

So, if travelers from New York are caught not adhering to the state’s self-quarantine orders, they “could be fined $1,000 and jailed for 180 days” - the latter which would only lead to greater infection rates in a setting obviously not conducive to social distancing.

Now I don’t seriously think Texas law enforcement would jail quarantine offenders. But the idiocy behind the possibility of such a law can serve to remind us that, even with so many lives at stake, we also need to protect the people living and working in our nation’s jails and prisons."
2020-03-29 2:40,"There is only one way out of this that avoids mass casualties and restarts the economy as quickly as possible. Nationwide voluntary quarantine with the entire population receiving a reasonable living allowance each month and relief from mortgage/rent/federal loans. Small and midsize businesses should have ZERO costs associated with ownership so they can start right back up when we come back online; large companies who are reaping the rewards of being the only open store in town should be taxed heavily to fund some of the research. TOTAL closed borders; no one in, no one out except those seeking asylum and they have to submit to a voluntary 21 day quarantine. Total shutdown of leisure travel for a period of 60 - 90 days. If no one moves, no one comes, no one goes, the medical system handles those already infected and then gets a break. Local authorities can pinpoint what pockets remain active and shift to a contact tracing/mandatory quarantine protocol. Federal authorities are solely responsible for developing a treatment and bankrolling the whole thing, which allows everyone to stay put and at the same time keeps businesses intact and waiting for opening day again. This could get us back and into work in three months. When the virus returns in fall or winter, we instantly test/contact trace and if it blows up again we do this all over. When a vaccine is available, life goes back to whatever version of normal is appropriate at the time."

Korea etc.  Studies conducted during the SARS epidemic have shown that even surgical masks can significantly cut down on the risk of catching the virus.  Meta-analysis of studies showed a mean risk reduction of 68% for surgical masks, 91% for N95, and 55% for frequent hand washing  (<a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/336/7635/77"" target=""_blank"">https://www.bmj.com/content/336/7635/77</a>).  I guess the CDC did not qualify their term ""not useful"", and you can argue 68% reduction is not useful.  But to say that it is less useful than hand washing is wrong at least based on this meta-analysis.  Hong Kong has not closed restaurants, bars or other businesses, and has only banned large public events.  Even so, we have been able to control community spread and most cases are imported.  One of the reasons is that everyone wears a mask when they are in public areas.  Many Western expatriates have refused to do so, arguing that they trust the CDC more than the HK government.  Therefore, what the CDC says has global implications."

All our problems will still be caused by ""immigrants"". The Earth will remain ""flat"". Science, logic, and reason will still be replaced with a casual ""who knows?""

And lies will continue to be sold as ""the truth"". And, by necessity, the truth will denounced as ""a lie"".

If the virus decimates this country, it will be because of ""Democrats and the media!"". If it doesn't, it will be because Donald Trump is a ""stable genius!"".

The ""reality"" these days, is that for a very large minority of people in this country, there is no such thing as reality anymore. Reality is whatever some preening overpaid nitwit tells you it is.

And frankly, I can't think of anything more dangerous or terrifying than that. Because history has shown, again and again, that when the truth dies - all of our worst nightmares become possible.

Tomorrow will be another day.

Another day in which our President will lie to us about the facts, shower himself with praise - despite his and his Administrations clumsy, untimely, inept, and outright deadly response to this ever evolving national crisis - as he castigates those on the front lines.

Just because we have the misfortune of having him as President (so to speak) it doesn't mean that every single cretinous remark that emerges from his defective brain needs to be covered.

Cuomo is receiving for calling out federal negligence. It is Trump's typical reaction to always strike back at a perceived critic. Also to always stay in the news cycle. He is so transparent and pathetic and unworthy of the office. How long until November folks? Hang in there New York!"
2020-03-28 21:28,"But why would he say something like that, one might wonder? Clearly, if he meant it for genuine reasons he would not have said it. I don’t doubt for a second that people who were on the fence about going to Florida, PA or other neighboring states where they might have homes are either packing their bags or just about ready to do so. Clearly, if this was a serious need you wouldn’t advertise it - you would just do it. 

So it’s clear this is just another example of the great stupidity of this president. He self aggrandizes by flailing his “power” and yet, in a time of crisis and need, he wants to drive yet another wedge amongst us. Divide and conquer is a dangerous strategy in dangerous times."
2020-03-29 1:35,Leave it to the repulsively petty Trump to weaponize the federal governments response to a national emergency. I will never forgive Republicans for letting this sick man run our country into the ground.
2020-03-29 3:02,Trump knows he cannot execute a quarantine order. He also knows the fly-over red states are about to be hit with the virus. These states have been following Trump’s dangerous lies and are now totally unprepared for the virus tsunami.  Results will be devastating. Trump is tossing in the “quarantine” gambit to divert people’s attention from his willful inaction and instead direct people’s anger to New Yorkers (aka “those hateful liberals”). He is Preparing to put himself in the position to claim that he (Trump) tried exercising leadership to save the red states but his efforts were blocked by those hateful liberals who are more concerned about political correctness instead of saving lives. We all need to stop spending time and attention On the legality or practicality of Trump issuing a quarantine order. Instead we need to focus our attention the reason behind him announcing this to the public.
2020-03-28 23:15,It’s interesting to me that since Trump has the possibility of charges being filed by SDNY when he is out of office suddenly this lifelong NYer who claimed he basically owned NYC is no longer interested in anything NY. Made Florida his residence and clashes with Cuomo and says Cuomo wants too many ventilators. Now says he’ll quarantine NY when NY is the state that started the strictest SIP orders. Trump is such a petty narcissist. It’s always about him.
2020-03-29 0:21,"Great idea, even if there weren't a pandemic. People from New York are obnoxious. Look at Trump. I rest my case."
2020-03-29 0:28,"Trump has been a state of perpetually winging it with his responses to the coronavirus for the last several months. He lurches from side to side and the country gets dizzy as their is no coherent plan by bluster, inconsistencies, petty score settling and lies. It's time for citizens to take their country's future into our hands...before he and his followers destroy us all."
2020-03-29 1:28,"The first two paragraphs in this piece explain exactly what not to do. As in Germany which reports every contact the person with the virus has had, we should do the same. We MUST. It defies logic and common sense to understand why FEMA is not doing this. This will literally kill people."
2020-03-29 2:59,"Trump’s lack of credibility is such that nobody thinks any blabber he emits means anything. He’s just trying to get attention for himself and what better way than to attack his old home town, where people think he’s a bad joke and where the governor looks increasingly good by comparison when he and Trump both have Covid-19 press conferences. But he got to be the headline for the day. 

The idea that Trump would designate the risk level of each county across the country is equally stupid. Absent nationwide testing of millions of people, who could know? And Trump totally botched any possibility that such a level of testing could occur and he made sure that it wouldn’t have been timely. But such a process could assure that one Trump goal would be achieved: People across the country would be further divided and more fearful. 

Last, it’s rich that the governor of Florida  would complain about New Yorkers importing disease into the Sunshine State after he directed that Florida would be a major exporter of Covid-19 by keeping beaches open at the start of Spring Break and then dispersing the students to the four winds after they thronged together and mingled their viruses. It will be interesting to see those outbreaks erupt in the coming days and weeks."
2020-03-29 3:25,"1. If you announce lockdowns in three states, there will be a mass exodus just prior to the deadline. That is counterproductive. 2. It cannot be enforced without martial law. 3. It was just another dim witted idea that popped into Trump's empty head."
2020-03-29 3:47,This virus is like an elusive sniper. How would you avoid being the target of a sniper ? You would stay indoors. Do it.
2020-03-29 4:53,Trump's feckless answer to every problem is to close the border.
2020-03-29 2:37,"Regarding the aborted attempt of quarantining of New York,  New Jersey and part of Connecticut:  Who's not listening to to Fauci and the rest of the experts now? Trump or Cuomo? 

If the experts recommended quarantine for Alabama, Louisiana and Arkansas and their governors said wait a minute... would they say how dare they deny science...they are putting the rest of the country in  jeopardy... those southerners are woefully  ignorant...it is absolutely necessary to quarantine? Of course you wouldn't.

It would make more sense if the media stuck with the facts instead of political opportunism. It would also make it easier survive this crisis."
2020-03-28 21:28,"Jealous that Cuomo is getting all the positives, none for himself."
2020-03-29 1:51,"Kudos to Cuomo: kept school and businesses open, then complain for lack of federal help, then refused to quarantine Wuhan-On-Hudson, while looking tough, decisive and sexy on TV. Let's spread the disease more and then cry for help, is that the winning strategy for New Yorkers?"
2020-03-29 3:55,"When Governor Cuomo needs 15,000 ventilators, I assume he requests 30,000. That is how the game  has been played by every New York governor and every New York City mayor for as long as I remember. The only new element here is the virus and we wish decisions were swift, without game playing. Our dishonest media wants to place all the blame squarely on the President, instead they should celebrate the fact that the two work well together most of the time. There was a time not so long ago when New York State announced  a new law suit against the President practically every week. With great fanfare and more than sufficient funding. 
Now we are told that the coffers are empty. We need ventilators, equipment, hospital beds and we have no money.
In the past fifteen years we have lost 20,000 hospital beds in the New York area. We are periodically reminded of looming crisis such as pandemics, biochemical war, attacks on the grid and more. And yet no one is ever prepared when the crisis hits. Not the city, not the state, not the federal government. Not now, not five years ago.
Some had a plan like the city of Los Angeles that once started to prepare for a pandemic. This LA Times article gives us an idea of the several degrees of preparation:

Let this be a lesson for all our present and future leaders.
Work together. I beg you."
2020-03-29 0:04,"If Florida is having a ""Problem"", perhaps they should have woken up and instituted physical distancing measures, closed down stores and restaurants etc weeks ago.  Don't pin that on NY/NJ/CT.   Their Governor DeSantis has made many, many ignorant and deadly mistakes."

2020-03-29 2:15,"As the Trump retreats once again from his exceptionally bad ideas to lead from the rear, the responsible governors and mayors of this nation have to start planning ahead.  REALLY ahead.

SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay.  It will be back, just like the flu. If and when a successful vaccine for the current pandemic is developed and distributed, the virus will keep mutating, like other virus particles, and a new, infectious strain will be back in a year or more. Like the flu, but more deadly.

The truth is not pretty."

He should be in quarantine. Why don't we just give him a state or two, (the Dakotas?), where he can prance around, call everybody names, and his fans can applaud and cheer all they like?

I do not even know why he is in any way still involved in handling this crisis; he should have handed that responsibility off to those capable of managing your country’s fate long ago. He has done nothing but to make the situation worse by his continual inane musings which have no basis in science or fact.  On top of that, he continues to act in a vindictive manner when people do not pay what he believes to be proper obeisance him.

2020-03-28 23:25,"Again,  it’s past time to stop listening to what this president says he will or won’t do and pay close attention to the directives of the governors of our 50 states. At this point listening to Donald Trump is not only a waste of time, but it is dangerous, a threat to our very well-being. Had he acted earlier, moving proactively against the onslaught of this terrible virus, he would’ve saved lives, but all he thinks about is his own self interest and his desire to remain in power. Like many autocrats he is also ignorant and that combined with his arrogance makes him unutterably unfit for a crisis such as the one that we are in.

Stop listening to the president’s ridiculous briefings, they are merely taking the place of his detestable, and often disgusting campaign rallies .  Instead , listen to the governors of the 50  states, they will be honest , at least enough of the time to help us get through this."

This one is simply unforceable so there is no need to question its efficacy. Like his initial China travel ban, this latest brain outgas is full of loopholes and thus equally ineffective.

As a German citizen, who is grateful for the liberation by the American armed forces from the right-wing radicals, I hope that the American people will also be able to free themselves from the radical, polarizing forces. This is by no means a comparison with the Nazis in the Third Reich. It´s only to tell everybody, that most of the german people are positive minded to the US.

It is the wish of the broad section of the thinking citizen not to be led by the minority on the wrong path. 

It is the wish that the young people who own the future take responsibility and stand up to rebel against the rule of the old white men.

I also learned how to trim my own hair. No more asking someone to cut it low only to have them leave enough hair to see you in three weeks as opposed to five if they had listened to you. I have some nice stylists, but there's nothing like doing it yourself. I remember when I was a teenager a friend stayed up all night braiding her own hair. What determination, I thought. Now I get it."

2020-03-30 20:21,I understand the need to inform women how to properly braid hair but it disturbs me that there's been an abundance of articles about black women's hair and upkeep. Many publications featured black hair for black history month and with pictures with 99% of the women with blond and straight hair. What ever happened to natural hair which is more beautiful. My wish was for Michele Obama to go natural before leaving the Whitehouse to cement her place in history but that dream evaporated. Billions spent to look unlike your exceptional race.

Anything else would be irresponsible and reckless."

The single most important thing going forward if you want that death toll number to be a fraction of what is stated is that everyone wears masks and eye protection. It’s a simple deduction, in Asia most people wear masks , they wore face masks before all this, they wear masks because they remember the SARS outbreak, lesson learned. The rate of infection in Japan which has some of the highest population density in the world is a fraction of the infection rate in the United States. In Japan they wear masks. They are able to have masks for the doctors and nurses, and the general public. So let’s look at things as a detective with deductive reasoning. Japan, everybody wears masks ,  very low infection rate even though there is incredible human density. New York, It is seen as culturally taboo to wear masks, in fact, New Yorkers were told not to wear masks, because you would be in some way taking it away from a health care worker if you did. How do you think those healthcare workers feel about that now, they have plenty of patients, and still need millions of more masks.
  If you are reading this comment, if you live in New York or anywhere else in this world, you are a fool if you go out without a mask and eye protection. The NYT should be running articles about the proper way to wear them, answering questions like can you wash them, I wash mine, I also use paper napkins as filters.

Instead and just reporting the news, that much needed equipment has arrived, the article focuses on circumstantial reports of faulty  equipment in other places, which may or may not be from the same equipment or from the same sources as those arriving in NYC. The assumption the piece wants the reader to make is that Chinese goods are all inherently untrustworthy.

In this time of emergency, this piece is very irresponsible, casting blanket doubt over world’s largest producer without any hard evidence. Many healthcare workers in the US are making do with home made ￼PPE and many people are still turned away from needed testing. China has implemented very effective testing for months and its healthcare workers are shown by NYT to be wearing professional protective gear. Their infection has been controlled.

Even that's not a guarantee--staying home as much as possible is the best thing).  That advice is not going to help. This isn't a holiday, and I wish people would treat it more like the plague.

I'm a homeworker anyway, and I also live in a rural area. My husband works as a telecoms exchange engineer, and telecoms is a critical role. Anyway, I have developed a chesty cough, so now need to stay in, and he does, as well.

This is a pandemic - no rules apply. And that includes having the ""right"" answers, whether it's from the experts, Trump, Cuomo, DeBlasio or any of our 'leaders'.

Read the excellent column in this very paper about the bubonic plague of 1665-66 in London. 

Similar to those times, instead of our hospitals being turned in to charnel houses, we should be forcing the quarantined to die in place. Then, there should be designated ambulances converted to death wagons that will pick up the bodies. The bodies will be stored in isolated morgues to then be cremated. 

Yes, it may seem like harsh measures, but these are harsh times. Isolating the living dead is more important than allowing them to have hope that they'll live when their hospitalization may cost multiple infections across our the health care workforce. 

And, just like over millennia of plagues, humanity will come through COVID-19."
2020-03-30 12:04,"Dr. Fauci is doing his best. But guidelines are guidelines and if the president continues to send mixed messages (not to mention asinine policies like crowding people together in airports), he's just reducing the possibility that people will follow them. His declaration of seriousness will be followed by impatience, downplaying the risks, attacking reporters for no reason, saying we should get back to work, etc. etc. 100,000 deaths is incredibly optimistic.

He didn't change course when New York was imploding because he knows that he would never win that state.  

Anyone who thinks that Trump's decisions have to do with the mounting death toll nationwide needs to look at the map of the electoral college.  I believe that is Trump's driving force during this crisis."

Unbelievable. Trump could have signed the Defense Protection Act months ago at this point. We could all have quality masks, our cherished doctors & nurses could have full and plentiful protective gear. We coud have enough ventilators so Americans do not die gasping for air. Instead, far too  many doctors, nurses and citizens will die and the infection continues to spread like wildfire.

Today, according to Trump’s ever flip-flopping estimates, as many as 200,000 people may die and the entire country should be at least approximating for another month what California has already been doing for nearly as long. Meanwhile, as the citizens Trump is supposed to be representing sicken and die at unprecedented rates, all he can do is boast, brag and bluster about his TV ratings. From real estate to “reality” tv, Trump has been steeped in the least real walks of life, which would explain his propensity for lies, exaggerations and dis- and misinformation. Here is a modest proposal, a last resort, as it were: Mr. President, why not get real, and donate the beds and facilities at Mar a Lago, Trump Tower and your other resorts to the health care of the people your policies have sickened? As someone who said, under you, we would be doing so much winning, we would be sick of it, it’s the least you could do. For once in your life, do something.

Peoples' lives are literally at stake.  

While I firmly believe we will get through this and will do it together, this could be a golden opportunity for this president and whoever wins in November to learn from this pandemic and to seriously put into place a workable and reasonable plan of action for the next health crisis because sadly, there always seems to be another lurking around the corner.

trump does not seem to understand that Mother Nature will selectively eliminate our population despite the efforts of modern medicine, or what he says, and so predicting a number is a folly.

The C-virus is not in the air as such, but in the minuscule water droplets that come out of your longs when you breath out (not many), cough (many more) and sneeze (a lot many more). A mask is only useful, if it can stop these water droplets. If it isn't very tight around your nose and mouth, it is not of much use, as the droplets will simply pass through the gaps as you breath in. If the water droplets touch your eyes, you can also be contaminated. That's why HC workers wear such face masks. Once you have used your mask in a compromised situation, you have to discard it and use another one. It is difficult, even next to impossible, to know when a situation is compromised, unless you are up close to known patients. A mask is somewhat useful if you have the C-virus, because it will stop some of the droplets when you sneeze or cough. But, then, you shouldn't be out and around people, in the first place ! Whenever you go out, the best thing to do is to stay 6 feet away from another person, refrain from touching your face and wash your hands, when you return home. Then relax and think about something else.

In Asia, many people have indeed worn for many years face-masks to counter air-pollution, but they are of no use - at all - since the pollution is in the air and you breath it in. At best, it will keep some dust out of your nostrils."

Per capita tell you how infected the area is. Also, a city or county may have fewer or more cases per square mile based on population density. Density tells you have many infected people you could actually encounter. I live in Albany County with 200 cases. The racist garbage that lives in the surrounding counties think of course Albany is infected. But Albany county is a larger county in the area with 310K residents and a daytime population not during lockdown of 500K. The surrounding counties have 100K-200K population for the larger ones and as little as 1K population for the smallest populations. Their fewer cases in many cases are more infected. So much for being a suburban white housewife."

Are we a nation that cowers in fear, letting the other person take all the risks?  Because if the vast majority of us are to ""stay at home"", who does that leave to package our food and make the necessary toilet paper, etc.?  We are asking others to put their lives at risk, while we sit at home, essentially on an enforced vacation-with-caveats.

Or are we a nation of all-for-one and one-for-all?  Do we all chip in, go about our lives, and accept the ""necessary"" losses?  Just when was it supposed to be okay to release the cowering masses from their caves?  When the last COVID-19 sufferer is at last cured or in their grave?

That could be...a...long...wait.

Again and again I keep bringing myself back to the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918, when some 18-million died in just this country alone.  We did not run, we did not hide.  When you got sick, you were quarantined.  And if you were well, you prayed you wouldn't get sick.

So, the tough choice.  Is ""200,000"" dead an acceptable loss?  Two million?  Twenty?

Because that's what this is all about.  Acceptable losses."

This is a huge difference between being optimistic and hopeful vs. being realistic.

The beautiful but small country of Spain had ""roughly 35 people died every hour over the weekend as the death toll passed 7,000.""  

That's Spain.  

The U.S. is how many times larger with how many more millions of people than Spain?

Such bold and unsubstantiated predictions are reckless and irresponsible.  Sometimes silence truly is golden.

Regarding the Munich agreement, Churchill, a real war leader, said:
“Churchill says the government had to choose between war and shame. They chose shame. They will get war too”
To paraphrase him:
“Trump’s administration had to choose 6 weeks ago between ignoring the virus and maintaining the usual level of economic activity. They choose to ignore the virus. They got the virus and the associated deaths, and a down-falling economy as well.”

I know, 6 weeks ago it was too early to talk about confinement. But it was already time to admit that a catastrophe was on its way and to prepare for it."

The science team at the University of Minnesota (including Michael Osterholm) calculates the low estimates of total deaths in MN will be 50,000, as announced by Governor Walz.  Given the population of MN at approximately 5.5M, and if the death rate of MN extends to the entire nation, that implies a US death total of 50,000*330M/5.5M = 2.8M.  This is 14 times higher than the current estimate.  Can the MN model and the national model vary to that degree?"

About coronavirus and all what is concerned to the epidemic - drugs that might help, vaccines,   etc. - we have to give credit exclusively to non policitized, well known,  epidiomologists and virologists. Sanitary staff, doctors and nurses, if allowed, will tell us the truth about what is happening in the hospitals - shortage of ventilators, masks, staff, etc. - Family doctors and ambulance staff can tell us about what is happening outside hospitals. About the data of infected, deads and recovered ,we shall never know exactely.Some countries will hide and others not. But chaos in the hot spots is too big. Therefore real numbers will certainly be larger than the official ones.  Not all people who died or is dying at home will get the test, because of shortage of tests or of sanitary staff to processe it. Many people who have been dying of pneumonia since the end of January haven't been tested.
As far as governments are concerned, if  testing, social distancing and confinement will confirm to be the right way, we only have to check when our government did what and compare it with the other governments. Get informed by reading on line newspapers all over the world."

The majority of cases could use it to get through the illness while the critical cases could use the ventilators.

Biden and Sanders should use their funds to buy 10-15 minute segments on national television and provide daily 'state of the union' style responses to Trump and his sycophants terrible handling of this crisis and managing of the country in general.

I remember how the public and media howled against Nixon for committing a third-rate burglary and cover-up, demanding his resignation.

They failed to protect the US and had all the information and warnings needed to take action, but Trump was too concerned about his reelection (which requires a great economy), and all the Republicans enabling his reckless non-action. At any time, Republicans could force Trump to resign, but they are all cowards.

Doing nothing and attributing any excess deaths to a bad flu season and any talk of ""coronavirus' to a ""Democrat hoax"".  That was the plan.

WashPo fact checkers just reported coronavirus death figures are massively understated.

""The daily tracking number for covid-19 is substantially below the real figure of deaths that can be attributed to the coronavirus. It represents only the bare minimum— confirmed deaths reported by hospitals, medical providers and state health authorities as caused by covid-19. The actual number is substantially higher.""

""Doctors and nurses state that many deaths from covid-19 are not being recorded as such. Deaths in the US are not being correctly reported"". Doctors are seeing thousands die from covid-19, yet a total lack of test kits, most dramatically in red states, mean they aren't tested. 

The fiction exists because the Trump administration wants the number of recorded covid-19 deaths kept artificially low. Covid-19 causes those infected to die of pneumonia or heart failure, yet they're dying because of covid-19. Without a positive test, doctors can't list the actual cause of death, covid-19.

""The numbers so far for covid-19 are only laboratory-confirmed death and official lab counts are likely missing 9 in 10 deaths.""

It's quite easy to understand Donald Trump's psychology:  ever single problem is deflected by blaming someone else:  Democrats, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, the 'deep state'....the Trump Blame Theory proves right every time.

Now, he's blaming selfless health care workers for his own abject failure.

There really are no words.

NOT my president"

I'd hate to think that Trump's actions are purely on a personal level.  Perhaps that's what this country needs for a competent response - a deep, personal impact to the President.  It sure seems that way if history is a guide.  Kudos to whomever brought the President to visit.

And I sincerely hope Trump's friend recovers.  My father nearly died from respiratory distress from pneumonia.  That visit to the ER and my dad's suffering will forever be indelibly etched into my memory.  It is a horrible way to suffer."

2020-03-30 14:13,"It's not just the incompetence, bombast, and meanness of the Trump administration that has allowed this health disaster to spiral out of control. It's the cuts to regulatory agencies like the Centers for Disease Control, the lack of adequate protective supplies and medical devices to help save lives, and the cost and inefficiency of the way medical care is provided in the US. This is a perfect storm that has allowed for this disaster. Innocent people die as a result of all of this, including those trained to provide care."

2020-03-30 14:15,"The NYT does an excellent summation of the news about coronavirus effects around the world. Governments around the world are all facing the problem about when to reduce restrictions. Public health experts would like best for all of us to live in solitary confinement or, at least, remain in our homes be they ever so humble for most of us. That cannot go on much longer before the collateral damage to our economy and society becomes too great. Too many decisions were made by too many governments, federal, state and local in too short a period of time. Too little consideration was given to the collateral damages to our economy and society by these decisions. Trillions of more borrowed dollars will have to be borrowed from our children's future to sustain workers who have lost their jobs both those on unemployment and even more for those workers who do not qualify for unemployment. Confidence in politicians at all levels is going down as result of how they are dealing with the crisis. People are getting mad because of irrational restrictions like the closure of all beaches, parks and sources of recreation. There will both societal and economic consequences beyond imagination for decisions made with inadequate consideration."
2020-03-30 14:15,"Of course this is a bold and decisive decision by Trump to extend the social curbs.  Any great war-time general is flexible to the changing conditions.  I am reminded of Eisenhower, who planned the Normandy Invasion (D-Day) on June 5, 1944.  It was changed to June 6, 1944 because of improved weather, thereby making the invasion of a success.  If Eisenhower was not flexible and adaptable to changing conditions, D-Day may have failed.  It is quite difficult to believe the statements I see here criticize Trump of having the same leadership qualities of Eisenhower and other great United States military leaders."
2020-03-30 14:15,"When comparing the number of deaths from the flu or from car accidents to the number of deaths from the current pandemic we all must take into consideration that in those cases, flu and car accidents, Trump has not and is not involved at all, science continues its work each and every day to try to minimize the number of deaths those two things cause.  Unfortunately, in the case of the pandemic, we have Trump involved and Trump has seen that as the opportunity to neglect science.  And Trump has seen that as the opportunity to to deride and insult the media and incite his unconditional subservient to attack the media people.  And Trump has seen that as the opportunity to declare those who differ as enemies of the country and told his followers those with a different point of view “should be eliminated” (do we forget about that rally where Trump said from the podium “I miss the old times when people like them were properly taken care of…” meaning brutally beaten).

The ""relief"" this bill provides are ""low interest"" loans.Why are small businesses paying interest when the banks are getting zero interest loans from the Fed?  The average small business in America has fewer than 10 employees. Moreover, many are freelancers that barely exist on the Federal economic  radar. For these businesses loans are not a help but a huge additional burden. Most do not qualify for loans in the best of times. Further, the last thing they can afford is an additional payment as they struggle to rebuild their business. These loans are listed as ""costs"" of the program in a disingenuous bid to be seen as a gift when they are in fact a source of income to the government. The cynicism of the leaders and their inability to help the real producers in this country demands their removal. We do not need ever more taxpayer funded debt designed to assist only the wealthy."
2020-03-30 14:27,"Once again the question is “what did the president know and when did he know it?” In his Sunday press conference the president suggested he was changing his approach to the pandemic because he just became aware that some models indicate as many as 2.2 million Americans could die from COVID-19, despite the fact that this information was readily available from many sources, including the New York Times, at least two weeks ago.  Was the president aware then, and he is lying now? Is he now telling the truth and was unaware then because he doesn’t read, and his main source of information, i.e. Fox News, didn’t report the modeling? And was that knowledge gap not plugged by his advisors because they didn’t want to risk infuriating him? It’s sad to think that his lying is the answer we should hope is correct.  The other explanations are truly frightening."

The less we try to apportion blame now the better. There will be time for that after the battle has been won.

As I watched her videos on social media, I noticed that the airport and streets in Japan were empty and I never saw them wear masks. We stressed to them that the Travel Advisory was changing to Level 4 and they needed to try to return A/S/A/P. Finally they did on Friday, but to my surprise, they went through both Chicago and  Raleigh-Durham airports without being screened for COVID-19.

What ... went ... so ... horrifically wrong?  The deaths occurring in the US due to this pandemic, less those that would have occurred as predicted by the best epidemiological models if proactive presidential leadership had been exercised in January, can directly be charged to Trump.

Over the years health improved, science, epidemiology in particular, helped us weather each storm.  So what happened? I can think of three crisis’s in my life that seem to illuminate some of the issues.  Certainly the ‘merchants of doubt’ come to mind as we tried to deal with perils of smoking, and the beginning of the anti-science answer to public policy...then comes the opioid crisis in rural America, the poor folks addicted to an oversold cancer drug whose addictive power helped us mask the pain of the poorest regions of our country, and likely helped elect Trump.  And then the overall complete and utter failure of too many so-called conservatives to honor the science of climate change.  Here we see the fear of science, knowledge and factually challenged religion many practice.  And COVID19...we will survive but what will we learn? Darkness of the cave, or enlightenment?"

2020-03-30 15:07,"It is a big mistake to cover this pandemic focusing on Trump. There has been too much reporting of what he has said, rather than what he has done.

He has repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the situation, made false statements about the availability of testing and medical equipment, promoted a not yet approved treatment, failed to follow advice from the National Security Council's, and blamed the mayhem on others including the media; while accepting no liability himself.

This only spreads dangerous misinformation and raises false hopes about how quickly the virus can be stopped and muddling public health messages with political sound bites. Ministers or president now takes centre stage, and the establishment press corps hands them the worlds largest microphone.

We should all go one step further and urge the media to let their scientist and health organisations dominate the coverage of the pandemic."

Remember we are the ones in distress not the 1% whose tax breaks added 1T to the national debt.

Don’t they require a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio of patient to intensive care nurses to be operated safely? What good are many thousands of machines if you don’t also have a reserve of skilled intensivist nurses?

I read that thousand of nurses and doctors have volunteered to come out of retirement to assist in NYC, but if many other cities like New Orleans and Detroit quickly become hot spots on the same scale, I’m afraid we are spread too thin. I am hoping and trusting that people much brighter and infinitely more qualified than I am are working through these same questions."

And Trump's opaque messages show nothing concrete but campaign ""feel good"" and ""be happy"" slogans.  

If he can simply stop criticizing other countries,  our own state governments, and realize the cold reality, we will be better off.  

Thankfully China still sends masks, gloves, and medical equipment to here since her own domestic virus is under control.  The first airplane shipment already arrived in NY airport this morning.

As Trump continues to heap praise upon himself and cast blame to those who are fighting the fight, real character and dignity will be exposed for better or worse.  Trump will continue to be critical of the front line workers, the real people doing the work, blaming them either for stealing masks and gloves, or asking for ventilators which he does not understand why are needed in such great numbers. 

But as the president continues to heap praise upon himself, true leadership is also rising to the top and filling the void. The nation's governors, republican and democratic, are fulfilling their duty, acting in the best interests of their constituents, and taking charge.   People who not only lead but willing to accept their shortcoming, that they have no monopoly on knowledge and delegate their responsibilities to competent professionals who do have the knowledge, and have the discipline and intelligence to listen to these experts on what is the truth, rather than tell the experts what they think is the truth.  

Yes, this is a time of crisis.  Thomas Paine said “THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.”"

The metaphor is fitting. Trump, like an opportunistic infection taking hold in that statistically unlikely percentage of the time, became president in 2016 despite the attempt of the voting majority to inoculate themselves against him.

Metaphors aside though, Trump's self-interested attempts to look heroic in the government's response to the crisis are weakening the strongest possible strategies. Governors, mayors, scientists and health care workers alike are spending precious time and energy trying to work around Trump's political priorities, incompetence and lies.

Trump unfortunately wields irresistible legal power, complemented by the support to get away with pretty much any illegal initiatives. If he did not have presidential power he would not even be a blip on the national psyche. But just like coronavirus, he's a problem that is very, very hard to eliminate."
2020-03-30 15:22,Why does Trump think that we cannot read the assessment of smarter people than him?  We are in lockdown until late May.

I look forward to a time when we have a leader that cares more about the citizens than the stock market.
2020-03-30 15:22,"Under a Trump administration, it remains foolish to trust anything Trump agrees to do as the best path forward. I don't mean that social hibernation until April 30th is wrong. Rather, it is whether that is enough and if it is, who will decide how and where we will relax the restrictions? Will it be based on the best data analyzed by the best minds in the country? Or will the data be ignored, misinterpreted or replaced with false or exagerated data by Trump?"
2020-03-30 15:15,"Trump has essentially two ways of imparting information to the public-1) Active directed lying, and 2) Speaking with reckless disregard for the truth.

Yet this man will always pander to his Evangelical base, which baffles me beyond belief that they support someone who never goes to church. Please believe Dr. Fauci, who has devoted his life to finding cures for viruses. It is very unfortunate that the guidelines he suggests are often ones that Trump takes credit for. I have lived with an immune deficiency for 35 years. Dr. Fauci and his team spent decades researching for a cure. It hasn’t been found yet, but his help in discovering sustaining medication has allowed it to be defined as a chronic illness as opposed to a fatal one.

The scenario, code-named “Crimson Contagion” was a mock outbreak of a respiratory virus that began in China and  quickly spread around the world by air travelers, who ran high fevers. 

In the United States, the simulation first detected the virus in Chicago, and 47 days later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. By then it was too late: 110 million Americans were expected to become ill, leading to 7.7 million hospitalized and 586,000 dead.
 “Crimson Contagion” was an influenza pandemic,  simulated by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services in a series of exercises that ran from January to August 2019.
The simulation’s sobering results drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed.
The draft report, marked “not to be disclosed,” laid out in stark detail repeated cases of “confusion” in the exercise. Federal agencies jockeyed over who was in charge. State officials and hospitals struggled to figure out what kind of equipment was stockpiled or available.

That's essentially Trump; the D or C- student, and half the country are the bad parents who cheer and celebrate whenever their child gets a D instead of an F.

 I can hear the Trumpian talking points from the right wing echo chamber already ""Only 80k Americans died from this deadly disease, yet you had some experts predicting deaths in the millions in this country, so Trump has averted a complete disaster here and put this country back on the right track."""

Any governor asking for federal assistance and coordination must be so nice to this small man, this is beyond ridiculous.

Media is attacked for asking reasonable questions, and Trump stood there and lied and lied about his previous proclamations despite the video evidence for all to see.

Now he's gone from we'll only have one infection case soon and he's doing a great job, to the realization there could be 100k deaths. But if so, he's done a great job.

Why did this happen?  Greed and money.

When fox is allowed to massively lie to their readers and watchers they're potentially killing their audience.

It was why the seniors in FL ignored the seriousness and gathered together dancing and spreading it.  I have no doubt while fox lied their viewers were out contracting the virus.  I have no doubt while fox lied their viewers got sick and will start dying en masse.

The stress of millions of workers precipitously entering the ranks of the unemployed could become overwhelming. Widespread foreclosures and bankruptcies usually follow. Widespread loss of access to health care or credit markets then dooms thousands of families. Fortunately, doctors may now have the President's ear. Similarly, the best economists need to advise the President but that does not appear to be happening. 

My suggestion is for a ""financial shelter in place"". Forget keeping workers on company payrolls. The best way to protect business is to put them in suspended animation. For those who have become unemployed and for the student loan programs, put interest and principal payments on hold. When the economy resumes, those payments resume as if the next scheduled payment. With mortgage payments suspended, also suspend rent payments. Banks when they make loans take on the risk that the loans will not be repaid. They must bear part of the cost but we also need to support the banks and make sure they weather the crises. Utilities (electric, home heating oil and gas), internet, phone, etc.) should be billed as a cost passthrough only with attention to limiting administrative overhead. Medical Care for uninsured temporarily billed as a Medicaid supplement. 

Such measures will preserve the economy and decrease financial damage."

The 9-11 Terrorist Attacks, The Flooding in New Orleans Post-Hurricane Katrina, The 2008 Financial Crisis also known as The Great Recession, The Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting, The Orlando Nightclub Shooting, and now The Coronavirus Pandemic have all exposed our government as being frequently incapable of providing sound leadership for its citizens.

We progressives know that these failures are ultimately due to our government’s financial capture by special interests which places our government in the service of a tiny group of extremely wealthy individuals and large corporations to the detriment of the majority of Americans who inhabit the middle and lower socioeconomic classes.

The U.S. government and economy are in desperate need of reconstruction. It is time for Americans to outgrow the myth of America’s superiority and accept this fact. Our very lives and the future of this nation and the world depend on it."

Results first and then positive commentary. Back up your statements with facts.

Remember that there will be a day after. You don't just shut this pandemic or its consequences on human beings off. The  moral, psychological, emotional tolls are/will be astronomical.

That keeps the employee employer relationship so when this ends the economy just gets going again.  Instead, the way the US is going, when this ends most small businesses will be gone and their employees may or may not be available.

Congress needs to investigate the blanket ""classified"" claim for all discussions and communication within the Center for Disease Control imposed by the President. We are entitled to know why an official would refuse test kits offered by the World Health Organization with the lame remark ""we don't need someone else's test kits, we can make our own."" And this of course proved prescient for the test kit debacle produced by the CDC; they failed to produce a viable test kit.

By the end of February it was pretty clear that one can test positive for corona virus but not show symptoms; unfortunately, only symptomatic patients get the test. So, it is likely that hundreds of asymptomatic carriers are moving around in society.

One public health expert said, bottom line, each locality / municipality was essentially on its own for figuring this problem out. We are on our own.

Health officials are unanimous in their view that without a concerted testing, tracking and quarantining of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, health officials are flying blind.

Obviously people want to be let out of their homes, but if we don't know what we don't know, we will be blind to resurgent cases, as we are blind now."

2020-03-30 15:59,"Decades of Democratic misrule in NY, CA, IL, WA, and lets not forget Puerto Rico have turned once great American cities and states into dystopian fiefdoms run by incompetents whose only visible skills seem to be buck passing, calling Republicans and everyone that doesn't support their agenda vile names, and blaming their predecessors or the Federal government for everything that goes wrong on their watches. But instead of placing blame where it belongs, the NY Times accuses Trump of showing optimism that is not fact based. Very unhelpful, but not surprising."
2020-03-30 16:09,"While the famtastic, like-never-seen-before, federal government is congratulating its own superlative response to CV-19, and getting a surplus of critically needed equipment and supplies to hospitals and clinics, let's not forget the duct tape needed for the White House crisis ""plan"" and the president's mouth."

All of this lack of response and coordination falls squarely on the shoulders of the president. Just ten days ago all of this was a hoax and and Fox news was making fun of people practicing social distancing. America is dying. Right now. Today. And the president insults the very people that are protecting us and saving us on the front lines. My support and heart go out to all of you. All this mess, all of this danger, all of this fear. All due to the hubris of one man."
2020-03-30 15:34,"The real issue to me is that widespread ignorance of science and distrust of media  is really getting us into trouble.   President Trump continues to say “who could have predicted?”... well sir... scientists, engineers and intelligence professionals did.  You have to listen and learn... enough with the hunches.  Here’s just a few more things you should listen to science and intelligence professionals about:  climate change, the danger of monolithic crops that leave us vulnerable to famine, overuse of antibiotics that will leave us vulnerable to new strains infectious bacterial diseases, social media contamination by those who do not wish us well, security issues on our electrical grid/banking intranets.  I could go on.  We need to start listening to experts.  You may not know, but we have many people with professionally acquired education that you need to listen to.  No more “I have a feeling” talk from you."
2020-03-30 15:42,"Trump has to wait and see a friend dying of this virus before he understand it? The man has no ability to sympathize or empathize. Once again we see that it’s all about him. When he feels pain then suddenly everything is real. When others are hurting he waves them off. If you want to understand why the USA now has more positive cases of the virus than China, a nation with three times our population, and why tens of thousands will die, look no further than the Oval Office. The buck stops there. So do the coffins."
2020-03-30 15:51,"Even while the US Media parrots Donald Trump’s ignorant fiction on Coronavirus pandemic, the sweeping uncontrollable outbreak in the US due to unpardonable Govt reckless negligence is a matter of universal global condemnation.

Over the last 3yrs the US, under its elected President Trump, has dragged the World back by half a century with its deadly attacks on worldwide efforts on Climate Change, Order-based World Trade, Iran Nuclear Deal & now Coronavirus. Over 50% of Americans ‘approve’ Trump’s handling of Coronavirus pandemic with 142364 cases, & growing unchecked, - the highest in the world !! The US has 320million people. China, with 1400million people, fought the Coronavirus all alone right upfront with grim National Fervour to limit to 83000cases & come right on top. What should the world expect ?"

New Yorkers fleeing the city are being hunted down down door to door in places like Myrtle Beach and Rhode Island and because they refuse to self quarantine. Spring Break and Mardis Gras attracted millions and then they all traveled back to their cold cities and spread it.

He offers gentle push-back that Trump can easily ignore. Fauci needs to step up and condemn the lies and tell the truth. It is the lack of moral courage on the part of people like Fauci -  while people die - that is the most difficult to understand.

The Hippocratic oath says: Do No Harm.  Dr. Fauci?"
2020-03-30 15:33,"“We can expect that by June 1, we will be well on our way to recovery,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday evening, though he offered no scientific data to back up that claim. “We think by June 1. A lot of great things will be happening.”

There's the real problem....hot air blasted from an off-key Trumpet.  Nothing of substance, there.

Will the media please mute this Trumpet and ignore him?  Thank you!"
2020-03-30 16:02,"""his advisers expected the number of people who test positive to peak around Easter, though he cited no data to back up his claim. . . ”That’s going to be the highest point, we think, and then it’s going to start coming down from there,” Mr. Trump said during an interview on Fox & Friends. “That will be a day of celebration, and we just want to do it right so we picked the end of April.”

Wow.  The end of April was ""picked"" as the time to celebrate based on what the president's advisers are saying.

I didn't realize that Mr. Ouija on the president's board of advisers.  Now it's starting to make sense - all of these predictions with no cited data to back up them.

In the meantime, the son-in-law did a sure fire cracker jack job with obtaining Chinese-made medical equipment.  So what if the stuff provided was faulty protective equipment and inaccurate coronavirus test kits.  He made good on his promise in securing the goods, right?"
2020-03-30 16:08,"The Times does not normally report misleading information likely to lead to more deaths as if it was harmless. 
Call it dangerous and deceitful which it is. 
So why carry Trump's dangerous dribble with some mild milk toast false equivalency. As in "" he offered no scientific data to back up that claim"" to yet more fantastic predictions of national recovery by June. Times,  to take off the kid gloves. 
 
Presidents should tell the whole truth. They are not supposed to be your grandmother or preacher. 
People are dying fast and the nation  needs to be told to expect a long hard battle and to fight hard until success is achieved. The death toll will inform us. 
Trump is not just a benign confused crazy uncle witness his venom directed at the media lately.  
Otherwise why has Trump marginalized his media critics as horrible, disgusting and the enemy of the people, the 1st step dictators take in crushing democracy. 
You won't think it indelicate criticism to call Trump fabrications dangerous  when he tries to cancel elections and jail critics."
2020-03-30 15:36,"If you remember, this virus was a ""Democratic Hoax"", it was ""only 15 cases in the US and will soon be down to zero"".  Rather than prepare US citizens, prepare the hospitals, increase manufacture of vital equipment and PPE for the obvious pandemic, Trump instead focused on minimization and denial.  Hey! look at the stock market! Our economy is sound....that is until it tanked.  I have to give Trump credit, he sunk the stock market in half the time it took to sink it in the GW Bush administration. 
The increased death toll as a result of our ill preparedness is on Trumps hands.  He and his Fox sycophants share that responsibility.  Nancy is right, Trump, like Nero, fiddled while Rome burned!  He will pay in November if not sooner."

2020-03-30 16:17,Trump throws out words without any context. He is always creating crisis after crisis and backs away every time. Best to turn him off and follow the science.
2020-03-30 15:56,"DJT needs to sit down, be quiet, and get the heck out of the way.  He is creating alarm at a time when we need calm and measured leadership.  Thankfully, we have dedicated, concerned, and articulate governors and medical experts who are speaking truth to power.  We need to cover them more and cut off any additional spin from the current occupant of the White House.  At this point, I'd take any previous president handling this situation over him."
2020-03-30 15:46,"When we allowed our President the ability to lie every single day America was immediately in danger. No person should ever be allowed to be President and be able to be untruthful for their own pleasure. That is a dictatorship.

That’s the way trump does it. Rarely correct but never in doubt.

It would be a bad joke if it wasn’t true."
2020-03-30 16:02,"Everyone is gushing praise all over trump this morning for listening to medical advice and extending the lockdown.

The truth is that he had very little choice. He has no power over the lockdown and most governors who have the power were going to ignore him and continue the lockdowns. He would have looked like the clown he is.

Let's not gush too much and let's remember that the 5 weeks he threw away through denial at the beginning created a disaster."
2020-03-30 15:55,"Somebody is going to have to address the 500 lb gorilla sitting in the corner of the room at some point: It is all well and fine that we will get past the peak, but what then? We will have only achieved the flattening by making everyone stay home but that cannot continue indefinitely, and when we let people out, infections will no doubt rise again.

The President seems to think that once past the peak, that we will have cured the disease and can return to normal. But we haven't, we have only pushed the Pause button.

We need to hear from Fauci and others what the long term strategy here is. Their silence on this makes me think they have no plan and are winging it which is not a good thing. At some point the stock market is going to notice this and react accordingly."
2020-03-30 15:55,"I suspect that this will be a continued game of ""good cop, bad cop"" between Trump and his team of so-called experts.  He will say he wants it opened now, then they will have a big sit down with him and talk him back from reopening everything.  Just stop it already.  This will go into June if we are lucky. Deal with it."
2020-03-30 15:57,"There are far too many tragedies of this  pandemic to count.  However, today's NYT reported that the folk singer, John Prine, was in serious condition.  I have been a fan for decades and fervently hope he pulls through, but am reminded of one of his songs right now.  He has written many poignant lyrics, and the one that comes to mind is, ""Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore.""  Nowadays you could update the phrase to ""Red Hat"" and retain the same meaning."
2020-03-30 16:04,"Remember two statistics from the President yesterday. ""2.2 million"" and ""will do well to keep death below 100,000"". 

The snake oil salesman will use these numbers in his election rallies. People should be aware that the best models (Imperial et al) without mitigation was giving contagion rate of 4 million and death over 250,000 for US. 

With timely mitigation, US could have kept the two numbers below 4 million and below 20,000. Now with delay of 5 weeks in testing and social distancing those models predict, yes, 2.2 million infected, however, their revised death numbers are well below 100,000 (between 25,000 - 40,000). Even going by current rate the expected deaths will unfortunately be around 15,000 for US. 

It seems in order to keep the social distancing for another 30 days, Dr Fauci has given the snake oil salesman what he needed for the election campaign i.e. ""my timely actions kept the death rate below 15,000 when all the scientist were saying it is going to be higher than 200,000, vote me in again""

The major problem across the world has been hospital capacity and not everyone who will go to hospital will die, that rate is only 1-2% check Italy, Spain, UK and China."
2020-03-30 16:05,"Trump never ceases to appall me. He has no empathy, no class, nothing is too low for him. So far he has never remembered the dead, never reached out in sympathy to their families. I think he feels these are just 'small people', 'minions', and are just dispensable. 

I live in NYC and lived here during 9/11. In many ways this is worse than 9/11, that was a single incident on a single day and we knew the extent of the casualties with a day or two. This situation is open ended. Very many times each day I head the sirens of the passing ambulances. Even at night now I run the fan so I don't get woken when an ambulance goes by.  Each of those is a human being whose life is in the balance.

Maybe the virus would have come here anyway, but I feel the Trump removed all of the precautions that were out there, such as the pandemic office, the pandemic resources that were on the ground in China to monitor for new viruses. Then he didn't act with getting tests in place from January and putting other controls in place. Now people are dying, over a 1000 in this city already. These people are from all walks of life and all ages. I find it very difficult not to apportion blame to Trump. He has failed miserably and continues to fail. We need a new leader, and November is just too far away. It is very sad where he has taken this country to."
2020-03-30 16:18,"My only quibble is with the “no one could have predicted.” Many people did predict it, over and over and over. 

The destruction of the middle class, the extra-constitutional power consolidation by Dems and GOP that’s led to political polarization, the rise of lobbyists and erosion of the power of the popular vote, the erosion of public schools and critical thinking skills, the lack of public health resources, and the continued illogical American exceptionalism - to name just a few issues - have been leading us toward this moment. 

The pandemic will weaken America even further, and global warming will kill us."

China has not learned any lessons from SARS.The fact that the virus originated there is not the issue.The fact that it hid the epidemic from the rest of the world is.The next time there is an epidemic originating in  China don't expect any different unless the rest of world demands external independent monitors.The rest of the world should not have to pay with lives to save the Commuist Party of China embarassement.

And by the way, if 200K Americans die, that would be a miracle.  I think it will be much more.  In NJ, we STILL don't have enough tests.  Test sites are closing down right after opening."

""Demand for health services rapidly increases in the last week of March and first 2 weeks of April and then slowly declines through the rest of April and May, with demand continuing well into June. The shape of the curve reflects both the epidemic curves within each state and the staggered nature of the epidemic around the country."""

2020-03-30 15:33,"The messed up part of this stimulus package is that Trump will use this to his advantage to buy votes and ultimately the presidency. It will look like he swooped in and saved the country by signing this into law. In turn voters will look on him favorably for doing the right thing. Thus insuring a groundswell of votes in November. Meanwhile,the Democrats are being silenced by this virus. Primaries are being shut down.The 24 hour news cycle is all about the virus.They are fighting  for any kind of coverage to get their message out. And for Trump he will turn this whole tragedy into votes to get reelected. I read an article that the Treasury Department is ready to start printing as much money as is needed to shore up the economy. And do you know what the new bills will have printed on them?  Instead of In God We Trust. It will read In Trump We Trust with his face on each and every bill."

2020-03-30 15:43,"That Trump says that ""by ________[put in any date; it will keep changing]  we will be on our way to recovery and that by _____all will be well ""  is meaningless.  That he gives himself a rating of ten out of ten and says  that his administration is handling this crisis perfectly "" acting so good like never before"" to solve this crisis---and that this crisis is the fault of previous administrations because they never prepared (despite the fact that he allowed the pandemic response team to disband) is unbelievable.  This man never takes  responsibility for his failings, and finds it easy to blame others.  
But Trump was the one who downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus (""it will go down from15 to zero"") and seriously delayed preparing for it and even now is slow in preparing  (""why do they need 40,000  ventilators ?"").
Bear in mind that China has about 4 times our population and the total number of  deaths which they admit to is under 30.000 (allow for some inaccuracies in the reports : so maybe close to 40,000) and Trump smugly says that it would be a great accomplishment if we ""only have 100,000 to 150,000 deaths."")

There are three possibilities: 1) there is something special about Florida in its environment or culture (or perhaps even medical system) that is limiting the spread and deadliness of COVID19, in which case it should immediately be studied; 2) through sheer incompetence they are failing to test and count COVID19 victims; 3) there is a deliberate effort by state officials to suppress the numbers of COVID 19 victims by state officials because of a quid pro quo with your president, which is why he appears to be giving Florida more support than other jurisdictions (like Michigan). People should be looking at the death rates in Florida and comparing them with the same time last year to see if there is a serious underreporting of COVID19 cases."

The virus of 1918 was much worse than the coronavirus: it had a case mortality rate of 8% (its reported 2.5% CMR has been debunked many times as mathematically impossible given the population at the time); it attacked particularly children and young adults; and killed at least 60 million people. It makes COVID-19 look like a lame cold in comparison. 

And yet one year later the Roaring Twenties started. The Great-Gatsby era of stock-market bonanza and Charleston dancing parties and debauchery. 

Having another Roaring Twenties now certainly seems like an impossible pipe dream. How did our ancestors managed it then? Was it the old saying Ignorance is Bliss? Was it that people didn't know the nightmare other countries were experiencing, that they couldn't see by-the-minute updates on the horrors hospitals were experiencing? Is it possible that out hyperconnected world, despite our advanced technology, has doomed us this time around?

Back in 1918 they didn't close entires cities, let alone countries. They saw people they knew and love die in droves, but went on with their lives, scared but not paralyzed. Is that what saved them? Was not knowing about the enormity of the pandemic what allowed their economy to soar one year after 4% of the World's population died?

I don't know the answer, but it's certainly not a trivial question."

There are several fast growing ""hot spots"" that could easily surpass NYC. The Mayor has not a single word for the rest of the nation, Detroit, New Orleans or others. 

It may be that the word ""share"" begins to have a larger meaning to all Americans than the single focus on NYC as bad as it is now."

Presumably he's started listening to advisers and internalized the message that many more will die if we are ""raring to go by Easter."" 

The flippant, almost casual justification ""we just want to do it right so we picked the end of April"" suggests the administration will likely move the timeline again if the risk remains unabated. 

If the man shows even a modicum of competency in this crisis, the subsequent hero worship may spell victory."

I wish the president would stop and praise these real heroes for their quite and modest badges of courage.
However, his constant high praise is saved for his staff and administration for what they do in every one of his press conferences.

I'm not saying members of his staff or administration aren't putting in long hours.  There isn't an employee in any town, city or state that isn't laboring long and hard hours.  

But anyone who consistently defies the chances they take to help others who have this virus ARE the heroes in this drama.

Not only this, but he's probably trying to figure out ways to get more power for himself by corrupting the laws put in place to protect Americans in a time of crisis.

If he's successful in this power grab, watch for a rescheduling of the November election, or some other political maneuvering on his part, or by the GOP."

Many in America no longer pursue with discipline Education, Science, Math, Music, Dance, Art, and Athletics for what they are and how knowledge or beauty can be shared to improve life where needed. Instead, they are pursued with the mentality how much money you can make from it. And do not care who I step on to get it or how much of this planet I destroy in the process.

America will never be great under the ideals reflected in the statement ""I do not care what Trump says or does, my 401K is soaring."""

If you are home with your baby anyway and can’t get enough diapers, this is the time to try. It works. I started at 4 months with my baby. And she was fully potty trained at 18 months. 
Diaper companies make millions of dollars telling us our babies aren’t ready and encouraging dependence on disposables. When you are outside the house and can’t find a bathroom, I agree disposables are helpful. But if you are home now anyway, give elimination communication a try. Your baby can do it and so can you.

2020-03-30 16:58,I guess I have been watching different Trump press conferences than some others.  I have seen a competent president who shows compassion and concern for the American people.  I have seen a president explain his course of action during these extremely difficult times.  I have seen a President who has his coronavirus team speak before the American public.  I have seen an excellent team explain in layman’s terms what they are doing and have accomplished.  They all are under extreme stress and pressure  and must be given praise and thanks.  These are not usual times and everyone’s nerves are frayed.  We are in uncharted waters and this is a first.

2020-03-30 17:27,"I voted for Trump.  I now realize that most likely was the largest mistake I made in my entire life as a voter.  The main thing that prompted me to decide my vote in 2016 that way I did was the $4 Trillion for infrastructure promised by Trump.  I was dreaming of fewer cars and more rapid transit systems, which in turn will help in relation to protecting the planet.  I thought if Hillary is President and she proposes a $4 Trillion for anything, including infrastructure she is not going to get it because the GOP will oppose anything like that but if Trump proposes it most likely, although reluctantly, the GOP will approve it. Now here I am, no $4 Trillion for infrastructure and the country at brink of collapse due to the President’s ineptitude.  Why the GOP allowed Trump to be the nominee in 2016?  That is where the problem started."

Trump only cares if state governors are being thankful to him or not. The earth does not revolved around you, Mr Trump. Its your job to save lives of citizens, whether or not you get thanked for it.  

Guess what, a number of third world nations have governments which actually care for their citizens even though they have to battle poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, hygiene and so many other problems that come along.

There is also some doubt as to whether China is being forthright in their reporting as to its reduced number of cases and deaths in their country.

Meanwhile despite what self proclaimed epidemiologists are on social media are saying, Covid is 10 times more lethal than the flu, much more contagious, and it hasn’t begun to peak yet in the US.

For modeling data, check out this forecast by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,  published in cooperation with the Universe of Washington. 

 <a href=""https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections"" target=""_blank"">https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections</a>. 

It forecasts Coronavirus impacts state by state with an aggregate nationwide summary from March 26 through August 1.  The model provides assumptions of restricted movement and forecasts a national peak of cases on April 14, with some states peaking before or after.

For example, the model forecasts the current horror that New York is experiencing to peak on April 6.  

In the absence of data from the current administration, I found it helpful in understanding (an estimate) of what we're in for as a nation.  It also made me hopeful we can get through this, get it behind us, and focus on getting back to work and restarting the economic engines."

Apparently Fox is concerned about lawsuits from victims; or if they have passed away, the grieving surviving relatives; many of them in the Trump base viewership. Murdoch's vast propaganda machine is obviously swimming in money. I would imagine that many lawyers will be coming after them. Fox told them it was a hoax, parsing whether it was a hoax or the Democrats perpetuating a hoax; what came across was virus=hoax. Their defence is feeble. There are clips with Trump saying there were x cases when it was already known it was x + y cases. Good lawyers will rip Murdoch's Trump TV to pieces.

Where has Trump been these past two months? Congress just had to spend $two trillion to patch the consequences of Trump's malevolent (ill-intentioned) leadership. 
Trump is the Typhoid Mary, Jim Jones, and Emperor Nero rolled into one. Before he is done he will have needlessly caused the death of several if not hundreds of thousands, many of them his most ardent and faithful followers."
2020-03-30 16:51,"Peak by April? Trump is not a genius at anything.  As we play catch-up on testing, we haven't even identified the cases that already exist.  So the apparent rate of increase of documented cases of covid-19 will increase more rapidly than exponential for a few weeks, merely a quirk of our slow response to testing.

But without reliable data, and the delays of testing the number of ""demonstrated"" cases cannot peak by Easter.  We can be sure that his medical experts -- Fauci -- have already told him that.  His other advisers will tell him whatever he wants to hear."
2020-03-30 16:58,"I am tired of hearing Trump said, "" They don't appreciate. "" No, Mr. President, it is the duty and responsibility of the presidency to safeguard the citizens and the country. You don't ask for appreciation.

Mr. President in any crisis, if you tell the truth, do your best, the outcome is worse than expected or disastrous, we still honor and appreciate you. 

So please use the power of the signed DPA to order the industrial base to make face mask, N-95, PPE and ventilators to help the front line workers because the doctors, nurses,  policemen, firefighters etc, etc are dying in front of your eyes to see. Is it that difficult to do ?"
2020-03-30 16:39,"Perhaps a timeline - updated daily: Donald Trump said - in his own words, just as he said it. From the very beginning of your reporting on the virus in China & within that timeline other voices added as we've traveled through this Pandemic - legislators, media personalities (this might be a good time to dive down the rabbit hole of right-wing media), other counties leaders, the CDC, our state governors, all the voices  - a timeline of what was said, who said it and the reality of how the pandemic began it's journey & continues - On the front page - every day."
2020-03-30 16:40,I think President Trump is doing a splendid job under extremely difficult circumstances and look forward to watching his press conferences.  These are very unusual times to say the least and we have never in our lives seen anything like this before.  Who would have thought three months ago that we would be at this horrible moment throughout our world.  This is unprecedented.  Everyone is panicking and terrified  for good reason.  We do not know the cause of this terrible virus and when it will all end.  We are afraid and uncertain at what tomorrow.  We need to band together and not be fighting over the little things as who is at fault.  This does not help matters.
2020-03-30 16:54,"Meanwhile Trump is eyeing that $500 billion part of the relief money. Pelosi et al wanted to put in restrictions to ensure it does not go to Trump family members and his buddies. So she wanted IG oversight. The commander in chief is already saying that the regulation is only hortatory-  meaning it is only an exhortation not a directive. He is resisting the right of congress to receive data from the IG about how that money is spent; and he has said already he has sole leverage over dispersal of the funds. He wants to make money - a lot of it - on the back of American suffering.
Meanwhile loyal toady, GOP senator Burr has apparently engaged in insider trading on the back of this tragedy.
The loss of American lives is a financial opportunity to these people.
""Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. As head of the powerful Intelligence 'Committee, Burr received frequent briefings and reports on the threat of the virus. He also sits on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which received briefings on the pandemic.""

2020-03-30 17:12,"Trump consistently leaves out the phrase ""I hope..."" at the start of all of his recent statements about everything. The basis is ""I hope I get reelected, because if not I will be in the courts defending myself against charges ranging from tax fraud to perjury."" And I am sure I have neglected some of the other crimes he may be charged with."
2020-03-30 16:33,"Trump, who says he understands these things very well,  also said about 3 weeks ago that the U.S. has only 18 cases and that we woudl soon be at zero. 

Now today he is claiming victory if we keep deaths to 200,000.

Instead of acting on his intelligence briefings he wasted months denying this  virus was a problem and failing to effectively mobilize the federal response which should have included widespread testing & tracing as well as procuring PPE for medical workers and first responders.

Metrics are the standard by which response to crises are judged. The fact that he wealthiest, most technologically advanced country in the world has more cases than country's 4 times our population and that our death toll will likely exceed by orders of magnitude all other country's would--in a rational world--point to a catastrophic failure of leadership. Yet I recently spoke with a Turump supporter who claimed it is China's fault and he is doing a great job responding. 

Our election of Trump, and the continued support he and his congressional enablers receive (his poll numbers have gone up!)  signals we are no longer a rationale country. We are a country paying the price for our ignorance and our  sheepish acceptance of the corruption and incompetance that now defines us."
2020-03-30 16:53,"I am sure Trump extended the ""isolation"" to 4/30 under a lot of  pressure from Fauci and others.

2020-03-30 17:20,"We need to choose to tangibly reconnect to one another in community, reconsider the reality of how we got here, and reinvent who we are as individuals -  and as nation - in order to fully recover.

We did not do that post-9/11, nor during or after the Great Recession. This virus may play out as either our third strike...or an enormous opportunity. 

If we choose to shift this challenge into an opportunity we must face some uncomfortable truths and realities...and be willing to play full out .

Every human life has value...full stop. But we must keep in mind we are one of the largest nations in the world, with one of the largest populations; we have 330 million people in our country.

Yes, be sobered and saddened by these deaths. Yes, step up to help those in need, especially our medical community...

...but we must begin to stand in front of the door to fear and refuse to cross its threshold. 

Fear disempowers. Courage empowers.

And with all due respect, we need the media to help tamp down that fear."
2020-03-30 16:45,"More bowing to reality from our Dreamer-in-Chief. Finally, President Trump recognizes what was supremely evident to even the most oblivious. The federal social-distancing guidelines are now extended to April 30th from the previous deadline of today, March 30th.

We know what is required to avoid having things ramp up again - thorough testing and isolation of ongoing cases. Not a peep about this though from anyone in charge. Both in terms of getting organized to do so, and lining up the resources needed, and in terms of preparing people for what would surely be perceived as draconian measures for those infected in May/June onward.

If you start asking those questions aggressively now though, perhaps some people may get a clue in time. Otherwise we're just going to bumble our way through the summer like we did through February, only with way more people dying."
2020-03-30 17:49,"A peak by Easter is totally reasonable. It's just math.

Over the past 4 days, the day-over-day growth rate in the total number of cases has fallen from 26%, to 23%, 20% and 17% between Saturday and Sunday. That's an average daily decline in the growth rate by over 10%. If the growth rate continues to fall by only 6% per day, then number of new cases will peak on April 13. If current trends continue, the peak could come substantially earlier than that."
2020-03-30 18:09,"To use his own vernacular, Trump is now the Visible Enemy. According to a well-researched article in The Guardian South Korea and the United States diagnosed their first case of coronavirus on January 25. South Korea immediately began testing tens of thousands of people and implementing societal changes, with the result that there was a significant change in the pattern of disease spread. In our country, six weeks later trouble still referring to this as a democratic hoax that was only affecting 15 people and would be gone in a minute. What is the real danger here?"

He wants to be told that he's doing a good job?  He dismantled the pandemic team, cut a significant portion of the CDC budget, he ignored intel from January 3rd on that told him a pandemic was coming, did not form an urgent task force at that time to order masks, ventilators and test kits--though he had TWO MONTHS to do so, and only Nancy Pelosi came up with any kind of a financial bail out to begin with.  This is making American great again?  This is competency?  This warrants congratulations and appreciation?  I'll tell what this is: a complete, unmitigated disaster.  The Civil War took 620,000 lives, 675,000 Americans died of the Spanish flu.  World War II cost 407,000 American lives and WWI 116,500.  This will undoubtedly rank 5th or more on the disaster scale for this nation, but our President wants praise, and appreciation.  Let that sink in.  And no, I won't forgive the time Trump wasted, in denial, when he could have chosen, for once, to be a leader and get ahead of this thing when multiple intelligence sources warned him.  In January! No more excuses.  He is reckless, and this time his incompetency is killing people and may potentially bankrupt this nation.  Happy now enabling GOP?"

Trump didn't create the virus, but his actions allowed its unfettered propagation in the US. Elementary logic tells you Trump is directly responsible for the death of many tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of American citizens.
Why this demonstrably correct fact isn't discussed by the Press, let alone by the Democrats, is inexplicable.

Last night he implied that New York (and surrounding) hospitals were lying about needing face masks and ventilators and refused to admit that he said he wouldn’t help governors who didn’t respect him – even though it’s on video for everyone to see and hear.

Somehow, somewhere there is a brave reporter out there who will finally call Trump out publicly for the liar that he is and will overpower Trump's usual verbal doublespeak before they cut his mike off.  This man or woman would be a hero to millions of Americans."

He KNOWS he is right about everything and I am wrong because even though my knowledge comes from years of  medical experience and 2 Bachelors of Science degrees, he did research! on Google! while he was in jail so he KNOWS I am wrong! Because of course, college and hospital experience cannot compare to research done on Google while sitting in jail! 

Unfortunately there are too many like him in my area- poorly educated, racist, unable to think critically, and deliberately blind to the daily lies and misinformation spewing from trumps mouth. I do believe that this person admires and envies trump for his despicable, boorish behavior because he has many of the same characteristics, but without the trappings of wealth.

That said, his prognosis of having at least 100K deaths in the USA is quite a mathematical stretch that is not based in the current reality.

For the USA to have 100K deaths, with 1% mortality rate (a number Fauci himself has agreed on) we would need to have 10 million infections, or about 3.1% of our population.

For comparison, Italy currently hovers around 100K infections, or 0.17% of their population. By all accounts their rate of infection is finally going down. To match USA's Fauci's ""best"" case scenario, we would need to assume the absolute and quite unexplainable worst in Italy's case (despite having peaked already) and assume they will end up multiplying their current number by 18 to end up with 1.8 million cases – 3.1% of their population.

It is possible that despite Italy's draconian measures, despite having apparently reached peak numbers, despite infection rates finally going down, they will still end with 18 times their current number of  infections? I guess it is possible. But quite improbable.

Corporations reportedly demand employees sign over their ""plague gifts"", just to be sure nobody has a chance to feel secure for a second.  Just so corporations know they control every aspect of every deal even if it does look like Pelosi won one.

What to do?

Well, do this:  Get every social security number of every American.  Match them to addresses. Write a big bunch of checks, say 350,000,000 of them.  Write them for a lot of money.  Put them in envelopes.  Send them.

No strings, no questions, no tests or limitations.

Money  they would never see if you try to parcel it out according to our usual regulation-heavy, ""mustn't let anyone get comfortable"", ""we know you're all here to rob us blind"" process.

You want some limits?  OK: if you have more than half million in savings/investments/property, no check for you.  I know, it sounds like an unfairly low standard, but that's because you have no idea how bad most people have it out here.

Hand sanitizers are a privilege.  It means you have money to buy them.  Lockdowns are a privilege.  It means you can afford to be at home.  Most of the ways to ward the corona virus off are accessible only to the affluent.  In essence, a disease that was spread by the rich as they flew around the globe will now kill millions of the poor.

Although Ohio had its first case earlier, Michigan’s cases are almost 5 times greater.  The damage of not acting as fast as DeWine is shown in every metric.  What would have happened in NY if Cuomo had acted at the speed of DeWine with the same information?  Hindsight is 20 20 as they say.  What Cuomo lacked is foresight, and the courage to act sooner.   He had the same info DeWine had, and failed to act timely.  Blaming Trump for not intervening into N.Y. or other states sooner is a sorry excuse.

America, the richest country in the world, has doctors and nurses begging for medical supplies, they don't have enough masks and are wearing plastic garbage bags for protection, and patients collapse outside hospitals waiting to get tested. And Trump has accused doctors and nurses of exaggerating the need for ventilators, but he has offered help to North Korea to fight the coronavirus."

To say nothing of what will happen to his nepotism members of the White House suddenly outcast.  No wonder he cautions reporters to ""Be nice.""  It's about all that he can do...  Oh, and when his base starts to starve and become homeless, beware the backlash."
2020-03-30 19:30,"President Trump angrily accuses medical personnel of hoarding PPEs  for their own benefit and not using them to treat patients in hospitals. Perhaps there is another different reason why resources are scarce. The President fails to mention that the ""the State Department [has] facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.  ""  (See US Dept of State Dept of State website press statement of Feb. 7, 2020).  While generous as this act of the US government was, it certainly affected our stockpile of supplies. Instead, the President chooses to publicly cast the blame on state governors like Andrew Cuomo and dedicated medical workers."
2020-03-30 19:30,"This American President wishes that he could get a little appreciation from the media for working harder on this virus cituation than most presidents have probably worked on anything recently.

President Obama got so much love and respect from the media - plus eight years of never getting a tough question from almost every reporter out there - that he joked with his staff about how ridiculous the media crowd looked as they gave him an eight-year pass."
2020-03-30 19:32,"Indeed the President’s blundering incompetence has been known from the start, despite his grandiose statements that he is all-knowing, all-seeing and all-powerful.

Make no mistake -- these dedicated workers are not military conscripts.  They do not have to show up for work.  They can quit.  And more and more will if they believe their own lives are being put at risk, or their efforts are not being appreciated.

Or if the situation deteriorates so much that ""showing up"" is futile, and their co-workers are falling sick and/or bolting.  At some point I imagine that even the most dedicated doctor, the most dedicated nursing home aide, etc. will put their own lives and those of their families first.

Morale matters.  It matters to us, the ""average"" American.  Not to Trump.  I imagine he and his family and others similarly situated have concierge medical care and supplies waiting in the wings."

Trump did not accuse individual doctors and nurses of stealing anything.

The question naturally becomes why.

In ordinary circumstances, the New York Times would send some investigative reporters to find out.

This is not stealing towels from the motel.

Anything on this scale would be done by the higher ups.

In New York, like all Democrat run cities, the corruption, if any, would be tied in with the Democrat politicians.

“We should think about the origins of this crisis. It’s a colossal market failure, exacerbated by the savage neoliberal intensification of deep social economic problems. 

“Our fates were handed over to private corporations, unaccountable to the public. For them, making a new body creams is more profitable than finding a vaccine that will protect us from total destruction. And the crisis continues because of the collapse of institutional structures that could deal with it.

“There is the possibility that people will organize and bring about a much better world. The crisis should bring about awareness of the deep, dysfunctional characteristics of the whole system, which must happen if there’s going to be a survivable future.”

I'm betting on the latter. But by the summer, the deaths and hospitalizations will just have faded into the background noise.

If you are unable or unwilling to stop lying.  Then please: shut-up.

We didn't expect you to help the country in this crisis, but we did expect you not to make it worse.  You are making it worse."

2020-03-30 20:47,Sometimes hindsight can be better than foresight. We had an obvious and clear warning about the the potential for this with the 2003 SARS outbreak which fortunately did not spread as widely as COVID-19. But it was a killer and a warning. That was when stockpiling  of some of the needed medical supplies should have started. The Bush administration did not do anything that I remember but in 2009  there was a Democrat in the White House as well complete Democratic control of congress and I wonder why they did not do anything to address a potential shortfall of critical emergency supplies. As evidenced by their quick passage of Obamacare they had the numbers to do so.
2020-03-30 20:47,Over 90 plus percent of people get this by touching something infected and then touching there face around the nose eyes or mouth/ those who inhale it usually get it from someone who cough/sneezed in a in-closed room/ while Mask are very helpful...wearing gloves and sanitizing the hands when out in public should be the rule.

To those out there that are Trumpists not Republicans, that is people with no ideology just idolatry, in relation to Trump’s accusations I tell you this: It doesn’t matter what words Trump used, it doesn’t matter how Trump phrased it.  Trump is - in front of the cameras and for the entire country to see it - insinuating that someone is committing a crime.  Normally that should be investigated privately by the proper authorities and punished accordingly if true.  The President is not doing any favor to the thousands and thousands of doctors, nurses, hospital security personnel, workers that clean the hospitals, etc. insinuating that there could be thieves among them taking advantage of the dire situation. That type of discourse could make some ill brained unconditional subservient of Trump go out and attack a medical professional or a hospital worker. The President of the United States of America can’t act like a neighborhood gossip propagator."

2020-03-30 20:57,"Re the Chinese numbers of the deaths due to the epidemics in Wuhan. I'm no particular fan of China but remember, Wuhan has around 14 million inhabitants. The Chinese death rate in 2019 was 7.2. Applying it would give 14,800 ""normal"" deaths in Wuhan in a couple of months (all funerals were forbidden, not only those of the epidemics victims). Add the tested deaths  from coronavirus. Add a few deaths due to other medical conditions which probably weren't treated in the weeks in which the hospitals where overwhelmed. Add people that in the same weeks died home from coronavirus untreated and untested - by the way, as The New York Times itself reported, it is exactly what could be happening here in Italy, in the hardest stricken zones like Bergamo. Nobody in Italy is deliberately massaging the numbers in any way. But for a few weeks control, even of the numbers, was at least partially lost. China is far less transparent than Italy, they have probably massaged some numbers and may do it again. But to understand if the numbers are sound or massaged you should count them properly.

I don't think he is capable of it, and I just hope we all have state/local govt filled with competent people.

He is incapable doing the job of being a president because of these limitations. He needs to step down as his anger issues get in his way of being a true leader. And Mike Pence is not capable of anything except being a lackey boot licker. Sadly, America is not doing well with these 2 in charge."

2) broad use of the new antibody test for Do I Have the Virus now, Did I Have the Virus and Am Recovered (have antibodies), or I Don't Have and Haven't Ever Had the Virus. 

Germany is getting all over the antibody test now with plans to provide certificates for those with anitobidies to return to work etc. once one has antibodies. Great idea, to get people back to work, as possible. 

The discomfort of ""labeling"" and ""certifying"" people in Germany (/in the USA) is not lost on me. I choose to view this, for this situation only,  as like a vaccination certificate, as to put children into Kindergarten, for example, but for everyone."

And yes, anyone reading this newspaper and paying attention knows he is lying all the time, anyhow.  So maybe somewhere in the article mention he is lying about test availability (don't just repeat his lie, also give the data, and call it a lie: ""president lies again about test availability"" or don't mention it).  More interesting: how many people want tests who aren't getting them?  How many places have enough tests?  

There is no need to repeat the President's lies.  Stop giving them oxygen and start telling us which places have enough masks, tests, ventilators, which don't, etc.  More Cuomo, Newsom, other governors.  People who are actually doing something.

No point quoting the president's stupid pronouncements.  Certainly not in headlines (quarantining NY is stupid and inpractical, don't put it in a headline, we know he says stupid pointless things, please stop with the breathless repeating of gossip!!).  Half of the time they carry no weight but make him pretend to some Americans (who aren't paying attention) that he is doing something.  You don't need to propagate that at all.  

If I want pointless gossip I can go to many places.  You can do better, please fix the headlines!!

Therefore, if you don't look for or test for something, you won't find it.  Pure genius!

Once again we find ourselves bailing out companies which never prepare for emergencies or put away money for contingencies, but are only interested in their earnings and stock prices. Then when disaster strikes, the first they do is lay off their workers. Ultimately we can blame the politicians for this mess including dear Nancy Pelosi, who seems to be in a dither. There has to be legislation dictating corporate contingency funds and more protections for workers which companies must agree to before they  receive a dime. But this is a tsunami.

If you assume that 1 million Americans are currently infected (of course we don’t know the actual number because of inadequate testing) that’s one infected person out of 300+ people. If we can identify and isolate that infected individual, the other hundreds can get back to work. While we are all staying at home, washing our hands, and practicing social distancing in order to slow the spread of the virus, it’s crucial that rapid tests be rolled out by the millions.

2020-03-30 21:05,"Testing is not an issue for Trump because if there are never enough tests then the confirmed rate of spread is not verified and thus a hoax. The numbers of infected can then be suppressed to make it look like his response has worked. Expect conservative doctors, which are most, to fully support the president in suppression of the extent of the issue. Southern doctors in particular will ascribe deaths to underlying issues rather than the virus. This is what the right does. Suppress the truth, and offer conspiracies."

If you're experiencing symptoms and test positive, you're quarantined.  If you're experiencing symptoms and test negative, you're quarantined.  So, remind me again, what's the big hoopla over testing?"
2020-03-30 21:20,"Why aren't you shutting down your airports?  It could be the difference between 60,000 and 200,000 deaths.

Is life cheap generally in the USA, or is it just that you don't place as much value the life of anyone over 70 as countries that have shut their airports down?
The circumstantial evidence is there - no real gun control, significantly lower male life expectancy, capital punishment

That's the question people overseas are asking themselves now, and will continue to ask after this has passed

I still don’t understand why his ratings are so high!  Why can’t the American people see through his distortions and outright lies?"
2020-03-30 21:22,Why don't we divide this country into two sections:  One headed and controlled by Trump and one headed and controlled by the Coronavirus experts.  This would end the problem caused by Trump and his base.  They would all be dead in about a week and we could finally get on with our lives.
2020-03-30 21:22,"Ray..I didn't hear him say that or even read that anywhere. Too alleviate your concern...
He said the peak may be around Easter and they would keep the restrictions on until 4/30 to let it wind down. They will then be reviewed based on facts on the ground.  He did say that he was hoping that by June 1st. things may be back to normal...Trump said that this was based on models, which have been wrong in the past, so he did not and never has set a solid date...He said he would rely on the Dr's, but hoped for June 1st."

Other people work hard to try to make up for the lack of help from the federal government, or federal employees try to work behind the scenes to fix the problem. If the problem gets solved, Trump will take credit. If the problem does not get solved, the American public and media has the memory of goldfish. That's the Trump formula to success."
2020-03-30 21:32,"I'm speculating here, but it seems likely to me that the discussions taking place in the oval office concerning the pandemic are invariably predicated on doing what is most likely to ensure victory in November. It would be nice to think that some consideration is given to doing what is best for the health and welfare of Americans, but anyone with an open mind who has been following along knows that isn't the case. Yes, we elected a winner-I've never doubted that for a moment. However, the problem for the nation is that his winning often comes at our expense."

Meanwhile the ticker on CNN now shows 3,000 Americans dead from coronavirus including 486 just today and 158,400 cases SO FAR.  BTW, just NY State has 10 TIMES the virus cases & deaths as the entire country of Canada despite having less than 1/3 of Canada's population.  Now Trump is actually bragging that USA will likely have ""only 100,000 to 200,000 deaths from the virus not the millions some predicted"".  Is this guy for real??"
2020-03-30 21:33,"From his perch in the White House Trump doesn't govern, he struts, he pouts, he preens, he tweets. The sages of Fox interpret and with divine guidance express his desires in words and ideas. These the President uses in a stream of consciousness feedback loop of hyper hunch and DNA based intuition called a presser. Thus America understands his will and bows before the bigliest brilliance of all time."
2020-03-30 21:33,I think he was originally going for herd mentality and spreading the virus  so everyone got the virus and only the strong survived. Maybe he thought if you got the virus and survived you'd be immune and that would save having to discover a vaccine.

2020-03-30 21:27,"Trump said he testing kits are no longer necessary.

Whatever happened to what's-his-name Biden? He's disappeared and, I think, has dropped out of the race. Sanders? Nice old man with good ideas, but offensive to listen to. I'd like to meet him and maybe someday I will. It's like taking to one of my neighbors over a glass or two or three of a decent New England wine. Frankly, the USA lacks any leadership at all. Putin could easily slip in and be awarded a lifetime presidency. I bet he would make thing happen."
2020-03-30 21:29,We have a president who openly said he would punish any governor who does not praise him by diverting federal support from their state. Think about that.  That is what demagogues in totalitarian regimes do to people.  Where is the outcry fro republicans.  Crickets.  Can you imagine if a president Hillary had said something like that.

A. We still don't have enough tests to test all who need it.
B. Even that reduced number is too many for the labs to process.

I guess since Trump was able to be tested, in his (twisted) mind, it's no longer an issue.

This is what happens when you allow completely biased media outlets transmit and produce their propaganda for a few decades. Ignorance elects the ignorant."

2020-03-30 21:37,The idea that the federal government is solely responsible for providing these and supplies  is political. When States took the Obama era Obamacare-medicaid/care  cash to run it themselves they made a devil's bargain. Trump wasn't that devil.

We will double down to make sure we only get factual information out to the public regarding this situation. We are also going to avoid idle speculation until there is sufficient data to support any predictions on when circumstances will change""?

Yeah. Neither can I."
2020-03-30 21:42,"Trump and his crew of ""Task Force"" people should suit up and visit NYC ED's, tent hospitals, etc.  They should staff testing centers and tell people how we have plenty of tests.  Having a parade of Republican donors speak at the Rose Garden about how they are making masks without filters in classic Trump:  All style and no substance.  Is that the best this country can do?"
2020-03-30 21:39,"The president puts himself up there on the national stage in full self-congratulatory regalia, spewing misinformation around as though the supply of it were drying up. That's why Americans are hoarding toilet paper. There will never be enough to wipe up this mess."

The spectacle of all these capable people (not Larry Kudlow) trying to steer him in the right direction is sad. He finally understands that the epidemic is not good, but the idea that testing might be important for the recovery is still way too complicated."
2020-03-30 21:41,"I’m sorry, but is this really newsworthy? We all know by now, if Trump’s lips are moving, he is lying...so why report it? And as a banner headline? How about placing the emphasis on verifiable information we can all really use?

If this is about keeping the public informed, then leaveTrump’s vacuous nonsense to his Twitter feed and his propaganda machine at Fox. But if this is about stoking the outrage machine for ratings, then give it a rest, NYT; we all have much bigger fish to fry right now..."
2020-03-30 21:42,"Testing is useful in treating ill people. And it is useful when you have a chance to contain the pandemic. Trump blew that chance months ago. At this point the virus is everywhere in the US so everyone must take care not to catch the virus too soon, and don't expect to be tested several times before you eventually catch the virus. The best test for widespread use is a test for antibodies rendering you immune, at least for a while.

Look at this frequently updated map from John Hopkins:

<a href=""https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"" target=""_blank"">https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6</a>

The US is currently just some 816 cases short of 160k confirmed cases and 55 deaths short of 3k departed. You will reach both before this day is done.

The US is way past containing the pandemic, it is now all about ensuring your health care systems can cope with the number of cases, and keep your most vulnerable safe for as long as possible. Never mind the ""economy"" it will tank anyway, and the less control you have over the spreading the worse the crash.

The worst in the US is how fast you burn your health care professionals. With 25% already in isolation, how many will be left in a week? Ventilators need professional operators not to damage the patients. 

In Denmark we are talking about lifting some of the tough restraints after Easter and the first diminutive easing is done this week. But our citizens are collectively taking responsibility and listen to the very clear plan of our government."

America, do you remember how we felt when 3,000 Americans died on September 11th, 2001?! We are nearing that number in Covid19 deaths,  and it’s projected to be worse. Trump’s delusional, he lives in an alternate universe. 

America STILL doesn’t have ENOUGH test kits! Why?!"

The only people I can think of who would still support him are those he see him as being just like them, but with more money and chutzpah.  We don't need a president who is just regular folks, we need somebody who is the smartest, best educated, most empathetic, most imaginative, most committed, most honest person we can find.  

If Donald Trump continues to drag his feet on every issue regarding the pandemic, he will drag the whole country down with him."
2020-03-30 21:43,"""All nations get the government they deserve."" This is about Trump and the 2016 election, but it is also the culmination of a lot of choices over long decades. But I do not foresee this country making any real changes even with this epidemic. America is far too entrenched in itself. It even clouds our view of the crisis, so we are unlikely to learn the right lessons. This is a nation of people who keep sticking their hands into the fire, get burned, get angry at ""elites"" or whoever, then proceed to stick their hands in their fire again."

(The CDCs failed us here too since initially specimens needed to be shipped mainly to the CDC Labs.)

From a neighborhood clinic, these swabs are picked up daily by couriers, but only once. At day's end. As a result, it takes up to 10 days to get your results. 

My sister, an Internist working near Chicago, tells me they have reduced this turnaround time significantly by having their own hospital's lab (staffed typically by LabCorp or Quest employees) to perform tests on-site. 

Results can be made available within 24 to 48 hours.

This approach should be adopted by most clinics and hospitals so as to more timely detect, monitor and control the spread of the Coronavirus."

The Reagan Restoration is the most destructive American political force in the last century. (The second-most is the Democratic Party's complicity in it.) Trump is just a cruder Reagan.

More abusive behavior. Mr Prez, stop your lies! Just stop. Try for one day not to abuse people, especially our medical heroes working on front lines in blue states.

This was a supposed journalist who was passed the mic and legitimately asked that jaw-dropping, terrifying question. WHY is this cancer still in our Oval Office?!?!"

He started up by saying that we would have ￼￼￼￼ widespread and efficient make testing that would make a huge difference.￼ it will take a while for The significance of what fauci set to penetrate trump’s facade."
2020-03-30 22:15,"Trump's downplaying & direct misleading to Americans of in contrast, a potential deadliness he was aware of with coronavirus, began in January while upset with House Democrats' engaged in impeachment proceedings of him.

As result, and due to his failure of any immediate & sufficient response in preparation to have testing available for Americans; plus warn all U.S. governors to prepare their states for possible war battle against this pandemic; (which the W.H.O. shortly later on January 30th declared it in being a ""Global Health Emergency""); both Americans' lives, and America's healthcare system are at great risk, (as opposed to initially only Obamacare for the latter).

Now the question is was that really why the leader of the free world acted in this latest irresponsible like means; and was it his purposeful intent to do so?

Remember, this is the same Donald J. Trump who once Nancy Pelosi  announced in September the House would be opening Impeachment Hearings against him, had stated that day and a short time after:
(1) ""Impeachment? Impeached For What?""
(2) ""If I get impeached, a Civil War would break out in this country ""like it has never seen before"".""

In addition, the same Donald J. Trump while golfing at Mar a Lago during Christmas break, ordered the assassination of head Iranian General Soleimani, for political hope that Iran would start a war against America.

So Trump ended up with his wish of America being at war; though in a never thought of possible means."

When I hear Acosta of CNN and Alcinor of PBS and Peter Alexander of NBC ask logical questions which Trump says are snarky, I know right away that he cannot answer them because they reflect on his competence. He dragged his feet. He talks without thinking. He shoots from the hip. He changes his statements almost every 24 hours. Fauci corrects him constantly. And I believe Fauci. But wait, there's more. I just looked up ""OAN"" news which I never heard of but which is apparently a far right outlet who Trump constantly indulges. I wonder why."
2020-03-30 22:19,"Trump sows disinformation, pitting people against people. The complexity of dealing with the virus on a local and national level are way beyond Trump’s ability to to understand. He utterly lacks compassion, so cannot respond on a human level. Without understanding, he is incapable of planning and acting effectively.  He is unable to lead. Confusion reigns. His mismanagement and denial about the seriousness of this pandemic, confusing pronouncements, heavy on his ( ignorant) gut feelings, absent science, absent data, absent truth put us in grave danger. Broadcasting his nightly press conferences do way more harm than good."

One time, when the parity of the local currency in relation to the U.S. Dollar skyrocketed one of those “leaders” came out to the balcony of the government palace and told the hundreds of thousand of unconditional followers massed below in the adjacent esplanade: “The enemies of our country complain that the price of U.S. Dollar is too high.  That is irrelevant!  Did anyone of you ever see a U.S. Dollar bill?” and the crowd exploded into an ovation.

2020-03-30 22:26,Don’t believe anything that Trump says.
2020-03-30 22:27,"Testing was an issue on March 13th only two weeks ago when Trump held a meeting about it with Dr Birx toadying up to an unscientific Dr Strangetrump.

""DR. BIRX:  Well, with the prior testing, it was taking several days because the test is slower.  We believe with this test, because of its throughput, that the testing can be from start — remember, it has to transport — to the laboratory that will run it.  And then we’re hoping that all can be finished within 24 hours, which is very similar to other tests that you receive today.""
""These are not point-of-care tests.  We are working on point-of-care tests, but we have to realize point-of-care tests take six months or more to develop.  So we’re not waiting for those.  We’re still diagnosing this on nucleic acid, so as an antibody.   This is actually the antigen — the actual virus in your nose that we’re amplifying.""

In that statement- with Dr Trump standing within 6 feet of her, they seem to be selling the urgency of testing as an issue and that they were as a team right on to it. Now Trump is saying he hasn't heard about it in weeks. 
That quote was from was 2 weeks ago. The usual insult-to-the-intelligence prevaricating.
Yet according to the NYT
""President Trump told governors on a conference call Monday that he “hasn’t heard about testing in weeks,” suggesting that a chronic lack of kits to test people for the coronavirus is no longer a problem. ""
When he isn't lying he is exaggerating- usually it is both."

Thanks, Republicans!"
2020-03-30 22:32,"President Donald Trump said that NYC hospital doctors and nurses are stealing and criminally hoarding/selling masks. He didn't suggest it or make an inference to that, Mr. Cuomo - he stated it. How? By saying that publicly it means he believes it. Otherwise, why even say such a disgusting thing? The president of the US is a disgrace. He is as fraud and proven liar. Why is he still in office? Enough is enough.  Why can't Cuomo, Pence, Pelosi, Barr, … the United States Marine Corp., anyone in authority or with even a whiff of concern for America take control of this reprobate?

It is interesting that all politicians are saying we must not be complacent in our taking serious the threat of COVID-19. They themselves, every single one of them, is complacent and does not care about the average American as long as Trump remains ""president"". He is not a president - one who leads - by any stretch of the imagination.

The only real threat, other than the coronavirus itself, is Donald J. Trump. And that is a fact."

2020-03-30 22:32,"What does it mean for the healthcare system to ""collapse?""

I imagine it means that the facilities are completely overrun with cases, healthcare workers themselves are falling to the illness and can no longer work in ever increasing numbers, there is so little equipment that the remaining doctors and other workers cannot attend to the sick, and cannot protect themselves and their own families from their exposure.

And that the diminishing number of doctors and other workers start to give up and walk away because it is dangerous and futile to continue."
2020-03-30 22:33,Can’t you journalists just very clearly state that Trump is lying?  Use that word so it’s very clear to anyone who reads what you say!!!
2020-03-30 22:35,I know someone who was turned away from two hospitals because staff said he just had a cold. They did no testing. Three days later he went to ER and is now in critical condition in a coma with the corona virus. He is not expected to make it. This cavalier attitude toward testing is killing otherwise healthy people.
2020-03-30 22:35,"“Mr. Trump viewed the pandemic as primarily about how it would affect his re-election chances and sought to minimize it for his own sake rather than respond to it as we needed.”

Our very own Dear Leader lies over and over again, makes false claims, makes empty promises, routinely berates the press and individual reporters, struts, preens, boasts, self-congratulates, and lies some more.  And we are supposed to APPRECIATE his supreme incompetence??!!

Doesn't Trump understand that any ""thanks"" or ""appreciation"" or ""respect"" he receives is totally and completely insincere?  You would think HE, at least, would understand the concept of ""fake"" and ""insincere.""

I think that Trump and his administration and those advisers who supported the wind back, should be sued, and as soon as possible. Apologies if this is already happening. In my opinion like the previous French government, there is culpable negligence."

But when using a 90 minute pandemic update briefing as he did on Sunday for its majority in a narcissistic means, in showing no concern or care for the situation and all Americans' well being;& especially those in the medical field risking their own lives in battle; is as low as it gets for anyone, yet alone a U.S. president.

It was bad enough to have him claim his COVID-19 briefings ratings are better than ""Monday Night Football's"" for one in comparison.

But to add in acknowledging Dr. Fauci's earlier morning warning of the possible U.S. case and death counts; in stating in related key words, ""if we hold the U.S. deaths to under 100,000 in all, we would have done a great job"" is not only a lower comment; but also one alone which makes the need for the 25th to be invoked immediately."

Do you agree?

Just to be clear that 200,000 deaths is the BEST CASE scenario in the opinion of Trump's people, not what they think is going to ACTUALLY OCCUR.

They still refuse to say publically what they think is REALLY going to happen, but TWO MILLION Americans dead is a number frequently spoken as a REALISTIC expectation of what Americans should brace themselves for.

That would be more deaths than America has experienced in her history of wars and any other catastrophe.

How many deaths is it going to take before America decides to rid herself once and for all of Donald Trump this coming November?

How many deaths are enough for America to finally insist that Donald Trump resign?

How many deaths because of Donald Trump's incompetence and callousnes are acceptable to you?

What number is where YOU draw the line?"
2020-03-30 22:46,"Trump says testing is no longer an issue but governors ""painted a different picture.""

The problem is not just President No Responsibility; it’s Republicans’ Conservative ideology.

2020-03-30 22:54,"Trump tries to look like the greatest leader possible while thinking the way to calm people is to mislead them into thinking all is well and under control when it is not. Contrast this with Governor Cuomo who follows the example of our great leaders who tell it like it is but in a way that gives a sense that all that can be done is but we have to work together to try to bring about the better outcome that is possible. People know that knowing is better that not, even if the circumstances are grave, but Trump does not know that."
2020-03-30 22:55,"Trump must resign now!!!  If you can't support that, then you are part of the problem.

What do you think?  Now's not the time?  A month from now?  Never?"
2020-03-30 22:55,Hasn’t heard about testing probably because those who know about it have stopped mentioning it in his presence because it upsets him and he thinks it’s part of a plot to overthrow his regime and he’ll throw a tantrum and go into a snit.
2020-03-30 22:55,"Please, I beg you. Just stop reporting the nonsense that Trump spouts from the podium, on social media and in his propaganda-laced appearances on Fox state television.  It is not informative; it is not productive; it is misleading at best; petty, childish, vituperative, mendacious, self-serving or simply delusional much of the time.

We already know the man is spectacularly overmatched and ill-suited to the job of President, whether during times of tranquil prosperity or in crisis. We know. Just stop reminding us. It’s simply depressing - and we don’t need any more of that at the moment, do we?"
2020-03-30 22:56,I'm sure the name of Donald Trump will remain as a stain in American history.

No other country in the world will be even close to that many deaths and the reporters and news pundits just accept it like an off handed comment instead of asking how did that happen so fast and call this dope out for his handling.
2020-03-30 22:56,Please stop reporting on what Individual 1 says. Please stop showing pictures of him. Please stop. You don't publish the names of mass shooters. Don't publish his name either. He is a danger to this country. Everything he says endangers us. STOP.

If we ""win"" the election and sleepy Joe Biden is the person who paves our way into the future, we'll still be as woefully inadequate and behind the times in 2024 as we are now. We will be having these exact same conversations  about Europe having what we don't. We still won't have universal healthcare, a liveable wage, family leave, action on climate change, or subsidized childcare. But we'll be talking about how badly we need it and how progressives are the real enemy because their ideas are too extreme. Congratulations us."
2020-03-30 22:59,"He’s a storyteller, that Trump. Sometimes the stories he tells— which are made up on the spot however the spirit moves him— resemble actual events with real people. Often, however, they do not."
2020-03-30 23:02,"Here in Utah, I have a co-worker who is in his 70's. He was denied a test today. He was exposed to a Covid positive co-worker two weeks ago (who was denied testing for two weeks, then finally got a test on 3/24). Now another co-worker tested positive this past Saturday, 3/28. Then today with Trump saying testing is no longer an issue, he was denied a test due to insufficient symptoms."
2020-03-30 23:03,"Trump:  ""I haven't heard about testing in weeks"" - ! All he needed to do was actually get on the phone and call the governors - you know all of them, not just those who only told him how great he is and what he wants to hear - and receive actual input, without arguing or attacking.  He might listen to news other than Fox and he would hear about the problem nightly.  

This highlights the total lack of competency of Trump, and the degree to which he is totally ill equipped to handle this crisis.   This is one more in a long list of examples of his either outright lying to cover up for the failures of the response, or his failure to be on top of the issues involved.  Either way, it is a failure of leadership."
2020-03-30 23:04,"The US is on an exponential curve. The demands for tests to keep up with the fast growing number of cases can't be fulfilled. It is a simple mathematical fact. Never mind the Trump fantasies. When test results are also delayed for days or a week, the use is limited.

Tests in the US are mostly limited to those with severe symptoms to direct the correct treatment in the health systems. They are not available to adjust behavior or various otherwise sensible personal precautions, as mentioned below by Emma Ess.

It is dangerous for the US health systems and supporting services your frontline personel is not better protected. The US do not have unlimited numbers of doctors and nurses and as they are contaminated too, the already weak capacity in your health systems is further diminished. 

You do not have unlimited numbers of skilled first respond crew either. The chain of services in your health care is depleted fast when the frontline personel lack the most rudimentary PPE and safety measures. The same goes for the crew in elderly care.

Trump can waffle, brag and blame as much as he likes, but the buck stops with his inadequate childish response to the early warnings in January."

He is using the national stage to lie, gaslight, revise history, attack fellow Americans, spread hate and otherwise use them as a method of self-aggrandizement through having sycophants praise him endlessly.

So how could he say there hasn't been talk of testing in weeks unless he is lying?  He lies all the time.  Trump is truly a dishonest, monstrous human being."

You see, Mr. Trump has adopted a two track approach to this crisis:

1.  He clearly is listening to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx and others who are making clear to him the scope of this horrific contagion.  Evidence: Trump has extended to April 30 his preferred date for a resumption of some economic activity in the US.  (Dr. Fauci has indicated that the date could slip further.)  Mr. Trump is no fool: he knows that Dr. Fauci is his ticket to emerging in one piece from this crisis.

2.  At the same time, Mr. Trump is using the daily press briefings to demonstrate to his adoring supporters that he is in command.

He and his Republican enablers, due to  his gross dereliction of competence, have thus locked down the economy, which may lead us to a second Great Depression.  But instead of putting a  proper pause on the economy by paying employers directly to preserve all the locked up jobs and having a moratorium on all debt payments they have allowed millions of Americans to lose their jobs, their health insurance, and with this unnecessary disruption made inevitable enormous economic devastation. As usual Trump and his enablers show no awareness of this tragedy, no empathy, and no compassion for the immense anxiety and human suffering they have caused.
He continues to engage in partisan, petty, and vindictive politics and in shameless televised public relations press conferences in which he touts how great and incredible he and his administration is!

And those extraordinary human beings do that despite the innuendo and insult thrown at them by Trump, the very person that should be the first one to be appreciative of their heroism and dedication.

Tomorrow will be another day.  Most likely one more day of Trump’s lies, of Trump’s deceptive affirmations, of Trump’s gross misinformation, of Trump’s inhumane verbal abuse, of Trump’s narcissist self adulation.

The worldmeters site now lists over 3000 deaths from Covid-19 in the US, a grim milestone.

Over 162,000 infected people - another grim milestone.

Stay safe, listen to the guidance,

Social distance of 6 feet or more, no groups of people in numbers of 10 or more (better fewer than that);
Wash your hands carefully and often, especially after you touch something with your bare hands that could be contaminated;
Keep your hands off your face;
Minimize your ""face-to-face"" contact with others to the extent possible - use electronic communication if at all possible (a computer virus is a lot less hazardous than one that can kill you).

Do it for yourself, your family, your friends and neighbors.

Best wishes."
2020-03-30 23:44,"Trump apparently conversationally said he hadn't heard much about testing troubles from governors in a few weeks. Then, to create fake news, the media exclaims that Trump  stated testing is not important. All but the foolish can see that. 
  Similar to when he hoped it would get better by Easter. He hoped it would. He didn't imply it would. Then the media says  ""Trump disputes his experts. Says virus will end by Easter"". Fake news again.
   This type of disingenuous journalism is shallow. Some uninformed readers may actually believe what you say is actually true, not an implication based on someone's opinion about what Trump may have been thinking when he said it..The Russians, all politicians, lawyers and the NYT use the tactic of taking a kernel of truth, then twisting it to create the impression they favor. It's a disservice to the public for the NYT to use these tactics during the pandemic to create news simply to divide us when we need to work together."

2020-03-30 23:27,"PBS news just did a piece that reviewed the reasons that, in all cases that they interviewed, younger people who were not at risk of serious disease were not being tested.

The primary reason was that doctors and nurses did  not have the time to test them because they are taking care of serious cases and patients who are older and are at risk.

Trump cannot manufacture more Doctors and Nurses.

The secondary reason was that the supply of swabs, masks, and gowns is too limited to waste these resources on healthier younger people unless those younger people are themselves doctors, nurses are another health care professional.

There is a global supply chain problem with medical supplies, but Trump's trade policy that wanted to make these things in America will now start to happen and American finally will see the risk of outsourcing our supply chain to Communist China.  

Trump is right that testing is no longer an issue at least with those at serious risk, but it does inconvenience these young, healthy people that PBS interviewed who wanted to know if they had disease."

All the infectious disease experts said ""keep the infections growth / totals curve FLAT"" over time so that we don't overwhelm our nation's hospitals.  We do that by social distancing, not touching our eyes/nose/mouth or wear N95 facemasks, washing our hands with soap thoroughly and we need to identify those who have been infected and then we quarantine them and those who have been exposed to them.

How do we minimize damage to the economy and return people back to work as soon as possible ?  We need to quarantine only those people who are infected and or sick and return everybody else back to work !  And how do we find out who are infected ?  We need to TEST them which the Trump administration has not been doing and need to correct pronto !"

His biggest fear is 'the numbers won't look good'.  As you may recall, he had earlier stated that he didn't want the Princess Cruise Ship passengers to disembark, because 'I like the numbers where they are'.  Afraid the potential increase of coronavirus illnesses would spike, and it would make him look bad with his minions.  Coronavirus testing is more of the same.

It's difficult to not imagine how many of those lives could have been saved if those 10,000 ventilators in reserve had been sent to New York.

Last night the president had the brass to accuse individuals who were requesting medical equipment of either hoarding or stealing because the amounts being requested were so high.

Tonight I remain appalled by the continued arrogance and gamesmanship this president insists on playing.  People's lives are at stake and yet for days and days very little has been done to help combat these shortages.

Bear in mind that the threat became apparent in early January, labeled a pandemic by the WHO--and that little was done to prepare , in terms of protective garb and needed machines such as ventilators until mid March.  As any doctor can tell you, survival of a serious health crisis generally depends on receiving the needed help early.  
The ambulance which speeds the sick patient to the emergency ward in ten minutes is more likely to save that patient than the one with the three hour trip. 
The major complaint against Trump, which he blithely ignores. is that it took him more than two months to become serious about what is happening and is only now trying to get the public out of crowds and protective gear for front-line medical personnel and ventilators for the sick.

2020-03-31 1:29,"Oh my, there aren’t enough hours in the day to give the reasons. 

Immediate feedback and Lots of ongoing testing is critical

The point is to know who is infected, where they have been, whom they have been in close contact with, what vulnerable people depend on them , etc, etc, etc

Just finding out you are a carrier  BEFORE you go anyplace is critical to the threat you pose to others. 

Quickly finding out where you have been and quickly assessing your contacts can prevent further spread.

 Before you walk onto public transportation, you can know if you are dangerous to other people, and hopefully stay put. 

Knowing you live with a carrier might save your mother’s life 

Before standing in line at a grocery, you can know if you are going to zap or kill somebody in line with you  


These aren’t great examples, but if you assume everybody has the virus, don’t allow anyone to deliver anything, keep family members in their own room, do not leave the house. Assume you are dangerous and everyone is dangerous to you."

I would encourage reading the Guardians article of march 28, the lost six weeks. from that article,  “The US response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort,” Ron Klain, who spearheaded the fight against Ebola in 2014, told a Georgetown university panel recently. “What’s happened in Washington has been a fiasco of incredible proportions.”

Trump has already admitted that he opposes making voting easier, because ending voter suppression would erase the only possibility Republicans have of maintaining power.  But allowing coronavirus free rein among his supporters would cancel even the voter suppression advantage, and hand America back to the majority of Americans.

2020-03-31 2:06,"For those who don't think testing is important, here in Oregon we've had 11 people infected at a veteran's retirement home.

It wasn't until a couple of residents died that the state began using up its precious. limited test kits to test their fellow residents.  Then they discovered 6 more cases.  Which led them to test staff and one of the nurses tested positive.  As of today, there have been 11 positive tests at the home.

What if the first residents had not been tested?  The nurse would have continued working, unaware she was spreading the disease among the most vulnerable, and eventually the virus would have likely spread to most of the residents.

For the life of me, I cannot understand why people don't ""get"" that testing is necessary.  South Korea has tested 1/6th of its total population.  They had their first confirmed case the same day the U.S. did, but now we are far and away the most-infected country in the world, simply because we have NO IDEA who is walking around spreading the disease."

It is simply not the case that everything the President says is newsworthy because he is the President.

The deal is so good these companies are ""ramping up production"" to take full advantage.

Meanwhile time, lives, resources will be committed to intervening in this meaningless way, distracting from real care and no doubt preventing some from receiving viable care at all.

There are those cynics who will suspect this is a mad attempt to curry favor by scientists, so-called, who have abandoned any semblance of ethical behavior or professionalism.  Scientist who should be permanently removed from the bench once this mess is past.

I say that's needlessly cynical.  It's obvious we're being gifted these usless, suspect drugs because the money is so good.  Because added to the three trillions we just handed to these bozos,this bonanza could make for a really good year.

I hope that sooner than later, our mayors, governors, those in Congress who value life more than party, our military leaders and 'US' will all realize we must take this nation's response to the pandemic into our own hands in self-defense.

That's why at his daily briefing today, NY State Governor Andrew Cuomo had stated, ""this virus has been ahead of us from Day One.""

Testing being made available now is great news for future COVID-19 prevention &/or battle. But had Trump initially performed his job half as much dedicated and adequately sufficient as Cuomo does above and beyond each and every day, this pandemic level in America could have been greatly reduced had testing been here ahead of the virus instead.
 
As result, no U.S. state including both's own home bred one in New York itself, would have ever experienced this invisible COVID-19 infectious disease be at its highest daily level risk to its citizens lives.

So these doctors and nurses are putting their lives on the line with inadequate personal protective equipment, while the president is openly accusing them of petty thievery.

He personally insults reporters who ask tough questions and back peddles on everything from denying calling it a hoax to reopening businesses by Easter.

From day 1 of his campaign I found him offensive and crass. We all know he knows nothing about gov, has illusions of grandeur (rivaling Putin and Mussolini), and lies constantly. Nothing is his fault and he will throw anyone under the bus. BUT, what I now find more abhorrent is that he has allowed thousands of innocent people to die because he refused to acknowledge the severity of the virus as well as disbanding the committee that studied pandemics ( which he claims he knew nothing about and blamed it on Flynn). 

Despite this, his base will continue to support him and FOX news will continue to spread his lies. Everyone I know feels shell shocked. My niece works in a hospital on Long Island. I have a picture of her wearing a garbage bag to protect herself. She, like other healthcare workers, is very frightened.

2020-03-27 17:33,"Here is our obligatory sad-but-true story of how unfair the world is where greedy corporations get even more money while worthwhile humanitarian efforts suffer, but it also contains a hint of the hazy future of American nonprofits. In the last 40 years, the number of small nonprofits has exploded while the middle class (who provide most of the donations) has been hollowed out and its wealth systematically transferred to those already wealthy. Couple that with systematic deconstruction of social safety nets by conservative governments and skyrocketing needs, and you have the recipe for the demise of many good nonprofits. There are simply fewer donation dollars chasing too many good causes. And the future doesn’t look bright, either. Will Millennials who are laden with debt be able to support good causes financially the way previous generations have? 

The point is this: If we want an America that is “kinder and gentler” we will have to change our spending priorities at both government and personal levels to support it, and those who start nonprofits have to pay more attention to building financial resilience and community support rather than putting every dollar to direct mission. Donors will have to cheerfully give to building capacity instead of designating for direct mission only."

It avoided that disaster 3 years later by firing that CEO. So on to No 4 where things were great but it was time to retire as i was two years past normal time.

Covid19 should not be used as a crying towel any more than for profit companies such as Boeing. Doing good is alike to managing well. Failure or economic crises does not earn it deserve bailouts.

Individuals have to adjust to good and bad times with scant assistance from anyone.

Where do you think the people of your community really turn in a crisis like this, in the moment they lose their home? In the moment they realize their spouse will kill them the next time they get angry? The moment they run out of options to feed their children? This is the situation that exists, woven into the very fabric of our country, whether or not you can bear to face it. Does the government seem to be rising to the occasion to you?

Non-profits struggle because we have to pour resources into obtaining funding, pleasing donors, providing documentation for audits of every cent of minuscule government funding we fight to receive. All the while diligently maintaining that the vast, vast majority of that funding is going to direct services. While private companies are able to generously allocate funding to overhead costs - which enable an organization to succeed at its ultimate mission - non-profits must minimize overhead to ludicrously low levels in order to satisfy both individual and governmental grantors. It is an endless and thankless struggle.

The problem is not COVID-19, it is the way our government and our economy have been built to ignore the needs of the people in the pursuit of profit."
2020-03-28 10:46,"Over the decades I was administrator and later CEO of a range of small and very large nonprofits. Pre-retirement I was a board member of and planning/fundraising consultant to a similar range of nonprofits.

In the best of times small non-profits without endowments led a hand-to-mouth existence, struggling each year to meet payroll and program costs.

Even institutions with 7- or 8-figure endowments usually had to work hard to raise enough money to meet annual expenses. Institutions with budgets of 100 million plus maintained vast fund-raising staffs and efforts to keep the money coming in, some for operations, some to build endowments still further.

Coronavirus and its impact on the economy will devastate the poorer part of the non-profit spectrum, driving many out of business in a matter of months as attendance drops and donations dry up. 

Mid-size institutions can cut programs and staff to try to weather the storm until the economy stabilizes and then improves, whenever that might be.

Larger organizations can cut staff and programs and, if absolutely necessary, take the fraught step of dipping into endowment.

The flow of donations has already been truncated by the sharp financial downturn; previously generous supporters still don’t know how far their assets and incomes might drop in the months to come, so they are sitting on their checkbooks.

The worthiness and importance of nonprofits are not in question; the near- and long-term survival of these institutions is."
2020-03-28 12:04,"Most small nonprofits live hand to mouth and do not have endowments.

However, most nonprofit organizations with endowments have a mechanism that allows them to “borrow” from their own endowments to cover operating expenses. This process varies according to federal and state laws and institutional charters and by-laws, so consulting an experienced attorney is a must.

Of course such “self-loans” are approved by a nonprofit’s board of directors only in extreme emergencies because drawing down endowment reduces income from endowment, an erosion of a fiscal resource that cannot be continued indefinitely; it is generally considered bad practice and even unethical to deplete endowments in most cases.

Most of the very large non-profits in NYC have large or huge endowments, so they have internal financial resources they can use in emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. 

However, channeling relief loans and grants only to the biggest and most successful institutions is rather like withholding ventilators and ICU beds from coronavirus patients over 60, or disabled, or with underlying conditions. 

This very serious medical issue is only now being discussed openly in the NYT and other media, so perhaps it is only fitting that we see the start of an open discussion of whether in this medical/financial crisis triage must be applied to select out the nonprofits least likely to survive."
2020-03-28 13:26,"I have read all of these comments carefully and would like to pivot to a more tactical (and practical) conversation.  

Non-profit organizations are struggling with if and how to fundraise during this unprecedented crisis.  The answer is that they must fundraise.  Many - if not most - non-profits rely upon a combination of contributed and earned revenue (think tuition, ticket sales, counseling fees, etc)

For most of my clients and the many,  many non-profits I have spoken with over the past couple of weeks, earned revenue has essentially dried up.  At the same time, many continue to provide services, in particular to vulnerable populations whose needs have exploded.  

The best advice I can give non-profits is to utilize your board  more than ever to make your case with your most loyal donors, and for the board, itself, to give generously.

The U.S. is unlike any other country in our reliance upon and support of non-profit organizations.  I strongly encourage NYTimes readers to give to the organizations of your choice to the best of your abilities."

My son owns a restaurant (take-out boxes only now) and has no problem splitting dishes.  That is not considered rude.  Some restaurants will have a small extra charge to do it while others do not.

2020-03-26 20:51,"Since the friend doesn't want to split orders yet wastes food, why not ask her if she'll agree to separate what she plans to eat from the rest of the food on her plate so you can take home what is left over?

It sounds like a lot to ask, but throwing away edible food is environmentally unfriendly and wasteful."
2020-03-26 17:32,"Should the parents in the first letter change the locks and the door and not give sonny boy a key and keep the doors locked?  They could explain they want to limit his traffic given the virus is so transmittable and they want to assure that he sanitize and stay at a distance when he visits since he's out and about and hanging around with others.  They could sanitize door handles, surfaces he touches and such in his presence. Give the lad some hand sanitizer to carry around with him.  Maybe that would get through to him he is being irresponsible?  Taking what I'm sure sounds like a harsh measure to them would even start to work with him after the pandemic."

2020-03-26 18:03,"Wasting food seems far more rude to me than sharing. 

As a single person who eats out often with friends (pre-Covid-19), sometimes I share with friends, sometimes not. It never crossed my mind that it was rude. And if I thought about it, I would not care. But to each, her own."
2020-03-26 18:13,"Letter writer 1, GG--I don't think your son has failed to launch, but you have some lines in the sand to draw out.  1.  No more bringing his laundry home.  At all, now or later.  The world has laundromats and he can go there. 2. And, no more free dinners--he brings a bag of groceries every third dinner and makes the meal.  3. And right now, he cannot come to your house as he is not practicing social distancing, and you need to stay safe.  I have two sons in their 20's, and I get it.  But, he will continue with these lackadaisical attitudes/practices until you set the limits."
2020-03-26 19:44,"At 25 he's bringing his laundry home?
Parents have to take a look in the mirror, see that they're enablers.
Start by cutting off the laundry service."
2020-03-26 19:48,"Two observations / memories from my childhood.
The first is how my parents treated me.
 They were very disciplined on me - never hit or abused me. But they let me know that I was expected to share their standards, which included, among others,- respect, kindness and the keeping of one's word.  The idea was that they were disciplined on me until I could be disciplined on myself.
The second is how they treated others.
Out with my father one day, we were walking towards what in those past times in the UK was called - a tramp.  (A homeless, vagrant person). As this very dirty and drunk chap approached, he stopped, took off his hat and acknowledged us, saying ""Good morning to you and your son."" My father stopped, raised his hat and said, while slightly bowing, ""Thank you. And good morning to you, sir""  My Dad explained that there was no reason why the tramp, or anyone, should be embarrassed by being ignored."
2020-03-26 19:51,"this newspaper reported today, 03/26, in article titled, ""What You Can Do About Coronavirus Right Now"" that in the space of a month one person can infect up to 400 people.  

The 'failure-to-launch adult child is a health threat to many many people including his parents.  One of the people he infects (before he has symptoms) may infect someone who infects me when i have to venture out to grocery-shop. His parents make me angry to by continuing to enable the son's irresponsible/dangerous-to-all-of-us behavior & by ignoring his endangering them."
2020-03-26 19:55,"The parents of the freeloading son need to show some tough love.  Your house, your rules, no free lunches. It will be a good lesson in what to expect in the real world once he decides to grow up. 
As for the meal splitting dilemma, try a tapas restaurant."
2020-03-26 20:03,"My sister lives in Lousiana and has had to tell her 25 year old daughter to stay away because her 21 year old daughter has bad asthma and covid would kill her.  She had to make the decision to tell the oldest to stay away for 2 weeks and let her come visit when she could prove she had self-quarantined.  Sometimes you just have to make tough choices.

As for the plate splitting, I feel the same as the friend that doesn't want to split.  Not comfortable with it and being forced or guilted in doing so will probably cause me to not eat with that person again."
2020-03-26 20:25,"I don't take the excuse that today is a challenging time for a 'failure to launch'.

When I was 20, my father died, my mother had 8th grade elementary school education, she was unable to make any decisions, my sister was in high school and I was entering my second year of Med School.

So please, don't talk to me about challenging times.

What has happened to America!?!?

What better time to carve out your place in the world than now?"
2020-03-26 18:09,"Why are the ""freeloader""'s parent allowing this kid to come back home when they know he refuses to practice social distancing? It's a risk to themselves as much as him. As for his ""failure to launch,"" I have to say the parents' behavior sounds awfully enabling. Please: let him do his own laundry and don't feel obliged to feed him unless it's really because you all enjoy each other's company. Otherwise, you are working hard to prevent him from launching."
2020-03-26 19:50,"I wouldn't withhold food from my child, even an adult child. It is stingy, cruel and petty. As for laundry, it would infuriate me when my adult brothers would ask our parents to do their laundry. How can anyone starve a child no matter what their age? BTW - It's the senior citizens (and I *might* be considered one) I see around here who are not social distancing. The younger boomers, GenXers, millennials and younger, like the letter writer's son's age, are doing just fine with this. YMMV."
2020-03-26 18:19,"Re splitting restaurant meals: It's fine if she doesn't want to split a dish, but it's shameful not to eat leftovers from the oversize portions restaurants insist on serving us. It's more healthful and saves money, too."
2020-03-26 21:33,"It sweet to want to help your child but it is not helpful, specially if you know you have done everything you can already. I grew up with 4 siblings, all of us took care of the house chores and cooking, while my parents worked. When my mom migrated to the US, I, at 12, did all the cooking and grocery shopping and got As at school. We didn’t have money and my parents pushed us to work. We now take care of both our parents. We were lucky and worked hard. I have a half brother that is about 29 and when he needs a hand, I will help him. But he expected to find whatever job he can ASP. And he does. He was the only one my dad didn’t push, and it almost ruined him. It has taken him most of his 20s to realize that and now he is trying to catch up. If my brother can find a job without a college degree and little social network, so can your son. Let him grow up and help only when you see he has really giving it all, but don’t treat him like a child. He can cook and  do his laundry out."
2020-03-26 21:42,"The parents should not allow their son into their home until he has self quarantined for 14 days.  Now, their first duty is to protect themselves. It makes no sense to blame the parents or him now.  We do not know who will survive this crisis.  Address the underlying issues later."
2020-03-26 21:53,"He hasn’t sadly failed to launch. He has parents who have failed to do their jobs. Out on his own, he will learn (the hard way, thanks to your failure to give him the skills he needs to survive on his own) how to survive, be appreciative and develop empathy. As a 60 year old Grandparent, I see a lot of this going on with my younger friends. You failed. Now, time to redeem yourselves and teach life skills."
2020-03-26 22:03,"To the parents of the 25-year-old young man: sounds to me like your son is suffering from a lack of self-confidence and is avoiding putting himself out into the larger world to find out about what he can do with his life--a real shame, yes, but not a total loss.

It seems what your son needs is to feel a sense of accomplishment--testing himself to see what he can do without fear of failing. 

The best thing you could do for him is to tell him during a serious ""family meeting"" on the phone that you cannot allow him to be in the house for 14 days because of safe distancing, effective immediately--sticking with it by remaining firm but caring.

Next, when the two weeks has ended, and hopefully he and you are all still uninfected, he needs to be told in no uncertain terms that, although he is loved, he cannot jeopardize your health by continually coming in and out of your home to do laundry, or anything else. You can talk by phone or email or Skype to remain in touch, but no visits until the pandemic has ended.

Finally, by using this time apart, he has had to go out into the world (as dangerous as it is right now) and figure out how to take care of himself and meet his own needs.

When this is all over, I feel confident that he'll have learned (very quickly) that he is capable, that he can survive on his own, and that he's grown up quite a lot in the process--all part of his gaining self confidence in his abilities.

As hard as it is, leave him alone to make his way."
2020-03-26 22:09,"Poor baby. His parents should certainly avoid hurting his feelings at all costs. The combination of things that are mentioned show show someone who is completely self centered. He is not even concerned that his actions are adding a significant risk to his parents. And life is so tough for today’s 25 year olds? Try telling that to the many immigrants who come to the US. Most arrive because of economic opportunities, and they work hard to make their lives, and the lives of their children, better."
2020-03-26 22:36,"From the perspective of the sciences relevevant to this context, and making inferences as to parent's age, child and parent comorbidities, location of the child's and parents' residences, etc., the son's defiant behaviour is likely placing the parents in much greater danger than he is placing himself (unless he has significant pre-existing conditions/practices that have compromised lung or general health). 

As such, if the way the son was raised does not offer a path to persuasion in the direction of immediate practical concern for someone other than himself (i.e., concern for his parents safety, and those downstream with whom they might come into contact), then he should be treated as any in that area that are increasingly likely to be contagious. And if his behaviour is that of someone less considerate of the parents than any stranger, perhaps he needs to face this through imposed distancing, for his own sake, and the sake of the many others he is on track to endanger. 

Otherwise, I find the indulgent, permissive perspectives expressed by PG and others regarding today's young people historically naïve and contrary to evidence (and so disrespecting) of the many equally young who serve in the front lines of the pandemic—e.g., in health care positions, and as first responders—or otherwise serve others in the Peace Corps, the military, etc. 

We must tell ourselves the truth regarding the potential and capabilities of our young people, before we can persuade them."
2020-03-26 23:14,"I'm so grateful Philip Galanes' grace and sensitivity, which he unfailingly delivers week after week. Contrast his tone with the dozens of frothing adults on this comments thread, tripping over themselves to pass judgement on a 25-year old. There's a lot of projection going on.

Remember that the father's account is only one side of the story, and frankly, it sounds like he dislikes his son. His letter is extremely judgmental and out of touch with the lived reality of many, many young people. ""Failed to launch"" means living in a shared apartment with many roommates? Seriously? That's an economic reality shared by millions of young and not-so-young Americans. The son hasn't found a career path at 25, and the father can ""almost"" deal with it? Please. It sounds like the son is working and paying rent, the father just doesn't approve of the way he does either.

As someone who has lived in crowded apartments with many roommates, I can attest that it's not easy. Put in his shoes, many people would choose to have a calm dinner with parents once in a while. And who knows - maybe he actually enjoys their company! 

But I do agree that the son is putting himself and his parents at risk by not adhering to social distancing, which by the way, is very hard to do when you live with many roommates. Boundaries should be communicated and agreed upon. Unfortunately, clear and open communication seems to be a pretty big hurdle here. Set aside the criticisms for ten minutes and see what happens."
2020-03-26 23:38,"The parents themselves are failing to follow recommended social distancing techniques every time they allow their son into the house. The kid's lifestyle, career path, and alleged freeloading are completely beside the point. If it is still a parent's responsibility to model socially responsible behavior to a 25 year old (which is, I admit, a dubious proposition) then the best example they can set would be actually practicing social distancing themselves."
2020-03-27 0:16,"Every generation has its challenges. My son left home at 18, but he struggled with temp jobs and roommates until nearly 40, and I pitched in to help a few times. I didn’t judge because I had asked his grandparents for help a￼ time or two in my 30s. I discovered through genealogy research that my grandfather never launched at all circa 1900, just brought his wife home and joined the extended family of parents, married sibs and their kids—21 people under one roof. Each sibling left when they had savings to buy a home, often on the same block. My grandfather moved out at age 29 with 3 kids. They were rebels; bought a house a mile away."
2020-03-27 0:17,"Freeloading 25-year-old son. The operative words here are: passive-aggressive behavior & communication, codependency, enabling and resentments. These are your issues, not his. Your issues also include failure to raise a responsible, considerate, conscientious, responsible young man. At 25, if he doesn’t have these qualities, the only person you can blame is in the mirror when you and your spouse are standing next to one another. Now, to be clear, I’m a nature *and* nurture person and there are kids whose genetics make them at risk for the development of mental health and social functioning issues. For nearly all kids, good-enough parenting will normally suffice to address these, or at least moderate them. For the most part, “the bad seed” is an urban legend, though a mainstay of American culture.

However, the way you laid out the situation, the language you used, was incredibly telling. Raising successful, decent children is about modeling the behavior you want your children to exhibit, behaviorism, loving them and demonstrating this, and a good balance of, well, everything. 

So, I would suggest therapy for you, and, if you can get them to do it, your son and spouse. 

Finally, don’t feel too bad. Ineffective parenting (and I don’t mean abusive) is rife in the US (along with passive-aggressive communication & behavior). You are not alone. You just need some therapy and read a few good books on healthy, constructive, assertive communication and behavior.

Tell your child he can come home only once he’s grown up. Until then, he’s forbidden.

Splitter: Ethicist is right. Order your own food, and take the leftovers home with you. Nothing wrong with stretching lunch to also be your dinner. There is also absolutely nothing ethical about bending your friend to your will. I’d bet good money that they’ve waited tables at some point, and know darn well that restaurants and waiters lose money on total cheapskates."

So she now has a parasite to deal with, but that's not our problem."
2020-03-26 22:08,Indulgence of this kind is so sad to me. It infantilizes the child and does not make them learn they can do things on their own. I know it is hard.

The parents in the letter raised a failed adult and the key is the statement ""we do everything for him."" I wouldn't let him in the house at all, but they have obviously catered to him his entire life in an effort to be loved."

Give him a warning beforehand that you will do this and see if he changes his behaviour.  He will not and laugh it off, of course - that's when you report him to the authorities.  Before all this, heed the advice of others here, and make sure he doesn't step foot in your house any longer while the pandemic is raging on."

2020-03-27 14:50,"Regarding restaurant meals:
You can't ask him to share while he's eating it, but you can stay after he's left. ""No, you go on ahead, I've got to XYZ."" Once he's gone, he doesn't have any say. You should respect him while he's there, but you don't have to respect silly, wasteful behavior when he leaves. Once he abandons something, he has no say over what anyone does with it. The restaurant is just going to throw the food away. Waste not, want not.  This is why cops can take fingerprints off abandoned water glasses.

Fair game. 

Online Yoga Classes:
Contact the studio and suggest that you might pay a moderate monthly fee that you could afford? Even $25 or $30 would probably go a long way to helping them make ends meet during the pandemic. They are undoubtedly paying increased overhead for folks using their services. Make a donation once a week that amounts to a monthly fee. But don't assume that because something is payment-optional that you can be a deadbeat. If you can't pay, don't use the service. You don't NEED it. You WANT it. There's a difference between needs and wants. 

Failed to Launch Son:
I have a 25 year old son who lives with me. Due to mental illness, he may never launch. It is somewhat, but not much, harder than when we were young. I graduated during the Bush I recession, after all. No jobs then either! He does his own laundry. He helps with chores. He goes to school. I pay for groceries, but he helps shop. 

Good boundaries are key. I set them. I am the adult."
2020-03-27 6:38,"LW with the friend who won't share: Perhaps stop eating out with her, given that she's a food-waster.

If you're up for it, please explain to her that wasting food is one of the worst things a person can do. It wastes raw materials, plus the energy used to harvest / transport / cook it, plus all the energy (heat/AC, lights) at all the facilities where that happens. Roughly 40% of all food in America is wasted -- completely unconscionable at a time of extreme pollution and a climate crisis caused by massive waste of energy, and completely unconscionable bc it's a relatively easy thing to correct.

If she were to take home what she doesn't eat and use it for her next lunch, she'd avoid using using additional food or energy to create the lunch (apart from a little microwaving, maybe).

And perhaps tell her, bc she sounds like someone who doesn't pay attention to this stuff, that Americans use about 3-4x as much energy as Europeans, whose standard of living is just as high. Our per capital usage coupled with our huge population = catastrophe.  We also pollute far more.  She needs to get with it."

Are you just not happy to spend time with him? You subscribe the worst motivations to him but continue to have dinner with him.  Maybe he needs a break from his hectic home life?  He's not living with you and expecting you to take of him, correct?  How is a 25 year old supposed to live?  I can't believe you look down on him for having roommates.  At the same time you are so judgmental of him, you don't seem to be able to draw the line when there is a life threatening virus in the world.  If you don't like him, don't martyr yourself anymore and don't see him anymore."

Thank you for this succinct reminder."
2020-03-29 18:03,"For the person who thinks her friend should split meals or share, you need to respect the friend's views and leave her alone.  You risk her declining invitations to future meals.  I have always felt food is something that carries the potential to share disease.  When in high school I took to heart the idea of never sharing, I avoided the mononucleosis that seemed to plague my contemporaries that shared soft drinks at social occasions produced. Also, the friend might not share the same interest in your food choices and were prefer to make their own choices, no matter how small or large.  The more I think about it, your demands are downright rude by expecting to share. I would be looking for new friends."

2020-03-29 14:18,"I am often puzzled by helicopter parents or the newly christened bulldozer parents who still treat their adult children as if they were young teenagers.

So your son comes to visit for a free dinner and to drop off his dirty laundry and you are actually asking advice on how to deal with that juvenile behavior?  Seriously?

If you want to find a root factor in the way your son treats you look in the mirror.  It's your house!  Set rules, and if he doesn't respect or abide by them, withdraw the dinner invite.  He can find another way to clean his clothes.

If he hasn't ""launched"" yet it might be because he is still being treated as a child."

He was working small job here and there and partying too much . At 25,  had enough , time for him to go. I was paying the rent and doing his laundry at this point. When I told my friend about letting him go, she said I would regret that because he seemed like he couldn’t take care or not ready to care for himself ! I did it anyway ! ( tough love). Now at 28( soon to be 29), he has his own apartment that he shared with his girlfriend, and they seem happy! He thanked me for helping him to be brave to navigate life in his own. I couldn’t be more proud of him and I like that I’m allowed to visit anytime I want ! Proud of my decision and more proud of my son !

A person who not only will not share with someone they (at least pretend) to like sufficiently to eat with, but then also refuses to save any uneaten food is just a pig.  Today there are thousands of people who really need the food this person apparently just wants to throw away.  Wasteful, self obsessed, oblivious to others....  I could go on and on...."

I know we need to stay positive, but when aftershocks of magnitude 3 to 4 shoot through the city a few times per day, staying positive is extremely difficult. My body is pumping with adrenaline all day long, I have no appetite, and I can't go anywhere. In the last week, I've had to duck and cover about three different times due to the earth bouncing around like a trampoline. I apologize for the negative post on an article designed to help people stay positive, but staying positive is easier said than done, especially when issues compound. The world didn't stop, we did."
2020-03-27 17:48,"Another good news that somehow hasn’t gotten traction, is that the FDA on March 22 sent a letter to all healthcare providers (<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/ventilator-supply-mitigation-strategies-letter-health-care-providers"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/ventilator-supply-mitigation-strategies-letter-health-care-providers</a>) instructing them to use commonly used CPAP machines (used to treat sleep apnea at home) for some mild cases, to prevent them turning into more serious cases that then need to go to the hospital. 

Yes, it is known that CPAP usage would aerosolize the virus which would then infect anyone near by. But this virus is so infectious we can assume everyone in the household of an infected person will be infected anyway. If using CPAP machines can prevent even a small number of patients from crowding our hospitals even more, then it’s worth trying. 

To be clear, this came from the FDA, so Drs reading this don’t dismiss it out of hand before actually reading the letter."

My wife and I are middle-class teachers, working on-line with our students, and while $1200 is nothing to sneeze at, it won't make that much difference to our finances. In short, we're fairly secure.
Those who are now jobless and facing financial ruin desperately need help. We may disagree with a number of aspects of this huge bailout, but at minimum, when our funds arrive, we will donate them to those who are in desperate need.

I used to be the optimistic pessimist, in the sense that no matter how bad things are, they can always get worse.  In the case of COVID, that is likely true, but I have changed in the sense that when all one has to keep them going is a sense of hope, one begins to really appreciate the little things.  We have water, we have electricity, we have a bathroom.  The things we take for granted are now things for which we need to recognize and express gratitude.  I know, my husband of 30 years who is now working from home full-time can't believe it either.  My mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2009 said, ""Cancer changes a person.""

2020-03-27 20:26,"Thank you Maria Cramer for writing this article. 

It will continue to serve a useful and wonderful purpose and reminder when my brain and emotions become overwhelmed with such dire and frightening statistics and information.

It is crucial to remember the key four areas you listed:

1) Kindness is being celebrated

2) Doctors and health workers are improvising and collaborating, and industries are trying to help.

3) Research on a vaccine and anti-viral treatment is moving at a breakneck speed.

4) The crisis holds lessons for the future.

Your article did not merely make me feel calmer and more hopeful, but it also served as a reminder to be kind and kinder to others.  

Sometimes a simple smile can work wonders.  While I was in a grocery line the other day, the lady ahead of me asked the cashier for some extra ""Monopoly tickets"" for the in-store game being played.  While the cashier was unable to do that, I told the lady I would give her mine since I live ""Monopoly"" every day, I don't need to play it too.  She was so tickled that I offered her my tickets.

Again - it's the little things, the little kindnesses that can go such a long way in making someone else, a total stranger, feel good, if even for a moment.

These days I'll take all the little moments I can muster and try my best to return the favor any way I can."
2020-03-27 20:10,"Great article, but the last paragraph recommends, ""stay home if you are sick."" This will never be practical until every American worker is afforded sick pay.

The governments services are amazing: free tests to anyone who wants one; food deliveries, drug stores that deliver the medicine to your home (ring the bell and leave) etc.  We even had a doctor make 2 house calls here for an elderly man who has bronchitis!  And, it was not expensive!  Wake up, America!  Our president's bombast is not leadership!   Don't know when I'll be able to fly home...but meanwhile I am being sheltered by the kind Germans."

It’s a wonder to see, and paradoxical that a virus that attacks the lungs has made the air breathable. I dread the smog building up again on the London skyline as things return to normal. We'll soon enough be back to wrecking our air and destroying the lungs of our children with less discrimination than Mother Nature."

There is an inherent goodness in all of us! It's up to us whether we seek out that goodness or mire ourselves in the swamp.  Hope floats to the surface, if we let it.
Everyone has a gift or talent they can share, all we have to do is look for it and share it.  The effects of kindness whether anonymous or not, are immediate and returned in abundance.

I anticipated as such, but not quite so soon. We must stay positive, be supportive and kind to each other. Don't be hard on yourself, give yourself a break, do what you can daily to make it through the day. Reach out and stay connected to friends and loved ones.

After all, lots of other things can be substituted for TP. At my local stores, there are still plenty of paper towels and kleenex. There are baby wipes. Any of these things can be used for the same purpose. So, why are people crazy over toilet paper? The other things missing at my store are kitty litter, peanut butter and flour. I figure everyone is at  home with the cat making peanut butter cookies and rearranging the garage to accommodate hundreds of rolls of toilet paper. Crazy times."

2020-03-28 11:27,"Bought a sleeve of washcloths they actually do a much better job in the effected areas. What was used before toilet paper?
Use your head folks. “Make do”:like great great grandma did."
2020-03-27 17:25,"I started online dating a few months before this started. I met a few dates in person that didn’t go anywhere. 

16 days or so ago I connected with someone and we started chatting on the phone in hopes of meeting soon. Needless to say we couldn’t meet in person, but we still talk every day by phone. It’s a wonderful way to get to know someone. I have something to look forward to every day and I look forward to meeting him in person one day."
2020-03-27 17:28,"You would think that making a baby during a pandemic would be inadvisable, a terrible idea, really. It’s one thing to have a baby boom after a blackout, it’s quite another when we can’t predict the path of this virus. 

Hospitals and medical providers being pushed to the brink, our system is under such stress. We are just at the beginning.

If not avoiding pregnancy for others, then for yourself and your potentially growing family. Exposing yourself, your baby, and others to this virus for pregnancy and wellness checks? I’d think twice."
2020-03-27 17:52,I think that there should be PSAs strongly urging birth control at this time.  To bring a baby into this unknown and terrifying situation is beyond understanding.
2020-03-27 19:40,"The lockdown and quarantine measures would force people to make a choice on what truly matters. It may turn good for some and not so good for others. Humans are biologically wired to be wandering nomads, moving places to places to collect experiences and memories. Corona changed all that. The repercussions have only started and would still not be over in the coming weeks or months."
2020-03-27 21:37,"With my wife trying to teach special ed students by phone and Zoom, and me trying to do my engineering work as normally as possible, I am very grateful to have a basement and 1/4 acre yard.  If we were back in our 10x56 house trailer with a baby and a big dog, it might not go so smoothly."
2020-03-27 21:45,"After my ex (28f) and I (34m) split up six months ago, she moved into an apartment with many roommates. I live alone.

Since the crisis, she humbly asked me if she could stay with me, as she said a couple of the roommates were being reckless with the situation. I hesitantly said yes, and we have been mostly okay the past two weeks. In times like this there are things are more important than what led to us breaking up. 

Hopefully no babies come out of it, though."
2020-03-27 22:41,"I'm lucky to live my old ball and chain, but I'm beyond thankful there is another bedroom in the house for some time alone."
2020-03-27 22:46,So glad I met a new man on match.com in December. We decided to be in each other's closest circles and it is wonderful to have almost forced intimacy.  It would have been absolute torture with my ex-husband! I'm 55 and he's 65!
2020-03-27 23:18,"I was happily single before Covid 19.  I'm more happily single now.  :-)

I do miss the weekly treks to my favorite club for dancing and socializing with friends, though.  :-("
2020-03-27 20:45,"My heart goes out to everyone stuck with someone they don’t love, or worse, stuck with someone abusive. Awful. I’m ever more appreciative to have a good partner during this quarantine. We try to give each other space. And when things get tense we both try to have “quick repair,” that is: make a sincere apology, affirm our love, and move on. We will all *really* know the kind of partner we have when this is over. If someone was consistently unkind, impatient, or cruel... get that covidivorce. As we are all learning, life is too short."
2020-03-28 0:47,"The pandemic presents hardships for parents and children obliged by court order to engage in visitations, sometimes requiring travel out of the area or state, often from households blended 2 or 3 times over (kids & other relatives or housemates going back and forth amongst multiple residences, schools, and so on).  Supervised visits in facilities that do not provide the 6’ per person distance needed to maintain public and personal health, with multiple kids of different ages and ability to self-control and from entirely different households families and cities. Some families have other members who are immunocompromised or else have other vulnerabilities, and some are in the habit of ignoring or may not be aware of the various and ever increasing list of possible coronavirus 19 symptoms. Kids may have to travel in small spaces of cars with people who may have been exposed and shedding virus, or the kids themselves could be that person. Some parents may lack authorization for making medical decisions for children or might send kids with uncleaned clothing or toys or other things that present contamination risk. Most kids in these situations are not venturing out to provide essential care for someone or otherwise doing an essential job, and the people whose job is supervising visitations are also at risk. Still, upsetting for parent and kid to have to skip time together. But maybe that’s better than one of them / their or the other household catching/spreading covid19 and dying."
2020-03-28 4:58,My wife and I have lived together since we were 19.  We are now 41.  We joke that we have trained for this.
2020-03-28 5:06,It is but a truism that times of crisis bring out the best in us. History has taught us that for the most part it is quite the other way around.
2020-03-28 13:43,"As the pandemic began I was trying to adjust to being alone after the the death of my husband last month. What helped was being busy - going to my office each morning - working all day and meeting friends for dinner.   I was looking forward to joining a bereavement group in early April.  
Now my new normal is working from my dining room table - preparing meals and walking my dogs.
I am not sure if this a good way to be grieving - alone in a house filled with memories but I have no choice. 
I have been fortunate to have a circle of friends and family that check on me everyday and listen to me talk with no advice or judgement.
This is my corona virus story - thankful my husband died in February in hospice and I was allowed to be with him until his last moments."
2020-03-28 16:00,"My husband and I purchased a big old house in rural GA two years ago and moved here permanently last November.  We feel we have the perfect place for social distancing - 4 acres, endless home projects, good weather for gardening and 4700 sq ft of house when we get tired of each other's company!  Sending good wishes to those stuck inside.  Be well."
2020-03-28 15:28,"Having the same incredibly stressful experience of still living under the same roof with my 30-year spouse from whom I'm ""separated"" and currently divorcing. I am not sick and neither is he. 

I get out once a day with the dogs, the only respite I have to get away from the dreadful darkness that is our former marriage. We have a 2-storey house but I am self-isolating in one room to stay away from him. I eat, sleep, watch TV, talk to friends all in this self-imposed house arrest. 

I run into him in the kitchen a few times a day, never a pleasant encounter. We often yell at each other, our resentments spilling over. There is almost no moment of civility. Having to see him every day is a cruel joke. I'm moving out in early May and can only focus on that. Getting away from this stressful living arrangement is a salvation I can almost grasp. 

Couples in troubled marriages will find clarity through this. Spend another minute with the guy lying on the couch in his tattered bathrobe? Nope. Time to move on, happy to live a new life, no matter the global crisis."
