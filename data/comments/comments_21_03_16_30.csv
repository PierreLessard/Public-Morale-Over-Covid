2021-03-22 16:31,"It will be interesting if, as many others are reporting, that after vaccination, these disturbing post-Covid symptoms may resolve. My sister had been plagued by some difficult problems after she was ill with the virus, and about a month after her second vaccination she started to note she was feeling better overall.  Let's hope this trend continues for many others."
2021-03-22 16:31,"I hope that you can make a full recovery.  How scary this must all be for you and your family.  Glad you were able to get help.  Keep on with therapy and meds and yes, if the house is what is setting you off, moving will help.

Best of luck to you and your family."
2021-03-22 16:32,"Thank you for sharing this story. You and your family are brave souls, Mr. Agerton. May peace come your way soon. And my gratitude for the medical community who are willing to recognize this and work toward finding solutions. May you all be well."
2021-03-22 16:33,"Wondering whether at this point a few weeks of controlled deep breathing exercises (inhale for four counts, hold breath for four, exhale for seven or eight, repeat) would help tamp down hyper-anxiety and other nervous system irregularities, as it has for other post-covid ""long-haul"" patients.  If the psychosis resulted from micro-clots, oxygen depletion and/or abnormal CO2 levels, might such exercises restore or heal the brain?

Others who've had long-term serious symptoms after ""mild"" Covid have improved after being vaccinated. Worth a try?"
2021-03-22 16:34,In reality this type of outcome is not unusual in people with a variety of immunity driven systemic reactions. I’m not sure why this is constantly framed in terms of Covid rather than immunological responses to novel antigens.
2021-03-22 16:34,I wonder how other virus could affect our mental health.  I had idiopathic cardiomyopathy which my doctor said could have been caused by a virus and that was over 30 years ago.  My ef  is still around 40% and no symptoms other than fatigue.  So much we don't know.
2021-03-22 16:36,"Thank you for your story. 
It is critical for anti-vaxxer to hear these accounts from people who are experiencing such devastating after effects from the virus.

So in a few cases, those who were ""long haulers"" have reported some relief after taking the vaccine."
2021-03-22 16:37,"Sounds exactly like an ongoing bad trip - full of overwhelming paranoia and anxiety, and where you know somehow that it's not real, but it feels real. Different from classical psychosis, where you're completely unaware that it's not real. This, for me - having experience in this - was a terrifying read. I hope he, and others like him, find something lasting, more than the respites described here."
2021-03-22 16:41,"All my best wishes to Mr. Agerton and his family.  There are few things more terrifying than feeling that you are losing your mind - and being aware of it.

Though infrequent, such experiences should remind all those who remain nonchalant about the virus (see Florida, Texas) that it can damage you even after you think you’ve recovered from COVID.  I don’t know whether anyone has ever experienced anything similar after a flu."
2021-03-22 16:42,This is a frightening account. I wonder about the degree of surety about this condition being an after-effect of the virus. Have all potential external environmental exposures been ruled out? The complexity of these correlations is mind-boggling -- no pun intended.
2021-03-22 16:46,"I have read recently some anecdotal accounts of covid vaccinations helping people with ""long covid"", and I think that some researchers are intrigued.  This might be worth looking into. Best wishes to Mr. Agerton and his family."
2021-03-22 16:49,"My brother was briefly hospitalized with covid early on, before we knew much about it.  He was only in the hospital for 2 days, but the first day he became unaware of where he was, and expressed some paranoid ideas about why he was there.  Fortunately, he recovered from that fairly quickly and was able to go home, tests having shown nothing in particular.  He continued to experience long-haul symptoms for a few months (mostly temp spikes and intermittent fatigue).  But has now recovered.  

I agree that people should be less cavalier about contracting this virus.  There's still a lot we don't know about it."
2021-03-22 16:50,"This should be taken very seriously.  Our friend recently committed suicide after a mild bout of Covid left her with weeks of insomnia.  Even though she was receiving treatment it spiralled into an insomnia induced depression.  In a moment of deperation she took her life.

My love goes out to her family and to anyone who has experienced something similar.  People must learn to not take this lightly and to continue taking precautions even as we all get vaccinated."
2021-03-22 16:52,"Recent reports of people suffering from long covid and mental symptoms can have a remission after being immunized.  I have a friend who had covid last March, had ' brain fog' until she had her second immunization.  To my mind that implies an active viral  component to the central nervous system symptoms.
Was a PET scan done? This man presents such a rich clinical history, I hope medicine can benefit from learning how his brain was impacted.  Thank you, Mr. Agerton for allowing us to hear your story."
2021-03-22 16:53,"Covid causes strokes, the loss of smell/taste, cognitive problems- and for some, psychosis. I experienced on going paranoia and psychosis after getting Lymes disease and having repeated head trauma from domestic violence. This stopped but it took a few years of eating very healthy, exercising a lot, taking anti-anxiety medication and sleeping pills to make sure I slept every night. I feel like my body's autoimmune response simmered down and my brain- which was likely mildly injured from being hit in the head by my partner hundreds of times- healed. People get hurt and sick in life and healing is possible if you prioritize health."
2021-03-22 16:55,"My prayers to you. I hope you recover from this. I also wonder about children and the effect of COVid on them. I know that children are a less vulnerable population for COVID , but what about children with chronic illnesses such as epilepsy and other neurological disorders"
2021-03-22 16:56,"He needs to get vaccinated, there are a number of reports of people experiencing mental health issues following covid infections that improved with vaccination."
2021-03-22 16:56,"It is outstanding that Mr. Agerton and his wife are working so hard to make this information available to others. They have been very strong and I hope the peace of mind they seem to be experiencing at the moment will continue. Covid reminds us that despite the amount of knowledge doctors already have, there is so much more to learn. But the most important part of this story, to me, was the openness of the Agertons in sharing their experience, because these symptoms are so often the source of shame. I am sure you have helped many people!"
2021-03-22 17:00,"First, my prayers for your full recovery. 

Second, your bravery, strength, and willingness to share your experience is invaluable. So, my thanks to you for this courage. 

May many learn from this strong man and seek the help and support they need. 

Mental health care is as vital and as important as any physical health need. High time both were treated as foundational to our overall health and wellness.

Sir, you are moving us in this direction. 

Thank you brave soul."
2021-03-22 17:00,"I have to wonder now about another story in this edition of The Times about Kent Taylor, the founder of the Texas Roadhouse restaurant chain, who committed suicide in response to COVID symptoms. 

That article mentioned that Mr. Taylor was oppressed by the onset of severe tinnitus, which certainly would be unnerving in conjunction with the other debilitating symptoms of the virus. But perhaps Mr. Taylor was experiencing mental disturbances like Mr. Agerton's as well. 

The more we learn about this virus, the worse it appears to be -- and the more criminally irresponsible it seems, that the previous president encouraged perilous behavior among his followers and packed auditoriums with unmasked people yelling at the top of their lungs."
2021-03-22 17:07,"Yet more evidence that we are still in the mental health and brain injury and illness Dark Ages.  
Perhaps it's time to initiate far better research approaches to open this vital field of medicine."
2021-03-22 17:07,"For 100's of years, here has been a known association with all acute infections and psychosis.  No one understands the mechanism. It usually resolves on its own.  It may even be caused by the medications used to treat infections.  Reporting like this, that focuses on one dramatic case give the impression that this is a widespread problem.  Even worse, it gives the impression that this is an established cause and effect situation with Covid which is not supported by the research.   We will now see an huge spike in the number of people who believe their mental health problems are caused by Covid.   
We have never tested for any virus as extensively as we are doing with Covid.  This is bound to lead to many false associations.   Lets pretend you tested millions of people for Rhinovirus (common cold virus), then tried to catalog all the symptoms they felt for the next 12 months.  Now put all those people into social distancing,  add in fear of a deadly pandemic,  add an extremely divisive political environment with armed insurrectionists, civil unrest protests..etc... and you have a recipe for a massive increased mental health issues. We know mental health problems cause physical symptoms.  Now add in Tons of reporting on symptoms that may or may not be associated with Rhinovirus.   It's a setup for a  massive increase in the false associations with the virus. Especially  if the symptoms of mental illness overlap with the symptoms you are attributing to the virus."
2021-03-22 16:58,"But sometimes your neighbors are really talking about you, or debt collectors are following you around......

Covid is tricky.  At least  medical professionals now believe that chronic fatigue actually exists. Chances are prior virus infections caused the older chronic fatigue cases.

Maybe we will find out that these symptoms of schizophrenia are actually schizophrenia,  And that schizophrenia is caused by some sort of virus attacking your brain.  

Be kind to the wandering homeless man,  it could soon be  you."
2021-03-22 16:34,"Every time I see an anti-masker, someone with a mask slung below the nose or chin, and those who refuse to social distance in public places, I think of folks like Mr. Agerton."
2021-03-22 17:06,Scary story.  Maybe it will get more folks to wear masks and use more caution.
2021-03-22 17:00,"Hang in there, Mr. Agerton.  One foot in front of the other.  A lot of people are wishing you well."
2021-03-22 16:28,Ivan needs to contact the Institute for Functional Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. They will help him find a doctor trained to address the inflammation and intense immune response that is causing his mental psychosis. They can work in collaboration with his current medical team.
2021-03-22 16:36,"We understand so little about the intimate relationship between the body and the brain. Strep can kick off OCD. Is juvenile diabetes caused by a virus? Maybe. 

We are told COVID-19 is a disease of inflammation. We are just scratching the surface and thank goodness we have scientists doing this research. 

Best wishes, Ivan, for a full recovery."
2021-03-22 16:54,"I went through an eerily similar break in April, no family history or prior personal history. No indication I had been ill with covid. A blood donation since has revealed a negative antibody result but that was 8 months afterward. I think it was a combination of stress factors from the shutdown, plus impacts the shutdown had on my own personal and professional life (professional shutdowns precipitated the discovery of an embezzlement that was itself traumatic). My point is it's been interesting and cathartic to see people have parallel experiences in the past year. I hate to see anyone suffer what I went through but it's reassuring to not feel alone in it. 

I'd also like to highlight how brave Ivan Agerton is for sharing his experiences! It has been hard for me to share my own experiences within my innermost circles, I even want to post this comment anonymously; I can't imagine sharing my story with such a wide audience. But he should know that putting it out there is immensely valuable."
2021-03-22 16:43,I just recently stumbled upon something on YouTube about sudden psychosis in children after coming down with Strep infections.  The virus somehow caused a neurological disorder and resulted in drastic and sudden changes in personality.  Wondering if there could be some connection?
2021-03-22 17:10,There are studies that show that covid long haulers get better after they receive the vaccine.  Has he received one ?
2021-03-22 16:39,"A friend of mine had a scary paranoid hallucination episode and a fever the night she got the Modena vaccine. Never did something like that happen to her before. Another friend ended up in the ER with a deliberating headache the night of the Pfizer vaccine. The headache has lessened but hasn’t gone away since the shot. 
Please write about these side effects. They are happening."
2021-03-22 16:29,"The unpredictability of this virus remains a constant. Anyone who is even fully vaccinated should take note. A variant may still upend your life in countless ways.

Stay cautious, obviously."
2021-03-22 17:05,"Thank you for sharing this important information on the side effects of long hauler COVID Mr. Agerton.  

I wish you and your family the best as you slowly recover and are able to resume your adventurous work."
2021-03-22 16:41,"This virus is bigger and badder than anyone realized.  Thank you, Mr. Agerton for going public with your ordeal.  I wish you lasting good health."
2021-03-22 16:55,"Perhaps a COVID-19 vaccination will help get rid of his strange symptoms. It helps some COVID-19 longterm patients with their physical ailments, so it's worth a try."
2021-03-22 16:44,"Seems like on a cellular level his body is aware of being invaded. Others have reported actually feeling that something inside them was “looking around, looking for something”. Folks experiencing these psychotic episodes might be ultra-sensitive to an invading organism, and the mind creates a scenario to go along with the physiology. This happens when we dream. An overheated room, needing to use the bathroom, hearing an alarm or being in an awkward position all manifest themselves in dreams."
2021-03-22 16:34,"I sincerely wish every person who doubts the seriousness of this virus could meet a patient like this. As a professional nurse, I treat too many people who could have avoided death and disease had they only worn a 99 cent mask and acted cautiously when in public. I find the scenes at Miami Beach particularly horrendous and attribute the callous disregard for the welfare of themselves and their families the result of political opportunists who should have known better than to encourage flagrant disregard of a disease."
2021-03-22 16:34,"I hope and pray for Ivan Agerton's continued recovery.

This story helps give perspective on the lives of so many people who struggle with non-Covid related psychosis, who often do not have insight."
2021-03-22 16:41,"I became covid sick last April. While being ill I certainly developed horrible mental difficulties, insomnia, anxiety, and delirium.  After the virus left my body I had months of depression. I felt things I have never felt before. 

Covid is real. My heart and love goes out to all people dealing with this. And as we say in New Orleans, this too shall pass."
2021-03-22 17:00,Kudos to Mr. Agerton for his willingness to share his story. It certainly drives home the notion that this can this can happen to anyone -- even the bravest and strongest among us.  Thank you for sharing and best wishes for a full -- and permanent -- recovery!
2021-03-22 17:02,"It breaks my hard to think of Mr. Agerton's suffering. It is difficult to imagine what it much be like. It is also horrible to think that even something rare, like post-Covid psychosis, will start showing up a lot the more people there are who get Covid. Something that happens  in - say 1% - of Covid cases (or whatever percent) can still add up to enough people to create another kind of public health crises when Covid cases climb into the 100's of millions or more."
2021-03-22 17:14,"Many thanks to Mr. and Ms. Agerton for their openness and generosity in sharing this harrowing experience, I believe it will help people.  I hope Mr. Agerton heals completely and quickly."
2021-03-22 17:15,"Instead of merely listing categories of drugs used that were helpful or not, for those of us with chronic depression it would be useful to know the names and dosages of the prescribed medications."
2021-03-22 17:21,"Thanks to the bravery of this family to expose the stigma associated with mental health. I am sending prayers that his suffering passes- it must feel so hard to live with paranoia, and, interestingly, COVID triggered the onset of his symptoms."
2021-03-22 17:29,Thanks for this. Great courage.
2021-03-22 17:18,The UK considers individuals with a history of severe mental illness to be high risk.  Perhaps this is why.
2021-03-22 17:20,"This is yet another in a myriad of reasons why owning a gun is not a good idea, as if we need more. And locking up his pistol only delays disaster by a few hours, assuming that he has a license, given that you don't need much more than a car and a credit card to arm yourself to the teeth. There is no mention of flagging him in a centralized database preventing him from just going to a gun store. And id he perceives his partner to be part of his conspiracy, she might be his first target. And relapses in the future? The entire situation is terrifying, not the least because we're all jumping to the conclusion that Covid is the cause. People ""go off the deep end"" suddenly for any number of reasons. We have no capacity for dealing with any of it. Not to mention that gun laws vary wildly from state to state. I'm in Massachusetts where guns are regulated, but a quick drive to New Hampshire with my driver's license and a credit card and I could come home with an assault rifle and loads of ammo. A bump stock or a bit of light machining and I'm fully auto. Am I the only one who thinks this way??? No wonder American carnage is so high!"
2021-03-22 17:22,"Brain inflammation is a known cause of paranoid delusion. a few ME/CFS patients, like Dr. Bruce Campbell, also have reported paranoia as one of their symptoms. I'm not aware of permanent paranoia among ME/CFS patients though, so maybe it'll be also temporary for long-covid patients.

There is a recent retrospective study that low dose Abilify, not a full dose for psychosis, alleviates symptoms like fatigue and brain fog in ME/CFS patients by enhancing dopamine which acts as fire retardant on brain. Maybe long-covid patients could try it and see if that helps alleviate their paranoia."
2021-03-22 17:36,"This infuriates me:

Emergency room doctors ruled out a brain tumor and sent him home with sleeping pills. But after he slept, “the delusions picked right back up where he said good night to them the night before,” his wife said. “It was progressively worse. It was something new every 10 minutes.”

What can I say. A person with psychosis, who could harm himself and others, walks into a room and you prescribe sleeping pills?"
2021-03-22 17:37,"This sounds incredibly difficult. This guy seems very sane, logical and rational. I hope he and his family are going to be ok. 
The thought of this happening to a large number of Q Anon Trumpsters is, however, really horrifying."
2021-03-22 17:39,"This story highlights just how much we don't know about this new disease. It also offers a great illustration of the mind/body connection that much of humanity chooses to either deny or ignore.  What a nightmare for this man. Hopefully his symptoms will fade over time. Meanwhile, the prospect of anti-psychotics drugs and the associated side-effects not to mention the impacts of an ongoing psychological roller-coaster is pretty terrifying. For those on the fence about the vaccine - Get your shot."
2021-03-22 17:13,I do hope we are studying these changes to the brain in depth and can use what we learn to treat psychoses from non infections etiologies.
2021-03-22 17:13,"What happened to this person must have been very hard, and I am glad he is getting better. But I have a problem with the whole premise of the story. Yes, perhaps COVID caused the psychosis, or perhaps it's a coincidence. The important part of the story is that this person got help and is being treated -- perhaps saying it is due to COVID makes that easier. But people become psychotic without COVID. Until there are studies, until we know if the number of people who have had COVID are becoming psychotic at a higher rate, it seems premature to make the conclusion that COVID is the cause. Perhaps it was simply the stress of having it or perhaps it is just pure coincidence. Ironically this is much like the anti-vaxer arguments: they find people who get sick after a shot and say the shot caused it -- well in any large population that is going to happen due to coincidence."
2021-03-22 17:38,"I was diagnosed with MECFS thirty years ago. It was
devastating. There are reports that indicate Long Covid
is similar to MECFS.

I told my GP: ""I think I'm going crazy.""

He replied: ""I will refer you to a psychiatrist who is very well
informed about MECFS.""

Psychiatrist : ""Tell me how you feel?""
Reply: ""Bewildered, every thing works, but nothing works
very well, the worst part is my cognitive function has declined
and I'm paranoid.""

Psychiatrist: ""You don't have a psychiatric problem, there's
something wrong with your brain chemistry, we don't know much
about it because very few people die. We don't get autopsy
reports.""
""Take 50 ml of flax oil/day"" (Ref Fats That Heal)
""Keep a diary, because improvement  will be slow, and you might
not notice any change.""

After a couple of months my cognitive function improved.

I was also advised to eliminate sugar, hydrogenated oil, 
processed foods. antibiotics and Prozac and other SSRIs.
Massage therapy also helped.

The good news is that you can get better, but it takes time.

The International Diagnostic Criteria for MECFS
(Note the cognitive aspect, it is often overlooked."
2021-03-22 17:41,Good article and one to be heeded. I hope Mr. Agerton's condition continues to improve. But the type and duration of  symptoms he's experiencing should be a cautionary tale to all of us. This disease shouldn't be ignored or down played.
2021-03-22 17:44,"I think maybe the what is going on is that, while sick, the scales somehow fall away from their eyes, and they are confronted with the reality of our society."
2021-03-22 16:27,"I am struck, first and foremost, by Mr Agerton's courage. This is a truly frightening sequel to Covid-19, and he and his family are facing it with bravery and honesty.  I wonder if some of the microclots being seen with the disease are the culprit here.  If the clot is too small to be seen on an MRI, that doesn't mean they are not there (I am not a radiologist or a psychiatrist or a neurologist, but I am a physician).  I hope that over time and with the help of his psychiatrist, his family, and his medications, that these episodes with diminish and disappear.  Interesting that as his sense of smell has returned, the psychotic episodes have lessened.   Good luck to you, Mr Agerton, and sending all my best wishes from across the country."
2021-03-22 16:51,"I can relate. I contracted COVID in late November of 2020, a mild case without a fever, mostly insomnia, slight congestion and muscle pain. I recovered within a week or so, considering myself lucky at the time. Around March 3rd I began to experience lung problems which have become significantly more severe throughout the month. I’m still unable to taste or smell, and am only now beginning to come-to from the ‘brain fog’ others have described; such as struggling with completing sentences and the like. The respiratory symptoms are most concerning to me, but the more I learn from experiences of others the more I feel like 
I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.  My best to anyone who is in the boat with me."
2021-03-22 17:24,"We have a friend who got it. Now, he has a runaway list of things affecting him. He thought he was going insane and his illnesses post-Covid might be imagined.

Moving toward death (his weight dropped to 110), he finally found a doctor who specializes in environmental diseases and he figured out our friend had been exposed previously to black mold and the Covid triggered a severe response to his previous exposure. 

He’s been on a very strict and specific treatment regimen and an extremely strict diet and he is improving a bit at a time. 

I had Covid last year. It really set off an immune response in me that was close to fatal because I already had a type of auto immune arthritis. 

I made it through. Then, I recently was vaccinated and after the second jab, the full body ache set in similarly, but not as bad, as when I had the real thing. That thankfully lasted three days.

Nobody really knows how this virus gets to different people. I hope that the medical community will come to understand that Covid 19 can act as some sort of trigger that sets off symptoms that otherwise might have stayed dormant in people. 

I have the sinking feeling we will be dealing with the aftermath of this for decades. 

Like rheumatic fever affected the hearts of so many kids back in the day who grew up with heart conditions that killed them before their time, Covid has the same ability to damage us in ways that demand an intensive amount of research so that treatments can be devised."
2021-03-22 17:07,"So the thing that stood out for me is that the first time in the ER they sent him home with sleeping pills. So disappointing that the ER does this. I've had a family member have the same response. It's nuts. I assume this is really because of the lack of psychiatric beds so the hospital just wants you out of there and your family gets to deal with you in the morning and try to find a bed, which can be nearly impossible sometimes. Great. If people realized the amount of trauma this inflicts on the families as well as the patients, maybe funding for this would be improved. I think most people have no real awareness of this however, or how bad it would be if they or a family member becomes mentally ill. It is so sad."
2021-03-22 16:57,"Interesting article. I had Covid in March. In the several months afterward, I had a huge blast of anxiety coupled with insomnia. The anxiety is much better now but I still have problems with insomnia. I think covid is responsible. I had a mild case during which I basically slept up to 18 hours a day. I think it attacked my brain and I wonder if others were similarly affected after they ""recovered""."
2021-03-22 17:01,"Unfortunately, we will see more and more immediate and delayed COVID related illnesses that require lifetime healthcare services. Given what we already know about COVID and preventative protocols including vaccinations, why are so many people resisting being vaccinated? 

Prediction - some form of national healthcare will be demanded by the largely conservative right, those that resisted and believed conspiracy healthcare theories and now can't afford the cost of care they need."
2021-03-22 17:56,"Frightening story.
I remember reading years ago that schizophrenia might be caused by a retrovirus that exists unnoticed in our genes. For some people, thought, that viral remnant can be activated by an infection, and the brains of people with schizophrenia show that this retrovirus has become active.

It makes me wonder if something like that is happening with Covid."
2021-03-22 17:47,This is a frightening story. To think that someone so capable could have such a hard time is distressing. it is another warning that Covid-19 is not to be taken. Imagine not taking the vaccine because of some political foolishness. I wish Mr. Agerton a return to normalcy.
2021-03-22 17:43,This story illustrates how the long term effects of being infected with Coivd-19 are going to be with us for years and even decades. The glaring side to this story is how awful or mental healthcare system is which is no surprise given how dysfunctional the entire healthcare system is in the country.
2021-03-22 18:01,"Terrifying.  Our thoughts are with you, and all covid survivors.  The articles describing the long term consequences has brought home how much we don't know.  What is the unifying factor to long covid, chronic fatigue, chronic lyme, chronic long term effects of infection?  No doubt this will become well studied.  In our household our mantra has been, you don't want to get it, ""mild"" case or not.  No one knows the long term consequences.  We are part way through this, people.  Find your second wind and stay vigilant."
2021-03-22 18:01,"This man had COVID followed by an acute severe depressive reaction. His psychotic symptoms, while alarming to him, may not have been the main issue, as they were temporary albeit truly terrifying. He recovered quickly in the overall scheme of things, although every day of the psychotic reaction was surely a nightmare for him. Contracting a serious disease that could kill you without any warning is overwhelming. We're all at risk of having a psychotic reaction to serious, confusing, unanticipated life experiences that could put and end to life. My point is only that what happened here may not have been explicitly due to the biological impact of the virus. 

This man fortunately had caring family members and good clinicians. Perhaps this article will increase the likelihood that more people will get vaccinated."
2021-03-22 18:08,"So thankful for this article!
Someone I know went through this late last year but we did not know if the person had COVID infection. But symptoms are spot on: hallucinations, insomnia, anxiety sometimes, believes imagines, and says things that are obviously not true. 100% healthy, normal person before this incident. As said in the article, it was like a light switch. Much better now but still not out of the woods."
2021-03-22 18:08,"The interaction of immune responses with psychiatric disorders, either with viruses, certain drugs, or with vaccines, themselves, are rare, but certainly not unknown. Eight or nine years ago, many individuals given the anti-malaria drug Larium suffered extreme severe psychotic reactions and the drug went from accepted, to black box warnings to being rarely prescribed.  A cottage industry evolved in logistics to bring back individuals from foreign countries who had become incapacitated from Larium side effects. The yellow fever vaccine has also precipitated psychiatric symptoms and led to admissions to psychiatric wards. The immune systems of these individuals experiencing psychiatric symptoms, whether from the virus or the introduction of other prophylactic substances,  appear to be in heightened states of inflammatory arousal. As the inflammation recedes the emotional states of decompensation should, hopefully, remit."
2021-03-22 18:10,"Again and again I am struck by how mysterious and unpredictable this virus is. I had a weird aberration in some bloodwork that was drawn the day after my first vaccine. My M.D. said the abnormalities were related to the vaccine and we will repeat the labs 4 weeks after the 2nd dose. He also said, ""it's not what this virus does to the body, it's what your body does with the virus."" Which makes perfect sense to me, after a year of reading everything I can get my hands on about SARS Cov 2. Terrifying microbe, and I am not going to let my guard down for a long time. I am as daunted by the prospect of long Covid and sequelae as I am of the acute illness itself.
Thank you to Mr. Agerton and his family for sharing his story. I am sure it will be helpful to many people in many different ways. 
Best wishes sir, for a full recovery."
2021-03-22 18:10,Such a sad story. Possibly meditation 🧘🏾‍♂️ could help. My heart goes out to him and his family.
2021-03-22 18:14,"Observations:
1. There is no way the ER physician only considered brain tumour for acute psychosis.  Regardless - weird that he was discharged.  He should have been admitted. 
2. At no point in the article is there a discussion of possible autoimmune encephalitis.  If antipsychotics fail - autoimmune encephalitis has to be on the differential."
2021-03-22 18:16,It is a testament to Mr. Agerton's mental discipline that he was able to handle the episodes as well as he did.  He is truly a strong person.  Best wishes for a full recovery.
2021-03-22 18:22,"Another reason to take COVID-19 very seriously. 

If something like this strikes us or a family member,  we cannot go back in time and social distance or mask up.

I lost my sense of taste and smell last year but have since regained it.

I am grateful that I have not suffered any more serious complications. 

For those who don't believe, COVID-19 is real.

Thank you Mr. Agerton for sharing your story and I am hoping you experience a full recovery from this dreadful and truly frightening virus."
2021-03-22 17:58,"Very, very complicated... But, might vaccination help him?  <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/health/coronavirus-patients-and-vaccine-effects.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/health/coronavirus-patients-and-vaccine-effects.html</a>

2021-03-22 18:22,Has he received vaccinations for COVID-19?  I have read that many long-haulers have reported an easing of symptoms after they've been vaccinated.  Perhaps that would help.  The truly frightening thing is that some people who have experienced these psychotic episode had thoughts of hurting themselves or others.  Everybody could be a sitting duck.
2021-03-22 18:06,I am surprised the article made no mention of the possibility that vaccination has possibly  been helping some of the long-haul Covid patients.
2021-03-22 17:52,Some long-covid patients report getting rapidly better after getting vaccinated. I wonder if he has tried that?
2021-03-22 18:01,The first thought while reading this article was wondering how many in our country are experiencing undiagnosed mental illness while fervently believing in Q. Enough people have had symptomless Covid to make that a possibility.
2021-03-22 18:25,"Mr. Agerton, sorry to see you going through this and thank you for your services as a Marine. I am no expert but please try the ancient India's meditation approach combined with yoga. Might be enormously helpful. Wishing you the very best!"
2021-03-22 18:29,I hope this family is doing well and that things will get better for them. Also did anybody else notice that this is the real life version of that one X-files episode?
2021-03-22 18:35,Apparently mild cases are not always so mild. Something is going on internally that is having a huge impact on some people despite the otherwise mild symptoms. Obviously there is a lot we don't know about this disease. People who are cavalier about it are playing with fire.
2021-03-22 18:36,"Frightening. COVID is a capricious virus with unknown and uncertain impacts, including the most mild of responses. We need broader broadcast of the varied impact of COVID so people take simple actions such as masking and social distancing more serious. Hello college students on Spring break?"
2021-03-22 18:38,"Devastating to read; devastating reality for many who suffer with a schizophrenia diagnosis.  If this is a long-term effect of COVID-19 and is an inflammatory process, why not administer anti-inflammatory treatment. High dose corticosteroids or other medications administered for acute COVID symptoms? Does  this also create an assessment of other inflammatory responses at play in many others diagnosed with schizophrenia with no family history and quickly emerging symptoms?"
2021-03-22 18:27,TG I never had this what I had was a complete lost of what I was talking about in the middle of a sentence. It was the strangest thing and after getting vaccinated it’s improving
2021-03-22 18:46,"Kinda makes one worried sick about what might be coming down the pike in the future considering we're a planet of 8 Billion people sometime this year.  Expecting to ascend to 11 Billion within 20 years.

How many forests can be cut down - how many overpopulated regions rely on livestock being raised and or sold hundreds feet from their abodes - and how many corners will get cut to get food and goods to the market that we assume are all safe?

Semper Fi, Ivan.  Go easy Sir and keep reaching out.  Nobody can live with that alone."
2021-03-22 18:48,Thank you Mr. Agerton. Thank you for your courage. Your experience with Covid 19 doesn't surprise me. Your story was very helpful.I hope you are doing better and remain stable. Again I thank you.
2021-03-22 19:03,"I felt occassionaly anxious since my mild covid episode in Oct 2020 but found it difficult to identify the source:  Living Alone in the pandemic vs. age vs. this, that and the other.  Still, its good to know what may be waiting in the wings ..."
2021-03-22 19:04,"What a nightmare for this poor man and his family. And for how many other people who have had COVID, and have had these symptoms. The more I read about COVID, the more I am clear that we know so very little about the disease. I think this is going to be with us for many, many years. Just yesterday, I had to beg a good friend who is resisting the vaccine, to get it. She is not usually vaccine hesitant. It is because of the way Trump push the vaccine production through so quickly; she doesn't trust them because of that. I can understand her hesitancy; I felt that originally. But I since have become certain is it the right thing for all of us to do. I told her, ""This the patriotic thing to do."" Though I know those words are not something many people want to do. But still, I begged her to think hard about it, and to please get herself vaccinated. It depends on ALL of us getting vaccinated."
2021-03-22 19:07,"This virus is creepy.  It has the capacity to harm so many different parts of the body.  Has there been any other recorded virus with this many side affects or are we simply kissing that the common flu could have caused mental health issues and never realized it.

It’s creepy but also very curious.  I hope we can learn from the virus a do major break through on identifying how other common viruses may cause abnormal side effects we never considered before."
2021-03-22 19:13,Physician here. I had mild COVID in Oct'20-recovered easily at home. Right away started having early morning awakening/insomnia and anxiety. Ordinary tasks started to provoke anxiety and seem insurmountable. Started to cry easily. Struggled with it for months. Seemed to get worse with the passage of time. Tired Psychotherapy-got minor relief only. Finally gave in-saw a psychiatrist and started Lexapro 10. Finally anxiety is totally gone and I am returning back to normal-feel functional again. Bottom line-please don't try to fight it alone. Seek help. COVID-19 is a weird unpredictable bug and does different things to different people.
2021-03-22 19:13,"This article showcases how poorly understood are the reactions of our bodies to disease. What is it going to take for doctors and researchers to realize that ignoring symptoms and throwing up their hands is not worth the big bucks we pay for health insurance? 

I've had a virus for decades that I have treated with an anti-viral medicine, but in the last five years I began to use herbal medicine in conjunction with it. I've never looked back. The success that I had with this treatment was phenomenal. I guess we have to experiment on ourselves now, to get results. Conventional medicine doesn't have the time or interest to help us truly improve our quality of life and resistance to disease."
2021-03-22 19:14,"Good luck to those struggling and thank you for sharing your stories.  There is so much to learn about factors that contribute to disease outcomes. Reading this makes me wonder: 
- Are there any assessments being done for nutritional deficiencies post-Covid that may affect the brain?
- Can contracting Covid right after time spent on a submarine (or other pressurized environments, like airplanes) affect the outcome, since oxygen plays such a big role?
- Are there any other environmental considerations (allergies, mold) since they had just moved into a new home when it first occurred, and things seemed worse when there. 
I just hope this family will find some answers and relief soon."
2021-03-22 19:18,"I talked to the ex yesterday and he told me of his experiences getting the vaccine.  First one, no problem.  Second one, sore arm like he said he has had before with flu shots.  But then he said he had real strange mental issues and couldn't get out of his recliner all day.  He said it was hard to describe just staring off into space.  

He sounds great now but he had that one bizarre day that he had a hard time describing."
2021-03-22 19:29,"I recognize my own husband in the article, but his situation dates back to 2007. Then 53 years old, with no history of mental illness, he became sick with a prolonged upper respiratory infection after having made several trips abroad. A few weeks after he seemingly recovered, he started to develop paranoid delusions, different but such as described in the article. As his situation worsened, he became anxious, agitated and insomniac and had to be hospitalized several times. Ultimately, he was diagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder, despite never having had symptoms before.

The experience was traumatic for him and the family and we always wondered how it all could have happened so quickly and without warning. The Times article in December mentioned that rare instances of psychosis also occurred with SARs and other viruses. Although we can't know if our case is connected, the circumstances are similar. I hope that the recognition that some people with covid develop severe psychosis will lead to new understanding and better treatments for those unfortunate people who are so suddenly and sadly afflicted."
2021-03-22 19:31,"""Doctors say such symptoms may be one manifestation of brain-related aftereffects of Covid-19. Along with more common issues like brain fog, memory loss and neurological problems, “new onset” psychosis may result from an immune response, vascular issues or inflammation from the disease process, experts hypothesize. '
Mr. Agerton's experience reminds me of Susannah Cahalan's experience with an autoimmune disease as she described it in ""Brain On Fire"".  Out of the blue, she became paranoid.  At various stages of her illness she was aware that something was wrong with her mind.  After being given numerous tests, various diagnoses, various anti-psychotic medications, and having been hospitalized several times, she was finally correctly diagnosed with a form of encephalitis.  She was treated with corticosteroids and recovered.  Our immune systems are so complex and neurologists and immunologists are making so much progress in understanding these disorders."
2021-03-22 19:31,"So much of what is happening with COVID also happened during the 1918 pandemic, including the arousal of ""cytokine storm"" immune responses and enduring psychological issues in some who survived.  The author of The Great Influenza suggests in his book that the WWI Treat of Versailles was entered into by Woodrow Wilson, because of the effects of the 1918 flu on his mental state. We are just beginning to understand the world around us and viruses in particular."
2021-03-22 19:39,"With 30+ million cases in the USA, there is a great chance that a handful of people will experience unrelated psychosis or other symptoms. This is anecdotes at best and I am sorry to see it published in a newspaper of record."
2021-03-22 19:40,Thank you NYT for the article.  I also appreciate many of the comments sharing their views.
2021-03-22 19:40,"Like Mr. Agerton I had a psychotic episode after getting infected in March 2020. I also simultaneously experienced the sane and insane periods.   If it hadn’t been for The Body Politic support group, I would have been in serious trouble.  Every time I had a weird experience from brain fog to hallucination to shiny red toe to hair falling out I checked in to find out if anyone else had had a similar experience. It was particularly difficult to sort out what issues were related to lockdown isolation and other external factors vs the disease. I’m 95% better and in hindsight can see that the symptoms were definitely related to the disease.  Although I empathize with the medical community  during the past year, they need to recognize that Covid 19 isn’t just a pulmonary disease.  Doctors, please keep up with the research! This isn’t over by a long shot."
2021-03-22 18:55,"What a nightmarish thing for Mr. Agerton and his family to go through. Best wishes for a rapid and complete recovery.
But reading the part about how Mr. Agerton was aware that his thoughts were delusional even as he had them made something click for me.
In February of 2020, when Covid was a blip (but a rapidly growing one) on the radar, my son's girlfriend visited and they spent a long day exploring Manhattan--no masks at that point. A bit later I wondered about whether they (and I, by association) might have been exposed, but none of us ever had symptoms.
But about a month later my son went to visit his girlfriend in AZ. Suddenly he was calling and texting me in terrible anxiety about all kinds of vague medical concerns. He went to at least one ER, but there seemed to be nothing physically wrong. He was freaking his girlfriend (and me, and himself) out. He'd had depression in the past, but this was bizarre and unusual hypochondria.
And then he texted me, ""I know that I'm acting crazy.""
Afterwards it all subsided, and I put the episode down to the anxiety we were all feeling by then.
But now this article has me wondering if perhaps he HAD been infected in February, and if his ""acting crazy"" might have been related to that.
He's totally fine now (aside from being attending a music conservatory virtually from home, which isn't QUITE what we'd envisioned for his college years!)."
2021-03-22 18:38,How can you be sure it has anything to do with Covid?
2021-03-22 19:30,"Is Fox News reporting this symptom too?

Maybe the CDC should mail everyone in America a list of Covid symptoms, long-haul Covid and chronic health issues from Covid to inspire those that refuse to get vaccinated to do so."
2021-03-22 19:43,"Kudos to this man for having the courage to tell his story. Sadly, the reality is that his career probably is over. It shouldn’t be that way, but it is."
2021-03-22 19:43,"The variety of Covid sequelae is frightening and fascinating.  Far different is brain fog from psychosis! Yet, fluctuations in estrogen might possibly account for what appear to be neurological changes. These psychotic episodes sound as much like hormonal psychoses to me as they do PTSD; and who knows whether this symptom is the virus impacting brain or whether it is the result of glandular dysfunction? (whose functioning rests so close to olfactory function)

...On another note, having treated many patients with advanced cancer, I know that chronicity of symptoms can itself be a problem.  I often recommended The Alchemy of Illness by Kat Duff, a therapist who dealt herself with serious chronic fatigue syndrome, for help coping with conditions prolonged-for-who-knows-how-long.  It's a brilliant classic about (not relinquishing the dream of light while) learning to embrace the shadows that are integral to healing, to living..."
2021-03-22 19:56,"Covid death rates dominate the headlines but the long-haul effects are what thousands - millions (?) will be living with for God knows how long. Meanwhile, in far too many places the party goes on with no regard to consequences - either short or long term. Thanks to conservative Trump clone politicians in Spain - Madrid has opted to become the Miami Beach of Europe. We truly are our brothers' keeper."
2021-03-22 19:58,"This may be happening in a small fraction of a percent, but infections are happening in large numbers so more people can be expected to have their lives changed permanently. After an abrupt onset psychotic episode or two, how long do you go without one before you feel free from it happening again?

I experienced a frightening neurological anomaly decades ago. At the time after a full work-up it was declared a ""bad fainting episode"" rather than a seizure (I think the doctor did that to protect me from things like losing my driver's license when they weren't sure what if anything was wrong much less how to address it if something was wrong). I was advised, however, to not do a long list of things alone for 5 years in case whatever is was happened again. It never happened again, thankfully, but I still think about when I am alone and would likely injure myself if it did.

Our lack of understanding about this disease and its long-term consequences is why I don't even want a mild case and work so hard not to get infected (and was happily vaccinated)."
2021-03-22 20:00,"I think the virus has contributed to a huge change in society's reaction to mental illness primarily because we may have experienced it ourselves. 
I am 76-years old and was able to avoid the virus (thankfully) by staying at home. I only went to the grocery store once a month. Everything else was delivered.
I was able to get both doses of the vaccine via the good graces of the CDC setting those helpful guidelines to help us older citizens get first dibs. I will be forever grateful for that bit of help. 
Getting both doses of the vaccine has given me some relief from the constant worry of getting the virus. I have chronic ailments that the virus would have exacerbated. I worried that it could easily kill me. Premises considered, I have been totally isolated for the past year.
So, how does that level of constant anxiety impact my mental health. Frankly, some days are better than others. 
I notice I have less patience with people who refuse to adhere to masking guidelines and who refuse to receive the vaccine. In the past I would have felt tolerant of those choices, but not anymore. 
Bottom line, I have far less patience with people and society than I did before the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a huge wakeup call that let me understand, for the first time, that society depends upon mutual cooperation and when it ceases to exist, or is otherwise obstructed by politics and other institutional mainstays, it places us all in mortal danger."
2021-03-22 18:58,"This is a devastating and utterly tragic after-effect of COVID for those affected and for their families. We can only pray is temporary.  Even more horrifying is the ominous question it gives rise to:  what will happen when paranoid psychosis strikes an already belligerent, gun-obsessed  personality, of which there are millions in the U.S."
2021-03-22 19:10,"I would like to say to Mr. Agerton and his family that I am so sorry this happened, and that it was very generous  & strong to share their story to help other people. I hope that things continue to get better and better as soon possible."
2021-03-22 19:34,"I am really sorry that Mr. Agerton has had his life disrupted like this. But I am writing because another sentence caught my eye:

""Finally, her [the wife's] nurse friend found space at the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle.""

It seems that, given the lack of accessibility to health care in this country, it is really crucial to have connections to the medical/industrial complex in order to get care. 

What would happen to a person in Mr. Agerton's situation if he/she didn't have any connections?"
2021-03-22 19:53,I am reminded of a NYT article I read years ago about the possible viral origins of OCD.  It makes me wonder if the Republicans against the vaccine already have the psychosis.
2021-03-22 19:27,"Having had psychotic episodes (not related to COVID), I can relate to much of this story, especially the inadequate (arguably inept) treatment by the emergency room (sending him home with sleeping pills). The typical ER is ill-equipped to handle psychosis. I once visited the same ER three times over a four-day period. The first time, they gave me an IV sedative. The second and third times, I was left on a gurney in a private room. I was also handcuffed to the gurney because I was arrested for disorderly conduct after I left the hospital the first time. Only at the fourth visit at a different hospital was I given antipsychotic medication. I remember the doctor saying, ""We're going to put you on an antipsychotic because you are psychotic."""

2021-03-22 19:36,"Really an interesting article.  Can someone now fund a study to test all the conspiracists and q types for Covid antibodies.  Could they have been infected, but asymptomatic (apart from irrational behavior)?"

The Last Guy had these symptoms before and after he got the virus."
2021-03-22 19:09,"Thank you sir for being willing to share this deeply personal experience.  The stigma around asking for help with mental health is real and does a lot of harm to the quality of life of those who feel the need to suffer in silence or “pull themselves up by the bootstraps.”  I work in inpatient psych and the general public would be shocked if they saw the range of people that find themselves in acute mental health crises at some point, generally after allowing very distressing — & treatable — symptoms to fester for many years.  While in the US I worked at a world-renowned facility in Boston which serves as Harvard’s primary teaching hospital for psych, so the diversity of people I encountered spanned across EVERY age/race/religion/culture/academic & professional achievement/financial status/line of work/etc. People that NOBODY would ever guess had ever dealt with severe psychological distress.  People become quite good at wearing masks to hide their inner pain from the outside world, but it always eventually catches up with them in one way or another.

The quicker people are able to find the courage, and it does take courage — especially for men (the older, the more difficult it is), to admit to someone that they need some help, the better their lives will be for it.  I’ve worked with former special forces soldiers & professional athletes, so any idea that these issues equate with some kind of weakness is utter nonsense."
2021-03-22 19:31,"I would like to know more about Mr. Agerton's training.  A marine guard on a submarine for a couple months?  That could drive the best service member crazy. 

Now add one year's lock-down, tracking apps on your not-so-smart phone and the loss of a half-million people in the U.S. 

It's a sad story.  Hope things get better."
2021-03-22 18:50,Wonder how many other of the ‘benign’ coronavirus infections out there cause similar issues that we then attribute to chance or cannot explain ??
2021-03-22 18:52,"Having stumbled yesterday on some information on PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus) which has a sudden onset after an infection, I wonder if a similar mechanism might be at work here. Doctors believe the psychiatric and neuromuscular symptoms of PANDAS are a result of rogue antibodies penetrating the blood-brain barrier and attacking the brain in a fashion similar to autoimmune disorders."
2021-03-22 18:56,This patient will need to remain on an antipsychotic for the rest of his life.  Low antipsychotic dosages have very little downside and they are effective.  For years it has been my hypothesis that psychosis is caused by viral infection either from epigenetic interactions or just in genetically susceptible people.  Recently studies have shown that people on the schizophrenic spectrum are much more likely to develop dementia.
2021-03-22 20:25,"This EXACT same thing happened to me last January 2020 after extensive travel- prior to any Covid cases reported in the US. I got the sickest I've ever been in my life, and then randomly had this extraordinary bout of psychosis. I still have a lingering cough and an inhaler... as well as the lingering feeling I'm insane. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced in my life. And, like, the subject of this article, I was well-aware that I was experiencing VERY REAL paranoia but that I was likely not rational. Do I reach out to the NYT? I tried the police AND committed myself to a hospital and have since tried a couple of other doctors-- both to ask about Covid confirmation AND about the paranoia- nobody knows what to make of it. It's really unsettling."
2021-03-22 20:25,"I am really grateful to read this article.  I am glad Mr. Agerton was able to get help. ""How long am I going to live with this?"" he asks.  I suspect a long time. But as others have noted, this article reminds us about those who will not be able to get help and will end up hurting themselves or others. It's tragic."
2021-03-22 20:28,"If Covid 19 can affect our brain in such a way to generate symptoms typical of Schizophrenia, imagine what happens to those who already suffer from it and the prospects for recovery. One of my brothers passed away last month from covid complications. He was healthy and strong but suffered from schizophrenia. He was taking antipsychotic medication for many years and was carefully following covid precautions. Though with medication he was able to function well, once he got covid, he became unable to describe his symptoms and was not diagnosed with covid until several days after contagion. He was hospitalized for breathing problems and after 5 days was covid free and sent home with oxygen supplement. After 5 days at home, he took a turn for the worst. His oxygen levels went down, he paniqued and started losing oxygenation fast. Slowly he became worse and desperate and was taken back to the hospital that same day.  He tested negative for covid yet his bronquial tubes were blocked and his lungs filled with water. His tubes were unblocked and they blocked again. By the end of the day he was gone.
I later found a study from NYU Langone which concluded that people  with schizophrenia are 2.7 times more likely to die of covid or complications than others. T cells get don't perform or know how to defend. Reading this article, I imagine the fear my brother went through not knowing what was happening to him or tricks his mental state played in his final hours."
2021-03-22 20:29,"Thank you for writing this moving piece about the severe mental health complications of Covid.  Mr. Agerton deserves a ton of credit for going public with his story--I am sure this will help others who may have similar symptoms but due to shame/stigma around mental illness, may not be seeking appropriate care.   It's so important to continue educating the public that mental health and physical health are intertwined."
2021-03-22 20:21,"I wish and his family a recovery.

as a teenager I watched a close relative descended into a bad mental illness.  its horrifying for those afflicted as well as family members and friends.

this is a very strange virus.   hard to believe it just popped out of nowhere - its an extremely evil swiss army knife of symptoms."
2021-03-22 20:22,Has the wonder drug cannabis been suggested or tried yet?
2021-03-22 20:22,"Highlighting extreme outlier cases--a hallmark of NY Times pandemic reporting. These are true cases, but far from the typical COVID experience, which is to be asymptomatic or with mild symptoms in which you recover within a couple of weeks at home on your own and then go about your life as usual after the recovery period. You would better serve readers to focus on reporting minus the hysteria-focus on outliers. That includes educating readers about the freedom and safety of outdoor social gatherings and the cardinal rule of protection during the pandemic: Never going into a home or vehicle that isn't your own unless you are there to deliver a professional service. And if you are ARE inside another's home for a professional service, keeping your mask on at all times and keeping as far as possible from the residents."
2021-03-22 20:22,"Karl Menninger, MD, a founder of American Psychiatry, wrote a book titled ""Psychoses Associated with Flu"" having studied the phenomenon shortly after the 1918-19 flu pandemic. 
Clearly post-viral syndromes are real and can have very unexpected consequences. I would expect to see sequelae (doctor speak for post hoc consequences) relating to neurological damage from COVID for a year or longer. 
Also well known was the worldwide epidemic of encephalitis lethargica after 1919, written about by Sacks et al and which made it into a film, ""Awakenings"". Encephalitis lethargica followed the flu pandemic if not immediately then 1-5 years later, with one case of parkinsonian type disorders even decades after. 
In Africa, the post-flu period was referred to as the ""year without a harvest"" due to rampant fatigue. 
We know that viral particles probably (definitely) made it into our on genome, heretofore being referred to as ""junk"" DNA but of course we're finding there is no such thing as ""junk"" DNA. Some of this will not be to our survival benefit; it will continue to hurt people for a while. 
Someone needs to make the case for a much more proactive CDC and NIH, certainly more forward looking as to emerging viral diseases which, heretofore, have been discussed at length but not addressed effectively.

2021-03-22 20:36,"Again, to look at mortality is one thing. This virus, newly released upon humanity and in massive numbers, will have its unique effects on morbidity."
2021-03-22 20:39,Has he been tested with the autoimmune encephalitis panel? New onset schizophrenia a few weeks after an infection fits the picture....
2021-03-22 20:55,"Firstly, kudos to Mr. Agerton for sharing his story. He easily could have remained anonymous and just accepted his current recovery, chalking it up to experience, without publicizing his story. This will absolutely aid others and also confirm to some in the medical profession the reality of a variety of post covid, and long-haul symptoms that a number of people seem to be experiencing. It's fortunate that he had a support group of family, friends and associates that were able to help shepherd him through this, as well as his coming under the care of Dr. Zantrop, who, perhaps unlike the emergency room physicians who sent him home with sleep meds, knew that this ran deeper and required serious care.
Thanks you, Ivan Agerton, for sharing your story. Sincere wishes for your continued recovery.
And, thanks to Pam Belluck, for the article."
2021-03-22 20:59,"A recent article stated that severe symptoms experienced by ""long-haulers"" -- post-covid sufferers-- improved with the vaccine.  I wonder whether post-covid psychosis might also abate with vaccination?"
2021-03-22 21:01,"'Lock up the guns' Great point of the need for Red Flag Laws.
The lethality of the method is closely related if a sucide attempt is successful.
In England when the country switched from the more toxic fuel gas to the less toxic natural gas.   The raw numbers of sucide dropped.  
Sucide attempts with a gun are very successful, jumping out of a first story building, much less."
2021-03-22 21:12,I'm thinking about a recent article about long-term covid patients feeling greatly improved soon after getting covid vaccinations.  I wonder if getting vaccinated would help in this case.
2021-03-22 21:19,"Thank you for sharing this story and drawing attention again to this complication of COVID.  My 33 yo son who has autism and lives in a group home developed new onset of psychosis after having COVID in November.   He continues to have auditory and visual hallucinations despite IVIG and adjustment of antipsychotic medications.  We have sought help from Neurologists, Psychiatrists and a mutispecialty clinic for Post Covid syndrome at Penn, but there are no good answers yet.  We need the best and brightest to tackle this problem along with the better recognized neurological, cardiac and pulmonary complications."
2021-03-22 20:56,"What a nightmare, Mr Agerton deserves some kind of COVID medal for both the anguish he bears as well as his cognitive ability to remain partially detached enough to report the symptoms clearly to health professionals.
I’m not a healthcare professional so I have no idea of the root cause of this acute psychosis. It must be frightening and a plunge into unknown territory, a condition designated as “mental illness”.
It disqualifies those so designated from certain professions and is a reason for a denial of refugee status or citizenship in some countries.
I hope Mr Agerton enjoys a full recovery to balanced neural chemistry and function."
2021-03-22 21:17,"So, we're going to start blaming covid for every ailment, just like liberals are blaming the Trump administration for every ill in this country.

There is really no connection, in either case.

Pathetic how in this country, so many people need an excuse...someone or something else to blame, as long as it's not ourselves."
2021-03-22 21:12,"This is off topic but I need help. I am a 92 year old diabetic with AF, homebound living alone, who has been unable to get a local appointmend for covid vaccine to this date. I am registered with VAMs and my local health dept. So far no response. I believe I have dropped through the cracks."
2021-03-22 20:36,This likely has zero correlation with COVID.
2021-03-22 20:50,"Maybe what should be looked at is encephalitis/AE/PANS.  Those are not new, those are studied and researched already.  It is not new for a really bad illness to cause this in some.  What can often not help is just psych meds, while ignoring the   immune dysfunction and inflammation gone awry, and probably MCAS.  PANS is not just pediatric, nor is it always acute.  This is no surprise to many of us who have had all sort of levels of this happen from illnesses and/or toxins long before covid.  I see certain things that all point to immune and inflammation gone awry.  I see tons of cases of MCAS and dysautonomia's talked about in long covid groups.   Want to learn more?  Look at MCAS, dysautonomia's, PANS and probably viral myositis, and target those issues, via antihistamines,  anti-inflammatories, diet, gut health.  There is an entire pediatric community, within PANDAS/PANS world that knows how the bodies response to illnesses can cause issues."
2021-03-22 20:52,"Interesting what shows up on the front page of the NYT.  On the front page of the Guardian today was a story of how the fight against tuberculosis, a disease that kills 1.5 million per year, year after year after year, has been set back 12 years by the worldwide Covid lockdowns.

But: a handful of folks who developed psychological issues chronologically after Covid--let's put that on the front page."
2021-03-22 20:50,"I Hate Hate, stories like this.  When you have 50,000,000 people with a virus the odds of a whole bunch of people also have unrelated aliments is incredibly high, I mean high like 100%.

A story like this causes panic when it is not needed.

The anxiety is normal and some people will have a hard time of it but this happens even without Covid to many people."
2021-03-22 21:11,"""Just like the flu"" said the other guy. No not at all and in addition to the one of every six hundred Americans that have died so far from Covid-19 we have a lot of people with ongoing struggles such as Mr. Agerton's. Yet nasty clowns like Senator Paul keep lying about how too much is made of the disease and mask wearing and so on. I can not imagine how much more suffering there would be if the other guy had succeeded in overthrowing the electoral process."
2021-03-22 21:20,"Though people seem unable to accept this in the way they do the physical issues, all diseases bring psychological and emotional changes to some degree. 

To a remarkable extent, I got from a statin drug many of the effects long-haulers are getting from Covid-19. Peripheral neuropathy is certainly a physical illness, but just as clearly, many aspects such as ""brain fog,"" are emotional and psychological.

When attention to the disease is caught by psycological issues, it even occurs that the physical manifestations, though so clear as to be photographable (statinstories.com), get denied."
2021-03-22 21:20,It may be nothing more than inflammation of the brain. I expect this must have been hypothesised and addresed with steroids.
2021-03-22 20:29,"We really need to ditch the term ""mental health"" because of its associations with poor self control or lack of discipline. It needs to be called ""brain health"" because that's what it is - an organ in your body. When it's sick things get awful fast. Yet people still say ""it's all in your head"" meaning you are somehow responsible personally for what is a real illness, physical in nature and behavioral in outcome. Psychiatrists in my state are reimbursed at the same rate as a psychologist and there is no comparison. Psychiatrists are MD's who know physical medicine.  Perhaps this occurrence with Covid will help shore up our mostly nonexistant ""mental health' structure. Long haul Covid and Covid in general, is likely here to say."
2021-03-22 20:43,"Not the main point of the article certainly but important: the ER sent Mr. Agerton home with sleeping pills.  No indication of a psych. consult or Rx for an antipsychotic.  

Many ER's are poorly equipped to handle psych. emergencies or call in consultants to clarify a patient's situation."
2021-03-22 20:57,"This is a really hard sell. As if the Covid has a mechanistic cause for psychosis. Maybe an extreme edge case if at all. The more obvious problem is how psychologically damaging masks and shutdowns have been for everyone. No one cares of course. ""The children are resilient"""
2021-03-22 21:01,"What would the effect of these psychiatric symptoms of Covid be, on people who already battle psychiatric illnesses?"
2021-03-22 20:38,"My cousin's son went psychotic in his mid-20s. Moved out West, was isolated by friends but making new ones until Covid created a work at home isolated, smoke weed all day phenomena. That and the work stress -- rapid descent into psychosis and in liberal California ... absolutely no way to hospitalized non-violent people. After some frustrating weeks, an old friend took 15 minutes to talk him into hospitalization.

I don't know if maybe this kid had Covid too? Or it's just a ""normal"" stress/isolation/marijuana-induced psychosis.

BTW, a good friend of mine and co-founder of a successful company we sold had a much earlier psychotic break basically from smoking too much marijuana (it is psychosis inducing in susceptible individuals). The break happened many years ago and it took him 2 years to fully recover, but he's been fine now for years w/o meds ... but the Doctors told him never to smoke week nor take a hallucinogen again."
2021-03-22 21:19,"What a strange disease to cause psychosis in Mr. Agerton. I am so sorry for all the suffering of his whole family.  Psychosis must have terrified his wife and I am happy she persisted in finding difficult to locate care for him. I write this with a slight fever from my 2nd Pfizer shot, feeling grateful  and I  hoping there will be immunity for everyone from the strange and deadly disease of Covid"
2021-03-22 20:49,"I am an ER nurse, and I have actually seen this phenomenon personally. For reasons of privacy I obviously can’t say or describe the person. What is important to remember is that the psychotic patient isn’t necessarily “crazy,” and deserve to be treated with compassion and respect. Another misconception that many folks have is that psychotic patients have no attachment to reality. Some are completely detached from reality, but a surprising number of patients realize that their delusions are just that: delusions. They are seeking help to rid themselves of these distracting and terrifying thoughts."
2021-03-22 21:26,"I think the scariest thing  to me is that his rational mind was conscious of his mental problems and decline.  How frightening is it to know you're losing it, and KNOW that you can't just turn it off?"
2021-03-22 21:30,Scary story. What's the prevalence of something like this happening? Is this a one off or a pattern? Supporting data would be helpful. There's a link to another article that says 150 people in Britain were hospitalized with psychiatric symptoms and 10 of them experienced psychosis. Am I missing numbers somewhere?
2021-03-22 21:33,I don't see any actual numbers or estimates of people affected in this way. The article suggests that there are many. So let's hear if that is true or not . An isolated case or not ? Is it a scare story or not ? Should be be at all concerned or not ? Why are we being kept in suspense ?
2021-03-22 21:31,I have long term covid-19. I’m now grateful to .only. have lost my ability to run marathons.
2021-03-22 21:31,I’ve been there. Pure terror. Never forget your not alone.
2021-03-22 21:38,"If stories like this don't convince you to get the vaccine, nothing will."
2021-03-22 21:38,"COVID-19 is, obviously, extremely prevalent.
A major confounder here is the imposition of social restrictions for 1+ year.  

Correlation is not causation...is there even a correlation?
Is there an uptick in new onset psychosis above the expected baseline? 

 And then once you can show that, can you show that it is mechanistically related to COVID?  

Given the prevalence of COVID, there are handfuls of people experiencing ""post-COVID _____"" fill in the blank to your heart's content, and get another NYTimes article out of it."
2021-03-22 21:50,"Mr. Agerton’s bravery in sharing his difficult story should be applauded and met with gratitude. Undoubtedly there are more people who’ve experienced something similar, and I hope their experience will be less awful for knowing they aren’t alone."
2021-03-22 21:51,"It is astonishing the degree to which I can relate to everything that's been described in his experience. I have a medical condition, cavernous angiomas, where veinous malformations bleed/hemorrhage. My first bleed was in the brainstem and the cluster of veins was removed surgically. The second bleed was in my right temporal lobe and led to epilepsy - which is controlled, strangely enough, by a medicine used for bipolar disorder. All this to say, there were in fact moments of paranoia and fear that he describes - where he is experiencing it viscerally and yet another part of his brain recognizes as improbable - that I lived almost identically. It was the ""hallucinations"" that caused me to go back to the hospital and say ""Something is wrong in my head"" and to eventually have a proper diagnosis and treatment. I understand that there were MRI and other scans done for this gentleman but I can't help but wonder whether this condition is tied to any kind of bleeding in the brain that is either brought on by COVID or some other condition."
2021-03-22 21:55,"My wife, son and myself contracted covid last March. 0ur 19 year old son had a classic case and constant fever  often spiking to 105 over 8 days. My wife and myself had mild symptoms but I found myself very overstimulated and slightly manic, severe insomnia etc. I’m surprised doctors did not give medicine to reduce inflammatory response like IL 6 inhibitors etc. ( my son’s symptoms resolved rapidly with the anti inflammatory naproxen )There have been many papers linking many psychiatric and neurological disorders to various viruses or bacteria over the years. Also inflammatory response via cytokines is implicated in most neurological disorders. It has been known for years that interferon therapy often cause severe depression etc"
2021-03-22 21:57,"He's a brave man to open up about this strange experience and the battle between his rational mind and these weird thoughts. I read that long-haulers can sometimes improve after they get the vaccine. Not most of them, but a significant minority. I hope this turns out to give him some relief."
2021-03-22 21:59,There are people that have had the virus getting the vaccine and if he reads this he should look into the possibility the vaccine will stop the symptoms. It was in one of the major newspapers last week
2021-03-22 22:00,"May this article be read by the unwise that say that the ""low death rate is worth the risk"" of not masking and not getting a vaccine. There are so many ""lesser but included"" maladies in this virus."
2021-03-22 22:07,"Thank you for sharing this story. 

I had small postpartum psychotic breaks after each of my kids were born. Some people have depression from the rapid change in hormones. In each case - I had a touch of psychosis (lucky me) where I felt like everyone was looking at me and angrily following me if I left the house without my newborn, and that my MIL was trying to keep me from my daughter because she and my husband had decided I couldn’t take care of an infant. It was terrifying, but I was able to see pretty quickly that I was having delusions, thanks to reading about Michael Lewis’ wife having a postpartum psychotic break. If not for knowing what it was, I might have thought I was losing my mind - but knowing it was a weird change of chemicals allowed me to calm my brain down even while it was happening. It passed within a day or two. 

That’s all to say - our brains are complex machines, and it is so helpful to know that Covid might in very rare cases cause psychosis, so that people know to look for these symptoms and treat them when they arise. I wish Mr Agerton the very best in his recovery."
2021-03-22 22:08,"Mr. Agerton, thank you for sharing your experience. I'm sure it will help other COVID sufferers if they should be experiencing similar side effects."
2021-03-22 22:10,"These symptoms remind me a lot of a friend who got NMDA receptor encephalitis after a viral illness two years ago.  She went from healthy with no psych issues to having hallucinations and eventually unable to speak.  In that illness the body has an autoimmune reaction to one of the neurotransmitters in the brain.   

I am sure researchers are looking for similar mechanisms here. Interesting and scary stuff. 

The treatment for autoimmune encephalitis is Rituximab. I wonder if they are looking at that as a treatment?"
2021-03-22 21:44,"Any stress—divorce, sickness—can induce or exacerbate mental illness. There may be a direct link between the virus and psychosis. But the stress of Covid illness in the midst of a pandemic is enough to throw someone into, say, a psychotic depression."
2021-03-22 22:00,I feel bad for this guy.  After my COVID experience i’ve had an awakening!  I’ve never felt better!  It has to do with being on aware of what I’m eating and exercise program.  But i like to think of it as my new lifestyle.  Better days ahead!
2021-03-22 22:04,"Mr. Agerton’s experience though agonizing is inspirational on a scientific basis.  1) His symptoms of psychosis were relieved if not cured by the application of neuropharmacological agents prescribed by skillful doctor(s). 

2) This case is one where a  SARS-CoV-2 infection effects the central brain, and its chemistry.  Obviously, the devils entered the brain. 

Brains have no immune system at all.  Brains do have reserves of biogenic amines, protein components to keep all of the neurotransmitters and aides to the many neurobiochemical reactions, going. 

Drugs like methamphetamine and base cocaine consume the biogenic amines reserves and people who use such drugs end up highly paranoid and dangerous. 

I would like to add that the NY Times and others ""Bill Maher"" are pushing the idea of health benefits of hallucinogenic drugs.  Here we have a case wherein if the paranoid person consumed such a drug, might end in tragedy.   Hallucinogenic chemicals play with the many deeply located biogenic amines and the many neurotransmitters of the brain, often to the extreme adversity of users of such hallucinogens. 

There is a direct correlation between dopamine levels and hallucinations.  Parkinson's disease is treated with agents to increase dopamine production in the brain.  Some symptoms of Parkinson's disease include hallucinations of a paranoid quality i.e. little green men."
2021-03-22 22:06,"I listened to this story on today's ""Daily"" podcast and was struck by the amazing bravery of this man and his family. His story, while rare, needs to be shared among those who still believe that Covid is no worse than the seasonal flu."
2021-03-22 22:08,"Horrifying. Yet people are still not wearing masks inside. Just the other day some guy came right up to me at the whole foods checkout despite the signs, with his kid not wearing a mask and shouting at the top of his lungs."
2021-03-22 22:06,My dad had a traumatic brain injury that accelerated what turned out to be Lewis Body dementia. He became paranoid after the injury and - although it comes and goes - it never really got better. It sounds so much like this... it makes me wonder if it’s the inflammation or an underlying problem like LBD
2021-03-22 22:15,"I hope Mr Agerton's story is read and *believed* by the people who, if they admit COVID is real, dismiss it as ""just like the flu or a cold.""

Applause to Mr Agerton and his family for telling their story that it might help other suffers."
2021-03-22 22:15,"I had a mild case of Covid-19 in December, 2020 that lasted about ten days.  With that said, I thought it was the most ""unnatural"" medical experience I've ever encountered in my life.  During that time, I had the loss of smell as well, plus moments where my brain just went irrationally blank.  Praying Mr. Agerton recovers soon."
2021-03-22 22:16,"It sounds like a mental 'fight or flight' scenario arising from stress, mental and/or physical, caused by Covid.   Our brains do some amazing and unexpected things.    I hope Mr. Agerton and his family do well and my thanks to them for having the courage to tell their story.   Not many people would not be willing to make such a selfless contribution to further understanding of Covid."
2021-03-22 22:18,"Best wishes for Mr. Agerton’s recovery. I had postural orthostatic tachycardia after COVID-19. Then, I began experiencing attacks during which I could not speak properly (slurring, not finding words), I was dizzy and had problems walking. I also was having trouble thinking clearly. I drove myself to the ER during a bad event. I was having multiple transient ischemic attacks. COVID-19 can lead to hyper coagulation and this was leading to small blood clots that were causing the TIAs. I am now taking aspirin and I am finally improving after several weeks. During that time I had some disordered thinking. I have never been so scared. It felt as if my brain was shutting down."
2021-03-22 22:19,"Research has associated inflammatory diseases like Crohn’s Disease with anxiety disorders and bipolar, and the biologics used to treat them with remission of psychiatric symptoms. Hopefully the troubling relationship between Covid and psychosis will spur research into the relationship between brain inflammation and psychiatric disorders."
2021-03-22 22:25,"My sympathy to Mr. Agerton.

Once again, we have new evidence---particularly for the Covid deniers---that increased mortality is not the sole ""cost"" resulting from the Covid epidemic and its mismanagement in the US.  We will likely also be dealing with Covid-related disabilities---now including psychological disabilities---for years to come, even among many of those who supposedly had ""mild"" or asymptomatic cases."
2021-03-22 22:10,How cruel this virus is.
2021-03-22 22:21,"People get psychosis every year. Hundreds of millions got COVID this year, some were bound to receive one after the other. I’ll believe it when I see the studies."
2021-03-22 22:09,A reminder that there are people with serious mental health illnesses who live with psychosis throughout their lives.
2021-03-22 22:43,"that's the problem with this particular virus.  the effects are broad, and vary widely.  from absolutely benign to horrific.  everyone in the country needs to understand this and then perhaps they will comply with best practices and not magical thinking."
2021-03-22 22:47,"Stories like this serve as reminders why “catching or transmitting” COVID-19 must be avoided. It’s not just about staying off a ventilator, there can be terrifying consequences from just being infected."
2021-03-22 22:49,"I have Bipolar I which was well under control before I caught Covid.  During my infection I had auditory hallucinations and during my recovery I had the kind of cognitive effects I associate with a bad mood cycle (mania followed by deep depression).  I recognized the psychosis for what it was because I had experienced it before.  It took a month to physically recuperate from the pneumonia and by then I had returned to a stable mood without any cognitive symptoms.  I attribute this to the combination of maintenance medication I was taking before and after infection, including an atypical antipsychotic.

I definitely had cognitive symptoms in the days immediately prior to the hallmark Covid symptoms like runny nose, diarrhea and shortness of breath.  My senses were heightened. Sounds, light, smell and taste were all very intense.  I was struggling to maintain focus on my work.  My resting heart rate also went up significantly."
2021-03-22 22:58,"I agree with others who sympathize with Mr. Agerton and his symptoms, which are clearly scary.  Still, as a cognitive neurologist, I feel that there’s a missing component here, which is that psychosis like this occurs not infrequently and there is no evidence presented to directly link OVID-19 infection with his symptoms.  The Latin for this fallacy is “post hoc, ergo proctor hoc”, it occurred before so it must have caused.  TO be clear, I’m not stating that COVID-19 didn’t cause his symptoms, I’m merely pointing out its a hypothesis and it should be clearly explained that the alternative hypothesis is that when many millions of people develop COVID, some of them will also develop other medical conditions unrelated to the COVID."
2021-03-22 22:58,"I read in another NYT article that some people who had long haul covid took the vaccine jab and their symptoms cleared up. For some,they got worse for a few days before their physical symposiums cleared up, for others, it was pretty quick. None mentioned they had psychosis, a few mentioned they had brain fog. Could Mr Agerton ask his doctors, if he had not already done so?

All the best. Be strong, it will not always be this way."
2021-03-22 23:02,"This may not be related, but a friend who had never been psychotic had a psychotic break and ended up in the hospital. He is anorexic and probably chronically under-nourished and dehydrated. In the hospital he was paranoid (didn't trust the hospital's water) and kept asking for his energy gum. It turns out that high caffeine use can cause psychotic symptoms and he appeared to be desperately needing a hit of that energy gum caffeine. He was probably lacking energy because he barely eats and used the energy gum to function. His very low calorie intake may have intensified his reaction to it.

Unfortunately this is not well known, so he was put on heavy anti-psychotics which have impaired his ability to think and act. He moves, thinks, and talks slowly and has almost completely withdrawn from social interaction. He's so afraid of having another psychotic break that he isn't willing to see if he can lower his dosage, under his doctor's care, of course. It's really sad. 

I don't know if any part of this offers a clue about Covid-related psychosis, but I thought I would share this info in case it happens to someone else."
2021-03-22 23:05,"I have had hospital psychosis. In fact I was dying. The dead called out to me.  
Stress and the lighting along with an infection and then the bits of conversations you become sure are about you till told they are not about you, and there are other people in the world.
Infection and lighting are issues.
It is dangerous for me to be in any hospital setting. A nurse told me I was deluded and I stopped to say it could well be the case."
2021-03-22 23:03,"This is a disease like none other. We have only scratched the surface with what we know. I think there are and will be so many more stories like this one. My heart goes out to people who are suddenly struck by strange symptoms after having had this disease. 

I have nothing but contempt for those who deny it based on the opinion of a dullard who had a big microphone and equally ignorant but loud-mouthed people buzzing around on social media and on Faux News. 

There's been plenty of time now to realize that it's a Big Deal and A Real Thing and we really don't have a clue since we're still fighting the spread. 

Wear your mask!"
2021-03-22 23:09,"I am so sorry to hear this.

I also had CoVid in November (and suspected to have had it in March 2020 as well) and had a psychosis episode for the first time two weeks ago. However there has been a bit of trauma and extreme stress over the past year for myself as well as an increase of cannabis usage. So it’s made sense that It happened when i looked at It down on paper.

I also do not have history of mental illness. But It has been very scary and confusing. This is making me even more scared because I have been recovering as it’s solely mental health. But if it’s because of CoVid and It could happen again after feeling better so soon...i really don’t know what to do."
2021-03-22 22:45,"What a tragedy--

--let's put this in (heightened) perspective:

540,000 dead, 30,000,000 infected; the 'long-haul' phenomenon percentage is shaking out to be about 10%.

That's 3,000,000 long-haulers--nearly one per cent of the population with long-term morbidity like Mr. Agerton's.

And 1 in 4  Americans are likely to not get vaccinated (nor to participate in other Covid-preventative measures, like masking)--

Where does the liability fall here?"
2021-03-22 22:30,"I had a severe case of COVID and was hospitalized for about two weeks, but seemingly recovered with no lingering effects. But I now have the whackiest dreams ever, each and every night. Bizarre, wild, and very memorable dreams. I did not have these prior to Covid. I cannot explain why I now have them."
2021-03-22 22:40,God bless him for sharing.
2021-03-22 22:52,"I like articles like these because I can show them to the people I know who will not take the vaccine or wear a mask. It’s like “Well, here’s another completely horrible outcome from this virus but just keep on not wearing that mask and keep on taking a pass on the jab.” So frustrating."
2021-03-22 22:53,"A neighbor of mine on Next Door recently responded ‘My body, my choice’ to another neighbor who reminded people to continue wearing masks and social distancing. This story shows exactly why such self-centered thinking is so absurd and dangerous.￼ For one, it’s not just your body; it’s anyone else’s body you happen to come in contact with when you’re infected. And the range of serious problems this virus can cause seems almost unlimited.￼"
2021-03-22 22:59,"I have a close relative who, at this moment, is on their second stay at a psychiatric ward for psychosis that all the family is believed to be COVID related. She was a front line worker and head of her department. Intelligent, confident and strong willed. In March of 2020 she probably contracted Covid, but was not tested. By June she was having delusions that common medications had fried her nervous system. She couldn’t sleep, was taking weeks off work, and forgetting things. By August she had lost her job and was admitted into a hospital for suicidal actions. She is about to be transferred to a state facility against her wishes. Its a tragic situation, and we don’t see any improvement with all the various medications."
2021-03-22 23:05,This happens with chronic Lyme and co infections.  The infections cross the blood brain barrier causing brain inflammation leading to psychiatric and neurologic disorders.
2021-03-22 23:05,"Yep, this happened to us as well. The hardest thing I've ever been through in my 56 years. A psychiatrist (the only one we could get an appt. with and he charged $950 an hour) told us that my dear one has schizophrenia. This unethical, narcissistic doctor was wrong, but the devastation at hearing it was still traumatizing. Stanford hospital was a NIGHTMARE and we left after waiting 7 hours without any care. We found our own way. We're still trying to find balance again."
2021-03-22 22:30,"Thank you to the author, Mr. Agerton and his family and his physician for being willing to tell this story.  I know that this psychosis is part of the Covid syndrome. I appreciate that the story includes how psychosis feels from the inside.  I just retired after working as a mental health professional in a Partial Hospitalization Program (subacute treatment) in a hospital.  I have worked with people with psychosis for a long time, before and during Covid.

I'll share some resources that may help anyone (and/or families), whether you have a personal connection or not.  First of all, in a mental health crisis, go to your local emergency room or an ER you trust.  A family member, therapist or doctor(or patient if they feel able) can call ahead to identify the patient coming to the ER & say why.  There should be a professional at the hospital to make an assessment and decide about safety and immediate treatment.  Often it is helpful for the professionals to get the family's or friend's reports of what is going on.

A community resource families may find helpful for emotional support is a local NAMI branch (National Alliance for Mental Illness) <a href=""https://www.nami.org/home"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nami.org/home</a>.  At various times they offer a Family-to-Family class which is about 10 weeks long, by donation or free.  I found that informed family members were able to manage their own stress by getting help themselves.  There are also voice hearing groups, for voice hearers, even if the psychosis is temporary.   Thank you."
2021-03-22 22:41,"If he hasn't already, Mr. Agerton should receive one of the Covid-19 vaccines. It seems that many long-Covid sufferers have improved after being vaccinated."

2021-03-22 23:19,"Granted I’m skeptical, but when I read no history of mental illness in him or his family my red flag alert sounded. 
No family is immune from mental illness. Every family has someone with some form of mental illness, whether it’s depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, spectrum disorders, eating disorders, attention disorders. If we really want to reduce stigma, we must acknowledge how widespread “mental illness” and not pretend it is merely psychotic disorders."
2021-03-22 23:19,My Sister in Law is going through this right now. It is frustrating that we can't find a mental clinic who will acknowledge that this is a real thing. She had no history of mental illness and she is only 37. This needs to get out to more people so that others can be aware so they don't hurt themselves or others. Luckily we were able to get her to the hospital. We need more research on this and we need to understand how long it will last. She has been suffering for weeks. Hope this article  spreads and it helps doctors understand the issue better. So grateful to know we are not alone.
2021-03-22 23:21,"""Emergency room doctors ruled out a brain tumor and sent him home with sleeping pills. But after he slept, 'the delusions picked right back up where he said good night to them the night before,' his wife said.""  Through much pain, I wish good luck to this man and his family.  Please pardon me but I must comment about the sexist mess of mental health care.  No one probably wants to hear this but you're lucky you're a man, with a supportive family.  As a female, without a family, who was suicide swatted at 48 by an EEOC documented psychologically abusive employer, I've been very unlucky and living a nightmare growing not diminishing since 2013.  Something like the direct opposite has happened to me.  I was never psychotic just targeted, which sounds psychotic, I know.  I was not suicidal but set up and mis-evaluated in the emergency room by an unsupervised student intern, who did not understand or believe that a woman my age might actually be telling the truth, not psychotic or suicidal.  Psychosis may also be mental torture but false charges of psychosis definitely are torture.  I need to stop reading the newspaper, one of my last connections to humanity because of the pain of reading the story of someone believed, someone supported by professionals and loved ones, someone who receives press coverage.  After nearly a decade of telling my story and only being able to claim further retaliation, my mental anguish is so incredibly painful on top of the loss I've been dealt."
2021-03-22 23:30,"@Judy 

My sister, who is 79, has had the two vaccination injections. She was very disabled in the same way after each: the next day sudden intense pain in one leg and significant disability. The first ""attack"" left her crawling across the garage floor and through the living room trying to reach her son who was in the back yard.

She described this experience to a caregiver, a nurse, and was told they hadn't heard of anything like this -- and that's as far as it went. 

I am no medical professional, but have been deeply exposed to medical jargon for 35 years as a graphics pro who constructs the graphics on the screens behind the presenters at Pharma meetings. And, yes, I read ALL the stuff.

I encouraged my sister with urgency to ask questions about clotting. The symptoms were there. And then...nothing.

Has anyone else had this experience after vaccination?

She was almost fully recovered after her first shot. Is now 2 weeks into the second shot with identical pain and identical slow pace of recovery."

2021-03-22 23:39,"We are learning all of these after effects of COVID-19 because it is so incredibly widespread, and with the numbers of reports the association cannot be denied.  It begs the question: how many of these kinds of psychiatric symptoms in others, long before COVID-19, were due to coronavirus, or other viral infections? Undoubtedly, many ‘psychotic breaks’ must have been due to just such an infection."

My work in psychotherapy alerted me to his history as a Marine. The intensity of military service causes many to push the images, the memories, the guilt, aside while resuming ""normal life."" The Covid virus can affect any and every organ in the body--why assume that the psyche which includes our history of emotional experiences is limited by the physical brain? 
Mr. Agerton has a great deal working in his favor: his awareness, his family, his love of nature, and his courage. This may be a time to face the aspects of his inner life that he's possibly ignored while focusing on an exciting outdoor adventurous life. Hopefully, he can mend what is torn, and harmonize his healing with the rest of his beautiful life."
2021-03-23 0:12,"In late January, shortly after my first vaccine, I become progressively, extremely ill with Covid over a period of  several days and was finally taken by EMTs to the hospital.  I had been unable to process what was happening to me other than being sick and could not make any decision about my care or seeking care.  Finally my grown children came, stepped in and called 911 for me.  At the hospital, at least in Jan-Feb, you were alone- completely alone, no visitors.  I was too weak to talk on the phone, and too sick to notice when anyone came in the room at first.  I tried hard to make sense of what was happening, but other than realizing why I could not breathe (O2 sats cratered early on even with oxygen), and that my lungs felt like they on fire with every breath, I could not put anything together.  I thought I was going to die. Alone.  The sadness was overwhelming.
Before retirement, I was a health care provider for 35 years, but none of that knowledge and experience could get through the fog.  The fog eventually lifted but not completely. The effects on my lungs may last for a very long time.  I wish that I could say the second vaccine made it all better, but it did not. There is much need for  thorough, and not just anecdotal research, on what Covid has done to us, physiologically and emotionally."

2021-03-23 1:15,"Covid-related psychosis provides a vivid example of the role of inflammation in psychiatric illness.  As a psychiatrist and neuroscientist I think we can learn a lot for cases like these.  In medicine we think of certain infections — like syphilis, classically — as “great imitators” by virtue of how well they mimic other conditions.  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is acting this way not only in the brain but other body systems as well. 

My long-term concern is that these brain sequelae of Covid infection will be even more pronounced in children who were exposed in utero.  I would not be surprised to see a spike in autism in a couple of years, and, perhaps, in schizophrenia and other serious mental illness in a couple of decades.  I fear that we are only seeing the top of the iceberg when it comes to the true public health burden of the pandemic."

These delusions are destroying families all over, kids, parents, spouses, grandparents, their relationships, jobs, health and grip on any relationship with reality or any apparent path back to it. Perhaps aftereffects of symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infections could underly some of this? (Like the heart disease and numerous other effects being identified.) I hope the medical and psychiatric community is or will soon be looking into this. It would be good to get some idea of how and why so many people could fall victim to this mass hysteria/psychosis."

Everyone around him had typical symptoms. A week after recovering he started acting very odd. He would talk to himself, isolate (normally very social), sleep all day (never a sleepy kid), would act very sad and quiet, he lost all motivation ( normally super driven), his grades went from AB to Fs, he would joke about death and he would spend hours in the backyard just walking around. In late February he showed us some journal entries that were very dark.  He started seeing a therapist however his suicidal thoughts turned to planning to act. He saw three Dr's until he was checked into a mental guidance hospital for children.  7 days later he is a tiny bit better but still very depressed and having dark thoughts. I've read and also talked to others who say this psychosis could be due to brain inflammation post covid. It seems likely since the bodies response to fighting a virus can prompt inflammation.

It took a long, long time to ease the symptoms. But it was a saving grace that I am self-aware. I have been in a mental hospital but mostly I manage. There have been times when it seemed like I was out of the woods. But the symptoms always come back. 

My psychiatrist prescribes medication that is very helpful. And I always adjust the medication to fit the circumstances. My psychiatrist tells me that I am one of the best at it. 

I suppose if my illness came on right after having COVID, I might believe that it was caused by COVID. But here’s the point. Sudden onset of psychosis is typical. And nothing about the symptoms described in this article  is particularly different from typical symptoms of psychoses not caused by COVID. 

There may be something the reporter neglected to report. But what is in the article does not come close to proving that the psychosis described caused by the disease. It is equally likely that it was a coincidence of timing."

“Like a light switch — it happened this fast ...” /// I’ve used that same phrase “like a light switch” to describe what happened to my mother 

Mr. Agerton’s experience reflects a phenomenon doctors are increasingly reporting: psychotic symptoms emerging weeks after coronavirus infection in some people with no previous mental illness... /// Last summer a doctor suggested my mother could possibly have had a ‘psychotic break’.

With Mr. Agerton, she said, “It’s almost like he had a split self where he was able to say, ‘My brain is telling me that the police are after me.’ And then he was also able to say, ‘I know that’s not true on some level, but it feels like reality to me.’” ... /// My mother knows something is wrong with her brain and says things like ‘they took my brain away’ and ‘I feel like they took my mind away’ and ‘I’m worried about someone taking my memory’.

An M.R.I. and other tests found no identifiable problems, said Dr. Zantop, who dove into researching Covid-linked cases... /// Same with my mother’s visit to the hospital last February days after her incident; tests found no identifiable problems; she improved somewhat a few months later and then deteriorated again"
2021-03-23 5:19,"I had a similar experience after having pneumonia, and being released to our home while starting a combination therapy that was steroid and an antibiotic together.  Wish I could tell you the name of it was; I remember my poor husband of 23 years having to talk to me to keep me rational and not spiraling.  It was terrifying, how quickly it happened.  I am normally a calm, meditative person, but that medication had me so whacked out.  I discontinued it then and called the Dr in the morning after the sleepless night of crazy.  He split the dosage into my “traditional” one antibiotic, one steroid.   
   My first thought is that these poor folks were given this medication to cure their covid related symptoms (not unlike pneumonia) and that this did them like it did me.  Scary."
2021-03-23 5:25,"Thank you to the Agerton family for publicizing this harrowing illness. As a psychiatrist working in a public safety net hospital, I hear many stories similar to this, though only a fraction involving COVID as a cause. Many cases of psychosis beg questions, often unanswerable by the currently practical tests, about the cause, but we learn of more such causes with each new tool to query the interface of brain and immune system which is intrinsic to our emotional learning and sense of identity. What struck me most about this particular story is that it is so easy to empathize with the subject, and the fear: “this could be anyone, including me.” Would we care less for him if there had been some uncle with a rumor of madness? Of if he personally had moments of instability as a younger man? I have seen similar cases myself, and agree: this is a disease one GETS, as one catches a cold, and thus there is hope that it may be cured and that the person “inside” is intact. Yet we ought to entertain the same empathy for the countless others afflicted by other mental illnesses, and relieve them of the burden of our judgment that this reflects who they ARE rather than what they HAVE or GOT. No one chooses to have schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, methamphetamine addiction, etc. Illness chooses those who are vulnerable and unlucky. Society chooses who to stigmatize and ostracize, as if the afflicted ARE the illness. If we all let this happen, we do so at the cost of our own human dignity."
2021-03-23 5:52,"Will the next pandemic be mental illness? I've read a few pieces on this phenomenon and wonder how long it will take to know how this disease will have affected people with an established history of mental illness. A family  member with a history of moderately well controlled illness has had a series of terrible setbacks since recovering from what almost certainly was covid. It's terrible to hear that people with no mental health history and who are accustomed to stress suddenly have the same type of symptoms as schizophrenics. I hope an upside will be that  greater numbers of people affected will result in more  innovation in the field with more reliable treatments. It is the worst possible affliction, like Alzheimer's striking a young person. My heart and thanks go out to this patient and his family for sharing their story."
2021-03-23 7:33,"I wish Mr. Agerton and his family the best, as he continues to make a full recovery. His brave voice is appreciated. He mentioned his “auditory hallucinations”.

This hallucinatory phenomena might be occurring in my own family.

Since my elderly uncle recovered from Covid earlier this year, he now experiences an ongoing and bothersome “dripping sound” in his home. He cannot remember when the sound started, 
but the first time he ever mentioned it was within a month of his recovery. 

He’s had several workmen visit, and they have found nothing awry in the plumbing or AC which might cause this... and they said they cannot hear it. Nowadays, my uncle tries to 
buffer the sound with a fan. 

There might be more people than we realize who have post-Covid hallucinations. Sadly, some will avoid telling others of this challenge... feeling that they have to suffer alone."
2021-03-23 8:08,"Curious to know how many of these people were treated with a steroid. Steroids especially after long term use can cause mania, psychosis and even schizophrenia which can occur long after the medication is longer in use."
2021-03-23 8:22,"I have a myriad of inflammation-related conditions (some genetic, some unknown) and frequent vitamin deficiencies, and I have bouts of anxiety, insomnia/brain fog, paranoia, and inability to taste/metallic taste.  My western-trained medical doctors and psychiatric doctors don’t treat these things as related.  I am often told that I should just relax more. That just isn’t useful. It’s been decades, and trying to “relax” hasn’t cut it. 

I hope doctors start taking covid-related long-haul and mental issues more seriously, and don’t tell them to just relax more too."
2021-03-23 8:26,"Underpinning the urgency of this story is that psychiatry is one of the great shortcomings of the health care delivery system today. The increasing emergence of mental illness, exacerbated by COVID, have exposed the great need for scholarships and endowment funding of medical school psychiatric studies, and its offshoots of psychiatric social work, psychology, etc.

All around Michigan it's difficult to find a psychiatrist who doesn't have a full calendar, and is able to take on another patient. I'm sure this is the case across the country. 

Because of the few psychiatrists in the field, many states and counties find it hard to hire psychiatrists for their prison systems, social work clinics, and related venues. Even signing bonuses and higher salaries are needed to attract psychiatrists. 

We need more university programs and greater emphasis and encouragement in psychiatric studies, including free tuition for medical students who enter this specialty."
2021-03-23 8:31,So it appears that this disease may be laying down a base or foundation of yet unknown problems to follow.  World health authorities must track these types of occurances (where they can)  in order to rule out any statistical anomolies and see whether this is in fact happening because of the virus.  If this little killer is seeding the population with psychosis or long term mental impacts then they have to plan detection and management as early as possible otherwise (at worst case) we might end up in a place where society breaks down. I really hope this family recovers fast and stays recovered.
2021-03-23 9:15,"good reporting and essential reading-covid and its long term effects are not well documented (not enough time has elapsed) but I wonder how many other illnesses may be causing what seem like unrelated mental illness.  A new prioity for the nation should be long term funding and research for the hows and whys of mental illness. It could be impacting our lives in ways we don't appreciate right now. On a one to one basis I would imagine that the impact of a person with mental illness  and his/her close family members and friends is fraught with difficulty and maybe some shame. You read about situations like this and I think (if you have never been in this situation) have little understanding of what the day to day life is like. I don't think anyone would choose it. It shouldn't be this way but do we as a country take it seriously enough?  Many diseases now cured or under control with proper medical treatment were once stigmatized but with research and education of the public are now ""handleable"". Best wishes and good thoughts to this man and his family-it is a tough road."
2021-03-23 9:49,"A 90 year old family member with diabetes was hospitalized in November for two weeks with Covid. Previously lucid, he came home with a rapidly deteriorating dementia including hallucinations. Finally, he was given a diagnosis of vascular dementia. It seems pretty clear that Covid caused or at least hastened this process, turning the last months of his life into a nightmare. He lives on, mostly out of touch with reality, impossible to handle at home, but we have no choice; no beds anywhere."
2021-03-23 9:52,"COVID has 2 phases. SARSCoV2 novel coronavirus replication and the body's reaction to the invasion. One of the hallmarks is the loss of smell and taste. The explanation is the damage done to the related nerves. So, it makes sense that the disease can also affect the sufferers' other physiological psychical components"
2021-03-23 10:18,"Personally I have no expectation of a return to normalcy any time soon.   And I am comfortable with the fact or idea that I may be wearing a mask every time I go out until the end of my days.  To think otherwise is to believe I can negotiate reality.  Not likely. The media is responsible for a great deal of the depression people feel and not likely to change.  They amplify any slight negativity into a colossal barrier.  In short, it is best to accept life on life's terms."
2021-03-23 11:39,"As others have said, there is still so much we don't know about this plague. We are -- all of us -- lucky to have Mr Agerton's testimony and he is perversely lucky to have retained the rational ability to recognize his sudden insanity. Impressive and courageous; thank you for this report."
2021-03-23 11:40,"I always have an issue when laymen assert a belief of no mental health issues. They are not subject matter experts.

In this case, it’s infuriating because it gives the reader only part of the story and often borders on misinformation. It is also infuriating with the disclosure he is “usually [an] unflappable former marine”.

I would be interested in reading the background of others with this condition. I would want to know if there are mental health risk factors, if there was a predisposition for mental illness, or if there were a combination of life stressors that may have contributed to a psychotic break?

I don’t doubt that covid played a factor, but I wonder about underlying issues. 

Early in the pandemic, I heard an interview of a young woman who reportedly had no underlying issues and she said “it’s as though the virus knows you better than you know yourself.” It was such a powerful statement it got my attention and I started noticing unique patterns in people infected. 

My sister, her husband, and two of her children eventually got it. They were definitely blessed in being able to recover. However, my sister with the most underlying issues suffered the most. And, her illness was rather predictable because she has diabetes. 

During her recovery period I spent 14 days reading everything and anything on the disease. And, again, I heard that woman’s voice. I believe we are not connecting obvious dots after the fact."
2021-03-23 11:42,"I’m interested in technology in a smart home.

Might this have exacerbated his symptoms?

Some individuals are sensitive to WiFi.  

There is a paragraph about his symptoms starting when the family first moved into the rental property.

Might this be also a factor?

What happens to a sensitive brain with WiFi?

Covid related- but sensitivity new?

Like an allergic reaction maybe."
2021-03-23 5:14,"Very disturbing, especially so for a country which needs an additional warning to 'lock up your guns'."
2021-03-23 8:39,I realise this is different- but sounds like my mom in her early alzheimer's days. Knowing you are losing your mind is worse than losing your mind.
2021-03-23 10:36,How long before the light goes off and people realize that this story describes Trump’s symptoms to a “T” —except for the self-awareness.
2021-03-23 11:37,"Well, Zika causes psychosis, from what I remember reading about it. Viruses do strange things."
2021-03-23 5:53,"Every time there is a new revelation of how dangerous this virus is, I am struck by how many Americans behave as if it’s just a minor ailment by not wearing their masks."
2021-03-23 8:25,"My best to Mr. Agerton and his family. It's so awful to be at the mercy of this virus. It's been a hellish nightmare for so many people. Psychosis is yet another horrible thing Covid brings us.

I've been filled with an unreasonable dread that Covid will suddenly cause severe disabilities years later with millions of people impacted, like early onset dementia. I can't think about it much because there's nothing to do except continuing common sense precautions."
2021-03-23 9:37,"One more thought-you only have to look at your health care coverage to see the status of mental health illness here in the U.S. I think that reflects the lack of research and knowledge of mental illness. Insurers can't insure a risk that is undefined. It doesn't appear to be how that industry works and it's got to work if you want benefits from it.  I also wonder if there's a little minimizing of the potential seriouness of mental illness.  This manifests itself in many ways throuout life here in the U.S. and the world.  A movie to watch ""Monster"" about Aileen Wuornos. Her backstory-well to call it tragic is the biggest understatement ever. How she got to the place where she killed several men-I can't help thinking if someone had reeled her in and given her the help she needed it might have been a different story.  But to do that I suspect that it would have been really hard, unpleasant and messy. But she needed help, she asked for help and didn't get it from a system that is not well equipped to handle this. There are so many examples of people who ask for help and don't get it-who knows how these ""ripples of pain"" move past the intial problem and cause more problems."
2021-03-23 10:59,"My heart goes out to Agerton and his family. I’m glad he has a curious medical team and that he’s male. In my experience as a female trying to get help after a mild brain injury left me with, among other things, suicidal ideation (which can be a symptom of an injured brain), numerous doctors discounted my observations and dismissed my concerns. For them, the fact that I was Middle-aged While Female meant I needed an antidepressant and nothing else. 
Our ability to measure ways a brain can be injured are woefully inadequate; this should make the medical community humble and curious, not arrogant and dismissive."
2021-03-23 11:26,Maybe now that so many in the broad population have the unfortunate exposure to mental illness more research and help will be made available.
2021-03-23 11:42,"Attributing the Psychosis described to Covid is irresponsible because it-s not evidence based.
It creates baseless fears.
I went through a similar psychosis and it was Cannabis induced and lasted for weeks.
Most probably the Cannabis was tampered with. 
Synthetic TBC.
Cases are increasing significantly since the introduction of the so called Legal Highs.
I would look there."
2021-03-23 12:23,"This is journalism at its best.  Hopefully this story can convince those who think they can get COVID-19 and recover quickly that such behavior puts them and everyone else at risk of severe sequelae.  We still do not know what the long-term consequences of COVID-19 will be, even among those who seemingly have mild cases."
2021-03-23 12:26,"I am a forensic psychiatrist. That he was sent home from the first emergency room with a sleep sedative rather than being hospitalized (even involuntarily if he refused) is an obvious clinical error given the information at that time-- not just in retrospect.

2021-03-23 12:34,"This may end up giving us more insight into psychosis, a positive result from this man's pain."
2021-03-23 12:41,Maybe now physical causes (neurological problems) will be investigated now for all mental illnesses!
2021-03-23 12:46,"I don't understand people who would rather get COVID than take a vaccine to prevent being infected by a virus that we've never seen before. Little do they know that viruses can do crazy damage to your body, especially your brain."
2021-03-23 12:58,"Aside from the horrors of this man's symptoms, how can it be that his wife would have to work so hard to obtain basic psychiatric care?  And what kind of a doctor would send a clearly psychotic person home from the E.R. with sleeping pills?  These are just further examples of how broken our health, and particularly our mental health, ""system"" really is."
2021-03-23 12:59,"Mr Agerton and family my heart breaks for you . I pray you recover soon. This should be a wake up call for all of you super spreaders , people who refuse to wear a mask and those refusing to take the vaccine . It is such a sad day in the most progressive country in the world stupidity and ignorance prevails . Mr Agerton you are a brave man for putting your story out for everyone. I hope it gets the results for  your pain and suffering."
2021-03-23 12:52,"A relative became sick with Covid 3 weeks ago. He still has an active infection AND psychosis. He's hallucinating and recognizing no one, thinking that his wife (now dead from covid) is the nurse. Maybe that's the only blessing. He has no idea how Covid has ravaged his life."
2021-03-23 13:12,"Perhaps this is an autoimmune response like the patient I saw who clearly developed POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) after COVID.  But we clinicians should remember that there are other differential diagnoses  in these patients not to ignore, like late-life schizophrenia or NMDA encephalitis that can be coincidental to this ubiquitous infectious disease affecting a large minority of the population."
2021-03-23 13:19,I hope they try to treat him with the anti-Covid monoclonal antibodies to see if that could be a cure. Horrifying.
2021-03-23 13:54,This almost exact same thing is happening right now with my husband. He is 53 years old and started experiencing very similar symptoms to Mr. Agerton's after a mild case of Covid. He was committed to a hospital for treatment and placed on anti-psychotic medication.  We have been married for 25 years and he has never had any mental health issues.
2021-03-23 13:59,"So now we have long-term COVID.  Let’s see what Fauci says about this, whether or not it really exists.

Go back a few years and look at discussions about the long term effects of Lyme.  Fauci said if you treat it fir a few weeks with an antibiotic it is gone.  People who have had Lyme symptoms for 30 years may beg to differ.

Long term Lyme symptoms include mental confusion, aches, heart problems, etc.  why the similarity?  Because the same human immune response system is in survival mode and attacks any and all things that come near it, including the human body itself.

Like a cellular level paranoia?"
2021-03-23 13:28,"I can't help but wonder if Covid has been here for years. It would sure help explain why so many people thought a mobbed-up, many-times-bankrupt, reality tv star with a history of falsely proclaiming his vast wealthiness, and forcing himself on women would be a fantastic president."
2021-03-23 14:16,"This is one of many reasons that undercounting in cases frightens me. Multiple officials of various stripes have noted that the actual case count is probably higher than we think, for myriad reasons. So at least if you know you've had COVID and then have these symptoms, you can think they're related and try to get help. But I can't help but wonder how many people have/had COVID and don't know it, and so might start to experience things like this without knowing why?

It is also hard to parse some things that could be ""long COVID"" versus things that could be symptoms of pandemic life itself, such as depression and anxiety. How do you know if you're anxious because you had COVID or if you're just anxious because you're broke, can't see friends or family, maybe live alone and haven't really been seeing anyone recently, etc.? Aside from the paranoia described here, with respect to other ""long COVID"" symptoms, there is some overlap between them and symptoms of just being alive at this point in human history."
2021-03-23 14:25,"Another problem to consider are people who never realized they had Covid.  Many Americans were infected but were asymptomatic and/or untested for Covid since the CDC was so slow to make testing widely available.

Epidemiologists and family doctors have their work cut out for them determining whether a newly diagnosed illness—from exploding heart muscles to mental psychosis and God knows what else—result from Covid or something else.  We’ll be dealing with the fall out from this pandemic decades from now, like other viruses.

My grandmother survived the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 only to die at a young age a few decades later from neurological problems doctors at Duke thought were caused by that virus. That  fact always startled me as a child, but led me as an adult to be extra vigilant during this pandemic.  

Even asymptomatic or mild cases may present problems later in life— and getting doctors to believe they might be related will be a challenge for the poor patient who wasn’t tested."
2021-03-23 14:56,"Tragic, and I wish him the best and a speedy recovery. But possibly we may gain some additional insight as to root causes of idiopathic psychosis that will eventually lead to better recognition and treatment."
2021-03-23 14:53,"Here comes the ""Covid Defense"".  I'm not trying to diminish this problem. What happened to him is horrible.  I'm concerned about the unscrupulous lawyers who will run with this as a defense for their clients."
2021-03-23 14:45,"People get anxiety symptoms for a variety of reasons, often for no apparent reason. To attribute events like this to having received a COVID vaccination, which is the reason for this news story, is junk science.

If this were a theory hatched by conservatives it wouldn't get a mention in the Times, except to discredit it."
2021-03-23 14:12,"One thing that is unclear and should have been talked more about and questioned in the article, is whether there was evidence of inflammation in his brain? Did the doctors do a scan to try and understand and treat the inflammation, instead of giving him non-specific anti-psychotic medications?

These people need help and it's a bit disappointing to me that we are not doing more to understand the cause of these mysterious symptoms and treat that. If we don't attempt to treat the underlying inflammation, then surely his episodes will come back no matter how many anti-anxiety pills he takes?

Science journalists need to do better and put medical/public health communities feet to fire a bit more. Throughout this pandemic there has been severe shortage of journalists asking ""why"" and too much reporting only the ""what"". We will never make progress on this, without asking basic questions about why certain decisions are being made and why other creative options that might solve problem better are not being explored. The US public health community has shown a real lack of out of the box thinking throughout this and their messaging has been terrible. We need print journalists especially to be gadflies asking why, and why not do it this way, or why aren't we attempting this instead of being straight mouthpieces describing what is happening and what decisions are being made. If no one asks good questions, then we arrive at sub-par solutions or no good solutions at all."
2021-03-23 14:47,CBD is amazing.  More research must be done to bring CBD to the forefront against COVID19 and other viruses.
2021-03-23 14:28,"Thank you Mr. Agerton for sharing your deeply painful and personal story. 

Having recently become a caregiver to a person who is recovering from a psychotic break and who was also sent home twice from the ER and Psych urgent care with sleeping pills while clearly psychotic, I ache for you and your wife for the hell you are going through. I wish you a full and speedy recovery. 

This article should be followed by an article on how hard it is to get help in the middle of a mental health crisis. It was only when I refused to take my loved one home (who had suicidal ideation) was a bed found for her in an inpatient unit two hours away. It was a terrifying experience and should not be something one should have to deal with in the middle of a breakdown."

It's a wildly used drug there. I experienced the same type of paranoid delusions as described in the article. I ended up in the hospital for fear I would hurt myself. I knew it was the drug. Once I stopped, the paranoid delusions slowly went away."
2021-03-23 16:08,Is anyone trying to determine whether or not this syndrome is connected with recent mass murders and/or hate crimes?
2021-03-23 15:57,"There is a great 'hidden cost' of mental illness.  How many people must die before we wake up?   How many ""Day Centers"" do we have nationally?  Less than two miles from where Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook killer, lived there was a large (square mile) campus of the Fairfield Hills Hospital, where the state of Connecticut housed thousands of mentally ill people.  Drug therapy has put the mentally ill out on the streets.  These people still need help especially with monitoring of their medications.  Out on the streets have been the killers in Atlanta and Boulder.  How many lives would be saved if these ""Adam Lanza""-type men were kept safe from themselves and others in hospitals like Fairfield Hills?"

2021-03-23 18:04,"This almost exact thing happened to my husband in Late July/Early August. We're pretty positive he had Corona at the end of February, but they say these type of effects can attack later. He was having the exact hallucinations almost to a T that Ivan experienced. He had no history of mental illness like this and is in his early forties, meaning that schizophrenia was highly unlikely. It's scary and I too fear a relapse. He hasn't tapered off his antipsychotics, but I know he wonders the same thing, when will this be over?"
2021-03-23 4:53,Maybe he should have stayed home like I have for the last year. What do you expect when you take risks? On top of that he put me and my wife and 4 kids at risk by traveling out and bringing Covid back to our community. Why is it that we have to be responsible and people like him can freely go out? I personally don’t feel sorry given what we as a family have given up over the past year. Pure stupidity.

2021-03-23 2:06,"I congratulate those who have the luxury of blaming psychosis and (perhaps) other mental health irregularities on Covid. Of course, stressing that neither yourself nor any one of your other family members have ever suffered from mental health issues is necessary when speaking to a reporter, for an article that will be read locally, nationally and nowadays, internationally. It does not mean that you were never going to have mental health problems. I really do hate to sound unsympathetic (because I am not) but, are we going to link everything that happens to a Covid patient to Covid? Some illnesses like these get you later in life yet, the medical profession insist on rigidly adhering to what is in their textbooks and look at any cases outside of that information like it is the patient malingering (!) or it is somehow else  the patient's fault. What it illustrates is that research is largely dictated by financially motivated pharmaceutical conglomerates. 
 I have every bit of empathy with anyone who has psychotic breaks at any age, in any stage of their life. I got late onset paranoid schizophrenia at 42, so I have experience with psychosis and it is a nonsense to state that in general people do not have insight. Yes, Covid needs to be studied but please, let us not become so focused on Covid to the exclusion of other illnesses and other causes."

2021-03-18 14:04,"So happy to hear this. While it is 1:4, it means there is hope that something like the shingles vaccine could be developed for long covid. 

My long covid has is elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, brain fog and difficulty at exerting. When really bad, I start gasping for air from walking across the house. Other than a new restrictive lung disease and tachycardia 20% of the time, there is nothing wrong with me, per medical tests. 

I get the vaccine today. I am beyond excited, but my chances of recovery from it aren't great. Hope however springs eternal."
2021-03-18 13:51,What a hopeful article for long term COVID sufferers still waiting for their vaccinations.  It's going to be fascinating to follow the data for the next few years.
2021-03-18 13:51,"On the other hand, I know a couple of people who got terribly ill after their second shot. One woman is still sick with one problem after another, a month later. After recovering from pneumonia, she now has a kidney infection. She did not have Covid before her vaccinations, but apparently has it now. These two people may be the tragic exception to the “benefits” the vaccines convey to the general population, but can we reduce the cost to human life if we have more stringent testing in the future? Yes, of course, save lives now. But we need to plan for the pandemics of the future too."

I have an unusual form of epilepsy and it’s very hard to put into words some of the horrible feelings that ones body/brain can produce. No one can live inside your skin.

2021-03-18 14:44,"If there is a silver lining in this Covid Cloud it might be all of the incredible science that is occurring on this virus and the vaccines that might also be applicable in other illnesses.  It makes perfect sense to me that the vaccine could make long covid sufferers improve if it boosts their immune system.

Now, I haven't read anything yet about the need for booster shots or the frequency of future covid vaccinations.  I hope we'll start to see that over the next year as people who have been vaccinated are studied.  So many opportunities to learn.

That said, Covid still stinks."
2021-03-18 14:52,"I'm not sure if this is germane, but within a few days of my first Moderna vaccination, my sense of smell was sharply heightened.  After my daughter lost her sense of smell from Covid last year, I almost daily tested mine: with a mint-scented mouthwash, a coconut-scented hand sanitizer and crumbled blue cheese in the fridge. After the shot, not only did these seem much stronger to me, but ""new"" aromas and odors emerged regularly.  I've never tested positive for coronavirus; perhaps the virus and its symptoms work on a spectrum of sorts."
2021-03-18 16:09,"Great news! I would like to see anyone (regardless of age) that has suffered long term effects be prioritized with respect to getting the vaccine. I'm in my 60's, and would gladly let any one of these people go ahead of me."

A year and a day ago I got Covid. I got my first vaccine shot on Feb 28th. About a week ago I began to notice that I was breathing slightly better, and I felt ""good."" Hard to explain. 

Today, I smelled cheese for the first time in a year. I was putting away my groceries and just got a whiff of it. Cheese was one of the only things I could eat at the beginning because I couldn't smell it. I know this sounds strange, but I didn't really know I still couldn't smell it until now. I just knew it didn't bother me like the smell of so many other things do.

Get your shot even if you had Covid. It might be doing... something? I noticed this a week before this article came out."

The anti- vaccine movement has spread too much misinformation and if there are adverse effects from blood clots here—proven or not to be vaccine related— it could undermine our efforts to vaccinate our people. We can vaccinate most adults by the May timeline with our approved vaccines. Patients with prior COVID infections are getting blood clots already and disproving association with the Astra Zeneca vaccine will be difficult. Why risk it?
2021-03-22 10:07,"I had my AstraZeneca jab last Tuesday and have had no side effects and I’m over 65. 

It was done at a NHS vaccination centre, my local theatre, I booked online in minutes the previous week and the actual appointment took only 15 minutes. It was rather impressive and with vaccinations the UK seems to have got it right. You should consider free healthcare for everyone.  It’s a pretty good idea. (But then so is ensuring everyone is registered to vote, can vote quickly  and the elections take 6 weeks, costing a tiny fraction of what the US wastes...)

Another point about the UK rollout is there does not seem to be this crazy partisan divide that we see in America.  A recent CNN report showed folks in a Texas diner and none were planning to get the vaccine.

This is a worrying sign of future problems. We will probably have to accept COVID will be endemic but by elimination it can be controlled. This is going to be hard if large sections of your population refuse it for purely ideological and nonsensical reasons.

Let’s hope over time common sense prevails - this is a global problem and if your country continues with a high caseload what will that mean for future travel to and from the USA?"
2021-03-22 10:09,"“which has been perceived by some as less desirable than other shots because of its lower overall efficacy rate in previous clinical trials.”

My daughter and I got the Moderna vaccine while my wife and son are scheduled for the Pfizer shot in April. Although the J&J and Astrozeneca vaccines are also effective we are happy with this selection."
2021-03-22 10:09,"What all vaccines do ~100% is when not preventing Covid mitigating the severity of the illness to the extent that it's then pretty much like getting the flu. Focusing on prevention of actually getting it does, like the press is obsessed wit, does an actual, harmful disservice by at least implicitly supporting and encouraging hesitancy and refusing to be vaccinated."
2021-03-22 10:12,Anyone who does not get the vaccine should be required to pay more for their health insurance.
2021-03-22 10:13,"""The vaccine was 79 percent effective overall in preventing symptomatic infections, higher than observed in previous clinical trials."" ---  "" However, AstraZeneca did not disclose the number of volunteers who got the placebo who developed severe Covid-19 or had to be hospitalized,""

Those two statements are not compatible.  Which one is not true?  If they announced 79% why not take it at face value?  I've read figures in this paper for all the other vaccines, but they never included a statement giving the number of the placebo takers who got sick - just the percentage.

Sometimes I wonder - the AZ vaccine is a ""non profit vaccine"" - I wonder if that attracts a lot of hate from other vaccine makers who push to get bad reports and nasty rumors published.  It has that look here - just one nasty line thrown in that doesn't quite fit."
2021-03-22 10:15,"While the news here in the UK this morning is all about how wonderful the AZ vaccine is ... DON'T FORGET ... here we ARE NOT following the science!!  Doses are being given at 10 - 12 week intervals instead of the interval giving the original UK and recently reported USA trial results.  It is great to gloat when success bolsters country (or vaccine) pride, but why are we not then following the science that gives those results?"
2021-03-22 10:20,"So long as results are expressed in terms such as 79% effective confusion and doubt will persist.

The relevant bottom line is that the vaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe disease, i.e. deaths and hospitalization (and in all age groups)."
2021-03-22 10:23,"In the 3:34 a.m. version of this article it said ""Its overall efficacy was higher than that observed in the vaccine’s previous clinical trials, despite being used on a dosing schedule that may not be optimal. Oxford said that figure could be affected by the thresholds it set for symptomatic Covid-19 cases.""
This quote was apparently based on the Oxford University press release, which says ""The absolute efficacy is higher in this new study than observed in the Oxford-led studies, as efficacy is affected by the protocol case definition (higher for more severe cases) and the population in which the study is conducted. Today’s findings are in line with findings from other major vaccine developers who studied efficacy in the US.""
I would like to know why this information was changed in the article. To me the Oxford press release reads a bit like a defense of good academic work, while the AstraZeneca press release reads more like an advertisement how great their vaccine is comapred to others."
2021-03-22 10:35,"Why would they not have reported serious illness/hospitalization or death in the placebo group?  Certainly those data are available.  And, what to make of the 4 week interval between doses vs. the 9-12 week interval currently recommended?"
2021-03-22 10:44,"WAIT....no trial data on unvaccinated? So no comparative facts to its efficacy.  It Does Not prevent infection, claims to reduce symptons.  Rushed study, no 2 year windows on any vaccine.  Stay away from all 3, use  D. Zinc and Betadine oral rinse....NIH."
2021-03-22 11:13,"Just to be clear, when we say largest test of its kind, we're just going to blow past the fact that the EU, UK, India and Canada have all been using the AZ shot for months. That AZ literally make the shot at cost and that it was invented entirely to be accessible across the globe even in nations without the necessary deep freeze infrastructure necessary to store vaccines like the far more expensive Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. This article just shows the echo chamber within which the US lives on its healthcare, even within the US."
2021-03-22 11:15,"A great news, but one cannot help but wonder whether this vaccine could have obtained earlier approvals and speedier rollouts in the U.S. and the E.U., and more lives would have been saved, if Oxford University had partnered up with Merck instead of AstraZeneca. 

After all, the initial choice of partner by Oxford University was Merck. AstraZeneca was then really not considered a vaccine specialist, while Merck was a clear industry leader in vaccines research, development, clinical trials, and mass-manufacturing. Yet U.K. political considerations led Oxford University to choose the U.K.-based AstraZeneca over Merck as its partner. The decision has so far worked out great for the U.K., but one day one should really examine whether AstraZeneca’s relatively lack of experiences in vaccine clinical trials design/management and mass productions had contributed to this vaccine’s comparatively slow regulatory approvals and rollouts in the E.U. and the U.S."
2021-03-22 11:39,"Missing data alert: which strains did the infected participants have? Was it against all 4 major strains: the original, P1, B117 and B1.351? That data also needs to be disclosed to evaluate these results effectively, since each of those has a very different transmissability rate and depth of symptoms."
2021-03-22 11:49,"This is great news, although initial data was already looking good in UK, Brazil, and India, but another stamp of approval can’t hurt."
2021-03-22 12:03,"It’s surprising that this article doesn’t mention what should be the elephant in the room: a peer reviewed, double-blind study concluded the AZ vaccine provides no protection against the South Africa variant, unlike the J&J vaccine, which was specifically studied in South Africa, and probably unlike the mRNA vaccines, for which we don’t have enough data. 

That’s bad news for the staying power of the AZ vaccine as variants progress."
2021-03-22 12:16,"The statement that the lack of adverse events, specifically sinus thrombosis, demonstrates safety is grossly misleading.

There were 7 cases of sinus thrombosis among 1.6 million vaccinated in Europe, statistically expected were 3, so an excess of 4 cases.  

In the current trial ~22,000 subjects received the vaccine.  None developed sinus thrombosis.  Based on the European numbers, 1 in 220,000 would have been expected, so the trial would have had to be 10x larger to see a single case.

Ergo, the trial was woefully underpowered to detect this potentially serious side effect and therefore no conclusion can be drawn.

This is what cooked data, or rather misleading conclusions, looks like."
2021-03-22 12:34,"You said “receiving emergency authorization from the F.D.A. — whose rigorous review process is considered the global gold standard”

“pewter standard” perhaps, not Gold. The FDA has a long road to travel to repair the damage imposed on it by the Trump Administration. An ‘emergency’ authorisation implies that the evaluation was less than robust. 

So no, your conclusion is inaccurate."
2021-03-22 13:11,"No, the new results should not help the vaccine recover from the safety scare it has faced in Europe.  That scare concerned a low platelet clotting disorder occurring in about 5 vaccinations per million and fatal in about half the occurrences  A clinical trial that vaccinates only about 20,000 volunteers is unlikely to detect that side effect at all.  

Clinical trials aren't expected to detect such rare problems with a vaccine, and public health agencies are right to declare that this vaccine's (overall) benefits outweigh it's undetected risks.  Approved!  However there will be those who are able to extend the calculation and perhaps disapprove.  If the AstraZeneca vaccine really kills 2 per million among young adults, as Norwegian and German investigations indicate, then is it reasonable for a healthy young adult to have this vaccination?  For someone aged 20-30 the chance of death after infection is only about 0.01%.  Their chance of being infected through the remainder of the pandemic is perhaps 1% -- it depends on how careful they are and how the epidemic proceeds in their land.  Multiplying those two probabilities gives 1 in a million.  Young adults would need to muster altruistic motives to take that vaccine. 
For someone aged 30-40 the chance of death after infection rises to about 0.04%, but they might be more careful about avoiding infection.  Half the people in a rational and self-interested population might reject this vaccine."
2021-03-22 13:14,"Missing from ALL accounts of the nucleic acid vaccines:  1.  What are the long-term safety concerns with these new technologies, which rely on the recipeints’ own bodies to manufacture the antigen (spike protein)?  Autoimmune syndromes should be evaluated.  2.  Which cells actually take up the nucleic acid payload (RNA  or DNA) and express the antigen ?

That said, I’m scheduled for my 1st shot in a week. Crossed fingers!"
2021-03-22 13:29,This trials finding of “no serious side effects” versus the observed thrombogenic adverse events that occurred in the community at large is a perfect example of how trials do not translate into real world results. The lack of control outcome data is also problematic and suggests the data might be being scrubbed. If nothing else the ability of a phase 3 trial to predict safety (not efficacy) should be called into question by this AZ trial. I could be wrong but I think the current COVID vaccine push has pulled the covers off a system that has no ability to adequately determine safety. That includes the FDA EUA process and the Vaccine Safety Monitoring System here in the US.
2021-03-22 13:31,"In the next several weeks, I think it may become more obvious to those with vaccine hesitancy that unvaccinated individuals are winding up in the hospital or the morgue from Covid-19 whereas the vaccinated are not. Even people who get Covid-19 and recover have a good chance of getting ""long Covid."" The data are showing that Covid vaccines offer better protection than getting the disease itself."
2021-03-22 13:13,"AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine is another vaccine candidate developed in 2020 thanks to the WARP SPEED program. USA is being a good neighbor to Canada and Mexico in sharing the AZ COVID-19 vaccine with them, even before all US adults and children (with parental consent after FDA approval) willing to receive the vaccines have received them. 

With 100 million US residents already having been fully immunized, another 100 million adults hesitant or declining offers of the vaccine, 29.5 million warriors who fought and cleared COVID and acquired immunity not only to the original strain that originated in china, but all emerging strains from UK, Brazil and S. Africa and 74 million children will not be receiving vaccines until the FDA approves vaccines for children, only about 30 million vaccines will be needed to vaccinate all adults in the USA who are willing to receive the vaccine. We are already having a surplus of vaccines by April 15, 2021. 

The robust scientific evidence that Dr. Rand Paul referenced in a tweet yesterday, was published in the Journal of the Amer. Med. Assoc.(JAMA) on March 19, 2021 with the title 'Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants After Infection and Vaccination', is great news for vaccinated adults and 29.5 million US warriors who battled COVID and survived. CDC now can provide guidelines to COVID warriors as to whether they should not get any vaccines or get a single dose of any vaccine to be considered fully immunized for purposes of travel."
2021-03-22 14:27,"Would it be asking too much of reporting staff to include the time frame of the trial — when did it start, when did it end?  Isn’t that relevant to understanding the impact of variants and Covid prevalence on efficacy rates?  The press release from Astra Zeneca does not include this information, so little journalistic initiative would be appreciated."
2021-03-22 14:32,It is more than a week since my wife and me had this vaccine.I am 80 and my wife is 75. We are both fine and are looking forward to the second dose which is 4 weeks from now.
2021-03-22 14:38,"How would this development affect Biden Administration’s proposal to lend out 4 million doses of this vaccine, which was produced in the U.S. with the help of the Federal government under the Defense Production Act, to Canada and Mexico? After all, neither country, especially Canada, seemed very enthusiastic about the proposal and was in no rush to finalize the loans.  Maybe now they would move faster than they did before. On the other hand, there would be greater pressure on the Biden Administration not to lend out vaccine doses that can be ready to go into U.S. arms in just a few more weeks."
2021-03-22 14:40,"I'd like your paper to dig a little deeper into the controversy around the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Why has it taken so long for the FDA to approve it when it is clearly safe and effective, is easier to administer and costs less than other approved vaccines?  Why have some European leaders raised doubts about what is essentially a British vaccine--against all evidence--and in the context of post-Brexit ill will on the part of the EU.  I'm not prone to conspiracy theories, but I can't be the only one to think it's odd that we've had a steady stream of negative stories about a vaccine that is possibly the best of the bunch and only costs a fraction of what the others do."
2021-03-22 15:25,"Just a stray question here with only anecdotal evidence. With the great efficacy of the Covid 19 vaccines are we perhaps seeing the common cold reduced in some ways too? I’ve had two colds in the last four months that came on like a ton of bricks, only to have them lift entirely within (first) 24 and then 9 hours. The first before first Pheiser, the second two weeks after my first shot ( I have been “out there”). This is not how I usually have colds. 
Just wondering if I should sell my drug company stocks, if over counter cold meds are no longer needed. Can you say “pan -Covid”."
2021-03-22 15:56,"As someone not yet eligible for a vaccine in NY (which is currently below that national average in fully vaccinated adults at 12% vs 13% nationally, per the the NYT Vaccine Tracker), I'm confused about the sub-header that reads ""the shot may not be needed in the United States."" Further elaborated, the story states that since EUA would be unlikely before May, federal officials ""predict"" there will be enough doses for all adults for the already authorized vaccines. Will this hold true when young people under 16 become eligible for vaccines? What if there are logistical problems with existing vaccines? Do we know how long the vaccinated are protected before/if a second round is needed? This seems incomplete to me and I, for one, would appreciate any additional information available while I continue to wait for eligibility."
2021-03-22 16:59,"Given the lack-luster results in South Africa against that variant that this vaccine had, is this really good news? The SA government determined that AZ was so ineffective that they actually gave away all their doses. As that variant and the similar Brazil P.1 variant become prevalent, people vaccinated with AZ will still be at risk. Since we have enough shots of more effective vaccines every adult by May, does approving this even make sense?"
2021-03-22 17:29,This is good news! To get through this virus and stop or slow it from mutating the whole World needs vaccinations. This vaccine which can be transported and stored more easily than the vaccines the US procured is a game changer for countries that find it hard to afford or hard to transport. First world countries should take care of their own but also keep in mind that this is a Global pandemic and we need to fight it globally and ASAP to lessen the chances of more new variants emerging.
2021-03-22 10:24,"Fantastic news.  It feels like we're finally getting real data on a vaccine that has had many question marks swirling around it.  

Even if the US doesn't need it, this is a big step forward for getting Covid under control around the world, especially given the easy storage requirements.

From a personal point of view, this is great news since chances are I may be a recipient of one of those ""unneeded"" doses."
2021-03-22 16:11,"Wow after testing on 32000 we finally establish that the Oxford AZ vaccine works- but its not going to approved or used ! . Meanwhile back on planet earth 17 million Europeans have been vaccinated with it and research showed in Scotland from a sample of 400,000 people that it worked better or as well as the others...Looking at the UKs stats their hospitalizations and death rates have plummeted and that's after just one dose of a vaccine  pfizer/AZ/Moderna. So why don't they allow the AZ vaccine here - its supposed to easier to store and transport ?"
2021-03-22 15:00,"It’s absurd to claim that the US does not “need” more vaccine. My sister-in-law & I have been trying to get my 89-year-old dementia-afflicted mother a shot for the last three months in Florida. She was in the hospital last week after a fall, but the hospital couldn’t help us—they had no vaccine. Her primary care doctor can’t help us—no vaccine available. My sister-in-law finally found an appointment for her, in a drugstore two counties over. But so far we haven’t been able to explain to my mom that she has to wear a mask in a way that she will ever understand. Every time we have tried to persuade her to wear a mask, she refuses & gets hostile. She isn’t anti-mask; she simply doesn’t understand what is going on at all. I am worried that we will drive a long way & wind up going home without ever having set foot inside the store, because she will fight tooth & nail over being forced to wear a mask. As long as there is a shortage there will be problems like this. Florida has done nothing to provide jabs in cars, as other states have done, & even the people who want to help us can’t, because there is not enough vaccine. Don’t try to tell me that we don’t need more vaccine! If you are a healthy person in the middle to upper classes, you probably have little trouble accessing an appointment now. But if you are poor, old, sick, don’t speak English, don’t have all your faculties, don’t have access to a computer or transportation or help, you are probably still unable to find one."
2021-03-22 19:08,"The most important attribute of any vaccine after the ability to deal with the virus is the ability for the vaccine to be modified to deal with new mutations.  By the time that all of humankind has been inoculated along with assorted bats, rats cats and probably gnats the virus will have mutated and the current versions of the vaccine will be ineffective and the whole sorry saga will start again."
2021-03-22 15:44,"There is a question in the horizon: what about the South African variant?? The New England journal of medicine published a study last Wednesday that shows a 20% efficacy of the Oxford vaccine. It’s also possible that the Brazilian variant might be resistant too. It’s not time to celebrate without appropriate studies.  
Efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.351 Variant

CONCLUSIONS
A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04444674. opens in new tab; Pan African Clinical Trials Registry number,"
2021-03-22 18:32,"Not so fast with the happy talk. This wily virus is getting wilier. 
‘Researchers say the 2-dose Astra Zeneca vaccine is only 10.4% effective against mild-to-moderate infection caused by the South African coronavirus variant B.1.351.' 
“Le variant breton” has managed to fool PCR tests, despite patients presenting with typical symptoms of Covid-19. Infection was confirmed with blood and tissue samples of the respiratory system. All 8 patients who had a negative PCR test, died.
‘Oxford and Pfizer's Covid vaccines are more effective against Brazilian variant than initially feared, study finds’, Good news!
If everyone in the world wore a mask and social distanced, we would be in a Happy Place. But America excels as the pot calling the kettle black, as the biggest violators of common-sense pandemic controls with the worst outbreak and most death in the world. It is looking like the SARS-CoV-2 Clade is outsmarting our scientists at every turn. One step behind playing ‘ketchup’ is leading from behind, literally. 
When I read headlines such as ‘Fast-spreading COVID variant can elude immune responses’ it scares the bejesus out of me’. Me and mine are not ready to go to our Final Destination just yet, the Happy Hunting Grounds, Valhalla, Hades. Drowning in your own fluids is a heck of a way to die. Let’s work together and quell this pandemic."

There will be a mark to the right hand or forehead to be the only way to buy or sell in the future, but anyone who takes that mark will go to the lake of fire, eternal suffering. Revelation 13:16-17 & 14:7-11.

America really sounds like this Babylon in these verses, but the Babylon will be destroyed with fire, in one hour. Revelation 17:15-18 & 18:7-11."
2021-03-22 19:41,"I don't have to make that choice (I get my 2nd jab of Moderna the 1st of April), but with a 79% efficacy and a vanishingly small (I believe I read ""less than 1/1000 of a percent"" of developing a clot or an aneurysm) negative incidence, and a near-100% fatal incidence were I to contract COVID-19, I'd take that chance.
But we probably don't need it in the states; let's send our doses to countries who could really use it (along with the logistics to deliver that doses)."
2021-03-22 22:54,I too was in the AZ trial.  Sore arm from the shots but after affect no worse than an annual flu shot.  Got my second shot early December.  Family flew in over the holidays and about a week later everyone got Covid except me.  Fortunately we didn’t lose anyone.  This was a long time coming.  Glad the data came out positive.

NIAID Statement on AstraZeneca Vaccine


Late Monday, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) notified NIAID, BARDA, and AstraZeneca that it was concerned by information released by AstraZeneca on initial data from its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. The DSMB expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data. We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible.

Authorization and guidelines for use of the vaccine in the United States will be determined by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after thorough review of the data by independent advisory committees.""

It appears that even after all the wrangling between AZ and the DSMB, there are still some loose ends. I hope this can be fixed, and quickly."
2021-03-23 14:04,"I’d have to know much more about the testing protocol to trust this. I tested positive and then again 60 days later after also being positive for antibodies.  OMG! Was I reinfected? Likely it was left over inert virus particles. I also had no symptoms. Had I gotten the flu months after my first positive test, would a positive test for covid indicate I had been reinfected? Would they test for flu?"

2021-03-23 15:24,"If these reinfections are simply positive tests, are they determining if the reinfections ARE reinfections? Or could they be long covid or ongoing infections?"
2021-03-23 16:20,"We (55y olds) had covid in June.   Besides PCR it was confirmed by lab tests for four antibodies.

We are part of a trial for J&J dual jab.   As part of that they drew blood in Feb and tested for antibodies.

We had zero.

Angle 1 : we had virtually no symptoms in June.   Nothing that would even have warranted an over the counter medicine.   So asymptomatic means your antibodies live short.   But, possibly it means your immune system was anyway geared as you were asymptomatic first time?

Angle 2 : so far, of the people that did report reactions in this trial, it seems only people that very recently had covid had reactions to the jab.   We all had saline as a family, or we already had an immune response???

Amateur conclusion : people that were asymptomatic with covid before should stand at the back of the vaccine line?   It’d make a huge difference in vaccine-poor places."

2021-03-24 1:38,Based on this I don’t understand why vaccines are being pushed on ppl who recovered fine and have no issues. Why aren’t we requiring immunity tests prior? This is still a big experiment and there’s no backsies on it.
2021-03-30 15:05,"I voted Democrat. I’m a social liberal. I live in London.  I’ve traveled twice to France over COVID for family reasons. Once mask mandates were instituted, everyone, myself included, masked up. Compliance is very high both here and in France. And if you plotted a graph of COVID cases (estimated total, not just diagnosed cases, ONS in UK has excellent data), you would see that if anything there is a strong correlation between mask mandates and INCREASE in COVID cases. Europe is a case study: these masks we’re using either don’t work at all or don’t work very much. Yes, Republicans turned masks into a political issue, stupidly. But dems have doubled down on it and insisted on continued, and escalating virtue signaling in the face of quite robust real world evidence that...masks don’t work!"
2021-03-30 1:52,"Finally a major figure has shown emotion about this deadly virus and at perhaps the penultimate  moment. Dr. Walensky has said what others failed to say clearly enough; doom is the right word when a virus never previously encountered by mankind is shrugged off by so many. No one can say we will defeat the virus because we have defeated prior ones. Vaccine skepticism, new variants, a faster but still inadequate vaccination may all prove our undoing. Too many of our trusted citizens have kept silent. The President is right to say masking and distancing are not political but unfortunately that is precisely how our governors, virtually all of them, are treating it. We must think about the unthinkable."

2021-03-30 1:42,"Wow, I am terrified. 

Wait!

Here is something from a neighboring NYT story:

“Scientists have debated whether vaccinated people may still get asymptomatic infections and transmit the virus to others. The new study, by researchers at the C.D.C., suggested that since infections were so rare, transmission is likely rare, 

There also has been concern that variants may render the vaccines less effective. The study’s results do not confirm that fear. Troubling variants were circulating during the time of the study — from December 14, 2020 to March 13, 2021 — yet the vaccines still provided powerful protection.”

We are dooomed! Put those masks on!  

No transmission by vaccinated people. Vaccines effective against those scary variants. 

Let’s stop the insanity."
2021-03-30 1:51,"Maybe Dr. Walensky and Pres. Biden need to get out more often and see that most Americans are still wearing masks, doing what else they ought to do to stay safe, and getting their vaccines.  They and Dr. Fauci have a flair for the dramatic when it's not necessary!  Let's get back to living our best lives with the US open and at work!"

The fact is there is a sizable percentage of people in our country (in my experience almost always white people) who just don’t care about public safety or their neighbor’s (or their own) health."
2021-03-30 2:15,"We seem to have a classic battle of good and evil. President Biden represents the good here, as do those of us, the majority, who take this seriously. Sadly, those who would put politics or a false sense of “liberty” ahead of the common good represent the evil - of unmasking, of crowds, of unsafe mixing, of selfishness, of creating hotbeds for the virus to relaunch itself and its mutations. 

I think most of us can acknowledge this analysis, but what is the end game, the benefit, of the evil? Is it just profit? Some false sense of “liberty”? “Owning the libs”? It shouldn’t be a surprise, Republicans; YOU get sick, too. Please don’t drag everyone down because you think it gives you some kind of political edge. It doesn’t. It just makes you far more unpatriotic as you think “the other side” is. This is war against an invisible but all to real enemy. America pulls together in time of war - at least we always have.

2021-03-30 2:45,"Dr. Walensky has experienced the trauma of COVID-19.  Many people have.  Her display of emotion was an expression of fear that, though the vaccine has made a difference, the number of cases and the number of deaths have once again either plateaued or increased when reviewed on a state by state basis or increased overall when reviewed on a nation basis per the article.

The pandemic is not over.  We are not done.  The about 30% of the population has been fully vaccinated to date and the cases are going up in our most densely populated states.

Wear a mask
Maintain social distance
Get vaccinated as you are eligible"
2021-03-30 2:41,"It's time to play hardball with these states. It's the same ones at every turn of the pandemic that have abandoned safety precautions, and especially gone on to subsequently host large travel events.  Just like we  raised the drinking age to 21 by threatening to withhold federal highway funding to states that didn't comply, I think it's high time we politely tell Florida, Texas, and other miscreants that their vaccine allotments will now be going to the states who didn't take sides with the virus."
2021-03-30 2:16,"""...the nation is a long way away from reaching so-called herd immunity.""
You have no basis for this statement.  We do not know how many people have already been infected and were asymptomatic, we have no idea how many people were infected, exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and recovered without being tested.
If the virus is as contagious as we have been led to believe (though we still don't know what the R0 was or is), then the likelihood is we are very close to reaching herd immunity."
2021-03-30 2:25,"I don't get it. Last week the CDC says it's fine for teenagers (who are unvaccinated and can spread the disease as easily as an adult) to be 3 feet apart in schools and that schools can reopen immediately. Now they are saying that COVID is due to surge, that we are in a desperate situation and that they are scared.
Which is it?"
2021-03-30 2:21,"I guess I don't understand what the CDC doctor is urging.  Is it that the vaccines must start happening quicker? Or is it that people aren't choosing to get the vaccine? Or that vaccinated people aren't wearing masks? Or that people are going out wearing mask and no masks?  Maybe I'm just not reading the article slowly enough but what i'm seeing is that 1) states are giving shots around the clock 2) they are astonishingly effective 3) in key groups (like over 70), we're at numbers like over 80% with shots."

We're so close to the finish line everybody. Never give up. Mask up."

2021-03-30 2:49,"It's been a year and we know much more now than when the pandemic started. This is what we know: 
1) masks help controlling the spread, a lot. 
2) All three vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J are effective. 
3) There can be serious side effects to the vaccines and deaths are extremely rare. In some cases, could have been prevented with a quick visit to the ER. 
4) Those who are at higher risk (the elderly and the sickly), were priority for vaccination and should all be inoculated by now.  If you are in this group and haven't gotten the vaccine, get an appointment. 
5) Not controlling the current COVID strains can cause stronger variants to develop and we'll never get out of this hole. 
I say it's time for stronger measure, fines and some jail if possible. There's no excuse for putting others in danger. And you reply with a conspiracy theory instead of a reputable scientific source, you are part of the problem.
After vaccines are open for everybody (including children), I say ""every man and woman for themselves. Let conspiracy theorists suffer the consequences of their choices."""
2021-03-30 3:17,"Here’s the conundrum. We need to stay vigilant to reduce the spread, but at the same time we don’t have enough willing people to take the vaccine to reach herd immunity, so either way the slow burn will continue. 

As a fully vaccinated person, with this new evidence that infection of vaccinated people is incredibly low, and thus my probability of infecting someone is incredibly low, I strongly advocate for public messaging that promotes a vaccinated person’s ability to resume a normal life for the purpose of increasing  the acceptance rate of vaccine fence-sitters and thus reaching herd immunity. I also fully support masking up as there is no way to tell who has been vaccinated or not.

As an example of positive reinforcement that would be helpful, I’ve traveled by plane 3 times since being fully vaccinated, had social gatherings with other vaccinated folks, hugged my parents, gone skiing, etc.. “Impending  Doom” will not motivate the fence-sitters, but will rather deter them."

2021-03-30 3:18,"I would say that specific directions would be received better than vague directives. ""Hang on a bit longer"" seems to be the wording that the CDC and Dr Fauci have been using, and it means very different things to different people. They (the experts) must have modeling to give a more definitive timeframe for ""hanging on"", and it probably is in the order of 3 months (my guess). Many people may think ""a bit longer"" would be a few days, but I suspect they are thinking longer than that. At any rate telling us a definite timeframe would be more useful, even if it has to change as more data comes in."

Stop taking precautions, and watch the numbers go up again.  We need to do more than remember the past: we need to learn from it.  If it works, KEEP DOING IT!"
2021-03-30 2:47,"I'm sorry, but ""impending doom"" and ""I'm scared"" is not the message that the Biden administration should be tossing out to the public. 'Neanderthal thinking' is fine. Hysteria is not."
2021-03-30 1:52,"The president is being responsible, something that his predecessor was not.

We are seeing the devastating results of the coronavirus in other countries as mutant cultures gain traction. This, in addition to the scarcity in some places of a vaccine, is only exacerbating the problem in countries that were under the impression that they had stemmed the plague's tide.

I hearken back to the spring a year ago when ""the other guy"" was demanding that armed citizens ""liberate"" their states so that people could once again be free to do the things that they had always done; to return to their lives without any thought or care of how their carelessness might impact others.

A president's first, and some might argue--only, duty, is to safeguard the citizenry whether from enemies foreign and domestic, but also from serious and killing public health issues. This president said, early on, that he hopes that as people become vaccinated and as the graphics show a downturn in infections and fatalities that they would not interpret statistical improvements as license to once again throw caution to the winds and resume a normal life. He told us that he hopes that by July 4th, Independence Day, that America might be able to celebrate the national holiday as it had in the past: cookouts, barbecues, large gatherings. But the Centers for Disease Control has thrown up red lights and clanging bells that at railroad crossings signal imminent danger. 

Why cannot we exhibit some patience and humility?"
2021-03-30 3:17,"When it comes to Covid-19 too many people keep doing the same foolish things over and over again before this plague is ever under control. 

Every time there's a dip in the death rate too many pretend this plague over, despite everyone knowing by now that deaths are always the lagging indicator with Covid because of the very long period from exposure until death. 

The infection rate is rising dramatically again because everything is opening yet people refuse to wear masks or to social distance. 

Thanks to President Biden vaccine production and distribution are way up. The US is doing better than European nations in vaccinating the population. In France, for instance, only 4% of the population is fully vaccinated. However, while we're doing relatively much better, as of today only 16% of Americans are fully vaccinated. 

President Biden is saying people need to still wear masks because the rate of infection in the US has spiked again to approx. 60,000 cases per day, and keeps rising. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky is saying that a Fourth Wave and a major increase in deaths is now inevitable, because it is.  

Wearing a mask is the smart thing to do, but too many people aren't interested in doing the smart thing, or rather they want to keep doing the same stupid things just to prove that they're right, even if it kills them and a lot of other people. 

""Sometimes a man wants to be stupid if it lets him do a thing his cleverness forbids.""

Part of the problem is the official recommendation to wear cloth masks, which provide little protection to the wearer from   aerosolized covid virus, even though they protect others from respiratory droplets.

These are the three ways people have ""agreed"" to understand ""causality."" Outcomes.
Given the number of unnecessary deaths, infections and their ranges of types, levels and qualities of diseasing, and the temporary, as well as long-term traumas that have occurred  since... what is the basis for an elected official- Gov.- whose mandate includes the wellbeing, health and security of ALL of the state's constituents, and residents, to be personally unaccountable for not planning, carrying out and assessing the most effective corona-19 treatment that is currently known and applied on the basis of scientific facts?  There is a destructive, fiery-epidemic. It's not a movie. It's happening all over! Politicalizing and weaponizing diseases is criminal. Immoral. Unethical.

That was up from 54,000 a day two weeks earlier, an increase of more than 16 percent. Similar upticks in Europe have led to major surges in the spread of Covid-19, Dr. Walensky said.""

Surely the different is that in October 2020, millions of people had not been infected (and now are and have recovered) and 93 million people had not been vaccinated (and now are). 

It does not appear that the situation in October and now is in fact comparable."
2021-03-30 6:42,"The people who refuse to wear masks are just selfish. I have a terrible opinion of them, wherever they are. I cannot find any reason why people would be so resistant and the Republicans who insist that this is a political issue are guilty of a terrible failure of governance. To all those religious people who insist on such rigid ideals of what is ""conservative"" but who do not wear masks I say, ""Jesus would say, first, love one another. Wear a mask.""  So many people don't want to go along and yes, of course, it's hard and of course, it is a hardship for many who own businesses, but it's necessary for just a little while longer.

The highest levels of COVID per capita aren't in Texas, or Florida, or Wyoming -- currently the highest levels are in New York, NJ and eastern PA.   These are areas of the country that have some of the most restrictions. 

Lockdowns don't work.   Masks don't work.  This has been shown in ""science"" over, and over and over again.   It didn't stop Fauci from warning about a Thanksgiving and Christmas travel ""surge"" which never happened, nor did it prevent him from warning about a March surge which didn't happen.  

Science plays no part in this.  It is destructive political behavior, pure and simple.   There is something about COViD which fuels infantile fear and narcissism in the left.

N.J., at present, has the highest rate of new Covid infections, why?  Some blame the international airport but N.J. is basically a suburban state, lots of young people.  Now that 75% of adults over the age of 65 have been given at least one shot, the death rate and infection rate of that group has dropped a lot.  The biggest infection rates are among the younger folks, those who are less likely to develop serious symptoms.  With all the spring breaks and mingle ing that occurs with the younger aged groups, it is no surprise that in a state where testing is easily obtained, this would be the case.  Masks are useful indoors and useless outdoors, (my opinion).  A major drug store chain reported poor earnings because they haven't sold any cough, cold or flu medicines this past winter, masks?  If Dr. Wolensky had any backbone, she would address the incredible infection rates of the many people crossing the Southern border who bring with them the most contagious strains of Covid into our country.  This administration is not testing anyone and releasing 75% of adults into the U.S.  If this isn't nuts then a bag of peanuts must be popcorn."
2021-03-30 10:25,"I was very shortly after the CPAC meeting ended that several red states opened their businesses fully and removed the mask mandate.  In Texas, where infection rates were high, vaccination rates were low, and multiple variants had been found, Republican governor Abbott not only opened businesses and removed the mask mandate. He even empowered the state Attorney General to sue any local leaders who tried to impose a mask mandate in their own jurisdictions.

Let's not be naive.  Abbott's actions, which resembled other red state governors, were not done because of a belief that the virus is was under control.  Rather, it was an attempt to deliberately spread the infection in Texas so as to thwart Biden's efforts to end the pandemic.  After all, if Biden ends the pandemic and revives the economy all in his first year, Republicans will face an uphill battle at the ballot box in 2022 and 2024.  Given the timing of these moves, it's logical to deduce that the strategy was developed at the CPAC meeting.

Does it sound cynical to suggest that red state governors would deliberately infect and kill their own citizens for political gain?  If it does, listen to Bob Woodward's interviews with Trump, where Trump acknowledges doing exactly that at the national level."

Unfortunately, NYT has exacerbated the situation by titling the article ""CDC Director Warns of ""Impending Doom"". She did not. Dr. Walensky said that she herself felt this. She did not imply a warning to all of us that doom was what we are facing."

There are a handful of medical reasons why someone might not be able to wear a mask, but otherwise it’s a modest inconvenience. You have had plenty of time to find a mask that is comfortable and works for you. And no, the pandemic isn’t done; cases are high and going up. So stop the self-justification. In 2021, if you aren’t wearing, you aren’t caring. Period."
2021-03-30 11:01,"""Although more than one in three American adults have received at least one shot and nearly one-fifth are fully vaccinated, the nation is a long way away from reaching so-called herd immunity..."" 

This common misconception ignores the approximately one-third who have already had COVID-19 and are resistant, if not completely immune, to the virus. Taking this group into account, roughly half of Americans are effectively immune. With around 3-4% of non-immune Americans being vaccinated every weak, we should reach the 60%+ immunity level Israel reached in early March (when its new cases started dropping precipitously), in around 4-5 weeks.

There is good reason for the non-immune to continue to take precautions. But the doom-and-gloom being presented by government scientists right now is unwarranted, and is likely to backfire as people lose faith in our ability to defeat the virus."
2021-03-30 11:18,"The two dose vaccination system is probably part of the problem here. As soon as people get the first shot they quickly begin to let their guard down. After all, they ARE somewhat protected from serious illness even after just one shot. People are getting infected between the doses. People talk about protecting others, but the temptation to return to a full, active life is far too great for people to really care once they have protected themselves. Meanwhile, many younger people, including those who have comorbidities, are still waiting patiently for eligibility in states that are slower to expand access (like Mass)."

2021-03-30 10:32,"This whole article reinforces the unnecessary hysteria over this virus, and the rise in certain areas around the country --- not others --- is telling. So much for ""flattening the curve.""

The states (and countries) experiencing the greatest rises are, not surprisingly, the ones that have been the most locked down since this time last year. States that were not as maniacally restrictive and began opening up sooner are the generally the ones wherein cases of CoViD-19 were higher earlier, but are now levelling off, or even dropping. 

The responsible virus, SARS-CoV-2, like every other coronavirus before it, has to run its course for us to acclimate to it. Seeking to limit exposure to the virus in particularly vulnerable demographics is laudable and feasible. Seeking to simply stop SARS-CoV-2 dead in its tracks is folly and just delays the inevitable, like trying to stop a tidal surge. 

And, to be sure, the correct analogy is tidal surge, not tidal wave. SARS-CoV-2 not killing everything in its path. It's just being a nuisance and overcoming those who can't swim or whose bodies are slow to respond. And that's sad. But the solution is not to try to stop the surge. The solution is to move the non-swimmers out of the way --- which Andrew Cuomo apparently failed to do in spectacular fashion.

Then again, what if it's not really the surge the government is trying to control, but rather the population? There's a question the New York Times will never ask."

Once you have vaccinated the elderly, the deaths should start dropping dramatically no matter the cases, as the cases are younger people.   This is EXACTLY what you are seeing in the US.  

How does the data on the ground (and in NYT) correlate to the Head of the CDC pronouncement?  Deaths are dropping massively.    I just see this as being partisan posturing by a politicized bureaucracy."

2021-03-30 11:06,"When President Joseph Biden said,“The failure to take this virus seriously is precisely what got us into this mess in the first place,” he hit the nail right on its head. The operative word here is, “precisely.” Precisely, exactly, specifically, deliberately, the failure of many people to take this virus seriously is why we’re here with SARS COV-2, still. The early response to this pandemic disease was flawed, especially because the previous guy was playing politics. Even the Medical community took a few months to get everything into order. The idea of “flattening the curve,” was a good policy. It implied that basic individual behaviors could help avoid capturing this airborne virus: isolation in-place, hand hygiene practices, and filtering the air breathed in through a properly fitted mask would effectively reduce the number of new cases thereby flattening the graphic curve of covid-19. It did just that. 

But, the previous guy and his obfuscations and his right-wing propaganda, along with a poorly educated public led to surges in infections and deaths that still is with us. And the persistence of the disease is precisely what has led to the different variants of this virus. And the politicization of mask wearing is precisely what has exasperated the ongoing spread of Covid-19. If this nation and the world has been rigorous in hand and finger hygiene, adequate air exchange by good ventilation, distancing, and properly fitted mask wearing, this would be ended... precisely."
2021-03-30 11:42,"We are living in an amazing time in history. Instead of a plague wiping out 5% or 10% or more of our population, we have technology and medication and testing to slow spread and save lives.

And less than a year into the pandemic, we have a vaccine! 

Many of our elders -- who are by far those most likely to die, and who made up the vast majority of Covid deaths -- have already been vaccinated.

And an estimated 30% or more of our population has already had Covid, meaning there's some natural immunity as well.

New cases are skewing towards younger people who are done with the social isolation of the past year. They know their chances of surviving Covid are greater than 99.99%. 

And more people are getting vaccinated every day.

While I agree that we could save more lives if everyone continued to mask up and stay home, what we're currently seeing is far from impending doom!"

It is astounding that a country that sent so many men and women to serve in WW ii, shifted all production from consumer goods to wartime goods, and sacrificed for 5 long years now has a citizenry that cannot bear to stay home and mask up. 

The WWII citizenry also had to grow and cam their own food to a large degree.  Our current cohorts cannot even bear ""take out"" food prepared for them.

Why is this any different? Furthermore it’s just for a limited period which could be shorter if everyone would cooperate.

Snowmobilers support small businesses during the otherwise slow and financially challenging winter months. A store-restaurant near our camp often had twenty for forty machines parked out front. Vents made it clear that meals were being prepared inside. 

The size of the dining area and the small retail space made it obvious to an observer that precautions such as distancing and mask wearing were not a concern to those inside.

2021-03-30 12:21,"Why is Biden ""Pushing"" a mask mandate and not ""Mandating One""!? Wasn't this the major complaint from the left about the last administration of not ""Leading From The Front"" and states complaining ""Were on our own, We don't know what to do,Lead Us!"
2021-03-30 12:32,"The data  -- British, Israeli, and now from the CDC itself -- clearly  show that the 2-shot vaccines  are 80% + effective by 2 weeks after the first shot.

We have enough vaccine now to give everybody their first shot now, and circle back in 2 months for the 2nd shot with future-produced vaccine.

Why isn't CDC recommending this?

Why isn't the press demanding to know why CDC and Biden and the Governors aren't following The Scientific Data?"
2021-03-30 12:28,"Another two weeks? Month? Year? Nope, no interest. We have a vaccine (that can be quickly modified if need be) and hospitals aren’t full. 

Feds blame states. States blame citizens. Citizens blame government. 

Europe is a terrible comparison because they completely botched their vaccine. The UK and Israel are more appropriate comparisons and this same pattern happened in both places (a plateau, a small rise, then cases/hospitalizations/deaths numbers dropped of a cliff right around when they hit 50 percent fully vaccinated, which we will hit mid-April).

Mental health, economic inequality, food and housing insecurity are FAR more important at this point than COVID. We were supposed to keep the hospitals under capacity and they are. People will get sick, those that need treatment will get it. Zero COVID is not the goal."
2021-03-30 12:05,I wear a mask and received the vaccine.  I am 75 and learned public hygiene as a child!  You are responsible for yourself! I don't care what others think!
2021-03-30 12:29,"The $1400 stimulus check seems to have worked exactly the way it was supposed to work - vacations to Florida, Las Vegas, shopping at the Malls, eating out."
2021-03-30 12:30,"Biden is absolutely right -- states should be keeping or reimposing mask mandates. However, no GOP governor is going to listen to Biden because, rather than being the moderate unifying president he promised he would be, he decided from the moment he took office that appeasing the loony left and taking partisan shots was more important than keeping his election promises and trying to unite the country. 

From his lies about the impact his nutty immigration policies have had on the wave of immigrants swarming our southern border to his handing out of stimulus checks like candy, Biden has been a disaster. He is right on masks. But, only two months in office and he's already been tuned out by half the country. What was it that last guy used to say? Oh yeah. SAD."
2021-03-30 12:44,"My wife and I just returned from a driving trip to Florida, Singer Island, to be exact.  Social distancing, masking and frequent cleaning of public surfaces  was ubiquitous.

I even saw people in their own cars and open, outdoor spaces wearing masks.  Some, I thought, were going overboard, but better to be safe than sorry."
2021-03-30 12:26,"We must never forget to remind Americans that Trump made mask-wearing ""controversial."" His emphasis was on the word VOLUNTARY... clear to anyone who could read between the lines that he did not support wearing one. There are video clips on YouTube of Trump stating that mask wearing was ""voluntary."" They are useful in reminding us of this grave failure on his part. And the primary reason Trump stated mask wearing was ""voluntary,"" was because he enjoyed being ""contrary."" Being contrary and controversial got him more media attention... which he craved. It was Trump's sick need to satisfy his ego that prompted unnecessary deaths in this country. And his rhetoric continues to linger to this day."
2021-03-30 13:02,"Rather than a mandate, which will seem draconian to many, the federal government should make masks available to citizens and schools, and work to make life go on, in a visible way, (it's going to anyway), rather than try to impose a routine that will be resisted by many and derided my many state and local jurisdictions.   The vaccination program is a joke, it could be assisted by federal agencies, taking the shots straight to workplaces, community centers and schools.
  
But telling people that they have to do something is an invitation to failure."
2021-03-30 12:17,"I needed a tool from Harbor Freight so my 81-yr-old mom and I stopped while running errands in Butler county, north of Pittsburgh on Sunday. Despite the sign that said “mask required for entry” on the door there were a number of mask-less men entering the store. It’s not just Harbor Freight. This has been the case for a year now in every store I’ve visited when helping her run errands. 

Butler County is Trump country where willful disregard for the well-being of others is as much of a statement of identity as the red MAGA hats that many middle-aged and older white guys still wear there.

On a positive note, the local hospital has been very efficient and active in delivering vaccines. Thankfully my mom and many of her friends are fully vaccinated."
2021-03-30 12:31,"Whatever happened to common sense in America; surely anyone watching this latest rise in cases, especially in areas where mask mandates are being relaxed, has to get it.

Think about it; for over one year, repeatedly, the wearing of masks, and social distancing, have shown that these simple easy to do safeguards work, worldwide.

And for those who want to tout lifesaving simplicity as infringing on liberty, go ahead, play your games, and when Covid-19 comes calling, perhaps you'll wish you had listened."
2021-03-30 12:51,"Many forget that we humans are a slowly evolving species still harboring the primitive responses of so many eons ago.

Not everyone is up to the task of perfect behavior when it comes to this pandemic. Just as not everyone is up the task of dealing with the increasing complexities of our truly insane planet.

Kindness, patience, and compassion are needed now more than ever. In the words of Elvis Costello, ""What's so funny about peace, love, and understanding?"""
2021-03-30 12:46,"Until someone can figure out how to prevent the virus crossing state lines, this is a federal issue and states rights should not even be part of the discussion."
2021-03-30 12:30,"If the director of the CDC feels overwhelmed by her job, then perhaps she is not the right person to do it.  The country needs leadership, not hyperbole and displays of “raw emotion.”   And for all the lamentation about Trump not banning masks, it seems Biden is unable to accomplish this.  So it’s time to stop blaming the past administration and singling out states as red or blue - this simply continues the politicization of the science and what needs to be accomplished as a country."
2021-03-30 12:05,My friend’s daughter and son in law are currently very ill with the virus. Last week they went out for brunch with a  bunch of friends and sat shoulder to shoulder at a table at an outside restaurant. One of the friends was positive and consequently passed the virus to others at the table. This is the problem in a nutshell. Ordinary people just don’t get it. This nation cannot open up until most are vaccinated. It’s so simple.
2021-03-30 13:06,"Here in the north we worry about snow-birds, spring-breakers, and school vacationers coming back from visits to the south where rules are lax and the truth about COVID is blurred."
2021-03-30 13:05,"By the standards of the pandemic, ""impending doom"" is probably, hopefully, exaggerated. Vaccination has been available for the most at-risk populations, the elderly. The large majority of senior citizens have been at least partially vaccinated, and those that haven't for the most part made a personal choice.

That said, lifting mask mandates this early is a serious mistake. Wearing a mask is inconvenient at worst, and effective at reducing spread.

Continuing lockdowns is a different issue. Lockdowns are continuing to cause great damage to our economy, and resulting in substantial  deaths both domestically and globally. The financial effects have been mitigated by the stimulus packages, but the bills for these will be a tremendous burden on our children for many years.

It's worth remembering why the issue of masks has become so political. It's largely because early in the pandemic masks were not available in the US due to globalization, and the government, including the CDC, were worried about hoarding by the public, depriving front line health care workers and first responders of the masks they needed.  Thus, early on, the benefits of masks were deliberately understated. The effects of this mindset linger.

<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html</a>

Today, now that masks are plentiful, they should be mandated for a while longer. But we need to think carefully about continued severe lockdowns, which may do more harm than good."
2021-03-30 11:52,"“We are just almost there, but not quite yet.”

Sadly, this is wishful thinking on Dr. Walensky's part.  There is a robust misperception in our country that we're ""almost"" at the point of beating Covid because the case count declined so drastically from mid-January until now.  This is reinforced by the NYT's Covid case count chart.  It conveys the impression that we're beating Covid because, compared to the case count at the sharp peak a little more than 6 weeks ago, the case count now looks low.

But comparing case counts from January 2021 to March 2021 is the wrong way to look at the big picture.  Today we have 70,265 new reported Covid cases -- nearly as many cases as the surge in late July 2020 that rang alarm bells across (most of) the country.  And the actual number of cases today is far higher than the 70,265 reported cases because so many Covid cases go unreported.  

We will not be ""out of the woods"" until we have reached herd immunity (which Dr. Fauci has recently stated would require 90% of our population to be immune -- a substantially higher percentage than the 70% or even 80% he originally projected).  But because about 1/3 of our population won't get vaccinated for a variety of reasons (anti-vaxxers, children, etc.) we're not going to reach 90% immunity any time soon.  So it is essential that all of us continue to do the right thing:  mask up, keep social distancing, wash hands, and follow other CDC guidelines."
2021-03-30 11:52,"Do you mean Texas and Florida declaring the pandemic over wasn't a good idea?

We've always known how to combat the Coronavirus.   

That we have the world's worst response to it just shows we aren't that smart a country to be able to do it.   

That's another thing November of 2016 has exposed."
2021-03-30 12:05,"So it’s not political but it was the past administration’s fault? 
Again, there is an inconsistent message. Begging people to wear a mask while allowing undocumented immigrants released without testing or vaccine.
Yesterday the NYT reported that it was extremely unlikely that vaccinated people could pass the virus & today...maybe."
2021-03-30 12:03,The instinct for self-preservation is highly over rated.
2021-03-30 12:41,"The US is suffering two pandemics. One is COVID-19, and the other is the uncontrolled spread of misinformation through extremist right wing media and politicians, social media, and word of mouth. 

Without a strong counterbalance to neutralize nonfactual information through legislation like the Fairness Doctrine, dis- and mis-information will continue to grow, creating a more divided and more dysfunctional society. We need to restore informed civil discourse about important matters such as public health."
2021-03-30 12:08,"The goal is to stop this pandemic. The states should not be in any position to impair the achievement of that common good for the welfare of the people. Under the commerce clause Congress could impose a national mask mandate, if it had the will. But, by executive order under the War Powers Act, Biden might impose restrictions on interstate travel among states that refuse to impose mask mandates. Stop tourist flights to Florida and see how quickly DeSantis buckles under."
2021-03-30 13:13,"I don't think it is helpful for the CDC to use a phrase like ""impending doom"" when it is pretty clear to any reasonable observer that we are unlikely to see COVID deaths in the future like those we have seen to date. Also, we now have a year of experience with 50 states taking different approaches to COVID in the US, and many more examples abroad. Are we to understand that states that took more ""relaxed"" approaches did substantially worse than states that took the most ""rigid"" approaches? No, that's not a rule that works from one state to the next. This is all so much more simple than the rhetoric: get vaccinated when you can; protect yourself until you can get vaccinated; measure your own risk and risk tolerance and act wisely in accordance with those."
2021-03-30 13:02,"We are not strangers to such psychological phenomena as risk-taking defiance of social norms, rolling the dice while hoping a better outcome, hating society and one’s own life enough to behave recklessly, the need to pursue lust and gluttony to their natural ends, the excitement of following a mob into criminal and/or immoral activity. Why should we have expect anything different now that “we” perceive a danger and know what is “the right thing to do?” All the behavior of everyone involved comes from our collective social consciousness. It’s foolish do deny that we’re all dying to act out, go on vacation, or mingle closely with others indulging the pleasures of a restaurant or bar. We reap what seeds we’ve been sowing in society through indifference, selfishness, lack of empathy and charity."
2021-03-30 12:27,"While it may be true that we all die a little every day, the ""anti-vax, anti-mask"" crowd turns it into a headling rush.  Slogans denying science seem to substitute for rational thought, and ""freedom"" to live becomes the freedom of these willful people to be the freedom to take others to the eventual unavoidable grave  destination all too soon.  Freedom in life is not freedom to take the lives of others.  

It is not smart and it is not brave to be brazen with any pandemic."
2021-03-30 12:16,"Trump never understood the danger of Covid-19. Neither do the governors who are in such a rush to reopen the economy. Like Trump, they are best ignored."
2021-03-30 12:09,"It’s tragic that the population on whose shoulders the fallout from this pandemic lands are so quickly and easily ignored. Doctors, nurses, support staff, orderlies, cleaning staff are all bearing the nearly invisible brunt of the disease. Those who say “no masks, no lockdowns, open now” have no clue at all about these folks. Endless perseveration about death rates, mask effectiveness, and the like are a convenient distraction from this reality: workers in health care are burnt out, many are leaving. Too many are left to navigate a world of personal pain."
2021-03-30 11:49,"I think it would be useful for people to try to understand the prevalence of Covid cases in the Northeast and Michigan -- rather than Dr. Wallensky talking about ""impending doom"".
We already know the story in Miami Date -- it's young vacationers....  It would be helpful for the experts to try to figure things out."
2021-03-30 12:51,"With recalcitrant and reckless red state Republican governors like Greg Abbott in Texas and Ron DeSantis, we still live in two Americas--one where science is is the guiding principle and the other where it is not.  And so, like the infamous Borg these men are demonstrating, not for the first time, that ""resistance [to Covid] is futile"" unless a national public health emergency is declared and they are charged with criminal ""reckless endangerment"" of federal employees and military personnel in their states. If the nation cannot work as one to defeat the coronavirus, how will it survive the assault on voting rights, systemic racism, and climate change?"
2021-03-30 12:38,"There is a portion of this country that continue to show that the only thing they think about is themselves.

We are a better nation when we put others first."
2021-03-30 12:40,"It is frustrating to observe the number of cases rising again despite the ongoing vaccination effort. Unfortunately, we are not likely to make great progress in stopping the virus until the segment of the population which accounts for the most cases and the source of spread of contagion, healthy young people, have been vaccinated.  We vaccinate anyone working in our schools and universities except for the students who are the potential vectors for infection.  This is backwards logic and casts the youth as both perpetrators and victims. There is a great deal of experience from influenza vaccination programs which have convincingly shown that inoculating school age children is more effective in preventing influenza deaths in the ""at risk"" population than only targeting vaccinations to the elderly.   In fact, studies out of Japan have repeatedly demonstrated that vaccinating children has resulted in nearly a 70% annual reduction in fatalities from influenza even though children are generally not at great risk of serious illness from influenza. Similarly, modeling predicts that vaccinating only 20% of the children would result in the same reduction in fatalities as vaccinating 90% of the ""at risk"" population.  Even though young people are very unlikely to die from COVID, they are the largest reservoir of the virus and the most likely to spread disease.  We need to start prioritizing vaccination of the youth; each jab will have an exponential effect in prevention."
2021-03-30 12:31,"This woman was on the front lines of COVID at the start of this. She's seen what COVID can do at its worst, but COVID is not at its worst.

Like a doctor or nurse fretting over the safety of their child after seeing one too many children in the ER, Dr. Walensky is scared for the people of America. However, that doesn't mean she's right.

She is an infectious diseases physician, but our nation's public health crises extend far beyond infectious disease. The obesity crisis only grows worse, bringing with it millions of early deaths as America packs on unnecessary pounds. The young are experiencing a massive mental health crisis as over a year of their life is snatched from them, living in small, broken down apartments working gig-economy jobs. Wealth inequality is soaring under these policies, setting back generations of Americans. So much education has been stolen from children, and the poorest will never fully recover. They will remain a year behind their richer peers and get beaten out of every opportunity.

It's time to stop thinking about the ""coulds"" and ""ifs"" and ""maybes"" and start recognizing the very real public health threats that are plaguing us right now. The most vulnerable to COVID are vaccinated. The most vulnerable to poverty, heart disease, edcuational deficits, and depression are suffering in full."
2021-03-30 13:21,"It’s almost beyond belief that much of the country is still ignoring health experts, a year after the pandemic began. How stupid and selfish. 

Biden could be doing much more to get the country to follow CDC guidelines.

He should be meeting with governors of every state and territory to impress upon them the need to enforce mask mandates, and not open up their economies yet.

He should address the country in prime time to tell people they need to continue masking up and practicing social distancing. 

There should be regular nationally televised reports from Drs. Wakensky and Fauci. I’m very disappointed at the lack of messaging and effort to communicate from the federal government."
2021-03-30 13:20,"To turn a phrase from Santayana, those who do not remember the pandemic are doomed to repeat it."
2021-03-30 13:51,"By now I've got a long list of states I'll never again visit. Those of us who have been taking precautions and being patient were not the ones who politicized this, but now, it's on. Watch while our spending habits become increasingly politicized."
2021-03-30 13:18,"I work on the front lines with the public every day. For the most part, people have no sense of self-discipline or community, and they don't want to be inconvenienced. They're thinking of themselves, and the greatest sin you can commit is telling them they're doing something wrong—bad driving, rude manners, not wearing a mask.

I strongly believe we will absolutely enter a new surge in Covid-19 for the same reason I think we'll be living with horrible climate change consequences for the rest of our lives: people can't be bothered to think of anything but themselves."
2021-03-30 13:28,"Please tell it like it is.  We are living with selfishness.     No sense of sacrifice can be found on the faces of the maskless.  This needs to be made clear everyday.  Many of us have parents that belonged to “the Greatest Generation”.  My father was drafted in October prior to Pearl Harbor and didn’t return home until April of ‘45.  He along with others fought through Africa, Sicily, Italy and Normandy before making it to Germany.  He was scheduled for the Pacific.  Not an ounce of selfishness. Without hesitation this generation would have worn masks.  But today sacrifice has taken a backseat.  I eagerly await to read about “The Selfish Generation” and their shameful behavior."
2021-03-30 13:31,"I can’t wait to get my vaccine. These “eligibility” dates are just that—dates when you can sign up. I was eligible nearly a month ago, am on two waiting lists, and still haven’t received notice of availability.

Eligibility does not mean availability, and I really hope the availability opens up soon."
2021-03-30 13:39,"I have held the hand of numorous patients that I removed from their ventilators as they passed away due to covid.  I have watched as they come in through the ER needing a few litters of Oxygen to a week latter on a vent fighting for their life alone with no family aloud to say goodbye.  I have gotten to see some leave and go home after beating the virus only to return a week latter because their lungs have been damaged beyond repair.   I know many that still reqire oxygen, unable to return to work or their daily lives, months after leaving the hospital.  I have seen patients with blood coming out of everywhere as well frantically try to get them to turn a corner that my never be.  I have seen the horror and the nightmares, I have lost friends,family, co workers, and patients.  I am among the thousands of healthcare workers seeing the same  as me.  We are not OK.  These events have changed us for ever.  We can finally breath a little as things start to improve but we have no desire to return to this hellish nightmare that to many take lightly.  Is wearing a mask really that much to ask?  How many out there caused deaths and they have no idea it was due to their unwillingness to comply with mask mandates?  I want to be a part of the solution not the problem.  Do you?"
2021-03-30 13:39,"It is unfortunate that many people who get vaccinated then feel no need to wear a mask.  While it is likely true that vaccinated people face little risk of contracting the virus, other people don't know whether we have been vaccinated or simply believe Covid-19 is no longer pervasive.  Heck, we may even be mistaken for anti-maskers or Covid deniers.  The result is, we contribute to the perception that masking is not the norm or is no longer necessary.  Many Americans are distinctly uncomfortable going against the prevailing winds.  Those who fear ostracism or unwanted attention are reluctant to don a mask around those who are maskless.  To reinforce the message that Covid remains a serious threat to much of our society, we all have a responsibility to consistently mask when we leave the house, vaccinated or not.  Make masking the norm."
2021-03-30 12:06,"What’s the ulterior motive for wanting people to wear masks? When health officials suggested social distancing and closing businesses, the ulterior motive was to tank the economy causing Trump to lose.  

The President and health officials want you to wear a make to help stop spreading a disease. Governors on the other hand, want to gain support of those who don’t like wearing masks (everyone practically). There is no other reason they can give.  Which approach harms the country though?  And which group, maskers or unmaskers, care more about their country and neighbors?"
2021-03-30 12:55,"The projection of panic from the obviously ridiculous ""CDC Director"" with her exaggerated ""Impending Doom"" will help nothing. 

First of all it is needlessly dramatic, but secondly and more importantly it is false. With a vast majority of 65+ population being vaccinated the number of deaths and critical hospitalizations will be cut so substantially that no new wave will ever approach what we've previously experienced.

If you want to forever wear a mask, even though you are vaccinated, more power to you but don't expect a large majority to care. I still wear a mask, even though I got vaccinated through a phase 3 trial, but I only wear it in places they require it and for the shortest possible time because I no longer care about infection - this is more about being polite since others don't know I am vaccinated. 

If people don't care about the risk, let them live how they want. If you are afraid for yourself, put 10 masks on and sit at home. This constant nannying from Biden and the Left accomplishes absolutely nothing and will change nothing. People have stopped caring about the government guidance. Vaccination promotion is about the only thing that is worthwhile. Everything else is meaningless by now."
2021-03-30 13:12,"Michigan, where my invalid, elderly mother lives, is experiencing the doom of the 4th spike right now and my mother, who is homebound, has been told that it will be mid-July before she can get vaccinated. That is unbelievable and infuriating."

2021-03-30 12:59,"Those critical of Dr. Walensky's impassioned speech as ""too emotional,"" or ""unprofessional"" would do well to revisit ""Don't Think of an Elephant,"" by George Lakoff, on messaging for effective persuasion. Facts and statistics alone will not reach many, because people are not entirely rational. 

Straightforward information hasn't penetrated the skulls of many of ""the public"" so far. Some party-hearty folks need to be made to feel the virus is coming for them and their families very, very soon, and there won't be enough doctors and nurses who can care for all the dying. 

Impending Doom seems about right, with variants more infectious and deadly already in our midst and not enough people vaccinated to stop the spread.  We need more ""this is your 22-year-old friend on the ventilator where she'll probably die"" ads from the administration. We need more doctors and nurses and undertakers sounding the alarm, more urgently, in many languages, on TV, radio, social media.  

Good for Dr. Walensky in trying to convey just how serious our current situation is."
2021-03-30 13:26,"Not to be overly cynical, but the progress made since the new administration came in just emphasizes the stark difference between the competence of the Biden administration and that of Trump.

It almost seems like these GOP governors are removing these mask mandates as we approach the finish (or at least should be) to sabotage Biden."
2021-03-30 13:10,"Why the impending doom?? The mixed messaging is real. We hear the news and then look around in our community. Two different stories. In Ohio, you can get a vaccine if you’re 16 or older. It has been like this for days. I live in a city of 20,000 and the endless amount of openings for vaccination availability does not mesh with the messages from the CDC. Everyone I know in this area has already gotten the vaccine who wants it. For many in this country, it appears our leaders are concerned with the 5% of the vaccine that may not give us immunity. What’s the point??"
2021-03-30 13:13,"I’m disgusted by ""the best hunters will survive"" system of booking vaccine appointments at the mega vaccination sites, and others too. Most people have toed the line with CDC safety recommendations (masks, distance, sanitation), and now in their fatigued states have to ""go on the hunt"" for appointments everyday--this is not civilized! What about a first-come-first-served system that allows people to register and then patiently wait until their legitimate time comes up (ON A FAIR BASIS), instead of being beaten by prowlers who are better equipped than others."
2021-03-30 13:27,"One thing is unclear to me:  When I went to a NJ testing site for my second shot, on March 9 at 9:30 in the a.m., there was no line.  I walked through, with staff, the first tent.  I was ushered into the second tent, where perhaps two people were in front of me, walked to the check-in desk and almost immediately exited to the the main building, and again, immediately was brought to my chair for the injection.  I would have expected the place to be packed, with a long line.  Is this because they ran out of vaccine?  Is it because the system still is not functioning well by not maxing out the facility's capacity each day?  Is it because it is still limiting to those over 65, most of whom have their shots?  Whatever the reason, I haven't read about this underuse of the facilities in NJ or elsewhere."

Just spent four days with my family (we are vaccinated, kids have antibodies) and the Covid safety measures were absolutely outstanding. You could not even take a 2 second photo without a mask on your face. Signs everywhere warned that guests would be ejected if masks are not worn over mouth AND nose at all times except when eating/drinking. There were plastic partitions on public transports and on the lines, disinfecting stations all over, and signs on the ground to keep us six feet apart. And every single guest and cast member cooperated, because we all agreed with the rules. How nice to not come across a single anti-masker the whole time!  It’s been a long time since I’ve felt this safe or been more proud of my fellow humans. It’s incredible what we can do together when we cooperate."
2021-03-30 13:24,I live in Michigan. Our latest surge coincides with high school opening - our Republican legislature tied school COVID-19 funding to full-time face-to-face learning. We have no social distancing and students are in unventilated classrooms with 35 other students. Our single high school of 1100 students has more than 200 students in quarantine and at least 12 known active COVID-19 cases. People aged 10-19 are the fastest growing positive group in our state. I wonder why? Could it be that schools aren't magical and viruses do spread within their walls?
2021-03-30 12:34,"States opening businesses, Schools opening with a reduction to 3 feet distancing, Biden touting the daily number number of shots (but not vaccinations as two are needed, except for J&J) — All while vaccinations are still in the early stages.  Masks will help, but there are other issues with the pandemic that need to be addressed.  The bigger problem is that while all adults will be able to get the vaccine soon, that doesn't mean that they will be able to.  The system of appointments is flawed and need to be fixed."
2021-03-30 12:54,For a year some believed it was 15 cases and soon it would be zero. Everything was under control. And the fishbowl cleaner and bleach didn't make any sense. But some bought it. Next came a light at the end of the tunnel and the never ending we are rounding the curve. Now comes the truth. The vaccines are here. All we have to do is practice the cautions until a majority of people get vaccinated and we can get back to something nearing normal. And still there is resistance to the obvious. We are a strange lot.
2021-03-30 14:00,"Instead of a blanket ""wear your mask"" mandate, it would be more realistic to start loosening requirements where it has been determined that the chances of transmission are greatly reduced or non existent. For example, walking outside without a mask is still verboten in many municipalities. Many people are disregarding the mandate especially when there are few other people around. It then becomes more difficult to refute the arguments that mask mandates are all a form of government mind control."
2021-03-30 13:54,"Dr.Walensky’s passionate plea to mask up just a while longer was totally appropriate and professional.Can anyone imagine what it must be like to work long hours using every technique of modern medicine to save patients with COVID and then realize that large portions of the population will not do a simple thing like wear a mask to prevent the disease? Doctors, nurses and scientists have been the heroes of this deadly pandemic but are ignored in favor of Governors and businesses who look at finances and political points.We should all shed a tear because many have done so much to save us and many,many more have done nothing or ignored the pleas to cooperate!"
2021-03-30 12:55,"It's completely baffling that the Biden administration seems preoccupied with masking, keeping businesses closed and kids out of school yet allowing immigrants to storm our southern border knowing that 10 percent have been shown to be infected with Covid.  I thought Biden was going to follow the science."

2021-03-30 13:05,"Biden must explain why states with lockdowns and mask mandates like NY and other Northeastern states have much higher corona surges even now than FL and TX which had no strict mandates and opened completely now.  He called Republican governor of TX a Neanderthal when he opened his state recently. He has to explain also why coronavirus is going up after he became president and imposed mask mandates in federal buildings. States that follow Biden is experiencing severe surges, school closing, business closings, economic decline, mental and suicide problems. Trump and his people said vaccine would be available to all Americans by April. Biden mocked it, but yesterday he  said it will happen. His 100M will become almost 300M. So, America is moving ahead whether Biden follow or not. Based on what is happening now, it will be stupidity to follow Biden's doom and gloom."
2021-03-30 13:04,"More nonsense from the Left. ''Impeding doom'' ? Really?  Wearing two masks after you are vaccinated? More nonsense.  The Left wants control. Period. We are not going back to shut downs and isolation. Those days are over. The fourth wave, the fifth wave. the sixth wave..? Does the Left actually think that they can just keep us in shutdown mode for the next year or two-- or more? It will not happen. Just ask Gov Newsom of California who will be recalled. Just ask Gov Cuomo who is in deep trouble due in part to his draconian shutdown.  Enough of the CDC bureaucrats and their doom and gloom projections as a pretext to shutting us down."

2021-03-30 13:30,"Emotional reactions are stronger than common sense. People are motivated by their emotions more than they realize. Trumps incitement made not wearing a mask a political statement connected to an emotional reaction. This was a deliberate abuse that incited the nation against the helpful, non-political, protective, common sense, reasonable mask. Because it was made so emotional it has had a lasting and far reaching effect. It was certainly abuse and Trump is an abuser. This abusive behavior has certainly killed many thousands of people and continues to kill many more. Another instance of emotions ""trumping"" common sense. In this case a lethal mistake."

2021-03-30 13:53,"A mask is a reasonable,helpful, protective device that saves lives, one of which may be yours. It is easy to do, not invasive, not political, not emotional, and when you are wearing one you feel more protected, as long as you wear it as directed. This is a good thing.
Trump reversed all this by making mask wearing a raw political and emotional statement. This abuse certainly made the pandemic much worse than it could have and should have been. We are repeating that abuse now. This proves that emotions are stronger than common sense. Something we already know. But a fatal mistake to make where Covid exists. Covid finds all mistakes with ease."

Today, Europe, except for the UK, is going through a significant outbreak reaching to levels we have not seen since last year. Politics has noting to do with the movement of the Virus.  Wearing a mask in California does not lessen an outbreak in New York. Except for a few tiny countries, we are leading the World in vaccination. The UK is delaying second shots of the two dose vaccines. The US with 5% of the World’s population has administered 25% of the vaccine doses and with production ramp ups we are on pace to hit 70% vaccinated by May 31st.  What is important now is, wear a mask, maintain social distancing where you can and most importantly of all, get vaccinated."
2021-03-30 13:48,"The ""impending doom"" remark, which does not seem based upon ""Science,"" is not helpful.

Many older kids not wearing masks with parents ignoring that and social distancing.  That same week our county had gone from low to moderate and I expect there to be a increase in cases over the next 10 days. I have avoided restaurants and stayed home. Too many people perceive easing restrictions as a pass to throw caution to the wind."
2021-03-30 14:10,"Masks are not enough if they are flimsy and loose, which is what I see in most cases.  The administration needs better messaging about the importance of quality well-fitting masks. There are private companies that got approval to manufacture N95 masks and ramped up production, but now have a surplus because large health systems have contracts with major manufacturers. We no longer have a shortage, but these companies are still prohibited from selling the N95 masks on platforms like Amazon. This administration needs to help these companies increase the manufacturing and distribution to the public at low cost."
2021-03-30 14:28,"What has failed to be mentioned about this fourth wave is that a large part of the population either through contracting COVID or being partially or fully vaccinated has some immunity to COVID.  Additionally, over half of senior citizens have been vaccinated. With such a large chunk of the population having some protection from the disease there is significantly less chance of overburdening the hospital system. The current US numbers keep being compared to Europe right before their current outbreak. However, Europe does not have the vaccination rates of the US or unfortunately the previous infection rates. I understand the need for continued caution but I would appreciated a more honest assessment of risk."

2021-03-30 12:46,"The fundamental misunderstanding many people have is that it is the government who decides whether you “have” to wear a mask. It’s not. It’s physicians and epidemiologists who “recommend” you wear a mask so you don’t get sick and die or get anyone else killed.

This misunderstanding leads people to think “Oh, so once the government says I don’t have to wear a mask anymore, I can stop.”

No. It’s not just about what the law says. It’s about following sage health advice.

The government doesn’t require diabetics to take medicine, but if you’re a diabetic, you’d be a fool to not follow the advice of your doctor.

Same logic applies here. The fact that many conservatives and so called “libertarians” can’t seem to grasp that the decision to wear a mask has nothing to do with whether or not the government mandates it is exactly what’s wrong with both movements."

Consequently, masking and social distancing may be required for the unforeseeable future at a time when people are giving up.  Not a pretty scenario."
2021-03-30 14:47,"Why in the world does anyone think that a year + down the road anyone is going to change their behaviors?  Those of us who have followed directives will continue to  do so and those who haven't aren't going to start  now.   It's also worth pointing out that  it really doesn't matter what states do, most private businesses still require masks. Overall though our only hope is to get folks vaccinated as quickly as possible"
2021-03-30 14:23,"It is simply a case of cooperation between the governing entities, from the president on down and us the citizen to stop the pandemic.
Yes the President is doing a great job demanding that people wear masks but if his policies fail it is only because people fail to cooperate. 
Those who think that the president is giving a mixed message should realize that a lot of this has to do with people using their heads and heeding the directives of experts , not those of their neanderthal thinking governors."
2021-03-30 14:57,"Once we reach the point where anyone who wants the vaccine has access it will be impossible to keep enforcing restrictions like masks and social distancing.

The vaccinated will rightly be unwilling to inconvenience themselves just to protect the anti vax crowd and the anti vax crowd by and large are also anti mask and anti other measures anyway. 

Within 60 days or less at our current rates of vaccination we will hit that tipping point and the focus will have to change to what those who refuse vaccination can and cannot do.

For the most part this will not require government action. Concert and Sports venues, travel industry (especially cruises and international travel) and even bars and restaurants will start requiring proof of vaccination all on their own because the alternative is not being able to operate safely at capacity. 

One good Super Spreader Event linked to your business will be a mortal blow to any business that must gather large crowds."

I would not have set foot on an airplane if it had not been an emergency. Both parents are nearly ninety, with multiple co-morbidities, and both have had only one shot so far. The trip out there was OK — not too many people, kind of enough space on the airplanes to stay away from others. But the airplane on my return flight was packed to the gills. They stuffed us all in like sardines — no space in between, no way to engage in social distancing. I could not believe the irresponsibility involved in that. I will not set foot on another airplane until the airlines understand that they are contributing to the spread of this disease with this irresponsible and greed-driven policy (it was American Airlines! — don’t fly with them unless you are willing to take major risks!) This kind of travel right now is the most irresponsible thing I can think of doing. Airlines are spreading the disease, and the government is allowing them to get away with it!"

2021-03-30 14:51,"Is wearing a mask a good practice? It certainly is. Is a mask mandate a good policy? No. To do anything the mandate would have to be specific to the type of mask, how and when it must be worn, what the penalties are if the mandate is broken, and most importantly the mandate must be enforceable. The “ mandates” that have been enacted meet few of any of the criteria which is why the results in states with and without a mask mandate are mixed at best. Do it right or don’t do it. Our “mandates “ are  a sorry joke that only cause political opportunism and “news”."

No better way to sabotage Biden's strategy than to stretch out the duration of the epidemic past the period when aid can help.  If the epidemic spikes again, and for a longer period of time the appearances are that Biden and the democrats have failed, when in fact its the Republican governors who have failed their constitutuents."

This coming from someone who wears a mask and has been fully vaccinated.
2021-03-30 16:19,"Sometimes I wonder what would be happening now if the first vaccines were given first to people between 18 and 40 instead of those over 65. I know this would sound illogical because those over 65 face the higher risk. However, those between 18 and 40 are the actual super spreaders. They work, they party, they refuse to obey mask mandates, and are generally irresponsible. In a world of rational people, vaccinating the highest risk first makes sense. However, given our actual social reality, maybe vaccinating the young people first would have brought a faster end to the pandemic and reduced risk to the higher risk individuals."
2021-03-30 16:21,"Dr. Walensky's heartfelt remarks and warning of ""impending doom"" was brilliant. Instead of more Covid-19 numbers and charts, which too many Americans and political leaders seem to ignore, she made a gut-level appeal for people to understand a very basic thing. 

There's been a rejection of expertise in this nation, something Trump encouraged. Even with the pandemic's crushing death toll, people still reject or ignore the best advice. Dr. Walensky is asking very little. We will know soon whether people were listening."
2021-03-30 17:23,"I'm surprised that the CDC director telling everyone she fears impending doom is resulting in this kind of response-- not the genuine fear she meant to convey, and that people should feel, if they ever want this to ACTUALLY be over, but rather outrage at and contempt for...the CDC director? 

She's just doing her job. She has every reason to cry. She knows better than most exactly what toll this has taken on the country and world. It is a tragic thing. Even more tragic is people shaming her and making fun of her rather than taking her words seriously, and knowing that NYC has already opened so much and is opening so much more this week and next week...Frankly, I'm terrified. Why are we reopening with such poor numbers, with such strong variants-- effectively, with so many good reasons NOT to do so? How many more people will die who didn't have to?"
2021-03-30 14:06,"It is NOT clear to me as to why the Biden appointed CDC director is warning of 'Impending doom' The job of the CDC is to share information based on based available science and I have often relied on the CDC.gov for information about staying healthy and travel advisories. Many of us knew that Biden installed in the white house will be impending doom for USA by itself but with vaccine roll out going steadily and the supply of vaccines exceeding the demand so much so that practically any adult can now receive a vaccine projects optimism, not doom

Biden pushing mask mandate is not going to change unless every American willingly wears a PROPER MASK PROPERLY. Has anyone seen a children wearing a mask? 80% will have ill fitting masks that fall below the nose if they are at all wearing one.

One of the reasons as to why there is a surplus is because 30% of adults in the USA have not yet received the vaccine because they are unwilling to get one. I have met a few that should have had the vaccine but are hesitant to get it. I have tried to convince them that acquiring immunity by being immunized is better that being a COVID warrior and surviving a brutal battle as I did but sometimes I feel I am fighting a lost cause. So mandating a vaccine may not work either as it will be against the World Med. Association  Declaration of Helsinki – Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. Just because FDA has approved a vaccine does not mean anyone can be forced to get it."

They go to the bathroom were ever they can, they eat from garbage cans and dumpster to survive. So if covid19 is as bad as our government wants us to believe why is it we are not seeing bodies on every street in America? I have yet to see one article about any homeless person dieing from covid19. 
When covid19 fist came every death in America was covid19. Even if a person died in a car accident,  had a heart attack, stroke, or natural causes. Hospitals took advantage of this because for ever covid19 death they reported they received more money. They even listed on death certificates as a covid19 death with an underlying  condition. Insurance companies started refusing to pay death benefits because of the way policy are written. Now let's jump to 9 months later when the vaccine comes out. The government pushes everyone to get the vaccine. Their are reports of people dieing after receiving the vaccine and now we are told the vaccine did not kill them their underlying condition did. Talk about a double standard."
2021-03-30 16:12,"Whenever you try to force the real world to do something that can be counted, unintended consequences abound. The details can be found in: “Counting: How We Use Numbers to Decide What Matters” (Liveright), by Deborah Stone, which warns of the risks of relying too heavily on numbers. Numbers can be at their most dangerous when they are used to control things rather than to understand them. Once a useful number becomes a measure of success, it ceases to be a good measure. This is known as Goodhart’s law. To quote: “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.” When an algorithm is built out of bias-infected data, it will perpetuate bias-infected practices. The bias-in, bias-out problem can sharply limit the value of data-driven recommendations."

If it'll bring reaity to those who are still against vaccinations or who still believe that it's a hoax or ""like the flu"", then personal anecdotes serve a very real purpose, so I don't fault Dr. Wallensky for talking about her personal experience."
2021-03-30 16:54,"Curious that the NYT has this article in ""politics"". This is not political it is a health issue so the fact that some people have politicized our national health during a pandemic is irresponsible and unpatriotic. Unmasked people in large numbers outside  and inside taverns and cafes angers me when I think that only a small fraction of our population has been fully vaccinated and even then until herd immunity is confirmed we should continue wearing masks. These noncompliant people as the variant strains grow stronger will be flooding our hospitals again and putting healthcare workers and the rest of us at risk for the sake of a burger, a beer and some small talk. We are a silly selfish nation of people."
2021-03-30 17:09,"I am confused, the states that haven't reopened seem to be doing much worse than the states that have and at the center of the new CDC directors pleas for continued diligence. Why is this?"
2021-03-30 15:36,"Biden needs to re-evaluate his continuing to follow Trump’s strategy of get vaccines into arms ASAP, AKA Operation Warp Speed.
So far, the mortalities and morbidities continue apace as the threat grows of a new variant arises that evades the immunity conveyed by the current crop of vaccines.
Is the government sharing all the information or is it still trying to control our reactions as it did when talking about masks early on?
Truth works."
2021-03-30 16:46,"Covid is a big deal and we should take reasonable precautions to minimize its impact.   However, drama doesn't help.  The age adjusted mortality rate last year with Covid is essentially what it was when many of us were children.  And, this year it appears it will be much better as death rates are down substantially and most of the most vulnerable populations will soon be inoculated.  I didn't think each year was a year of impending doom when I was a kid and I don't now.   This isn't the flu, but it isn't the plague either!"
2021-03-30 16:48,"100 years ago the world's population was 1.8 billion. The conservative estimate was that the 1918-1920 pandemic took 50 million lives. So 1 in 36 people of the world's population was killed in two years by that pandemic. This was at a time when ocean crossings were rarer and for a relatively very few people. In 1919 it took the US Army three months(!) to cross the US in a convoy. They averaged nine miles an hour, there were no roads, only trails. Five days at best speed across the country by rail, but again not everyone traveled like they do now; and there was no air transport at all.
 Now we have 7.8 billion people and let's say three million have died from Covid. That's 1 in 2600. In a world where a great number of people travel all the time, and getting from one continent to another (or from one side of a continent to another) takes only hours, not days. According the the W.H.O's data, as of yesterday, for every 100 people who get infected, 2.64 will die. That figure has been going consistently down. In the US that rate is 2.34, also going consistently down. Last year 13 million died from communicable diseases, 2 million were from Covid. worldometers.info 
Dr. Walensky should be canned for that display. She is not there to be Meryl Streep or to charge at windmills. 
1 out of 2600 now, versus 1 out of 36 one hundred years ago in a much less crowded world. Exaggerated peril, j'accuse."
2021-03-30 15:27,"A year into the pandemic/endemic, and those inside the blue bubble have truly lost their minds.  People are making their own decisions now; we are way beyond education.  People know what the facts are - they are choosing to disregard and create their own reality.  In the west and south especially, ""freedom"" is more important than ""responsibility"" or ""health,"" even one's own.  People are living and dying as a consequence of their decisions.  It's hard for me to fathom that people can vaccinate and mask up to stay safe and healthy; at some point, and I think we've reached it, people who get sick haven't taken the necessary precautions.  Why should I care more about their health and welfare than they do?"
2021-03-30 16:20,"I take great exception to this reporter’s characterization of Dr. Walensky’s off-script plea as “raw display of emotion” and am floored by some of these highlighted comments - “speaking hysterically”, “teary-eyed”, “unprofessional”...?

I just watched her entire message on YouTube and she was none of these.

I challenge all of you to walk even half a mile in her shoes - or someone who’s lost a loved one to Covid in the cruelest, most isolated way possible - and behave with even a modicum of her composure.

The lack of empathy, imagination, and sensitivity is appalling."
2021-03-30 17:29,"Surprise, surprise.... Texas and Florida continue to lead the way while incompetent blue states continue to struggle. Additionally, a more relevant statistic would be to see what the percentage of mortality is rather than the percentage of infection. C'mon man!!!! As our fearless pseudo leader likes to say."
2021-03-30 16:07,"Wait, in 8 of the 9 states that have an uptick in infection, mask mandates are in effect. Is that right?"
2021-03-30 16:16,Open the country up. Dems are just doing what they have to do to try and stay in control  of everyone. Betting money government is holding back vaccine to stay in control of their police state.

2021-03-30 17:39,"I was disgusted to learn, at the first outdoor gathering my family had since the pandemic took hold, that my mid-twenties Grandson and his wife will not get the vaccine.  They also don't wear masks.  They are both healthy.

I think it's selfish and uninformed.  I cannot get vaccinated because of an auto-immune disease of unknown origin and blood clot issues, which makes me sad.  I am  not willing to take the risk with my life.

I tried to reason with his wife by saying that she could still spread the disease and she said that even vaccinated people could.  The CDC has just now come out with MAJOR news that most frontline workers are not infected after being vaccinated and if one if not infected they cannot spread the disease.

Someone tell fox so-called news and, especially Tucker Carlson.  They are killng people daily with their lies.

Please, Good People, if you are healthy get vaccinated.  Together WE CAN STOMP OUT THIS DEADLY DISEASE.

OUR lives and world depend on it.  Meantime, keep wearing masks and taking other precautions so things don't get worse.  The only ones who won't help stop it are the people who profit off the misery, hospitalization and death  of the rest of us."

This pandemic is nothing compared to others. The Black Plague killed millions more! And was by far more contagious. Get off it and worry about yourself! If you not afraid of covid like I am, then awesome. If you are, fine. Go get your vaccine. Go get your mask. But remember the next time you try and tell someone your okay with killing babies, that everyone else has the right to do what they wish with theirs. Cant have it both ways. Covid vaccine isn’t even FDA approved! Masks don’t work, I’m proof of it. I got covid. Religiously wearing a mask out of fear and washing my hands! Get over your fear tactic! Texas numbers are lower now that they have lifted their mandate. Florida numbers are not different than a state with a mask Mandate. Get off social media and do your own freaking research!"

2021-03-30 15:25,"Unfortunately,  there's no cure for stupidity.  It's not illegal.  A person can even kill themselves if they want,  without prosecution. 

But being responsible for the deaths of others is called murder.  

While some businesses in some states are making a few bucks, none wearing masks or distancing; while some indoor restaurant diners enjoy their maskless freedom in close quarters with others--where servers and cooks are maskless, too... 

Any Covid that these people exhale is only looking for more human lungs to infect.  Once airborne,  it knows no boundaries. 

The diners' brief taste of freedom could be their last, while they blithely infect family, friends and strangers. 

This utter lack of concern for others' lives, the idea that bar life is better than death, shows a strange rationale among the maskless ... one of selfishness and indifference to life, and a asinine ability to reject scientific information."

Huh - Michigan, New York and New Jersey lead the way in this recent surge.  It's not the masks / restrictions folks.  It's a seasonal virus that comes and goes in waves."
2021-03-30 17:06,"I believe this is a well-deserved article, however I am very disappointed that so many times the author refers to our president, as Mr Biden. I believe this is a blatant bias."
2021-03-30 17:45,"What's the end goal here?

Most people I know are vaccinated. My county has had less than 6 cases per 100k daily for months so our hospital system is nowhere near being overwhelmed. 

We were told to wait for a vaccine we did. In fact, it's getting harder and harder to travel with requirements to get covid tested before leaving your destination. Vaccination status means nothing.

We had less about 1/5th the cases that we had on our peak.

It's been over a year and the states that did almost nothing are better off than many of the states that ordered strict lockdowns. Time for the government to be realistic. We're no longer protecting ""grandma"" because grandma has most likely gotten both vaccine shots. We're just virtue signaling."
2021-03-30 5:36,"The only 'doom' is for small landlords. The CDC says they have not been able to evict non paying tenants for over a year. The typical lease doesn't address hysteria over a virus, and doesn't give the CDC any authority to decide anything..."

Therefore, having a face mask in place when in public is what solidarity demands...in strict justice. And the Golden Rule: ""do no do to others what you wouldn't want them do unto you""."
2021-03-30 2:28,"This latest eruption of fear-driven decrees will not solve the problem. We know the virus can and will continue to mutate. Unless we listen to the perennial wisdom of our own bodies and do everything we can to strengthen our immune system, we will paint ourselves into a corner of getting the vaccine over and over again with unknown consequences. A vaccine which will be successful if it lessens or gets rid of symptoms. It will not stop transmission of the virus. This is not the way to resolve this challenge but rather the way to prolong its seemingly cyclical return. While continuing lockdowns will play havoc with our emotional health and stifle our chance to return to full employment. What are we doing?"
2021-03-30 18:03,"The problem with the use of the phrase ""impending doom"" is that one day, when there is something like impending doom, or even impending catastrophe, we will not take it seriously.  A 10-15% increase in normal annual mortality that takes us back a few decades in terms of annual mortality rate is not impending doom.  It's just a big problem that we should take reasonable steps to counter."
2021-03-30 18:38,"I really wish the CDC would give some real guidance, instead of the blanket statements they have been giving. If we are vaccinated, and two weeks past second dose (which is what they are/were saying was necessary), are we ok to meet with others in the same boat? Or, should we listen to the blanket stay at home advice. Is the surge among the unvaccinated, or those who need no advice? For those of us who have followed all the rules and are desperate to see family, what should we be doing?"
2021-03-30 11:25,"The problem for President Biden is that he is sending a mixed message on Covid.  He is telling us that he is doing a great job in controlling it.  This message encourages us to resume our former lifestyles.  However, at the same he is telling us to continue to follow the CDC guidelines on masking, avoiding and social distancing for a little longer.  America does not need much of an excuse to give up the CDC guidelines, and the President's words may be giving them a reason to do so.

2021-03-30 19:22,Dr Walensky last week open schools this week the world is coming to an end.    Herein lies the problem the messages are inconsistent causing folks not to trust those in charge who have proven themselves not to be trustworthy
2021-03-30 21:40,"Would be great if government still mandatory mask until this is over. There are people like me that due medical issues still not allowed to take the vaccine, and we are essential workers to serve those who refrain to use mask and the big cooperation that doesn't care about our well being. I understand our medical issues is not anybody problem, but I understand everyone also wants to get served... Consumer and corporations.."
2021-03-30 20:09,"A mask mandate is a purely political statement. People have been informed and a mandate is ridiculous especially since it can’t be enforced.

2021-03-30 20:38,"Many whine in favor of a national mandate, but the country is made up of 50 states, all of which have different economies, demographics, standard of living, etc.  States that were the most restrictive have actually done worse; even when population size and demographics are taken into account.

Not saying I don't wear a mask, I do.  But, I appreciate the state's rights to determine what is best for their constituents.  Do not mandate masks at the federal level as if everything across the country is the same.  Heck, most of the money for state government coffers from the stimulus bill went to blue states, not based on population, but on the impact of poor decisions by governors/mayors."
2021-03-29 10:40,"This article revealed to me how easy it is to dismiss the reality of a person’s fears when they are not grounded in science or logic, and ignore the greater reality that many have been manipulated and used by claims that employ logical-sounding claims (“Everybody’s  doing / buying / voting for it, you should too).  We don’t need only logic, but compassion, and not just when there is a need to persuade, but simply to be more human ourselves, together. For instance, those workers are paid very poorly. Where is compassion for them when the minimum-wage debate comes up? Many of them work two jobs and raise a family. And now it the person in charge says, sincerely, no doubt, “I care.” Where was that move to really listen when they the employees were not needed to behave in a certain way? Where is the ability to listen when doing so isn’t “useful,” and I don’t mean only for the administrator in the article, but for all of us in our political conversations?"
2021-03-29 10:51,There are such things as job requirements. Obviously people in the medical field must require vaccinations.
2021-03-29 10:57,"These people's  jobs should be contingent on being vaccinated yesterday. It was they who spread the disease from nursing home to nursing home and hence to the rest of us. We must stop this disease.
The only reason this isn't happening is that employees are underpaid, and hence scarce.
I remember when the Salk and Sabin vaccines came out. We all lined up in school and got it. No one refused. It was our patriotic duty."
2021-03-29 11:12,"I would give anything to get the shot at this point, but I am still not eligible. I have been working from home for more than a year and miss my colleagues desperately. To have the opportunity to get it and refuse, especially if you work in a nursing home? The mind boggles."
2021-03-29 11:25,"This is such terrible propaganda. 

Workers' vaccination status should be revealed to no one else in the workplace. The fact that staff were given 'influencer' status and told which staff to target with their pressure tactics should be cause for litigation. Where is health information privacy (HIPPA) in this scenario? 

Vaccination is a personal decision and a medical procedure, all details should remain between the vaccinated (or unvaccinated) person and their medical provider, no one else."

2021-03-29 12:03,"A week ago I had a minor procedure done at a very well regarded local hospital near a big city.   While I was recovering I chatted up the nurses to pass the time.  Two of them said they had not been vaccinated and were not sure they would be.

I was astounded.  Here are these people leaning over me on a hospital, and not vaccinated.  When I had a chance I asked the doctor about this and he said he hadn't known, but the staff were not required to be vaccinated.

How about that for scary?  This is no hospital in rural Missouri (or name another state if you happen to be from MIssouri).   In this hospital, your order off a menu, they bring you your food piping hot and they answer the call button within two minutes. The staff are pleasant and respectful.  I actually love that place.

But nurses not vaccinated?  Holy cow.

How can this be?  I can only assume that they are so short of staff that they cannot dictate even basis measures to protect the patients and the other staff.

Today my wife has to go in for a test.  I couldn't sleep at all last night."
2021-03-29 12:04,"This would be the proper focus of the next round of Federal legislation. It's within Congress's power to allow employers in general, and health care employers in particular, the right to make Covid vaccination a job requirement."

My mother is a resident of an excellent home.  They have been on lock down from visits due to Covid cases with the weekly testing, almost continually since early October.

Of course not everyone has agreed to be vaccinated, given the constant cases.  My Mother got her first shot in January.

Sadly, until I am fully vaccinated, I am not visiting my Mother, it is just too big a risk.  Happily, I have an appointment.

Whatever the various reasons, it is selfish.  But then we see that daily on the news with no maskers and spring break entitled partiers."
2021-03-29 12:15,"No one should be  forced to take a vaccine.

Her reticence sounds like an excuse by management to not open its coffers in a highly profitable business to low income workers. A $500 bonus to all who get vaccinated  (and who already have been vaccinated) would do wonders."

I had to have unexpected major surgery in January. All of my attending healthcare workers had been vaccinated. We were all masked all the time. I was too young to access a vaccine, and I certainly did not want to chance infecting them. But the idea of being in a healthcare facility and becoming infected from a health worker is anathema. I am now vaccinated and have to have another procedure tomorrow. I hope everyone has been vaccinated.

There are folks who wish to see the Biden administration fail, and are purposefully not masking or vaxxinv to protest him. In the long run, though, this is much bigger than the politicians. The virus doesn't care who or what party you are, it just wants a host, any hoat. Herd immunity protects everyone. We really should try to get to herd immunity sooner than later so we can get back to some kind of safer life.
Trump got vaccinated."
2021-03-29 11:54,"The article would have been much better if the author had examined the reasons behind the workers' hesitancy.  I don't understand why a woman who paid to have some tatoo artist inject ink into her skin would refuse a vaccine because she does not know what is in it.  She has no idea what is in the tattoo ink, who manufactures it, or how it was stored.  Same, no doubt, for much of the food she consumes."
2021-03-29 11:59,"As usual commenters focus on worker's low pay. Let's get real, one employee got the vaccination because she wants to protect people when she travels to Puerto Rico and Jamaica later this year. And they all have mobile phones. Also, notice that the security guard is wearing his mask below his nose in the photo. You would think for the photo he would follow protocol.

The elderly and many employees got their shots months ago. You have to be willfully ignorant to not see their excellent outcomes. Surely those who are hesitant know vaccinated coworkers.

One employee admits she isn't afraid of needles and even got a tattoo. Another says she only puts healthy food into herself and family. I would wonder if she actually follows recommendations as to what a healthy diet entails. Or is actually promoting diabetes and heart disease. Hopefully she does follow public health advice."
2021-03-29 12:14,"I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with a business or organization - for profit or non-profit - to require vaccinations as a condition of employment or membership. If schools can require vaccinations from kindergarten, then businesses should be able to do so for Covid regardless of the status of the vaccines as for emergency use. 

I sing in a chorus. When (or if) we ever return to singing, I certainly hope our board of directors makes vaccinations a requirement for attending rehearsals. A health care setting? Heck, yeah. Make it mandatory, If employees refuse, tell them to clear out their lockers.

I know of a hospital employee who refused the vaccine, claiming he did not know what was in it that it would rewrite his DNA. This is a man of science! He even provided some phony religious exception document that he downloaded from the internet. When he got Covid, what did he do? Trotted right off to his place of employment for an infusion. Bet he did not know what was in that either."
2021-03-29 12:23,"Those of us who read the Times can't imagine it, but a large chunk of the population exists in a news-free world.

Worse, many of them listen to biased talk radio and podcasts or spend time on one-sided web sites that reinforce their ignorance.

Elder care workers have just spent a year watching their charges suffer and  die. Many of them have become ill themselves. But after strenuous efforts to persuade them 21% STILL refuse to take a medicine that might potentially save their own lives.

We no longer sleep on lice infested piles of straw on dirt floors. We don’t have to decide whether or not to eat our seed grain or starve. The diseases we take for granted will not kill us like polio and tuberculosis. Yet they are somehow too good to take this vaccine. I don’t remember hearing that US troops on D-day in Normandy were heard saying :”No, you first.”"
2021-03-29 12:32,"Corporations need to make life extremely difficult for those who do not get the vaccine.

Without a vaccine airlines, trains, public transit, cruise ships, etc. should not allow you to travel.

Sporting, Concerts, fairs or any other mass attended event should not allow you admission. 

Restaurants and Bars the same.

Church leaders of all faiths need to get the message out and require vaccines. 

Employers should require vaccinations or look elsewhere for employment.

The ONLY exception should be a PROOF of allergic reaction to the ingredients and then the person needs to wear double mask at all times, quarantine and produce negative covid tests weekly.

Can you imagine if our ancestors refused polio, measles et. vaccines?

Give adults to August 1 to comply. Children need to comply within 3 months of availability to children. 

These corporate leaders will bulk, but without a consensus we will never be able to ""fully open"". These corporations bottom line will suffer more.

The government requiring will not work. It needs to come from the corporate world."
2021-03-29 12:35,"Vaccine hesitancy (a polite way to denote the refusal to vaccinate) among lower ranks of healthcare workers is somewhere between the elephant in room and an Uncle who shows up to Nets game in a Confederate flag T-shirt. If you don't let the noise distract you (""it's not fully approved, it's authorized for emergency; it's a new untested technology""; etc) you'll see that it falls within the well-established pattern of inadequate training and poor overall educational attainment. Before this vaccination hesitancy there were hundreds of papers in various medical and nursing journals pondering the reasons for noncompliance among nurses with flu pandemic (H1N1pdm09) protocols, overall low use of PPEs, etc. Medical errors being among lead causes of death in US and hospitals (and other healthcare facilities) being main sources of drug-resistant bacterial strains (and now credited with facilitating emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19) fall into the same pattern. So the story of trials and tribulations of a nursing home manager trying to vaccinate their staff is like a makeup tutorial for applying lipstick to a pig."
2021-03-29 12:37,"I disagree with Ms. Sandri's position that tactics like incentives to vaccinate are bribes.  Our fishmonger at Whole Foods told me that management is offering employees $40 per shot.  When I asked if that was effective, he said, "" You bet.""  When I managed a large department, I found that incentives like gift cards or bonuses were highly effective...contests, challenges etc.  Human nature responds to rewards for behavior."
2021-03-29 12:40,"A lot of healthcare workers are within child bearing age.  Is it right that someone needs to subject themself, and perhaps subject an unborn future child to an unknown vaccine ramification?  

As a senior, I got my COVID vaccinations and was relieved.  No worries.  Yet, if I had been working as a young adult in the role of an RN, that I am, would I be willing to take a chance on my future and the future of any children I might have by accepting a COVID vaccine?  I’m not so sure.  

We’re not talking about vaccines or disease that have been around for centuries.  We’re talking about something that took over our lives quickly and with unbelievable strength.  Let’s not be so quick to judge."
2021-03-29 12:41,"One of the miracles of modern medicine, along with imaging, antibiologics, transplantation, surgery...is vaccination. And it's not even that new. 
I don't recall being asked for my opinion on certain vaccinations when training as an EMT; it was a requirement. I really don't recall being asked, while in basic combat training in the Army in 1970, whether I wanted the complete Southeast Asia series of shots; two in each arm, same day. I did want them, my drill instructor said so. Complain to your congressman. There was so much vaccine apparently that the med techs used the injection guns like squirt guns,
Now that I am at that age were some of my peers are in these homes, I darn sure want the workers vaccinated. If not, find a spot elsewhere."
2021-03-29 12:47,bravo to ms. sandri.
2021-03-29 12:45,"Ms Sandri is a wonderful person who took the time to find the best way to persuade her staff.  But there is another side to this coin.  During those months when her hesitant staff endangered the residents, themselves, and their own families many, many other people for whom Covid19 is a life threatening disease waited patiently in line for the vaccine to be available for them.  Shame on all the vaccine hesitant and anti vaxxers out there. Particularly shameful are the people who write in here to defend the selfish staff and continue to spread fear about the vaccines."
2021-03-29 12:35,"Can we have a follow up on Ms. Proctor? Has she been able, or wanted , to convince others in her family to get the vaccine? Usually converts are the most excited to convert others. I hope she now gets her other vaccines. Especially one for tetanus given she’s ready to let tattoo needles got into her body"
2021-03-29 12:51,"Until there is a study that demonstrates that prior infection provides no immunity to re-infection, it would be reasonable to exempt workers who have proof of prior infection and recovery from any vaccination requirement.  

There have definitely been a few cases of re-infections, but then the vaccines are known to be about 5% ineffective themselves.  Does prior infection provide any worse protection than vaccination?"
2021-03-29 12:51,"More qualified workers are paid more.  In this context, an hourly pay increase for vaccinated workers might be effective.  The federal government might help subsidize it."
2021-03-29 12:49,Just fire them if they won't take the vaccine.  Vaccine refusal is irresponsible and anti-social.
2021-03-29 12:50,"No vaccine, no work. Period. Same for the military, hospitals, all front line workers."
2021-03-29 12:39,"I am no anti-vaxxer, but I must admit that if our recent president had pressured the FDA to approve a ""Trump Genius Serum"" just weeks before the election, I would have been very suspicious of it.

As it happens, Trump did pressure the FDA to release its Emergency Use Authorization for the Pfizer vaccine, but only after the election, and only after it had already decided to release it (as I recall).  This had no effect on anything, but was somewhat like the king who commands the sun to rise in the morning just to prove his own omnipotence.  

So I did grab a shot (Moderna as it happens) at the first opportunity."
2021-03-29 13:00,"Our de facto criminal health care system has something to do with it, ie push every known drug, pill, procedure, operation, test on you to make big pharmacy and HMO Execs. richer instead of most of the aforementioned things actually do work.

It is like the boy that cried wolf syndrome ie when we have a vaccine that may be a game changer many people don't believe it.

I stopped taken the flu vaccine 7 yrs. ago when I either caught the flu in the clinic beforehand or had a bad reaction to the shot and was in bed with a 101.5 fever for two days (yes I know flu shot zealots, you can't get the flu from the shot.)

Then I found out that year the shot was only 19% effective for my group seniors.

That was enough. I practiced social distance when I can, wash hands and now will wear a mask always in certain situations.

The above is the surest way to avoid the flu. 

I will also take the covid shot soon if there is some evidence it is working and not a dud. (yes I know covid shot zealots, they worked in trials, real life is different from trials. )"
2021-03-29 12:51,"This is very simple.  You work in a health care situation, whether it's a hospital, doctor's office, clinic, nursing home, around sick, old, vulnerable people.  You want to keep your job?  You take the vaccine.  That's it. Or hit the road."
2021-03-29 13:00,Could they be fired? I think that might change their minds￼
2021-03-29 13:05,"I would wager that most if not all of this staff are on some kind of medication, have seen a Doctor of Dentist, and probably have had some kind of medical procedure. So, please help me understand why someone taking medication for high blood pressure, draws a line in the sand on covid vaccinations."
2021-03-29 12:56,"Ms. Sandri sounds like a wonderful manager. She really worked to change minds. She easily could have “bribed” her employees but she chose the difficult path of communication, education and getting to know and understand her employees. She cared enough to put in the personal effort. 
I compare it to “bribing” one’s children to do the right thing vs spending the time teaching them to do the right thing. She’s amazing."
2021-03-29 13:07,"The people believe in doctors but they do not believe in politicians. The problem with Covid is that was and is treated as a social-political problem. Finally now in some places, the decision will be between a physician and his/her patient. I do hope it is not too late"
2021-03-29 13:08,The article was all about understanding and caring and listening and well done I say. The vaccine question has been going on for years and people who don’t think much about it need to listen to other peoples fears because people have been hurt by different vaccines. So please don’t lump everyone together Retired Fed
2021-03-29 13:12,"Pfizer and Moderna are expected to file for full FDA approval of their Covid-19 vaccines during the next couple of months. Hopefully the FDA will have granted that sometime during the second half of the year—and just as hopefully, those of us who’ve been vaccinated will have all signed up for the V-safe app to track any side effects and contribute to ongoing monitoring. 

Once full approval has been granted, vaccination can be made mandatory for healthcare workers. Enough of this nonsense! 

I understand the hesitation; I was not at all keen on the Gardasil vaccine for my kids when it came out because the risk/benefit ratio was pretty dodgy. However, with Covid, if you’re worried about the side effects of the vaccine, check out the side effects of the virus—especially as it mutates through its plethora of victims."
2021-03-29 13:07,"This simply leaves me speechless, if one works at a health care facility where ones actions have a direct effect on their charges - then that company has the absolute right to terminate them or require they are vaccinated. Would you go to a restaraunt where people handling your food weren't required to wash their hands after going to the bathroom? Hairnets so hair isn't in your food? Stay out of the kitchen or stay home if they were a waitperson if say, they had a stomach bug or is that ok with you? Please, this is ridiculous- the statement - you don't know what's in it could be anything! Random ingredients? Please - as a healthcare worker- unless one is illiterate- those answers are all available at the touch of a mouse. Do they really think ""nobody knows""? Pharma employees and scientists simply walk into a lab, throw stuff together and then say hey, don't know what this stuff is out what it does? In this situation where OTHERS LIVES are at risk through your behavior - Vaccinate or terminate. simple."
2021-03-29 13:14,"Ms Sandri is a model for management during crisis.
“Everyone‘s fears are real...”. Coercion would not have worked. Giving people time to adjust was the key."
2021-03-29 13:24,"Do these same people know the ingredients in the food they eat every day? Of course not but food is essential for life, not too different than the vaccine.  I suspect these people may have been lied to for much of their lives and I can respect that so the only thing we can do is keep trying.  Ultimately a primary reason for getting it is because we care about others, especially the elderly.  Since these people work with the elderly they should know that."
2021-03-29 13:27,"Ultimately the public will require all businesses to vaccinate their staff or face what will effectively be a boycott by those of us who refuse to allow the foolhardy to place us at risk.  As we move past the current state of the pandemic fewer people will be willing to risk a return or spread of the disease.  Out of this will emerge a public health ""seal of approval"" or such which will identify businesses which are 100% vaccinated.  Employers will require it of new hires as no one will be willing to face the liability - deserved - of not protecting their staff and customers.

Hospitals and schools required vaccinated staff before the pandemic.  I believe - and hope - all businesses will move to this in the post-pandemic era.  I will be expecting it everywhere I go and from everyone with whom I work.  ""No jab, no job.""."
2021-03-29 13:32,"As tempting as it is to just scream, ""Fire them if they don't get the shot!"", threats aren't a good way to convince adults to do something. Even if the employees 'comply', what is the longer-term impact on the employer-employee relationship?

Ms. Sandri's success shows the power of persuasion. Plus, making this a positive experience for the employees may prompt them to speak positively about the vaccine and convince hesitant friends or family - ""I learned more about the safety and wanted to do my part"" instead of ""My employer made me do it"".

I personally convinced a hesitant person to get vaccinated - not by threatening her or pointing out her logical inconsistencies, but by acknowledging her concerns (""I hear you, I had that same thought initially""), highlighting the growing body of evidence of safety after millions have been vaccinated, and sharing my own relief upon getting vaccinated. Not only did she get the shot, she convinced a relative to get it too! 

A year ago scientists were saying it could take years to get a vaccine. It's not totally irrational to be a bit wary. Let's give people a chance to change their minds before resorting to ultimatums."
2021-03-29 13:36,"When I worked as an administrator (no direct contact with patients) for a health facility, testing for tuberculosis and hepatitis was required, as was having an updated tetanus shot. These were required for employment, and refusal to comply resulted in not being hired or termination. The same terms should apply with regard to the COVID-19 vaccine. 

If there are staff members who are ""hesitant,"" then they should be given an ultimatum and terminated if they refuse to get vaccinated. Sorry, ""hesitators,"" but when working in a health care facility, it is truly is not about you."
2021-03-29 13:36,"Addressing individual fears works.  They've found the same with neighborhood canvassing.  It makes me nervous because in the time it takes to talk people off the ledge of their fears one by one, the virus continues to do what viruses do to survive:  it mutates, and becomes harder to fight.

But that's the state of this battle in these times. So many issues exposed by the pandemic, from lack of worker protection to the healthcare system's treatment of BIPOC. 

The long-term and overall effect of COVID19, when we have the distance to assess it, is going to be more devastating than we currently realize.  But what happens in the next pandemic, when the mortality rate is 50%, or our children are targeted?"
2021-03-29 13:42,"This article makes me sad to think that if nursing home staff is so hesitant to get the vaccine, that we as a country will never get to herd immunity. No local government will be able to make the personalized effort that Ms. Sandri did for each of her staff."
2021-03-29 13:47,"Mandating vaccination by firing those who refused and hiring new people would have met the immediate need of having a vaccinated workforce but it would not have solved the wider social problem of refusal- whether it stems from misinformation or the sense that no one cares about them.

By taking the time to understand where people's fears and hesitations come from and meeting them, one by one, with information and compassion, Ms. Sandri has set in motion a process to curb the spread of refusal.  

Until people recognize that vaccination is a public health measure, people will continue believing that personal health measures such as eating healthy food are relevant.  My healthy habits will not protect others.  The beauty of vaccination is in its community spirit - like the community coming together to contribute a square to a quilt that then protects everyone, including those few who are unable to contribute a square. 

Unless people feel connected, respected and heard, how will they have that community spirit?"
2021-03-29 13:47,"If our concern is for the residents of the nursing home, and they have all been vaccinated, why is this even an issue? Free choice."
2021-03-29 13:49,"I predict hesitancy among the under 50 will turn into a  US vaccine glut by May. The younger crowd either doesnt see the seriousness to them or fears the vaccine. I predict the government or employers will be offering modest incentives for vaccination then, e.g. $50 gift cards."
2021-03-29 13:44,They should lose their job ASAP.
2021-03-29 13:31,"This. Is. Nuts. The idea that we have to coddle and understand/debunk every half-baked conspiracy theory just to placate people like this is totally unacceptable.

And I would wager that the “hesitant” employees would be getting a much less charitable shake from the NYTimes if they were mostly white, rural Trump supporters."
2021-03-29 13:59,"We need to make it mandatory get the vaccine or no job.  Especially if professionals are working in a hospital ,police or nursing home.  Get tough with these cry babies.  They are probably GOP who listened to the Fox News and they lie about every thing.  I am a retired 67 year old Army veteran .  I got 2 Pfizer vaccines and i love  my country enough to want to end this virus .  Israel has a two tier system the government and business are working together.  If you don’t get the vaccines no job.  That is tough but so is dying from this horrible virus."
2021-03-29 14:05,"I’m pretty sure the Biden administration could use Ms, Sandri and her team approach!! The his article made me feel hopeful. Thank you!"
2021-03-29 14:07,"I hope that every prospective nursing home patient can veto staying in a home that does not have 100% vaccination. If someone doesn’t want the vaccine, then he/she should be denied employment at these homes."
2021-03-29 14:20,"It is shocking and irresponsible to allow healthcare workers the option of refusing vaccination. Both my elderly father and a sibling were recently hospitalized for issues unrelated to Covid. They had both been in strict isolation at home for the entire pandemic, but upon entering the hospital they immediately caught Covid from unvaccinated caregivers. It is flabbergasting that the wellbeing of vulnerable patients has been treated so cavalierly by our healthcare system."
2021-03-29 14:20,"Our response so often is, ""if it's true, according to science, everyone should just get it!"" And then immediately move on to judge individuals who have fears or concerns. 

I think the wise approach this manager took could be applied to other issues like climate change or the equity gap or conservation of nature and biodiversity. It's about Americans, one person at a time, caring as much about the common good as they do about themselves. The cult of the individual has really brought us to the brink.

I think we should all, especially the media and government, really listen to her saying that, ""I’m Asian, but I’m not Japanese or Thai or Indian, and they are very different people,” she said. “Until we understand cultural sensitivities beyond the major skin color groups, we’re not going to be successful at reaching herd immunity levels with some of those subsets.”"
2021-03-29 14:22,"Ms. Sandri took a thoughtful, considerate approach to this problem and it worked!  People are frightened - whether those fears are real or not is not the issue - what IS the issue is finding ways to alleviate those fears and get as many of us vaccinated as possible.  Well done Ms. Sandri!  Well done everyone of the workers at the nursing home who have taken the vaccine and are now in a better position to protect those they serve as well as themselves and their families."
2021-03-29 14:33,"Physician here.

This whole last year and our collective failures have shocked and dismayed me.  The rationality and the general scientific knowledge in this country are much lower than I thought they were.

I don't understand the mentality of a huge number of my countrymen. They just don't seem to get basic things. And I myself did not know how little they know, which is a huge flaw in my understanding of social reality in this country.  It has caused some major rethinking."
2021-03-29 14:48,"Holding the hands of hundreds of thousands of people until they agree to a vaccination isn't viable. This will drag on forever if everyone has to treat trained medical staff like children, whispering encouragement and showing Tyler Perry videos. Not sure how the human race has lasted this long."
2021-03-29 14:40,"No shot, no job. ESPECIALLY for those who care for the most vulnerable."
2021-03-29 13:48,"Why is this even a question?  You don’t want the vaccine fair enough, but find another line of work. If you don’t have the vaccine you’re endangering those whom you “care” for, those who you work with...  Do those who you “care” for have a choice or voice in this matter?  I sure don’t want workers with these selfish attitudes towards a life and death situation anywhere Near my Grandma."
2021-03-29 13:42,"Here is what may be the final solution to vaccine hesitancy:

Israel already is opening many public facilities (restaurants, bars, sports arenas, theaters) to vaccinated people only.  That is, people with a ""green card"", which is a vaccination passport.  

And there is much more:

•	The EU is working on a vaccine passport.  
•	Rutgers and Notre Dame are requiring students who attend the fall 2021 semester to be vaccinated.
•	 In the UK, the mantra is ""No jab, no job"".  
•	Also, in the UK, there is a proposal to make vaccination a requirement to enter a pub.
•	A growing number of US companies — from cruise lines to sports teams — saying they will require proof of vaccination before opening their doors again.

Vaccination passports aren't new.  They have been around for decades for international travelers. Humanity has long abhorred infectious persons.  That's why there were leper colonies.  That fear hasn't gone away.

These people simply reject basic hygiene both where it affects themselves and others.
The anti-vaxxers and non-mask wearers will soon be shunned and restricted as people respond to the primordial impulse to avoid the unsanitary and the diseased."
2021-03-29 14:51,"The key issue here regarding the ability to insist on staff vaccination is the emergency authorization status of the vaccine. 

Even the Department of Defense had a law passed against it in 2004 making it no longer possible for them to order vaccinations of emergently authorized vaccines. (See the Anthrax example.) Up to one third of military folks are not vaccinated, which actually affects mission readiness.

In medicine, the calculation used to determine advisability of medical decisions is the “risk to benefit” ratio. COVID’s risks to both individuals and society at large are so extreme that somewhat radical medical decision making has been forced, ie the rapid deployment of a vaccine not yet completely vetted according to usual FDA standards.

Even so, based on the avlbl information so far, the decision to vaccinate continues to appear to be one of the most advisable routes to address COVID.

Gather your info, consult your medical team re: your individual risk, etc. But for the vast majority of us, getting vaccinated as quickly as possible and maintaining all the public health guidelines in the meantime, will be the only way out of this mess."
2021-03-29 14:34,"This will work. 
Get vaccinated or get fired."
2021-03-29 14:19,Why not just offer them all a raise if they get vaccinated.
2021-03-29 14:55,"If this is supposed to be a feel-good piece about the magic power of good managerial skills, it failed. What it showed is a dismal lack of education and willful ignorance on the part of people who are responsible for others' lives. Over 200 million people worldwide have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, 100 million in the U.S. alone. It is the single greatest public health triumph since the polio vaccine was approved.

Are these reluctant workers entitled to refuse vaccination? Of course. What they are not entitled to do is put vulnerable people at risk because of their obstinacy. As many other commentators have put it, no vaccination means no job. Good day."
2021-03-29 14:56,"For me, the decision to be vaccinated was simple: either get the shot along with a very, statistically, unlikely reaction or don't get the vaccination and very, statistically, likely get Covid. Along with Covid comes a possible death. The vaccination doesn't have any likely death component. But I can understand that many people don't think like I do. And they make decisions very much unlike I do. I wish the article had explored these in more detail. Very few people know exactly what's in a BigMac burger... but millions eat them anyway. 

My biggest take from this article is: I want the director of the nursing home I eventually enter (not for a good many years yet, please...) to be a clone of Tina Sandri. She sounds like a wonderful person."
2021-03-29 15:08,"Virtually everyone in the world born before 1980 was vaccinated against smallpox, and the disease has been eliminated as a threat to human welfare.  Of course viral diseases are not as easy to combat as bacterial diseases, but the fact remains that a very high percentage of parents in the industrialized world consent to vaccinate their children against  DPT.  Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have demonstrated 95% efficacy in preventing serious COVID infections and over 99.5% efficacy in preventing deaths caused by the disease.  The reluctance people to vaccinate against COVID-19 can only result from misinformation that circulates on unregulated social media.  It behooves federal and state governments to assure that correct information about the extraordinary efficacy of these vaccines circulates among the citizens of this country.  The quickest way to end the pandemic and return to normal activities is to assure that the the majority of us are vaccinated.  The same applies for all affected countries whether they're in North America, South America, Europe, Asia or Oceania."
2021-03-29 15:17,"I think I’m more shocked to learn that someone who works in a nursing home has never received a vaccination of any kind.  No polio, measles, mumps, chicken pox vaccines at all.  How is it even safe to have her in a patient contact role under any circumstances?  There are measles outbreaks on college campuses regularly, because some refuse vaccines.  This person and others like her put their whole community at risk. It never occurred to me this would even be possible when every school child is required to have these basic vaccines to attend school. If you are in a patient contact role I would expect them to be mandatory. Same with the COVID vaccine. People are put at risk by her refusal."
2021-03-29 15:19,"I truly appreciate the belief by this manager that people should not be bribed or coerced into taking the vaccine.  Everyone has their own reasons for taking/not taking it.  Fear, medical history, cultural perspective, rationality ... all play a part.  And our individual freedom to choose what happens to our bodies does not exclude the choice to take a vaccine.  So people have to be allowed to make that choice.

Ms. Sandri's method, while not bribing or forcing, was still coercive in my view.  It was still putting pressure on people.  It was not merely providing education or comfort ... it was focused action on the goal of meeting a 75% vaccination rate.   I'm not for that either.

I do feel judgey, however, of people who, while working with the population of people MOST VULNERABLE to the virus and to death by that virus, will not take the vaccine that could save lives of others.  I would expect these people to at least be required to step up the handwashing, wear fresh gowns daily, wear gloves, double masks, and take Covid tests as frequently as allowable as long as the Covid virus is with us.  Because it kills old people.  And they are working with old people."
2021-03-29 15:36,"I encountered this when, silly me, I assumed that all employees at my mom's nursing home would WANT to get vaccinated. But when talked to several of them, they said no,  they weren't getting it. My second assumption was that the home would REQUIRE them to be vaccinated. Again, no,

This second notion is countered by the idea that in a free country, personal freedom trumps everything. This idea seems quaint to me as one of the last men to be drafted. (Drafted to fight in a war I didn't believe in btw.) It also seems quaint to me as a school teacher at schools where state law requires all kids  get vaccinated before entering school.

I remember the terror of being informed of the spreading virus inside mom's home AFTER it had been locked down for several weeks. It could only have been coming in from the outside by the staff bringing it in.

So the freedom of nursing home staff to not be vaccinated should be respected - but they should also be given the freedom to look for anther job.

(My mother and I are now fully vaccinated and I hugged my mother for the first time since her nursing home locked down exactly one year and 11 days ago.)"
2021-03-29 15:44,"Employment is a choice and agreement between employer and employee. If a job requires travel, then fear of flying makes it impossible. A fireman has to risk his life, as does a cop. Vaccinations should be required for any front-line workers, esp in healthcare. A no brainer. Don't want to get vaccinated? Then stay home. Our public health depends on it."
2021-03-29 13:38,I hope that Ms Proctor was vaccinated for other preventable diseases before she started working at a nursing home.
2021-03-29 15:56,"My husband and I have both received 2 doses of the Moderna vaccine.  We are both grateful to have gotten it.  Even if we were to become infected with Covid the chances of either of us dying or even ending up in the hospital are pretty much nonexistent.  We are both seniors so that is really important to us.  My husband had no adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I developed ""Covid arm"" about 5 days after my first shot.  I checked online and found out that while it is uncommon it is nothing more than unpleasant for a short period of time.  The second shot caused a fever, a lot of aching and a nasty headache.  Antihistamines were helpful as was acetaminophen.  3 days later I was fine.  Would I do it again?  Oh yes I would because I don't want to die from Covid.  I don't want to risk infecting others.  And most of all I want to feel relatively safe again."
2021-03-29 16:13,"If nursing homes paid a living wage and offered basic benefits, there wouldn’t be such a staffing shortage that the  manager can’t risk losing any of the staff she has.  Also, staff wouldn’t have to work in multiple nursing homes to survive, which helped to spread the virus from facility to facility. 

These staff are people who are truly being taken advantage of, and it is entirely reasonable for them to mistrust those in authority."
2021-03-29 16:16,"Why are we surprised at vaccine resistance?  Illogical conditions do not beget logical responses. The nursing home industry is in crisis because it is a failed model for our seniors.  Its workers have poverty wages, massive turnover, abysmal training, and horrendous labor conditions.   COVID has exposed the fallacy of  choosing institutionalization over the more affordable age-at-home option.  Rationalize senior care, and you'll rationalize its workforce."
2021-03-29 16:16,"A nursing home works with some of the most vulnerable patients there are.  It is essential that the staff not infect the residents.   After explaining to the staff the reasons it is necessary, if there are still holdouts, the situation becomes simple.  ""You do not have to get vaccinated if you don't want to, but you cannot work here if you don't.  This is effective immediately."""
2021-03-29 16:22,"As an HR director during a pandemic time when employees stress, fears and worries can be amplified,  I applaud Sandri’s efforts. As this vaccine is new, I think winning people over with a customized approach expressing care & concern is the way to go. But I would create a new policy that anyone newly hired into direct patient care role be required to be vaccinated. WhenI pursued my graduate degree and wrote my thesis at a hospital, even though I had no patient interaction and was only there 6 weeks, I was required to get my vaccines updated.  For new staff, the Covid vaccine should be added to the list.  However since current staff didn’t sign 
on with this understanding, influencing & education campaign is warranted."

We can’t possibly hope to meaningfully address society’s myriad problems if we subscribe to the absurd notion that each opinion is as good as the next.  Our collective capacity for self-sabotage is endless if we fail to uphold standards that value expertise.  It’s well past time to put these know-nothings in the rearview mirror so we can move forward without them.  We don’t have time to coddle vaccine skeptics, conspiracy theorists, or any other ignorant group.  I can’t believe I or anyone else has to say any of this out loud."
2021-03-29 14:14,"The strategy of meeting people where they are and addressing their particular concerns (about anything contentious) seems like a good life strategy, too. 

There's a lot of disinformation being aggressively spread about Covid vaccinations by a handful of people on social media. Facebook, Twitter and Google need to de-platform those responsible for spreading idiocy and fear. They need to stop hiding behind their in-house rules about their 'community standards' violations. These people are a public health hazard."
2021-03-29 16:23,"It is so so simple:

530,000: Number Americans who have died from Covid-19

93 million: Number of vaccinated Americans

ZERO: Number who have died from Coronavirus vaccination

ZERO: Number of vaccinated Americans who have died from Covid-19

Joining the 93 million Americans is safe and will protect your life, the lives of those you love, and the lives of those around you. It is the safe choice for you and the loving choice for you to make for your families and your fellow Americans."
2021-03-29 14:52,"Someone reminded me of a quote by Maurice Hilleman (do a Wiki on him):  ""You should only vaccinate those you want to live.""  A banner with this across the front entrance might have helped too."

2021-03-29 14:20,"Ms Sandri’s approach — not wanting to bribe or threaten — but respecting each person’s dignity and autonomy, was laudable.

Meeting everyone where they were, from a decision perspective, is at the heart of “motivational enhancement”.

Great example of effective administration."

2021-03-29 15:11,"How is it that agreeing to be vaccinated, against the flu and all other communicable diseases, is not already a condition of employment in long term care, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, hospitals, with home care agencies, child care agencies, schools.....?  I don't get it."
2021-03-29 17:35,"Getting every citizen vaccinated now is a national priority.  President Biden has said it is everyone’s “patriotic duty.”  So, it is incumbent on each citizen to vaccinate.

Imagine if, in the early stages of World War II, a large percentage of citizens refused to follow government mandates to support the war effort.  

For example, people saying they would not ration basic goods such as food and gasoline.  How receptive would the government and the public have been to that notion back then?"
2021-03-29 17:41,"IMO everyone should have to get the vaccine unless there is a medical exception. Those are rare. 

No one working in a care home or medical care provider job should be allowed to say no and if they are one of the rare ones who cannot get a vaccine they will have to find a new trade to work at. This is not something that can be allowed to be decided on opinions and feelings. It is a matter of factual science that vaccines work and are necessary with this virus."
2021-03-29 16:20,"Care givers and healthcare workers not getting vaccinated is stupidity, ignorance and selfishness beyond belief. Period."
2021-03-29 18:14,The tenor of comments seems to be rather harsh toward the refusers. They don't appear to be part of the stupid Republican anti-vaxxer crowd but have been affected by the right-wing propaganda. More understanding from our side is in order. Everybody needs it for themselves and as their duty to others. Convincing them rather than ordering them as the article makes clear seems to be the way.
2021-03-29 19:40,"My first instinct was to think that these people should be told the facts and then the vaccine should just be mandatory. That their illogical beliefs are putting people in danger.

Then I realized that *my* feelings were trumping logic, and that this director took the right approach.

Feelings are not truth. But studies say that persuading someone by using logic or facts is highly ineffective when it comes to strongly held beliefs.

So let’s say I have two choices as the director here:
1. Use logic to persuade people and have fewer people get vaccinated voluntarily.
2. Listen to and empathize with peoples’ feelings to persuade people and have more people get vaccinated.

After the voluntary step, the next steps are things like:
- Forcing people to get it and lowering their morale
- Firing people and having too few employees, since the article says there is a labor shortage

So, logically, it was best for the facility to listen and appeal to the employees’ feelings. To give them some time. Because evidently it worked. Plus maybe there’s the side benefit that this successful vaccination makes these people more open to vaccines in the future.

The only counter-arguments I have are based in anger. In feelings. And that’s not logical either.

Now I think if there are still people in several months who refuse to be vaccinated, it would be worth doing a cost benefit as to whether it’s worth mandating it. And I think that would be totally valid.

But for now this seems to work."
2021-03-29 19:48,"While the effort is appreciated, why isn't one of the job requirements?"
2021-03-29 19:57,"As a former nursing facility employee and now a volunteer in one, I have been consistently struck by the low wages people in these essential roles are paid and how little they are respected, which many of the comments here reflect. Employees often feel disregarded by administrators. I applaud Ms. Sandri's approach, but I disagree that offering some incentive is bribery. I felt unwell after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, though I soon recovered. A paid day off would  be a little reward for all the hard work caregivers do, though most appropriate would be paying a living wage to people who do this difficult work."
2021-03-29 20:17,"I won't judge these people. I have friends and relatives who are aware that they shouldn't drink heavily, smoke, weigh twice what they should or otherwise damage their health due to impulses, apathy, false beliefs or whatever.  

Perhaps if they felt as valued on the job as those who work for Tina Sandri, and were approached with kindness and respect by their doctors, they'd do more to protect themselves from future harm."
2021-03-29 20:30,I mean if all the residents are vaccinated and supposedly can’t get Covid then why are staff pressured to get it?
2021-03-29 21:13,"Thank you for your leadership Tina!  So glad you refrained from patronizing approaches, such as bribes or threats, and relied on honest, individual effort.  It's somewhat reassuring to read about a leader that values individuals and addresses people as individuals versus tribal groups or marginalized victims.

Treat people as responsible adults, and they'll behave as such.  Treat them as victims, and, well, you have the new Democrat party."
2021-03-29 21:35,Brava for Ms. Sandro for your extra effort! I know you were only doing your job and the extra effort towards motivating your staff in getting vaccinated is proof every little bit helps in getting the US towards herd immunity.
2021-03-29 21:58,I am ecstatic and grateful fir being vaccinated. I'm not going to die now and I'm not endangering others. My family is together again in person. Side effects from the shots were minor and went away quickly.
2021-03-29 23:04,I think the vaccine should be required for continued employment.  (The nursing assistants who were caring for my folks said they were required to get annual flu shots by their employers -- and that was some years ago.)
2021-03-30 0:12,"Have any of the commenters here actually worked as nursing assistance in nursing homes?  
You are quite delusional if you think there is any feel good stories for the people doing this job.
It is hard physical work, can be rather gross and sad. Raise your hand the last time you changed and adults poopy diaper.   These people are ALL underpaid...fire them! Sure that will fix it.
 Or how about paying them a living wage with benefits. Provide educational opportunities. Give them a vacation. After all they are caring for YOUR dearly beloved family members'

Nursing homes in this country are money making machines.  Profit driven. Wake Up.  Act UP.
All the Top administrators in this business care about is money.  
All the practice administrators, directors of nursing ect. care about is having enough staff.
 After 40 years as a Registered Nurse in a hospital setting I have great empathy for caregivers working in Nursing home.  I wouldn't  do that  work for my wages
God Bless and Help those CNA's."
2021-03-30 0:51,"I don't understand why the people working in health care, retirement facilities are so adamant about not getting the vaccine.  To me, there is a simple solution - No vaccine no job.  They are putting the lives of everyone in that facility at risk of getting the Covid-19."
2021-03-30 0:58,"My cousin is a highly educated, not a person of color, multi-decade medical professional of probably 40 years now. In imaging and MRI. Been a tech and a supervisor both through course of her career. 

For the past several years, her hospital has mandated she get the flu vaccine each year, and she bitterly resents it.

The same mandate has not -- and likely will not? -- occur for CoVid vaccine, due to the newness of it all, and indeed, while in the first tier of eligibility to receive the shot, she declined then and continues to say no. 

She's very smart woman, and it's a often more than a little baffling. We're very close cousins, more like sisters, Love her to pieces, and she knows we diverge on many things, including this ... she even said right upfront, 'if I could give  you my slot/shot, I would.' 

One of her issues is, as she has explained it to me, in a Tier1 trauma hospital, she sees or hears about all the worst cases. All the bad reactions to shots, they come through her institution. It has instilled this very real distaste for vaccines over time. So, on one hand, I get that. 

But on the other, you know, science. Statistics. Death. Disability. From CoVid. All that ignored. 

At another very large hospital nearby, up to 40% of the RN staff and multitudes of doctors -- also NOT taking the vaccine. 

So this seems pervasive in healthcare, at all skill levels. Not just elder care, and not just people of color. 

How we get herd immunity at this rate, a battle."
2021-03-30 1:28,"Taking the time to sit down and have a personal discussion with employees -- WHAT a novel idea.

Good grief -- how far are we into email and texting that we don't remember how to just talk to people."
2021-03-30 2:10,"What is wrong with the US educational system?  Even low level employees should have taken enough science courses before they leave school that they can understand the history and success of vaccines.  Lifespans have increased…until now, when people believe conspiracy theories, not science.  It's very upsetting."
2021-03-30 3:04,"I'm very impressed with Ms. Sandri's efforts to persuade her staff to get vaccinated. She sounds like a stellar leader. This article gives me some useful ideas on how to approach my 62-year-old brother, who is refusing to get vaccinated. Thank you."
2021-03-30 1:06,"Let's see- Over 200 years ago George Washington required the Continental Army to get vaccinated against smallpox, and that was a far cruder and much riskier procedure than today's vaccines. Allowing anyone, absent a compelling medical excuse, to abstain is nothing more than playing to, and reinforcing ignorance."
2021-03-30 13:36,It is inconceivable that any nursing would continue to employ anyone who refuses vaccination.
2021-03-30 14:12,"They should be fired.  If they don't want to get the vaccine that's their decision, but they should not be employed to care for the elderly and infirmed in the middle of a pandemic that's killed 500,000+ Americans.  

""Let them move at their own pace"" is grossly negligent while they risk the lives of the people they've been entrusted in their care.  Do we let school bus driver's learn to drive at their own pace while on the job? 

I don't care if there's a labor shortage, offer more pay and you'll get plenty of workers. 

I hope the residents were informed of the percentage of staffers who had refused to get vaccinated.  I hope they were allowed to refuse care from those that refused to think of them.  And I hope everyone involved knew that management had consciously and willfully chosen to allow them to continue instead of having to pay a little more to find qualified workers."
2021-03-30 14:26,"What a strange piece. 
If someone has been working FOR A YEAR IN PERSON and has not gotten sick (or, of course, died) and doesn't want to take a vaccine, why make them? This seems like a coercive and bullying workplace culture, not something that out to be the subject of a hagiography. 
What's more, in objective journalism, we include voices of the other side. Are there any doctors or experts who believe, like Ms. Proctor, that young people are not at risk from the virus and do not need to be vaccinated to lower their risk of getting seriously sick, or the risk of the VACCINATED elderly residents. The answer to that is yes, but the voices aren't here."
2021-03-30 14:27,"""nearly half its 200 staff members declined."".....Getting vaccinated should a condition of employment in a nursing home. period. If you don't want to get vaccinated, that is your choice, but you shouldn't be allowed to work in a nursing home.."

2021-03-30 15:36,"My dear parents, in their 90s and in frail health, have been quarantined in their tiny assisted living ""apartment"" for the last year.  No visitors, no ventures even into the hall.  They pay several thousand dollars a month to be there, as they can't safely live on their own.  When the vaccine became available, they rejoiced and got it.  Their facility is now relaxing restrictions and allowing residents to leave their rooms and take meals in the communal dining room.  So you can imagine how stunned I was to learn that the facility encourages, but does not require, all direct care staff to be vaccinated.  Mind you, new residents are coming in, and they are not required to be vaccinated, either.  The staff go about the community, often without masks, and many have second jobs in restaurants, bars and stores.  I expressed my outrage to the facility administrator, reminding her that residents are paying dearly for care that is expected to promote their health and well-being.  Allowing these most vulnerable citizens to be--needlessly--exposed to this virus is unconscionable, in my opinion.  Residents don't know which staff (or other residents) have refused vaccination, so they have no hope of avoiding these Typhoid Marys.  I say require the staff and incoming residents to be vaccinated.  Bribe them if necessary.  Those who refuse should be transferred to grounds keeping or administration.  They chose to work in healthcare, for heaven sake."
2021-03-30 15:42,"A few of the office staff at my kids' school recently shared with me that they declined the district's offer of a vaccine. They also said their own kids were at home, since they don't trust the safety of in-person learning. So, while the largely affluent, white population of this town takes advantage of in-person learning and the wide availability of vaccines, many of our recent immigrant neighbors are doubling down on isolating their kids and working frontline jobs without the protection of being vaccinated. It's a really heartbreaking puzzle. We can legally require anyone in a car to wear a seatbelt, but we can't legally require a vaccination during a global pandemic."
2021-03-30 15:53,"Management's push to vaccinate their staff has to succeed in order fir them to fulfill their obligation to their residents/patients and their staff, but the bottom line is always money.
  Its refreshing to see the lengths attempted here, I hope their staff appreciates the effort.

   If healthcare workers, and/or administration cannot be persuaded of their ethical duty to their fellow man and/or their patients this lack will only serve to ask the obvious- where do their obligations lie in their employment?
 However the overwhelming nursing home deaths of the last year has made us all aware this aspect of fulfilling good management is not common practice."
2021-03-30 15:55,"I hope they get the balance of their staff vaccinated to 100% of all of those that CAN be vaccinate. If anyone has medical condition that absolutely prevent them from getting vaccinated then the rest can be motivated to get vaccinated from them if not for themselves, giving them the gift of Herd Immunity."
2021-03-30 16:06,"Instead of Tyler Perry, the continuous loop playing should be that of a person staggering, gasping, wide-eyed with fear, in a cold sweat.  Next scene: a closeup of that person being intubated.  And repeat."
2021-03-30 16:47,"The very same people who refuse vaccination because they don't know what the vaccine is made off are mostly the ones who consume all kinds of harmful chemicals eating hot dogs, hamburgers, and other commercial mysterious fast foods.  They too drive cars without knowing what is under the hood. 

Fear is an irrational thing, but it could be confronted by giving example after example, whereby people, like their own patients, didn't die after being vaccinated.  Had the vaccine not come into existence, they most likely would have died.  If I were a resident of that facility, I would refuse to be taken care of by someone who is not inoculated.  If enough of the residents refused care, pretty soon the matter would be resolved: staff would either get vaccinated or be dismissed.  Liability is a big issue for the institution.  Residents would win."
2021-03-30 14:13,"I cannot understand why any adult would want to remain unvaccinated. We may eventually reach a point where if you remain unvaccinated you will not be able to visit a person in hospital or nursing home, fly on a commercial plane, swim in a public pool, go on a cruise or visit a foreign country. Why would anyone want to limit their lives this way? There are so many misconceptions about the vaccines floating around and it's time churches and other social groups started debunking the crazy myths. One of my mother's friends actually told me the vaccines were made from placenta fluid!    My response was  to ask what difference did that make - she thinks it's sinful!"
2021-03-30 15:19,"A friend of mine just pulled her father from a nursing home in New York City because there was a COVID outbreak. Nearly all the residents were vaccinated, many employees weren't, and they hadn't begun visitation again. 

So I wonder how COVID got in there.

The outbreak was mostly among employees."
2021-03-30 15:28,"We humans are interesting creatures. We know that hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from Covid-19, and millions around the world, but we focus on “somebody said” that a person got sick after their vaccination. We listen to “you don’t know what’s in the vaccine” even though we do know exactly what’s in them. 

My 93-years old mom, who lives alone an airplane trip away, was reluctant to get her shots. But my sisters and I told her that we just couldn’t visit her until she did, because none of us wanted to be responsible for killing her. But we all got our vaccinations and then she got hers. Our mom now has one of her children visiting her after a full year of separation from us. And my other sister will be with mom next month, and then me. We are so lucky to be able to be together again. We are so lucky to be among those who still have aged parents. Many people don’t. 

Yes, we humans are mysterious. You would think that we would look forward to joyous occasions, but, too often, we get turned away by our fears."

If THEY want to get sick and/or die, slo be it, but do not wantonly spread Covid to your vulnerable nursing home patients under any circumstances. Were I running this ""home"", and had I encountered a staff like that, I would have explained to them ONCE why it is necessary and, iff they refused, shown them the door immediately. There are many our there who, given then opportunity to be vaccinated, would have jumped at the chance to take their places.

How many of them get their false information from Trump and his fake news media?

And they’d certainly be fired if they said, “Nah, I just don’t feel comfortable wearing gloves when handling bloody tissues.” 

Personally, I think they should be fired or re-assigned if they won’t be vaccinated. And told, “When your knowledge and your feelings catch up with the rest of the world, and you are ready to be vaccinated, come on back.”"

In my small office at a large institution, the feelings are split: some of us are happy to trade private offices for no commute (and the resulting savings) while others, particularly the boss, relish the perceived legitimization that comes with dedicated space. There is much more than functionality to office space.

Lesser staff will work off-site with reduced pay, hours, loss of benefits, and no opportunity to further oneself.  I’ve actually seen this happen over the past year. 
Contrary to the odious boss who keeps everyone chained to the office what we might get is the odious boss who keeps a precious few close with an eye to slashing staff as automation creeps in."
2021-03-30 13:46,"My company already has many of these features due to the fact that we work with a lot of overseas team members. So our conference rooms have camera systems and big screens, but it never really worked as well as we would like, and it was always difficult to book a room because there are many more teams than rooms. Working from home has been much more productive, but a hybrid model would be a disaster in our case."
2021-03-30 13:50,Most people who are cheerleading for working from home now vs. the office as we knew it will eventually burn-out of working in the same place they eat and sleep. This is the problem with so many people not setting boundaries in their work/life balance.
2021-03-30 13:52,This just seems so terribly shortsighted; we will not be in this pandemic forever so all of the mitigation won’t be needed forever. Why throw  every way of our old way of life out? Why?? How is all of this necessary?
2021-03-30 14:13,"In this case, I believe, capitalistic & profit motives will end up doing the right thing for *wait for it*... employees. Here is how:

1. An old fashioned employer cajoles employees into coming to work in a hybrid model.

2. On the first day of back to office, the employee endures two hours of commute, loss of flexibility and having to deal with random people looking for 'serendipitous' moments. 

3. Employee with a few neurons left asks employer to go to office one day a week or full remote.

4. Bad employer denies request of (3). The employee goes to another company and the old fashioned employer is put at a competitive disadvantage for loss / lack of talent.

5. Good employer accepts request of (3) and they live happily ever after."
2021-03-30 14:58,"Open office plans are terrible. Even a cubicle farm is an improvement. Having your own office is best.

""Hot desking"" is terrible.

Working from home is no good. If you want me to work from home, then you can pay for:
- part of my internet bill, 
- part of my electric bill,
- a desk,
- a chair,
- a second (or third) monitor,
- a keyboard,
- a printer
- a scanner
- and... a stipend so that I can get a place with two additional bedrooms that can be used as a ""home office.""

I have access to all of those things in the office. I do not have those at home. If these companies are going to save so much money from real estate, then they can help their employees get what they need to work from home.

Let's not forget all of the things that are lost through in-person interactions. Especially when you bring on new hires."
2021-03-30 14:59,"So, just so we're clear, companies are going to be transferring the costs of office space to the employee."
2021-03-30 15:00,"Early in my career I had an experience with 'Hot Desks.""  What I found was that if a work place is shared, then no one is responsible for it.

2021-03-30 15:07,"Where I work, our HR team is telling us that we will take a hybrid approach, and that if people want to work remotely they will have to apply and meet certain (as yet un-named) criteria. 

Needless to say employees are incredulous and are probably weighing their options, given that we have been remote for a year and delivered record performance. Why is social control so important? 

The employers are definitely attempting to define the future of work without realizing it has already been decided for them."
2021-03-30 15:17,"What's really needed is no worker's rights at all: a worker with an expectation of work, at the same company, for more than today, is a liability waiting to happen. Much better to have all of your workforce/online/gig workers, who can do the job for a bowl of soup. The best scenario: workers go to schools for $100k for a 4 yr degree, the institution owned by a subsidiary of the gig work they will do for the same company. If for any reason there is profit to be made in laying them off, outsourcing their job to a subcontractor, or finding a way to bump the stock price through ""streamlining"" regulations, do it. Ideally, no HR department, no Regional managers, no one working for the company who gets paid in anything other than daily wages. Privately held, the CEO picks the board. Paradise."
2021-03-30 15:24,"One challenge is that existing ""remote work"" tools (like Zoom, Webex, etc.) are not sufficiently seamless and high performance.  Get 20 people in a meeting and there will be a succession of little problems. Not to mention that even with a big monitor, it's not the same as sitting a room, with respect to body language, the ability to lean over to the person next to you, etc.  This is fixable, although there doesn't appear to be any mid-scale products (Cisco and others have very high end products).

Similarly, consider the non-scheduled, ""have you got a minute to look at this on my whiteboard?"" kind of interaction.  Yes, there are shared whiteboard apps, but they are complex and expensive.

The other challenge is that there are jobs that need those shelves and filing cabinets. I work with spacecraft - you're often working with documentation that is 20-30 years old, from companies that no longer exist, much less have their old catalogs on line.

There are, too, still jobs that require touch labor. But there's also a lack of casual in-person assistance.  Someone doing research with a breadboard on the bench encounters a problem.  In the past, you could go down the hall and get someone to come look at it, make some suggestions, and 5 minutes later, you're back working on it.  Now, you'd schedule a meeting, they'd come into work (tomorrow?), etc.   Sure, you could do some fancy remote access, but as noted before, zoom and its ilk don't really support this."
2021-03-30 15:30,"The Work from Home Genie is out of the bottle and there is no putting it back.

We were always headed here. COVID just made it happen in 12 months time instead of a decade or more. 

Between convivence for the workers and tremendous savings for the employers there are just too many factors in the ""Win"" column to see Office Jobs return to the Pre Covid way of doing business. 

And as a wonderful bonus Remote Work is as Green as it gets. Eliminating daily commute and rush hour does more to solve pollution and conserve energy than anything else we could dream up that is remotely feasible in the here and now."

Just as it was hard to imagine what it would be like over the past year, so it's hard to imagine what will emerge one year hence.

Yeah, we were supposed to do this during the pandemic but why continue with this when the pandemic is over?
 
When I was working, besides my lovely colleagues, my office was my sole refuge. I can't imagine going to work in a place where I was only hotelling. I did it when I was young, and I hated it. 

I'm so glad to be out of the workplace."
2021-03-30 16:29,"Those phone call booths lack ventilation (since being sound-proof means they close up tightly). Those were the thing that caused the most concern in my office, which has long used hot-desking and most staff work from home a few days per week.

Lost in all this conversation is that many people do not live in homes with a private space conducive to work. Companies are outsourcing the cost of office space onto their staff."
2021-03-30 16:30,"This won’t age well. In a push to save money, large corporates are pushing reduced real estate footprints without first resolving the cultural problem. Hot desking doesn’t work long term and neither do wide open floor plans for anyone who needs either privacy or quiet. And the tech is better but not there yet. We aren’t yet living on the Enterprise in Star Trek and nobody is being beamed up by Scotty. On the other hand, there are huge inefficiencies in daily commutes and employers will provide accommodations for flexibility going forward. By in large when you see these posts, employees want their pound of flesh and employers want employees back in the office. Both are going to happen. But nobody is going to be a net “winner” in that struggle. Employers won’t have office lease savings. Employees will have to pay for larger homes w office space and won’t be paid more for that. Employees will work from home one to two days a week but expect to be available 24/7 now. Employers will lose some oversight of employees with more chaos and absenteeism literally and figuratively. Nobody will win and nobody will lose. It will just be different."
2021-03-30 15:07,"This is so horrible. Seeing that ""hot desk"" photo is incredibly anxiety inducing. Having one's personal space at work - the place we spending more time awake than anywhere else in our lives - is incredibly important. This alternative (solely to - let's be clear - save employers money, since study after study have shown open and shared office environments are worse for productivity and employee happiness) is alienating, impractical, frustrating - how have we still not put these office designs to bed in the wake of a pandemic?

I have been looking forward for months to getting back to my private office at work, and I continue to."
2021-03-30 13:41,"My workplace is now beginning the conversation around what they're calling their ""Flex"" (capital F, yes) policy.  I sure as heck hope that old thinking doesn't ruin it.  75%+ of the work can be done entirely remotely, as demonstrated by the events of the past year, but a handful are so anxious to come back to the office and no doubt will want to drag along the unwilling or unable."
2021-03-30 16:47,"As there is a desire to make the online face to face experience, the hologram is trotted out as a solution. A much easier solution is a 3D tv with a 3D camera at each end. 

A different question is whether an employee can properly (IRS) declare a home office."
2021-03-30 16:51,"The key thing here is that employers, regardless of size, have moved to a mindset where employees can be located anywhere - globally. 

Suddenly, one will compete even more with skilled workers in lower (not the lowest) cost countries. In the IT domain, places like Ukraine, Poland, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay will increasingly augment high cost talent in the US. 

Forget about jobs going to India/China...those are long gone and are not coming back. This is the next wave that will accelerate thanks to this new 'remote' work."
2021-03-30 16:58,"As technology ‘stretches’ the office environment to include remote working, hot desks, social distancing and improved HVAC filtering, I would also expect that common illnesses like the flu and common cold would dissipate too.

I guess necessity is in fact the mother of invention."
2021-03-30 17:27,"I am likely in the minority here, but I miss my roughly 40 minute one-way commute. It was a transition period between home and work, and vice versa, during which I could mentally and emotionally prepare or detach myself from either. Or, ideally, to just enjoy the scenery. Now, from waking to bedtime, it's non-stop stimulation and the need (expectation) to be always available. Living at work, literally, is not an ideal future for any of us."
2021-03-30 17:38,"I retired 13 years ago at age 55. If I could have worked from home ( an option that was being gingerly explored at the time) I would have stayed. My job required a telephone, a desk top computer and a coffee pot and a flat surface to hold it all. 

The only  in person or group activities were meetings for updates and trainings. But, given the past year, we have learned that even those can be successful completed from home.

The company is now 100% operating from home with a skeleton staff, safely distanced, going into the office. Given the opportunity I would return to work in a minute...from home. No 1 hour commute each way, more time to work!!"
2021-03-30 17:55,"""Workers have often resisted the loss of their personal desks when companies sought to reduce their real estate footprint, but they may be more amenable to the idea now if the payoff is the ability to skip the commute and work from home.""

Perhaps newer, more naive employees will buy into this narrative, but I don't buy it. Employers are using this as a way to cut down on office footprint.

Here is how this will shake out. First, they take away your cube/office, and justify it by saying you can work from home most days. A few months later, your boss (who got to keep her office) will decide that ""we are just more efficient in the office"" and will force you to start coming in 100% of the time.

I've seen it too many times in my own career. Employers take away perks by offering a carrot in return. Then, they take away the carrot."
2021-03-30 18:18,"People most afraid of the new emerging work from home, and partial work from home, paradigm shift in  work environments are middle managers. Their jobs revolved around direct supervision of persons ""reporting to them""  and maintaining the appearance of a productive and active work environment. 

So, while companies adopt some of the efficiencies brought by the risk mitigation requirements of the pandemic there may be a streamlining of managerial responsibilities, resulting in the need for fewer supervisors, or the growth of ""working supervisor"" roles. 

In my old company, where I worked on a team of 10 people, in the office, our supervisor was always a promoted former line staff employee who basically gathered up totals of our monthly productivity, wrote a report, approved settlement dollar amounts if in excess of someones authority, held person to person meetings in her office when problems arose and made coffee. No reason why that person could not get her hands dirty at the same time other than some deeply embedded and largely wasteful   corporate practices based ion outmoded beliefs. But, with the pandemic everything appears to be on the table for discussion."
2021-03-30 18:26,"The company i worked for went in for ""collaborative"" workspaces big time a couple of years ago. They reconfigured whole floors to a series of open desks where employees had a six inch separator on their portion between them, people on either side and people in front of them. No place to put your stuff, they had lockers. Other areas they lowered the sides of cubes to encourage more ""collaboration"".
Most people hated it, but that did not faze our management. In retrospect, it stands out as the most costly office philosophy fad they ever bought into though. You couldn't design work areas to make employees more vulnerable to transmissable diseases."
2021-03-30 18:27,"I have a question for NYT readers about the collision of Hybrid Workplaces vs. Race to Net Zero carbon in buildings.  

Q: If you could save money and help reduce CO2e in your home office, would be willing to have your WFM energy use metered and tracked?  

This would involve ONLY electricity consumption data at specific sockets or equipment, no metadata or other info with privacy concerns would be shared without your explicit authorization. You would be able to monitor your own WFM energy info via a smartphone app.    
  
FACT:  The workspace electronics, task lights, and other things we plug at our desks and common areas is approximately 40% of the total energy consumed in the typical office building. Experts estimate that 50% of that (i.e. 20% of total energy used) is WASTED. Unnecessary. Non-productive. Money down the drain. 

Hybrid Workplaces will be a choice; certain benefits & costs accrue to employee or employer, which from the comments to this Square Feet article clearly need to be worked out.  ""Race to Net Zero"" is a corporate ESG strategy to decarbonize building operations, increase energy efficiency and integrate renewable energy . . . efforts which are rapidly shifting from nice to necessity as municipalities mandate CO2e reductions by 2030."
2021-03-30 18:27,"Been there. Done that. I've worked in all kinds of offices -- open-plans, cubicles, closed doors -- and one spacious corner office.

Eventually, the surrounding noises and cross-talking in the open office lead you to a conference room, or phone booth -- or someplace -- to conduct one-on-one phone conversations with customers or clients, or people you're interviewing.

So, hybrid offices, which offer a variety of work ""spaces"" within the office are needed -- adapting to the work that's being done."

Inevitably, I have to get IT/AV to fix whatever egregious thing the last instructor did to the technology to get it to work for my class. Quite often someone made off with an important cord - I'm sure because they didn't know better. The same is true for conference rooms. The times when everything works the way it is supposed to without IT/AV intervention are rare. I imagine that will be the same scenario for hot desks."
2021-03-30 19:17,"I still don't get it:  what's the advantage of commuting all the way into an office -- however beautifully furnished with all the nice amenities -- only to sit in on video Zoom meetings with remote teams all day?

In my mind, the only real and compelling reason for an office is when the most interesting, dynamic and experienced mentors in the company hang out there.   It's about being in proximity with the best people, not about meetings or sitting at your desk reading email.  

Think of an office as a live event with an exciting keynote speaker where you get to ask questions and interact with some of the top minds available -- that's what I think an office should become post-pandemic."

2021-03-30 19:38,"From an industrial history perspective, the need for a ""white collar work factory"" has been going down precipitously with the availability of cheap computers & abundant Internet. 

The global COVID pandemic has merely highlighted & accelerated the obvious. Here is how:

1. First transformation was from agricultural to industrial society with workers having to go to factory as that is where the costly 'tools of production' was present.

2. The second transformation was from industrial to 'white collar' with mainframe kind of costly computers still needed workers to come to a 'factory'.

3. Since 1990's (PC era) the 'tools of production' for white collar work became very cheap. BUT the society did not change and we continued to have 'office towers' in downtown crammed with people staring at computers all day.

4. The COVID epidemic of 2020 has shown that people can just easily 'stare at computer' in the comfort of their homes and get ""intellectual"" work done just as well.

The ""remote work"" genie is now out of the bottle. The 'white collar work factory' will soon be a relic of the past. 

Prepare to witness the biggest social transformation and enjoy the ride."
2021-03-30 19:54,"Why the continued need to see everyone in person?  I really need quiet.  I work on platforms all day, I don't need to be in the office but if I am called in a desk in an open floor space just doesn't do it.  And no I don't want to stream music all day or wear noise cancelling headphones.  I'm home.  It's quiet.  I'm doing great work and I jump on and off video calls as needed.  Leaders need to learn to lead from remote locations."

I will feel uncomfortable with new neighbors every day and won't even know where my colleagues are sitting if I need to talk to them. yes I'm sure there is a digital map, yawn. I need my own space to be productive and I have this at home. I miss seeing people in the office but if what we have to come back to is zero personal space, no thank you. people make calls to their doctor in the hallway outside of the bathroom as it is because we have no acoustic privacy.

Many office workers, pre-COVID,  were not 'forced' to work at the office.  Rather, many wanted to work at the office.

Why can't we just let other people be?  Those who want to work from home can do so, and those who prefer to escape their homes for a bit...to engage with strangers on the street...on the subway....with fellow citizens...and to then work in a space that is specifically dedicated to work (with no distractions)...those who want that, will continue to be able to do so, as well."

OF course there will be skeptics, people who resist, and people who will think wistfully of the pre-covid reality (conjectured camaraderie and togetherness, over-wrought family-related metaphors).  But new ways of producing value, independent of physical location, will enrich everyone.  I have found very little evidence to suggest that all people, when at work, are working.  While there is strong link between physical presence and work (such as nurses), Dilbert and the Office tell us that much of the time spent at work is not working.

A third of the population, including so many of society's most productive, imaginative, and inventive workers require some sort of calm, private space to function at their best. A retreat from meetings and someplace where one can converse with others without feeling like being in a constant meeting.

Once again, the needs (i.e. immediate cost savings) of the employer are winning out versus human needs. I am glad to be out of it."

All adults and children who want the vaccine should get it (exactly like the flu shot -which we receive yearly). But especially for young kids this shot needs to be a choice for families for many years until its safety has been rigorously tested."

Assuming your survival rate of 99.997% for those under 20 years old is correct (I didn't check), for that age population of approximately 80,000,000 in the US, you're looking at 240,000 COVID deaths that can be prevented by an effective vaccine.

I get it, priority to older adults. But it’s practically APRIL and the first vaccine was rolled out in December. There has been plenty of time to do this testing before now.

Children are paying an enormous price and can’t return to normal life until they are vaccinated... move it!

Now parents have to decide if they risk their child’s health and health of others or allow them to be guinea pigs.  I am not sure if I would let my child be part of a test group, but I am grateful for those willing to overcome hesitation and enroll their children.  It seems like a King Solomon decision.

How come more people don't get this?  Perhaps it's human nature to ignore future consequences?  Human nature to assume 'it won't happen to me'?  This a virus we know very little about.  Long term problems are just coming to light (that's why they are called LONG term, they don't show up immediately!) 

Children are pushed into schools without the vaccine under the idea that the virus is basically ""harmless"" to children. Or now that grandma is vaccinated, it's fine for the child to contract Covid. They will bounce back. (until they don't)  Reckless and selfish behavior on behalf of adults.   

The FDA should fast track this vaccine.  I have full faith in the trials.  If the scientists say it's safe, it's safe. Get it done now."

The government is bad when it comes to systemic racism, systematically sterilizing men and women of color, testing HIV drugs on orphans (and lying about it) and the list goes on and on and now I’m supposed to trust the government and a company whose drugs have killed kids because they outright lied about double blind clinical trials.

2021-03-25 22:39,"Hard to blame India. India was one of the hardest Covid-hit states. The article states that India has exported more doses than given to its own people, and only 4% of the country's population has been vaccinated. The US has not exported ANY doses yet, despite 16% of the population vaccinated.  

Ultimately we'll need much of the world vaccinated to return to global normalcy, and overall manufacturing pace needs to be maintained and enhanced."
2021-03-25 22:23,India had helped the world with 60 million vaccines and used 50 millions at home. Other countries have been hoarding. It is correct for India to find a better balance for domestic needs and then help other countries. Let other countries first match up India's initial generosity.
2021-03-25 22:32,"Yes it was nice for India to donate doses but it was not smart. India needs to get on vaccinating their own, no country who can produce their shots should be sending it elsewhere. Some people here in the west have hard time understanding the fact that country's main responsibility is their own citizens first and foremost above all else. Poor countries will just need to wait, rich countries paid for the research with their tax dollars. Once we are done vaccinating our own than they can buy it no freebies."
2021-03-25 23:08,"The cases never went down..they were most likely simply under reported.. if one looks at the graph of India's cases, there is a curious steep decline from September onwards, a flat region and then suddenly an equally steep climb upwards.. most countries don't have this type of trajectory.. it is a more uniform grade either in up or down direction in most places and that is normally how pandemics play out in most places..

So this sudden climb begs more questions.. 
Hopefully the data coming out of there is clean and reliable."
2021-03-25 23:02,"The whole article is so biased .. India has exported more vaccines than any nation today and for some reason taking a pause on exports, while COVID is surging at home is shown as something sinister. 

No other country is exporting anything closer to India, actually, US as one of the largest producers of the COVID vaccine has exported ZERO vaccines till now (they just allocated some AstraZeneca stocks that they are not using to Mexico and Canda) 

Cmmon NYT.. give it a break."
2021-03-25 22:44,"Can't blame India for the difficult situation. India's needs are huge for a population 1.2+ billion. With Covid surging again, it has to prioritize its own people first. Indian companies producing other vaccines such as locally developed Covaxin and Russian Sputnik V should ramp their production to supply local population and export to others. COVAX program should accept both those vaccines given the dire needs all over the world."
2021-03-25 22:47,"NYT should give more credit to non-Western countries such as India, China and the UAE for offering vaccines to other developing countries. Most reports have framed vaccine donations from non-Western countries in terms of a “diplomacy win”, which seems a weird angle to come to mind before the humanitarian angle.

If these countries don’t export vaccines, news reports will frame it as deficiency/backwardness or even hoarding (especially in the case of China). As another comment says, we can’t really blame India."
2021-03-25 23:25,"The other day, I had a conversation with a fellow expat who rhetorically asked me, ""how does it make sense to save lives elsewhere, when your own are dying?"" Even the hardcore fans of Modi are not happy with some of his moves to share the vaccine.

This is a bad situation, one that will make most countries look selfish. The tone of some articles also will not help. India has shared a lot more than Europe or the US, as a percentage of what they have (as well as absolute number of vaccines). 

Yet, India has a responsibility toward others. I hope PM Modi does not lose sight of the fact that a high percentage of the worlds poor relies on India for their medicine. To abandon them would not be in sync with the principle of ""vasudeiva kutumbam"" (humanity as one family)."
2021-03-25 23:12,"Biden urgently needs to say how and when the US will start to contribute to vaccinate the world. Just blocking all exports, including key ingredients for other vaccine producing countries, and saying nothing about when the US intends to end this blockade is neither decent nor smart. If 200m Americans will be vaccinated in 100 days, 300m will be vaccinated in 150 days. That's more than all adults. And after that? Even poor Canada has to get every single shot from the EU that is starving for vaccines and dying. The US is still hoarding at least 26m doses of the Oxford vaccine that it will probably never use. Right now, ""America First"" cynicism continues."
2021-03-25 23:27,"I see nothing wrong with what India is doing and if anything it should be a model for poorer countries. India invested heavily in building infrastructure and human resources to manufacture drugs so they would not be dependent on donations. 

I don’t understand why NTY is so pro welfare, isn’t it better that India and other countries are self sufficient and have a government that invests in its own people."

Instead of waiting for a handout can't the world's scientists get together and help say, Africa to manufacture their own vaccine?"
2021-03-25 23:37,"Interesting how western media is always negative when reporting anything about India. 
India has exported more doses than it has given to its own citizens and redistributing it now to more of its citizens to get pandemic under control. What's wrong with this situation? 
Why don't the superpower USA donate some of its vaccine  to poor countries rather than hoarding the supplies including AstraZeneca vaccine? I think we desperately need to  earn some goodwill in the world rather than bombing poor and mostly brown skinned people."
2021-03-25 23:52,"What country is going to benefit the most from this development? Once again its going to be China. When it came to so-called vaccine diplomacy in the developing world, it has been a race between China, Russia, and India. The United States and its allies were counting on India to counter the Chinese vaccine diplomacy, especially in Southeast Asia. This is going to delay or even maybe cripple that effort."
2021-03-25 23:58,"I am a physician  and researcher who has been treating COVID for the last 14 months and has been in contact with on the ground doctors all over the world including India.The reality is that once COVID took hold in India there was no stopping it- 1.3 billion people in a area less than 1/3 the size of the US. 

Despite this India has developed ints own testing and own vaccine. Its mortality rate is not even in the top 15 and masks, though not worn as much as they should be, has not been politicized.  India has donated more vaccines to the developing world than any other country- not asking for anything in return. These are qualities that should be admired and not derided. Given the overall low mortality in India (<.1%) and likely herd immunity in many large cites, exporting the vaccine was not unreasonable. The only way we will get out of this is if we vaccinate everyone.

Contrast this to the US and Europe which has hoarded the vaccine, politicized masks (how many people shot for being asked to wear one), and not donated single dose to the poor in Africa or Latin America.  India ha done its service to the world- the US and NYT authors should ask if they have done theirs."
2021-03-26 0:04,"Balancing the supply chain of vaccines between the demand internal and the international  has been a herculean task.

India is now vaccinating more than 2 million people a day, soon to be ramped up to 5 million. NYT should find out which other country in the world has such a massive vaccination program before writing obviously biased articles."

2021-03-26 0:30,"So in the supercilious tone of NY Times , -- Mr Joe Biden, a  "" woke liberal "", has banned all vaccine exports of vaccines out of the United States, leaving long term allies and immediate neighbours like Canada and Mexico which have NO vaccine production capability in the lurch. Despite having signed contracts with Canada, Mr Joe Biden's export bans resulted in severe loss of credibility and resulted in reputation damage to Pfizer and Moderna. In addition to banning exports of vaccines, Mr Biden has banned the export of all precursor ingredients and chemicals that are required to make vaccines, directly affecting the vaccine manufacturing capacity abroad. However, despite US, UK exporting ZERO vaccines,  and the EU now clamping down on it's own exports, and the history of 70 countries receiving  vaccines from India, it is India that should be held responsible to supply vaccines at rock bottom prices to all countries in the world from North America , South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania, while NY Times and the west can pontificate and wring hands like the ""Prof Wouters of UK "" in this article, which is quite rich while he possibly got an Indian vaccine shot in the first place!"

Really? You are comparing a 66 million pop first-world country with that of 1.2 billion? Do they just forget that the vaccines literally got certified a few months ago? Can you imagine how many people India would have to vaccinate in a day if it were to do same % wise as much as US or Britain? I am all for accountability but come on do a fair comparison please. India is doing great vaccination-wise, considering its vast population, poverty levels and general misconceptions among people."

Vaccination that ultimately speeds world trade seems non-arguable.
However, sending off vaccines while local constituents are deemed secondary does, indeed, seem short-sighted.

2021-03-26 0:35,What the COVID pandemic shows in stark terms is that the “global economy” with its “supply chains” (boy do I resent that term!) and its climate destructive ways is sheer folly. I am glad to see that we are moving away from reliance on foreign countries half way around the globe. We should produce within our means sustainably and at home. And I am so glad to see that our vaccines are made in America. Global “just in time” production is the past and belongs to the dust bin of history. Resiliency and sustainability are the terms for the 21st century!
2021-03-26 0:47,"Another biased anti India article by the Nyt. India has donated and exported more vaccines than any other country, more than it has used to vaccinate people in India, while the US and Europe have not exported any.

Putting Europe into the same category as the UK, which has exported nothing, and the US, which has exported almost nothing, is highly misleading, to say the least. Europe has exported 77 Million doses to other nations, which is one reason (next to unmet promises by AstraZeneca) why its vaccination program is lagging others. So I can understand why India is addressing the crisis at home with priority now."
2021-03-26 1:04,"How dare an American publication make these claims, unlike India and Europe, the US is making ZERO contributions to helping the rest of the world. Time to block them out of the supply chains. Europe and India should block exports to The US and the UK immediately!"
2021-03-26 1:16,"I am not a fan of the Modi Government, but, I cannot see the scientific reason for India to not prioritize vaccination for its population. Due to rampant air pollution, respiratory health is poor in India. Further, genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease and poor sanitation conditions combined with a mostly blue collar based workforce make it such that the average Indian is at high risk for being infected with Covid and facing dire consequences if infected. 
Must I also remind the reader that India is the world's highest producer of genetic pharmaceuticals?"
2021-03-26 1:10,"India has performed extremely poorly under COVID. Millions of Indians got infected, thousands have died. Vast majority of both infections and deaths are underreported. GDP is down by double digits and unemployment has increased many folds. Recently, PEW reported that millions of Indians have fallen back into poverty. Currently, India is a human tragedy at a epic scale. To make matters even worse, Modi government in guise of COVID has unleashed multiple undemocratic laws that curtail the freedom of speech, freedom of press, and recently the freedom of Delhi government to govern itself. Indians farmers have been protesting for almost 6 months now for their rights. Indian labor organizations are doing the same. To sum it up, vaccinating 1.3 billion people is only a tip of the massive problems India is facing. Frankly speaking, good amount of these problems are self inflicted. I would recommend Indians to get rid of Modi and elect a sensible, pro-democracy and humane leader who can relate to the poor and middle-class of India and not just shamelessly pander to the corrupt capitalists."

Make up your mind; and could you place a check on your Orientalist dog whistles about nationalism, as if we aren’t seeing it here enough—earlier under Mr Trump and now under a Democrat administration. I’m thinking of cancelling my subscription for this Pavlovian India bashing, twinning reporting with presumed runaway religious nationalism in that country. I ain’t no supporter of nationalist governments anywhere, let alone in India, but I force myself every time to ask when I read articles with patronizing headlines, forced inferences—is this spite against one man, the Indian prime minister, or against the country?"
2021-03-26 1:12,"AstraZeneca licensed the Serum Institute because it could make enough vaccines for many countries.   I am surprised that wasn't mentioned in the article. This isn't India doing anyone any favours, it happens to be home to a private corporation teaming up with a vaccine research company to produce a vaccine on the condition that it makes it for everyone. Google it. Considering how much help India will need over the next few years due to climate change drought and refugees, they might want to think a bit more long term."
2021-03-26 1:48,Circle the wagons? Bonus points for using an expression offensive to American Indians in a story about India!
2021-03-26 2:15,"This issue is spreading: the EU and now India's policy prohibition of AstraZeneca vaccine to be sent out of country is only beginning stages of the nationalization of a countries' health manufacturing's deliveries. Though this vaccine was not developed in India, India can negate the promised delivery to outside its borders.  EU is slowing the delivery to a country (England) even though an English university was the partner with a Swedish lab to create the vaccine.  We saw this earlier in PPE that was created in China for American companies but the supply chain fell apart as there was few or none factories in the United Stated that could fulfill the sudden large demand.
It is a wake up call: manufacturing of critical items as well as the development of such, need to remain within a countries' borders.  Inexpensive costs versus timely delivery and control of one's research and development only looks good when there is no emergency.  However, an emergency is not the time to realize the lowest cost is not truly cost effective."

I see how it works."
2021-03-26 3:29,"The article is missing an important point. India started exporting initially because it (Serum Institute) was producing the vaccine at a much faster rate than the government could distribute within the country. Now that its vaccination infrastructure is better organized, the pace is picking up. 

As of today, the problem is not availability of the vaccine but access and also ‘hesitancy’ on the part of a certain segment of the population. But things are improving and more and more people are being vaccinated. 

Sure, there is a real second wave, but that cannot be linked to the speed of volume of vaccinations. Even the US, with such a tremendous pace, still has amongst the largest no. of daily new cases and deaths.

In such circumstances, it cannot be grudged that India is recalibrating its needs and restricting exports."

The US has exported no vaccines, but a limited amount vaccine components, although recently it announced its intention to loan 4 million doses to Mexico and Canada.

The EU has exported 77 million doses.

The UK has exported no vaccines, but the UK had a small vaccine manufacturing capacity prior to Covid focussed on producing flu vaccines. The manufacturing capacity has had to be built nearly from scratch. So far about 15 million doses have been manufactured compared to over 200 million in the EU and well over 100 million in the US."

This is the real motivation behind his export drive. 

Readers should be reminded of  two comments  made by Modi post 2002  killings of Muslims,

The key question is really what other nations have done in the past year to foster the pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities in their own region. It would be great if there are more alternative production centers distributed around the world.

They are morally, ethically obliged to and should be mandated to produce and supply to the entire world equitably. All political, diplomatic economic issues aside, this is a country which is providing a critical supply of vaccines to the entire world and giving hopes to billions others. Hopefully it also grossly shaming some others along the way."
2021-03-26 10:11,"Another article biased against India. A country trying its best to contain the COVID 19 pandemic with its own resources. After donating millions of doses to other countries,  India is criticized for trying to save Indian lives. Is this the new normal for honest journalism? I want to see balanced reporting with balanced heading/titles. Or, if that is too much, I will have to cancel my subscription"
2021-03-26 16:02,"If India is vaccinating its own population, then they are greedy.  They are not good citizens of the world.  If India donates vaccines to 80 other countries, it is a sinister design in global diplomacy trying to take advantage of the pandemic.  If India does not have enough vaccines for its own population, then it is Modi's lack of vision and leadership to not have anticipated the pandemic.  No matter what India does, NYTimes does not like it. #antiIndia #antiModi #biasedreporting #stopreadingNYTimes"
2021-03-26 7:49,"Dear NYT,
Biased much? How is it that you always manage to paint India in poor light? “People who live in glass houses should not throw stones”. Your own country is exporting almost nothing. Every country has the right to protect its people first and by the way the amount of generosity India has shown, is FAR more than any western country. Doing all of that while expecting in nothing in return."
2021-03-26 19:37,"Each and every country spends a major portion of its budget on its military, police and prisons. This includes all poor countries. They do this in the name of 'national security'.

What this pandemic has shown us is that every country needs to invest in manufacturing facilities for essential healthcare supplies like PPE, medicines and vaccines. They need to do this for the sake of their national security. If your plan is to rely on supplies from other countries, then be prepared to wait and watch your people die until those countries have first met their own needs.

When the next pandemic hits the world, all the bombs and guns in this world are going to do your country no good. But the ability to manufacture your own essential medical supplies can and will save the lives of your citizens."
2021-03-26 11:54,"We need to get any surplus vaccines to the countries with the more mobile populations and least able to afford them. It’s a simple math equation. If we don’t do this simple thing as quickly as we are able without slowing our own rollout, we are going to be fighting this thing and wearing masks forever."
2021-03-26 11:56,"Yes, when it happens it will be a problem. But a good one to have. And don't think that manufacturers won't be on to the next version of the vaccine - the variants are increasing and they will have to be matched. So the glut is temporary. 

In the meantime, PA is still in Phase 1A - you read that right, over 65 YO, or with medical conditions (and my asthma isn't one of them) only, and no dates for when over 50 will join the lines. So we, here in PA are not living the ""we are getting close to a glut"" yet, thank you. Let's talk about how only 14% of the nation has had both doses, shall we? And how inequitable the distribution and roll out has been. We have a long long way to go yet."
2021-03-26 12:01,"It’s time to allocate vaccine to primary care doctors.  The emphasis on mass vaccination centers, pharmacies and community-based facilities has largely been successful.  However, a significant number of people are not being reached by the existing logistics of vaccine distribution. The so-called ‘vaccine-hesitant’, the elderly and home bound, and those daunted by the process of making an appointment to receive a vaccine all are currently being missed. I suspect this represents a proportion of the population that may surprise officials. Since primary care physicians give the majority of childhood and adult vaccine in this country anyway, they are well-equipped to deliver shots into the arms of the most vulnerable patients.  Here in NYC, interested clinicians were vetted and approved in December, without yet receiving a single vial. Recent communication from the NYC DOHMH indicates their intention to start shipping next week."
2021-03-26 11:49,There is a legitimate argument that Operation Warp Speed is and was the single most successful and impactful government program ever.
2021-03-26 11:49,"Still cannot find any pharmacies, health department, hospital openings for vaccines in this area of SE Michigan. There is no glut of doses here! Since Michigan is now in a super surge, might make sense to direct some of this glut to the state? A few weeks of surplus sent here could possibly mitigate peak of this 4th surge and perhaps prevent some interstate spread."
2021-03-26 12:17,"Share. Help those less fortunate. The ability to continue mass production is established, share the extra and keep producing for backup. 
If there is suddenly a shortage it is a deliberate shortage by the pharmaceutical companies to decrease supply and raise the price.  Didn’t governments basically pick up the tab for development and then have to buy the vaccines?  
Whatever can be done to build bridges between countries instead of walls is desperately needed."
2021-03-26 12:26,What commenters are missing is that the glut isn't available yet.  We're still at a deficit but the government is looking at what supply will be vs demand 6 weeks in the future.  So we have a bit of a way to go before entering the surplus stage. But it is coming.
2021-03-26 12:26,Two thoughts- of course we should share but has there been a count of all the 15 year old kids who will soon be turning 16 making them eligible for vaccines?  Also has there been discussions about distribution of vaccine directly to college campuses to vaccinate all students and staff who might have struggled to get appointments ? Or even to other large employers to vaccinate employees on site? Easy access avoiding red tape of singing up may speed the process and require distribution direct to other places that have not been receiving them . Let States also maintain a stockpile . Clearly the country was completely unprepared for this we can’t let it happen again.
2021-03-26 12:32,"The risk in the immediate future of this pandemic is only slowly coming into focus.  As was mentioned in the article, there remain questions regarding the persistence and efficacy of the antibody response (against variants, etc.).  Also, there is no way that the US can donate our way out of the world's pandemic.  Does not mean the US should sit idle?  No way.  But it seems to make the most sense to license or somehow suspend patent rights and seed production of vaccine to other countries to bring the world out of this mess.  Teach other countries ""to fish.""  After all, doesn't our gov't hold the most important patents for MRNA vaccines?

Countries with no ability to manufacture should be the focus of the world's attention for donation."
2021-03-26 12:45,"It will be important to get extra doses to people living abroad once we have gotten people vaccinated, but we should remember that many people outside the US have visas to enter the country, are able to enter as desired from ‘visa waiver nations’, and there are also many people living abroad who are dual US citizens who come and go frequently. 

My point is that there is probably more covid vaccine tourism going on than we recognize, that is, people with the means to travel or family here will be coming to the US to get the covid vaccine.  Perhaps clinics in gateway cities like Miami or LA could set up package deals?  Yes, this sounds crassly commercial bit the reality is that it is already happening."
2021-03-26 12:55,"How quickly we forget. Is an over-abundance of vaccine really a ""dilemma""  when only a year ago development of any vaccine was not a certainty? An over-abundance of effective vaccines under these circumstances may be a challenge and an opportunity, it is hardly a dilemma."
2021-03-26 12:56,"Our domestic needs are not yet fulfilled. Until that happens we should be keeping our supply right here. Too many people are still having difficulty getting appointments for vaccination. And because it appears that younger segments of our population will soon be able to receive the vaccines, it is important to ensure an ample supply to meet that demand."
2021-03-26 13:00,"I just love all this talk of a vaccine glut.  Here in PA, we are still in Phase IA. While other states have dropped their age limit to 60, we have still yet to do that. No doubt it is the fear of being unable to meet the demand of moving the 60-65 age group into eligibility.  We are seeing no glut here, just continued scarcity."
2021-03-26 13:01,"I can’t get a vaccine and I’ve been searching. I might be able to get one in Ohio 85 miles away. 
I have no idea why you say there’s a surplus or there’s  going to be a surplus."
2021-03-26 13:06,"Imagine being 85 and having trouble signing up for an appointment online, or spending hours waiting on hold, only to be told there are no appointments available. The distribution of the vaccine has been yet another national embarrassment in the handling of the pandemic."
2021-03-26 13:24,We in the U.S. won’t be safe until the pandemic is ended all over the world. Ongoing infections abroad may lead to variants unaffected by our vaccine and infection induced immunity. Variants could be more infectious or cause more severe illness than what we have seen. These would be a plane trip away from anywhere.
2021-03-26 13:43,"Why is the abundance considered a 'dillema'?  Once we vaccinate our own citizens,  vaccinate countries most in-need.   The article mentions expiration dates and transport of the vaccines and such, but with a coordinated mobilization of our well funded military plus some diplomacy, couldn't these challenges be overcome?"
2021-03-26 13:46,"Those saying they’re eligible but unable to nab an appointment should consider that supply has improved but not yet become equal to demand. Shots therefore go to the most flexible, the most persistent and most tech literate. 

It’s not as if there are vials being discarded or unused."
2021-03-26 12:40,"Obviously, we should ""share the wealth"" with the rest of the world. 
Bottom line: It's the right thing, the noble thing, and in everyone's (the planet's) best interest."
2021-03-26 11:59,"The sooner we dispatch our excess doses to foreign ‘hotspots’, the more likely we are to prevent harmful mutations that will come to our shores.  It is in our own self-interest to be generous with our vaccines.  Just think of it as our generation’s Lend-Lease Program."
2021-03-26 12:34,"""No man is an island,
entire of itself;
every man is a piece of the continent,
a part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less,

Any man’s death diminishes me,

it tolls for thee.""
-  John Donne, 1623

Share the vaccines with the rest of humanity.

We are all interconnected, whether one wants to admit it or not.

...and it's the right thing to do."
2021-03-26 13:00,"A surplus is a good thing.  Until the world is vaccinated, the pandemic will continue.  Donate any surplus to Mexico, Canada, Central America.  Vaccinate anyone who travels to the US who is not vaccinated. 

A friend told us yesterday that she drove 3 hours (one way) to get vaccinated in Texas.  Impossible to get the vaccine in her city (Austin) because demand is high and grabbing an appointment means spending hours on line (and failing most of the time).  Drive to a deep ""Red"" county, and it's no problem.  She met a couple at the clinic who flew in from Oregon!"
2021-03-26 13:13,"This should be a no-brainer.  The pandemic won't end until the world is vaccinated.  To deny unused vaccine stock to countries desperate for vaccines is to guarantee that the virus will continue to spread, and to mutate.  Who knows if new variants from abroad, resistant to the existing vaccines, won't infect the US population, reigniting the pandemic here and once again shutting down the American economy?  It is in the nation's self-interest to share unused vaccine stocks with the rest of the world.  It is also the morally right thing to do."
2021-03-26 13:29,"I think the answer is in the story: “Biden administration officials who are inclined to hold on to the coming U.S. surplus point to unmet need and rising uncertainty: Children and adolescents are still unvaccinated, and no one is certain if or when immunity could wear off, which could require scores of millions of booster shots.”"
2021-03-26 13:39,"Once American adults have full access to the vaccine, hanging on to millions of doses  just in case there is another variant in the fall or winter makes little sense.  If the virus is allowed to rage through the rest of the world while the US sits on its stash, people will die needlessly and  more mutations will arise. The reserved vaccines may not even be effective against the new variants. Manufacturing is not going to stop so why not distribute the excess to the world when it is so desperately needed?

Trump is gone.  It's time for America to rejoin the world and be the leader that it once was."
2021-03-26 11:58,Donating to high risk populations in badly affected countries rather than sitting on the current stock of Astra Zeneca could have already saved more lives than the average military intervention of the US did cost. Also it would have benefited all by slowing down mutations. Shameful that the US in contrast to the EU follows a strict no-export regime (and adding insult to injury is gloating about it)
2021-03-26 12:38,"Canada desperately needs vaccine as it has no domestic production and has to rely on European imports.  It would benefit the USA to sell vaccines to Mexico and Canada, its two geographic neighbors, biggest trading partners, and friends."
2021-03-26 13:13,"You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.  Once everyone who wants to be vaccinated has gotten vaccinated, save a small supply for the kids about to turn 16 or 18, and ship the rest out to less fortunate countries where they will save lives.  If anti-vaxxers change their minds later, they can travel to Canada or Mexico and try to get one there."
2021-03-26 13:01,"This embarrassment of riches offers a unique opportunity - assist our first world allies and donate large amounts to the developing world. The latter is particularly important. If the pandemic has demonstrated one thing, it is that we as humans will live or die together. Poorer peoples are the key to the future. They and the decisions they make will be crucial to the protection of the planet and the survival of our species. Attention paid to their interests now will pay long term dividends when they are asked to ""pay-it-forward"" in the years to come."
2021-03-26 13:10,"I hate to see such vulgar language as ""glut"" plastered across headlines and used to describe the increase in vaccine supply, and feel discouraged that this is presented or viewed a ""problem."" There's an opportunity for optimism here, and setting a positive tone, at least temporarily. I'd like people to view any abundance in supply as a positive outcome for not only our country, but other countries that we could help. This is an international crisis, and I believe the Biden administration will act wisely regarding any extra vaccine."
2021-03-26 13:18,"My goodness! Cases and percent positives are creeping up! Let's get a handle on the U.S. first and then consider helping other countries. I would love it in my state if younger people could be eligible for the vaccine -- they are the ones spreading the virus for the most part. However, too many older people and people with health conditions still can't schedule a shot."
2021-03-26 12:16,"The federal government does is best, but I have the feeling by all this, that on the states level those governments are sometimes have not the right logistic teams to do the coordination and distribution of the vaccines! While some states where behind with this in the beginning of the year, they got better and speed up. Other states who started out great got their data mixed up can not reach people to get their second shots or had nearly a month without bigger vaccination numbers. We can do better! And we should really look at our local governments and judge them by their work! Because in such situations you can see if leaders are true leaders!"
2021-03-26 12:48,"Having a surplus of the vaccine is certainly better than not having enough to go around. Many people and many countries have been  frustrated trying to find where they can get vaccinated. If more Americans would realize the shots are a life saver and if we could share with countries who really need our help there won't be a stockpile. The president has been doing a wonderful job so far, i'm sure he'll figure this out quickly. Besides, this virus isn't going away anytime soon, as we can see from the charting of new cases  in the states where it seems to be getting worse. It's up to the American people to realize that a vaccine is necessary, so go get one."
2021-03-26 13:07,"Can't wait...Last week, there were appointments all over the place, but, this week, nothing, I mean nothing. I do understand that this roll out will be uneven, and, do know, and appreciate, we have a President who has made distribution a priority."
2021-03-26 13:18,"While this is a looming situation, and not a current issue, any close observer of the responses to the pandemic can see that these are huge, long term efforts which require massive planning to achieve success. 
So the United States' opportunity is to take our already purchased doses and give them away.... carefully. Could we not provide a massive infusion for the EU and earn huge political capital? Could we not carefully direct vaccines to stable countries in the ""third world"" who would honestly distribute it?  What about offering it to Iran?  Ask where we can build bridges, in the common effort to immunize the globe. The value of this in reminding the planet's population of the best of our country could be vast and timely."
2021-03-26 13:27,"A huge part of the problem (and the discussion generated by it) is the lack of transparency over who decides and how vaccine distribution is taking place - how much goes where, when.  Tell people.  And if there’s truly going to be “excess,” it’s a no brainer - justice dictates we start sending it to the hard hit lesser developed countries."
2021-03-26 13:28,"There are still many parts of the country where there’s still no way to get any vaccine.  Also, even scientists and public health officials don’t know how long the vaccines will last or what effect the variants will have on herd immunity.  Why are we talking about surplus and glut and giving away vaccine when inequality in healthcare for people suffering from this scourge and vaccine dissemination is glaring right here at home?  The United States has to learn to take care of its own kitchen before it tries to clean someone else’s.  No nation would be expected to act differently.   Biden has it right."
2021-03-26 13:36,This is a golden opportunity to cement our key alliances and push back on China’s global vaccine diplomacy with some of our own. I hope we use this opportunity to it’s fullest extent.
2021-03-26 12:38,"I'm no mathematician but it seems simple. 
Figure out what we need and sell what we don't need at cost or give it away fast. Lives are at stake. 
Many nations are suffering terribly with no hope of getting vaccines. We could fill their dire needs. 
I'm Catholic and in kindergarten, I can still hear Sister Vincent tell us kids about the the Golden Rule. 
When something came up, she would ask ""How would you want to be treated?"" 
It's not rocket science here. 
Just apply the Golden Rule. 
I know Sister Vincent would totally be on board with it and I sure am. 
Please, hoarding is a negative in any instance, especially now. Release the excess vaccine. 
Thank you for this article."
2021-03-26 12:39,"While the US and the UK have been keeping all the vaccines they produced to themselves, the EU has exported close to half its vaccine production to other countries (including, interestingly enough, a substantial quantity to the UK). This is why I get angry when I read (often enough in this very newspaper) how successful the vaccine roll-out in the US and the UK are, while the EU gets blamed for its difficulties. As it often happens in life, the EU gets blame for trying to be the good guy."
2021-03-26 12:51,"We should absolutely export them to our allies and countries resistant to or victims of the growing Chinese sphere of influence. 

The United States has a huge amount of goodwill to rebuild after the past four years - which we’re going to need very badly indeed, as the last administration was essentially correct in its evaluation of China."
2021-03-26 13:07,Everyone keeps forgetting this is a two step process. When is this over? (1) We first use the vaccine to reduce the rate of infection (2) so we can do the second step of quarantining the sick and people they may have infected to eradicate the disease in the United States. The fire is still burning until we've done the both steps.
2021-03-26 13:27,"It's time for the U.S. to engage in it's long-forgotten, especially under Trump, and engage in a new ""Good neighbor Policy"" and send teams of health professionals to Mexico and Central America to assist those nations in vaccinating their citizens. That could also be the first step in developing a regional immigration policy."
2021-03-26 13:39,"There are millions in my state (our 24-year old for one) who are eager to be vaccinated.  Let's get all states on board to take care of all willing citizens no matter what their ages.

I'm no scientist, but understand we won't be safer until the entire planet gets vaccinated.  Companies like UPS, FED-EX, and Amazon are always bragging about logistics.  Is the Government using their expertise to the fullest?"
2021-03-26 13:13,This does not sound like a problem to me! All Americans who want the vaccine should receive the vaccine post haste.  Any extra doses should be sold ( at reasonable cost) to other countries.  Revenue from the sales should be distributed back to the American taxpayer in the form of investments in infrastructure and public health.
2021-03-26 12:15,I got my first dose and am scheduled for my second. It have no complaint about how it was handled. On the day of my first dose I had the shot 4 hours after I registered and the 15 minute wait on the line had me done before my actual appointment. With everyone jumping to disown Cuomo I’d like to thank him personally. Not everyone can be the first on line but I think it was handled well all things considered.
2021-03-26 13:48,"There is no glut.  It's nearly impossible to get a vaccine appointment in New York, and as soon as they open eligibility to more people it will be even worse."
2021-03-26 12:20,"This article talks about a glut on the other side of having all Americans vaccinated. A good strategy would be to look at where most expatriates/immigrants are from seeing as these are people who are inclined to travel back and forth between their host and home countries for family visits, which is inevitably an exercise in cross-contagion. The only way to truly end a pandemic is global action."
2021-03-26 12:23,"We may need additional vaccines in the near future.

Vaccine effective duration in general is about 6 months.  If at the time virus is still active, we may need to take additional shots to protect us.  The current shots we are taking cannot protect us for long duration.  The protective duration will be expired soon.  We will need additional vaccines in place when we need them."
2021-03-26 13:04,"We'll worry about a glut when we see it, but the story raises the issue of when we declare a glut:  Is it before the vaccines have been offered to children or after?  As it stands, there are still plenty of Americans in the 1B and 1C categories who have yet to receive their first dose.  Assuring their vaccination should remain our first priority, and the 2's and 3's should come soon after.

Once a glut has been declared, only a bureaucrat locked in a dark basement for a year would even question what to do with them.  Make them available through U. S. Aid programs directed toward the most needy, especially those in the countries that have received no virus to date.  Skip Covax: the deliveries should be clearly marked ""Made in and Donated by the U. S. A."""
2021-03-26 13:55,"Heartbreaking comments about people struggling to get the vaccine. Here in New York significant progress has been made in getting doses to the heavily populated City and Long Island. 

Thankfully I got my second shot Moderna in February and my daughter's is next week. My son is scheduled for his first Pfizer dose on April 2nd, my wife April 24th.

Good luck and remember, no one is safe until we all are."
2021-03-26 14:08,"Give any possible excess to other countries. We can keep production at high levels to cover the need for variants or possible shorter than expected vaccine effectiveness.  These donations could make a big difference in our international reputation and save US lives in many other ways in the future.    Right now China and Russia lead in helping other countries with vaccines and that has many risks in the long term. Let's also remember there are no real borders for viruses and thus for 'herd' immunity. So, we are helping ourselves by doing this."
2021-03-26 13:59,"I'm not sure if they're already doing it, but why not partner people who can administer a vaccine with programs like ""Meals on Wheels"" that deliver to homebound people? The J&J vaccine would seem like a good candidate for this given the storage aspects."
2021-03-26 14:03,"The government intentionally over-committed to buying massive quantities of vaccines from multiple sources to ensure the best chances that America's needs would be met.  The best would be that multiple suppliers would formulate safe, effective vaccines that could be produced and distributed in large quantities.    The government and their partners now have the opportunity to distribute the surplus fruits of their plan to the rest of the world free-of-charge."
2021-03-26 13:59,"This is the kind of open and shut case that would never have been a difficult question for our parents’ generation.

It is in humanity’s best interest as well as the national interest of the United States to continue to manufacture and to freely distribute however much excess vaccine our means of production are capable of. This is an urgent matter that requires action, not debate and delay."
2021-03-26 14:07,"It's mind-boggling to read about a looming glut of vaccine dosages, when we are severely rate-limited by the ability to get shots into people's arms.

It has been 3.5 months and only 14% of America is vaccinated.  The pace of vaccinations is an absolute embarrassment.  Vaccine sites only do a few hundred shots a day.  

Why hasn't the national guard been mobilized to distribute vaccines 24/7?  Vaccine sites everywhere are operating 8-5 pm, then storing thousands of doses overnight every night.  

Every night that doses are stored and not given out, is another opportunity for people to get sick, hospitalized, and die.  Get the shots in people's arms.  ASAP.  Whether we have 100 million or 200 million extra doses is irrelevant if we can't vaccinate people quick enough before the next variant develops resistance."
2021-03-26 14:15,"Classic.  Even at the lowest help-ourselves-first level we should obviously ship these vaccines out.  The longer we don't help the rest of the world, the more chance the virus mutates to a form that make the current vaccine less effective, and comes back to bite us in the end.
I thought the provincial-thinking government was voted out in 2020."
2021-03-26 14:03,"Isn’t this the purpose of the 195 member United Nations? Like, do as the label suggests and unite; imagine the unforeseen consequences of cooperating across borders to save the world from Covid. Sounds much better than waving millions of life saving doses around like some sort of twisted diplomatic instrument, which is exactly where this is headed."
2021-03-26 13:50,"Mid-May is almost two months from now. A lot could happen by then, with a nascent wave of cases in at least 10 US states, the lower effectiveness observed in the South African arm of Janssen’s trial, and South Africa’s decision not to use the AstraZeneca shot because of low effectiveness. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill ending our state’s mask mandate on April 10 just as it appears our case counts might be getting ready to head back up again.

There’s also the question of whether exports will really save lives. Suppose a “herd immunity” threshold of 70% applies for two countries of equal population, A, which makes a vaccine, and B, which does not. If A inoculates 70% of its own people first, the other 30% will enjoy vicarious protection from the herd immunity. Yet if A sends half its output to B, 35% of the population in both countries is vaccinated but no one in either country has vicarious protection. It’s possible that more people in total would die under this scenario, unless both countries strictly reserve the shots for high-risk groups. Of course we don’t know whether herd immunity is a realistic prospect with Covid; seems the idea failed in Manaus, Brazil.

Byzantine complexity attends such calculations as the virus goes up and down like a yo-yo, and count on politics to muck it up as always."
2021-03-26 14:18,"This is a no-brainer. If America ends up with a surplus we should share with countries (mainly 3rd World) who desperately need the vaccine. 

And note I said ""share."" Not sell at an inflated price or hold the vaccine as an inducement towards trade or policy decisions."
2021-03-26 14:06,"There is currentlymno glut in the US, as these large numbers are based on planned deliveries in the coming months. We will eventually have one (as will Canada, the UK, and the EU) since we all contracted for multiple quantities when we did not know which vaccines would be successful. However, the timing depends on several items: willingness to get shots, of boosters are required, when vaccines will be approved for use in children, etc.

But our glut will not be a global glut, at least not this yea. The strategy for Biden to follow is simple: America first, Americas second, other allies and strategic countries third, and the ROW fourth."
2021-03-26 14:09,"Sitting on these doses is not only immoral, it is self-defeating. We need to smother transmission worldwide as fast as possible. We should ship the AstraZeneca stockpile tomorrow to a combination of countries with whom we have a lot of interaction (e.g., Canada, Mexico) and those who are in dire straights (e.g., Brazil). 
The mRNA vaccines can be developed in weeks and are terribly effective. If we need to tune for new variants, these current versions won't help anyway. Get 'em out the door and let's plan for the next campaign in this war."
2021-03-26 14:03,"Domestic distribution is still far from ideal. States got allocations, and this goes back to the former guy, based on total population more than in population in the priority groups, so states with older populations (esp. in the northeast) are still working through over-65s while states with higher birth and, yes, death rates (poorer health care, more dependence on faith healing) are making it available to everyone. That's unjust.

There's also a general mood in the US to diss the Astra-Zeneca/Oxford vaccine. Its initial Phase 3 trials were a mess, but since then enough data has come out to show that it is safe and effective, except against the South African variant. But the press takes every bit of bad news and blows it far out of proportion. The US should either use its stockpile or let the rest of the world use it; once it is approved here, domestic manufacturing should keep up with demand."
2021-03-26 14:07,"There are an estimated 9 million expatriates living outside the US plus armed service members. Many of these people are subject to local government policy on vaccine procurement and distribution. Maybe find a way to help them out?

US citizens and service members aside, vaccine diplomacy is real and could work wonders as a gesture of goodwill for many emerging and developed countries. Most of which are in the back of the line because ""America first""."
2021-03-26 14:18,"Given that vaccines can only be kept around for 4-6 months, the Administration should institute an collateralized loan program to lend out any vaccine stock that may expire used in, say, 2 months. Any such loan to a foreign country should be done on a collateralized basis, with the acceptable collateral being a firm and prepaid order for a US-made vaccine of the same type to be delivered in, say, 3-6 months. 

Under such a program, the Administration can lend out vaccines that may expire unused. Such vaccine doses can be immediately put into arms overseas to help to stop the pandemic. In exchange, the US will receive a fresh new batch of vaccine inventories in a few months that it can either use or lend out again."
2021-03-26 14:22,"Timing is everything. There is a surge going on right now in the U.S. Meanwhile, millions of younger adults and some seniors are unable to get vaccine appointments either due to current eligibility rules, demand exceeding supply, or both.  

Yet, younger adults and children are increasingly the source of the surges and are becoming more present in hospitalizations.  Many schools are reverting to virtual again.  This is not the time to put the cart before the horse and be considering giving away big portions of our vaccine supply until our own crisis has passed.  

It’s not a question of IF we should share.  It’s WHEN.  Now is not the time.  American citizens have to be patient to get doses and are waiting for eligibility and availability to open up.  The rest of the world will have to be patient too and get in line in order of priority just like the rest of us."
2021-03-26 13:27,"I live in San Francisco Bay Area and I’m eligible for vaccine, yet I still can’t find anywhere where I can take the shots. All vaccine appointments are booked 2 months out. It sure doesn’t look like “surplus” is happening."
2021-03-26 12:18,This will probably be a windfall for the manufacturers but that’s ok in my opinion. Maybe some of that profit can be spent on refining these vaccines into products that can be more easily repurposed for other coronavirus threats.
2021-03-26 13:03,"Hopefully plan ahead! Coordinate resources. Estimate when you need to ship it to the world while you prepare to do that! Then do it with some level of will and competence, not like the first time around."
2021-03-26 12:19,"Clearly, if we have an excess of vaccines we should keep some in inventory and share the rest with other countries, giving it away to less affluent nations. It's the right thing to do."
2021-03-26 12:37,"There are really only two alternatives here: 1) the US acts on its own rhetoric and becomes a beacon of hope, pushing out vaccines globally and letting the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share for once or, 2) the US continues as the country of hypocrisy - one that exports violence and Coca-Cola, but but not prosperity. The latter hypocrisy is causing the nation to implode - perhaps the former possibility, then?"
2021-03-26 14:10,"While it’s practically impossible to get a vaccine appointment right now, in a couple of months, America will be at the point where the news will be dominated by the 30% refusing to get vaccinated. 

There will indeed be a “glut” of vaccine and not enough takers.

Keep some for the kids and boosters. 
Donate the rest. 
The world desperately needs it."
2021-03-26 12:08,"At some point - say September - there should be a ""last call"" for Americans to get their vaccines with the announcement that surplus will be shipped to other countries and continents on October 1. That should bring some people off the sidelines for fear of missing out. And that should be the end of it. There's no reason for people around the world who need the vaccine to wait behind the dawdlers. And speaking of the vaccine recalcitrant, all first responders nationwide need to be vaccinated. Do you want to be in an ambulance with unvaccinated EMTs? The same goes for each and every person who works at - or lives in - a long-term care facility. Vaccine ... or goodbye."
2021-03-26 13:48,"While we certainly are not at the point of a vaccine glut here in the US right now, the vaccine glut is coming. Once it’s here though, we should send that surplus to the developing world as part of our vaccine diplomacy. Those shipments of vaccine should say “Made in the USA” in big bold letters!"
2021-03-26 12:15,"Looks like the press is finally catching on to the fact that the biggest problem the U.S. will face vis-a-vis Covid-19 isn't going to be the dearth of vaccines but the fact that there aren't going to be enough arms to receive them.

We will shortly have enough vaccines to inoculate every person in the United States -- and a whole lot more.  At the same time, however, approximately 100 million people living in the U.S. aren't going to be vaccinated any time soon.  The ""non-vaxxers"" will include: Republicans, 41% of whom (around 35 million people), per polling, will refuse to be inoculated; 46 million children, who aren't eligible for vaccination because children weren't included in the vaccine trials; the 20 million undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they show up to be vaccinated; the 10-15 million Blacks who won't be vaccinated because the medical community victimized them over generations (e.g., the Tuskegee experiments); the 2 million pregnant women who weren't part of the vaccine trials; the 5 million living in rural areas who don't  have ready access to medical care; and the 15 million or so who have contracted Covid and think they're immune.  And so forth.

I cringe when I see charts projecting that the U.S. will reach herd immunity (90% of people vaccinated) by August.  It won't happen then, or for the foreseeable future, because of the millions who won't be vaccinated."
2021-03-26 13:05,"Keep enough vaccines for our population, but then protect the rest of the world, which will protect us from more deadly variants, Doing so also will raise our standing in the world as we compete in soft and hard power with China. It will provide some degree of reparations to countries like the Philippines that we invaded and colonized; Southeast Asia, where we dumped bombs and Agent Orange on hundreds of thousands of neutral poor farming families; and Central American countries where we repeatedly intervened without notably improving anything."
2021-03-26 13:34,"I agree.  Here in Maryland I know plenty of 65+ who are struggling to get vaccinated.  Dear Government, please concentrate on one task at a time.  Get the USA vaccinated and then worry about the surplus!"
2021-03-26 14:14,"Clearly, to help permanently disarm this world-wide pandemic, a solid, severe and repeated kick in the pants is what is needed in the form of as many people as possible to be fully vaccinated. I would hope that ANY country which has a surplus of vaccines would share with other countries who are struggling to get their citizens vaccinated.  It is not only the most prudent course of action but also the most life saving and compassionate action to take."
2021-03-26 13:43,"Let's donate to Canada, Mexico and other Central American countries. We visit and trade heavily with both the former, and anything that helps countries in Central American will help our immigration problems. There are huge numbers of Canadians and Americans who haven't seen elderly relatives across that border in over a year now. Anything to get it open without a quarantine would be great."
2021-03-26 12:49,A very good problem to have.  Vaccinate Central America.  Create jobs- and a process for applying for work from there and only there.
2021-03-26 12:45,"we need it here, our feds have dropped the ball, we are well behind the USA, we ordered lots, however all production is in the USA and Europe, we are stuck, our own fault by not recognizing how reluctant some would be to shared and I get that, take care of your own first. we can then get north America back open, we do $3B a day in trade and many auto parts cross the border two to three times during manufacture, there are do many cross border families who have not seen each other, my son in NYC, selfish I know however we are one continent."
2021-03-26 12:52,"The simple answer here is to help our neighbors to the North and South. Canada and Mexico both need vaccines, and delivery shouldn’t be much harder than Montana or Texas. We could do this in smaller and more intermittent batches of delivery as well, given the tight relationship and geo proximity."
2021-03-26 13:21,"Please let's not fret about a ""glut"" when the majority of us who want a vaccine still can't get one. Solve one problem before manufacturing (pun intended) another."
2021-03-26 12:08,"If America, with its enormous industrial capabilities, is NOT prepared to make an adequate contribution to the vaccine supply of poor countries to the rest of the world, prestige loss is no smaller than the one Trump started."
2021-03-26 13:21,"I cannot comprehend why a glut of vaccine would present a dilemma to a country that claims to be the world's champion of decency, morality and human rights. 

As ""much of the world goes begging"" for vaccines, does anyone in the Biden administration, or even Biden himself since he is such a decent guy, believe that it would be in the US's national interest, security and moral standing to simply send the surplus vaccines wherever they are needed (while, of course, keeping plenty at home in case, e.g., ""booster shots"" are needed)? Stopping the virus in the US while it proliferates elsewhere around the world won't make the US safe!"
2021-03-26 12:19,Ship them to universities medical facilities and vaccinate students before they head home. This would help the home communities from getting re-exposed from incoming students.
2021-03-26 13:30,"The US effort vaccinate appears miraculous to us in Australia as we only commenced our roll out this week. We do not have anywhere near enough vaccine with most front line health workers still not vaccinated and we will be likely not complete the program until 2022. We don’t have vaccine hesitancy but we do have vaccine shortage.

The system is also cumbersome and heavy on bookings and paperwork. 

At least we don’t have any Covid here. 0 new cases or deaths for a long time.
While our Govt’s incompetence is annoying we can at least send what we have to Papua New Guinea where a crisis looms on our doorstep."
2021-03-26 14:14,"The view from outside the US is pretty different than what I read from US publications.  The EU provides vaccine to the world. Russia provides vaccine to the world. China provides vaccine to the world.  India provides vaccine to the world (they are curtailing some exports, but not all).  

The US and the UK stand alone on holding tightly to vaccine nationalism (those Astra Zeneca doses released by the US to Canada and Mexico were ""lent""....the US government stipulated that you get them back when broader access becomes available). 

Canada (which US media likes to point to as having paid for lots and lots of doses) has given 1 dose to about 10% of people with the plan to administer the 2nd dose in 4 MONTHS because we don't have enough and we're just trying to get some protection to the most people.
  
Obviously, the US has been through a lot, but the US government has completely abandoned the field on world leadership with regard to coronavirus. And now you face a ""glut"" in the coming months and the US government is actually considering stockpiling doses as people around the world die.  Not exactly the shining city on the hill. I want to be able to see the US as the leader in the world, certainly not China. But it's hard right now."
2021-03-26 12:21,"Vaccine surplus. Great. Share it with other countries. However, in the meantime get those young men and women in this country vaccinated. They want it! Skip over the elderly that are refusing the vaccine."
2021-03-26 13:35,Most people here are at least one vaccine dose in. Pre existing and underlying conditions in Virginia also included smokers and the obese and documentation was unnecessary. Lots of folks will be surreptitiously angling for a third Pfizer or Moderna shot while there’s a glut. What’s wrong with Pennsylvania?
2021-03-26 14:17,"What to do with excess vaccine?  Really?  This is a problem people in the know foresee?  Have all of the 2,300,000 people incarcerated in the US received a vaccination?  What percentage of the 11,000,000 undocumented living in the US have been vaccinated?  Hispanic vaccination rates are still in the single digits. When those questions have been satisfactorily answered, then start worrying about excess production.

At that point, send the excess to Mexico.  Or to Canada.  Shouldn't our closest neighbors benefit from our largess? Why not ship it to Central America or any of a dozen African nations whose healthcare systems are non-existent or breaking under the strain of Covid? 

And on every box, carton, and shipping container print in big. bold letters, ""A GIFT FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"".  Maybe, just maybe, we can repair a small fraction of the damage done to our international reputation by the previous administration."
2021-03-26 14:34,"What dilemma? Keep enough to satisfy the demand expected for those remaining adults who want it, including teens. I believe the target date for this is the end of June, but it appears to be ahead of schedule. The rest should, and will, obviously go to other countries."
2021-03-26 14:39,"There is a huge waiting list for shots down here. We can't even get an appointment or get on a list, even though we are in the eligible age group. Having the doses is one thing. Actually getting the shot is another.  And 2 of the vaccines require 2 shots, so process has to be repeated."
2021-03-26 14:43,"COVID-19 is a moving target. It evolves. By the time we have finished with everyone who is willing to be vaccinated in this country, we will probably be looking forward to vaccinating against new variants that resist the existing vaccines. That will require modifying them, doing some degree of testing, manufacturing them in quantity, and distributing them. Around and around we go. Where we stop, nobody knows.

How do we get off this merry-go-round, or avoid getting on in the first place? The best way to reduce the opportunities for the vaccine to evolve into more communicable and virulent variants is to prevent people from getting sick now. And that means here and abroad. 

There are politicians and personalities who are understating the dangers of the virus, discouraging vaccinations, and opposing the wearing of masks. They are making policies without regard to the changing nature of the disease. Example: opening schools in areas where the B.1.1.7. variant is already present. It is more contagious and damaging and seems to be easily contracted and spread by children.

A number of strategies have been suggested to defeat the virus, including sophisticated systems for testing and tracking and tracing. But the success of all strategies begins with taking the disease seriously. Medicine first. Economics second."
2021-03-26 14:46,"Since last November, the biggest problem predicted with this entire vaccination endeavor was the logistics of rolling it out, successfully and orderly.

Where I live, there are shopping malls, civic centers, Arlington Race Track facility and a plethora of other in-door, large capacity sites in which mass vaccines could be coordinated to accommodate hundreds of people.

For crying out loud, this pandemic has been here for over an entire year, and yet, how many cities across the country are still grappling with the logistics of processing and giving the vaccine to anyone who wants it?

These kinds of plans of action should have not only been in the thinking stage, but already set to hit the ground running the moment vaccines were made available to every city in the country."
2021-03-26 14:47,"Drug companies will continue to churn out; there is no need to hoard the looming surplus just in case we need more. In fact, vaccinating other unvaccinated countries right now rather than hoarding to re-vaccinate our population in the future will be a lot effective in stopping the virus on our shore."
2021-03-26 12:43,No glut in LA. Still a very cumbersome system to get vaccinated.
2021-03-26 12:17,"I’m getting to the point where Joe should have the Feds take over giving vaccines from incompetent states and localities. He needs to look in his own backyard for evidence.  Local Washington DC is not getting sufficient vaccine supplies and then with the vaccine supplies, 40 percent go to non residents.  With other states now vaccinating anyone over 18, DC cannot even complete vaccinating those over 65.

But then the mayor can purchase flags with 51 stars to fly all over the city in support of DC statehood.......sigh."
2021-03-26 14:36,"Vaccine every person on American land, and them we can worry about the rest of the world."
2021-03-26 12:06,"That’s just a bizarre article. it’s not lost on the reader that India one of the major suppliers ( serum institute) is holding back its inventory to ROW to deal with the spike in infections in the country. Countries like Nepal, Mozambique, Burundi and other are expecting vaccines now only in 2022 and even 2023 as a result. If the world needs vaccine and there is a glut here why are we even contemplating this here? there is us and there there is them ...poor needy folk that we may on occasions help out for the right photo op."
2021-03-26 12:33,"Some of the future surplus, I believe, should go to Canada, to enable that nation to speed up its mass Covid immunization effort. At the rate it is going, Canada won't complete its vaccine rollout until late September 2021 (source: CTV News). Help from the United States would enable Canada to hits its vaccine milestones faster and will save lives there."
2021-03-26 12:22,"Get the vaccines into peoples arms ASAP.  It’s mind boggling to read about a coming glut of vaccines when only 14% of America has been vaccinated in 3.5 months.

Vaccine sites should be run by the national guard and inoculating people 24/7.  Storing vaccines overnight helps no one and contributes to hospitalizations and deaths.  In my state they are running vaccine sites during casual working hours only.

Get them in peoples arms."

2021-03-26 13:13,"""for Biden""? In the headline? 

What does this have to do with Biden? Its Trump that ordered and paid for the vaccines. Its the states and localities that are delivering the vaccines supplied by the private sector, or not effectively delivering them.  Its not hard to do if its not over-bureaucratized. Just make it easy ... don't do what some (highly Democrat) states did and demand that unused doses be thrown away. 

Also to note: you are not counting immunity due to having the actual disease. You have to add that in to the ""herd immunity"" numbers. Finally, not that actual cases in the under-30 demographic add to immunity, and are continuing, without lots of deaths. 

Our county is now a bit over 50% overall immune due to vaccine or having actually had it (we know the exact number in our U of I college population). We are limited in vaccinations only by the state not sending enough doses."
2021-03-26 13:15,"These vaccines need to be used before their expiration, so forget any stockpiling nonsense. Upon their status of superfluous, any truly effective donation given their complicated administration these vaccines will have to be accompanied by medical rollout teams & mobile storage facilities."
2021-03-26 12:07,"Nice to speculate, but the Biden Administration still has to vaccinate many Americans.  Too many still cannot get appointments."
2021-03-26 13:37,"I have mentioned once or twice on The Telegraph that we would be over-producing shortly while the EU was still figuring out what to do.

I propose that we sell it to them under the following conditions:

    We are guaranteed at least a 1000% profit margin.  No AstraZeneca zero-profit situation for us.

    They promise to give away for free half of what we send them to all the poor countries they have been emoting about.

    They require the French to use first all the AZ vaccine that they have been whining about.

    We place an American flag sticker on all vials, and require the recipients to wear a ""God Bless America"" pin.

Other than that, they can get all they want."
2021-03-26 13:57,"Get the kids in school vaccinated as well so that we can truly starve the virus.  In addition, booster shots are likely.  This is not rocket science.  Get the US economy back to normal so that all of the people who lost their jobs can get back to supporting their families."
2021-03-26 12:14,"Until all US states make the vaccine available for adults 18  AND those adults receive their vaccinations, I don’t see how we can possibly already say there is a glut. Send those vaccines to Oregon!"
2021-03-26 13:43,"Our biggest problem is shortly going to be the unacceptably large number of people who are vaccine reluctant not only here in America but around the world. France for instance is even worse than we are for % of people who say ""thanks but no thanks"" to vaccine. 

There is going to have to be a vaccine passport system with those who refuse to get vaccinated excluded from things like air travel, concerts, cruises, schools and even bars that wish to operate at full capacity. 

The alternative is just forcibly vaccinating people and that just won't fly nor should it. You should be free to refuse the vaccine but that doesn't mean free from consequences. See public schools. In most states no childhood vaccinations means you cannot be a student or a teacher or any other worker inside a school. 

Otherwise we will be playing ""Wack-a-Covid"" for decades as the large number who refuse to vaccinate serve as incubators and spreaders for new variants the vaccines are not effective against starting a whole new round of restrictions and a race to find new vaccine to stop the new variants. 

By making life extremely difficult for the vaccine reluctant it won't take long to get all but the most insane to comply voluntarily so they can go back to freely traveling, happy hour, live concerts, etc."
2021-03-26 13:46,This is a no brainer.  Any excess vaccine the US has morally needs to be used to vaccinate the rest of the world.

2021-03-26 12:55,The US has an ethical and leadership obligation to distribute  vaccines worldwide. Biden is smart enough to know the US has to be seen as being fully vaccinated or the right wing will attack him.  Biden is a compassionate and caring person. He is also smart enough to avoid giving sound bites to the right wing echo chamber. The world will be vaccinated.
2021-03-26 13:12,"""vaccine scarcity will soon turn to plenty as much of the world goes begging."" I have read this sub-headline 3 times. And I am sure the conceit is substantiated, but it doesn't make sense. More vax, so people are left to beg? We are 21 years into the 21st century. Instantaneous communication has led to ""immediate gratification"" -- or,  the desire for it. Attention spans have deteriorated so that while people are reading more individually, fewer are reading an actual book. I guess I am outdated. I don't understand the Alice in Wonderland nature of our world. If you are alive, COVID-19 is a threat, please act responsibly and get vaccinated."
2021-03-26 14:33,Surplus? Send it to metro Atlanta. Georgia consistently ranks dead last in % vaccinated. Our own Governor told us to hit the road and look for appointments in distant rural areas.  The same week he signed legislation to restrict our voting rights.
2021-03-26 14:56,"This is preposterously premature.  There is NO ""glut"", the supposition is based on optimistic presumption, not fact.
You may also examine the ""gluttonous"" vaccine orders placed by Canada and other countries, exceeding the numbers of their populations.
When we have vaccinated the 90% of Americans who want the vaccine, then we can create anxiety about potential excess supply, but not until then.
There are at least 2 months to review existing orders, as we move to inoculate the hardest to reach Americans, those in rural areas of the country.  Certainly any excess doses are being factored into our distribution strategy now, as a daily analytical process.
Additionally, it's not yet clear if variants will require ""booster"" doses, which is another sound reason to be conservative in our procurement activities."
2021-03-26 13:46,"I seem to remember a story about the American media being more negative in their COVID coverage than anywhere else in the world, finding bad news in everything..."
2021-03-26 14:22,Redirecting excess vaccines to the citizens of countries not fortunate enough to have a government that ordered enough vaccines would be the moral thing to do. But we should not delegate distribution of vaccines to the incompetent and /or corrupt heads of state that failed to procure vaccines for their own populations and might profiteer from our generosity.
2021-03-26 12:44,"Let's face it, the AZ vaccine IS inferior to the other three options. Much better to donate it to other countries who lack any vaccine, and hope they don't turn up their noses at a good option for their people."
2021-03-26 13:10,Doesn't the Astrazeneca vaccine require 2 doses? This means that we'd need more 400 million vaccine shot to cover the entire US population.
2021-03-26 12:32,"I'm hearing that a lot of people are refusing the vaccine and that most of them are white republican men. Once we have enough vaccine then set a hard deadline at which time the vaccine's price will rise from zero to $1,000. Two weeks later the supply shuts down until the ACA registration opens up again. Then send any remaining vaccine to other nations."
2021-03-26 13:36,"It is my understanding that one of our closest neighbors has a very very low vaccination rate and since we share a boarder and routinely experience people crossing back and forth, we should be generous and share it there and beyond."

2021-03-26 12:26,"There are still significant distribution problems in this country, especially to rural areas. I’m not in favor of “sharing” anything until every American who wants the vaccine has received the vaccine and I think that’s going to be past “mid May”. I’m also unsure of when we will need to be vaccinated again? I get an annual flu shot. Do we not think Covid-19 and it’s “variants” won’t need to be at least treated with a “booster” vaccine? If vaccine is about to expire — in six months or a year — then let’s discuss the export in five months. Will the Covid-19 vaccine just be “baked into” my flu shot? There are far too many questions about “what next” to just start loading up the ships in some sort of “vaccine diplomacy”"
2021-03-26 12:21,So what’s the question here??  Every vaccine we can send to poorer countries only helps them and restores America abroad.

2021-03-26 14:38,"This ""dilemma""needs to be planned for. When the time of having extra vaccine comes, the logistics need to in place to ship it and distribute it to where the need is greatest. 
In no case should any vaccine languish in storage and expire."
2021-03-26 14:49,"The US should “loan” its Astra-Zeneca vaccine. Many countries are suffering delays in shipments; they could return the vaccine later, or redirect it as the US wishes. This helps now, when it is most needed, without compromising US supply in any meaningful way."
2021-03-26 15:08,"The absolute miracle of having developed a number of effective vaccinations against a formerly unknown SARS virus cannot be allowed to be undone by the indecisiveness of bureaucrats on what to do with the millions of doses being produced. Gather accurate information quickly about where the vaccines haven't been widely available in this country and make it simple for people in those areas to get vaccinated safely and quickly. If we indeed wind up with a surplus that can't be used in this U.S., there are plenty of nations world that will require our help to get their populations vaccinated. There is no such thing as a surplus if there are spots on the globe where people don't have access to any of the vaccines. Get them out there regardless of political prejudices or economic concerns, and send or train the necessary personnel to administer those doses. The sooner every country is vaccinated, the virus has less time to mutate into variants that may require new formulations of these vaccines. We can't behave like some small company working out of a warehouse in an obscure location. How do we handle the next variant or new virus that emerges if we can't even decide how to stop the spread of the one currently wreaking havoc around the world?"

2021-03-26 15:22,"I would rather Biden have a surplus of vaccine problem, than the other side of the coin, not enough vaccines.  Also, we still don't know if a booster will be required to deal with all of the variants that are popping up both in the US and aboard.  So, a so-call surplus could turn into a shortage very quickly.
Also, what would be wrong with sharing some of our surplus with Latin America and Africa, even Canada?"

As for excess, who said manufacture should stop when we have ""enough"" domestically.  There should be NO debate.  Anything we can spare, give to COVAX, and get the kids done as soon as possible.  With all the money being spent, we can spend a few billion more for the rest of the world.  If nothing else, it's self-interest!"

I gather that the timing of authorization for younger children is more uncertain, but we should ensure that we would have an adequate supply vaccinate them once approval is obtained before exporting.

Once we have a real surplus (as distinguished from future production), I would start by sharing with Canada and Mexico, the two countries with which we share land borders."

2021-03-26 13:46,"I am 73 years old and I just got first dose of AZ vax here at a clinic in Ghana. I had been tracking vax availability in DC as that is where I live when in the US. I get emails saying how many doses will be available and there is a web site for registering. I go to the registration site just to look, and it is full by the time I read the instuctions. The AZ vax I got in Ghana came from India via Covax. Now  I wonder if India will release its AZ supply so I can get the booster in May. If the US probably will not need the AZ vaccine by the time it is approved then it should be released to countries like Brazil and Ghana that need it. A negative covid test can be positive 48 hours later when the air traveller finally arrives at JFK. The world is too small to hoard vaccine especially if it is certain that 80 million will refuse it in the US on the advice of Qanon, MAGA minions, and lizard people. The fire fighters and ambulance drivers in Ghana have not been vaccinated. And I wish the US social media would block the absurd antivax idiocy that is posted. It is hurting Ghanaians. Some of my friends already believe the vaccine will make them impotent or put a microchip in their skin. Who knows what non English speakers believe."

Get that? The US is importing vaccines but not exporting. To then go on to talk about the humanitarian credit the country might reap if and when it ever decides to release some vaccines to the rest of the world is laughable. The rest of the world knows very well that, in this domain, the US is continuing Trump’s America First policies, even where American themselves are oblivious, thanks to this kind of journalism."

Brazil was (yet) another ramification of hiring an inept narcissist as president. What we're seeing out of Biden is refreshing and encouraging. We're witnessing a ""team"" approach of qualified advisors tackling the massive train wreck left behind from Trump. The recent voter restrictive measures being passed right here in Texas and Georgia should remind Americans that the bad old boys haven't gone away.

That being said, glitches in distribution need to be addressed here as well. I'm hoping that soon decliners will be the major issue. If enough people are vaccinated, those who refuse will present less of a danger. 
It made sense to rely on technology to organize distribution early on. That will have to change if people who don't have phones and computers are to be served. I'm pretty sure it's possible to use those ""excess"" doses even if that doesn't make for eye-catching headlines."

It seems odd that it would not be our instinct to do the same here. We've proven that we can ramp up vaccine production and distribution to levels where we can get shots in to arms as quickly as would be needed. Once all eligible Americans are vaccinated, it seems it would just make sense to start vaccinating the rest of the world and keep our levels of production high. Viles on shelves won't protect anyone, even us, from variants that come from unvaccinated populations spreading the disease rapidly.

That does not mean it is easy or simple to do, just clear as to what we should do: Sell vaccine at a fair price to other developed, wealthy nations, and donate it free or sell it at drastically reduced prices to poor, underdeveloped nations. The idea of people anywhere in the world doing without vaccine while all of our citizens and even aliens are vaccinated, and excess vaccine sits on our shelves, should be anathema to all Americans."

Another stupid, irrational, destructive federal regulation.  Common sense: If you don't need them, give them to someone who does.  Abroad, if that is where they are.

No wonder people distrust the federal government and complain of over-regulation.  We could have had vaccine months earlier if the FDA had not insisted on Phase 3 trials for efficacy.  This was an emergency!  Phase 2 trials established that serious side effects were rare.

is concerned that it will interfere with his percentage of population vaccinated number--that is high due to the ease of organizing age only shots.

This has forced severely high risk patients to live in fear as he opens up CT--restaurants now 100% capacity. High risk patients, like those afflicted with diabetes, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial disease (COVID could mean a death sentence for these populations) immunocompromised, cancer patients and on and on... . All of them locked inside their homes as variants are at risk of growing sin ce everyone is loosening up.  But, hey, those low risk, predominately white, 35 year olds don't need to worry about cold symptoms. 

The governor has been pressured to open it up to everyone this April. So there is that. But he still will not allow the high risk to take priority over, say, the healthy 20 year old.

2021-03-26 16:05,"A perfect opportunity for the U.S. to recover its position of leadership in the world. President Biden, with his team of experts, will determine the number of doses needed to immunize every person living within the U.S. Then, a reasonable supply will be kept in reserve in case boosters are needed within the next year. Then, working in collaboration with the CDC, WHO, and international healthcare leaders, excess doses can be shipped to nations in need, until every nation has sufficient supply for their citizens. Imagine, the U.S. partnering with every nation to eradicate this deadly disease; a humanitarian triumph."
2021-03-26 15:31,"There are two-ish obvious answers for where to send excess vaccine first, each addressing one of the largest concerns in American politics.

The first is send them to Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries so the pandemic is not amplifying migration. We do need many more immigrants to the USA, even more so after losing a half million people and having the birth rate decline further, but smoothing out the arrival rate will greatly reduce suffering and the vulnerability of migrants to criminal groups. No one should be forced from their home by disease if there is an effective treatment available.

The other country to send them is Brazil, as creating good will with the Brazilian people will be necessary in negotiating protections for the rainforests and having those protections followed and enforced. This would benefit the entire world in addition to Brazil itself.

Of course, all of this depends on the capability to equitably distribute the vaccine within each of these countries, and that cannot be taken for granted. Sending a giant shipment of vaccine somewhere only to have it captured by criminal groups then used to pressure citizens and government with ""virus extortion"" may do more harm than good. As with virtually every other social problem, corruption and organized crime are the most critical bottlenecks on the road to progress."
2021-03-26 16:11,"A good future problem to have and I am sure that the best minds are working on it. In the meantime, there is enough vaccine in many states and the process for getting appointments is still complex and unwieldy, especially for the tech unsophisticated folks. Let's solve for those problems now. And please...keep wearing that mask in public."
2021-03-26 16:50,"Why is the federal government deciding what to do with the vaccines? The companies that make the vaccines ought to be the ones making those decisions. 

The vaccine makers were free to enter into contracts with other buyers, and they did. And now the government is telling them what to do?"
2021-03-26 16:53,"Plan to export any excess stocks of vaccine to countries which are far behind in vaccinating their people due to lack of vaccine. Until everyone is immune, the pandemic could mutate into something that those with immunity, now, would not have immunity. The longer this pandemic lasts anywhere, the more it changes and the results less predictable."

Let's get this out to primary care physicians if there is such a glut!"
2021-03-26 16:30,"There will be plenty of people in the US who will refuse them, and wasting vaccines in a global crisis is sinful. Not to mention, we will squander a real opportunity to engage in vaccine diplomacy like so many of our rivals are.

2021-03-26 16:32,"Perhaps it is only a case of even a stopped clock being right twice a day, but credit should go to the prior administration for getting behind funding to develop these vaccines and the pharmaceutical complies for solving the riddle in record time.  I didn’t like Trump or many of his enablers, but it’s the vaccine that accounts for most of the success, much more so than random and capricious  lockdowns."
2021-03-26 16:19,"In the short term share surplus vaccine with Canada and Mexico. If and when additional US doses are needed, they can be easily redirected for domestic use. 

The manor in which Biden shares vaccine with our allies and the remainder of the planet is an opportunity to restore the United States to a global leadership role. I hope they don’t miss this opening to restore our reputation."
2021-03-26 16:21,"It seems like every other post has the basic comment - “what glut?” I wish folks would read the article they are commenting on.

The US has purchased enough vaccine doses to inoculate 400 million people. We will have that many doses by the end of the summer or in the fall. There are 330 million total people in the US. We will be lucky to vaccinate 80% of our population because many won’t take it and those who have had Covid-19 only need one shot of the two shot vaccines. So we might have more like 136 excess doses. 

The question is how maximize the benefit of those doses to help bring the worldwide pandemic to an end, ONCE everyone in the US is vaccinated. 

It’s good to finally have an administration that can do math, take in existing data and plan something in advance."
2021-03-26 16:26,"Perhaps allow your neighbors to the north to buy some off you? Not just the ones your country is unwilling to use. We’re being told December at the earliest for young, healthy people. It would be good economically for people living on both sides of the Canadian border. It doesn’t make sense to me that the US-Mexico border appears to be wide open but we can’t cross the US-Canada border with our passports to visit family in the United States that we haven’t seen in over a year. 

It’s a small thing but shopping in the US is very popular with the large majority of Canadians living close to the border. The US is giving out thousands of dollars per family to stimulate your economy, those of us living in Canada would be happy to pitch in with that effort if we could just get that border opened!"
2021-03-26 16:38,"Sharon LaFraniere and Noah Weiland write, ""Of the vaccine doses given globally, about three-quarters have gone to only 10 countries. At least 30 countries have not yet injected a single person.""

The distribution of vaccines is not based on ethics. Government operates on the basis of interests and power, hence this unethical outcome.
This foreshadows unethical behavior as CO2 levels continue increasing, and the global heating catastrophe continues to worsen. 
While some claim that government could become ethical, its long record of injustice and inequity puts the lie to such notions.
We need the creation of ethics-based-organizations to manage vaccine distribution and this worsening climate disaster."
2021-03-26 16:31,"With assurances that my own imperfections are humbly acknowledged, the circuitous truth here is that we are barely able to vaccinate our own willing adult citizens. We all know there is tremendous threat to our political stability from the extreme right that may just explode at any time until the slivers of lies are removed from their warts.
It is my firm stance that the greatest responsibility each of us has is to and for ourselves/families. Of course, we assist and provide for those who cannot do either. But, first, we have to stay well to produce, distribute, protect, and administer the vaccine to those beyond our Constitutional responsibilities. 
Empathy is on the table always. No request should be dismissed without serious consideration. No nation needs to be unheard tho not all can be helped near term.
With no specific knowledge, I think perhaps our leadership is wary of the coming October-December threat of mutations. Once the doses are sent out, there’s no way to get them back should circumstances change. Being prudently cautious does not equate to discrimination or stinginess. There are likely data mounds fed into analyses with ranges of probabilities including those with a nasty challenge. These decisions are not made in a compassionate vacuum. Nor are they made lightly."
2021-03-26 15:10,"The frustrating thing about the ""misfortune"" of having a glut of vaccines is there are many people who refuse to be vaccinated due to misinformation, politics and fear. Much effort and expense has been directed by a competent Biden administration to vaccinate all U.S. residents, and I've read a third of Republicans do not plan to receive it.

Any surplus vaccines should immediately be flown to our fellow global citizens. In 6 hours a flight can reach northern Brazilian states, the Caribbean, Mexico, Canada, and even the U.K. Much of Central Africa doesn't even have the vaccine on their radar, and they can use the doses. Our ""problem"" can be a solution for others."
2021-03-26 12:38,"Until all in US can get vaccine, shouldn’t share.  I know many who still can not get appts for the vaccine. All for helping the world but a president should look out for its own countries citizens first; that’s why he was elected!"

That's enough to inoculate the entire Horn of Africa!

(Sorry, if you Americans don't know what that last one is, Google it.)

To simply sit on vaccine that can be used to save the lives of people who are desperate for the shot right now is the absolute height of depraved indifference.

If it's not safe for Americans, it's not safe for anyone else either.

Supposedly numerous people died of blood clots after getting this vaccine. But it hasn't been determined whether the deaths were from the vaccine or due to natural causes. Holy stress-inducing non-information. I would personally get the vaccine myself. But my father is insisting on getting it. He already has severe compromised veins due to longstanding illness.

Sure, you may have a ""surplus"" of vaccine by May ( that's only 6 weeks from now), but that will be because  there aren't mass vaccination sites open 24 hours non-stop and employing a sufficient number of the millions of RN's, LPN's, etc., licensed and perfectly capable of giving a simple injection.

If this vaccine is as good as they say, we can donate and help administer it in refugee camps on our Southern border and elsewhere, in poorer countries with higher rates of comorbidities, in the favelas of Rio & Sao Paulo, anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere as winter approaches.

Enough vaccine should be kept in the US  to vaccinate every person who lives here along with enough to provide boosters to vulnerable populations if need be.   

Sending vaccine to other countries before that point will just become another point of attack for right wing media, who will say on one hand that vaccine is worthless and on the other that Democrats are jeopardizing Americans' health by not hoarding it - and their audience will buy both."
2021-03-26 17:35,"When the government starts to manage a market from the top down, we get waste. Never fails. And with this virus epidemic we are also seeing an epidemic of waste. 

Take ventilators, for example. A year ago people were screaming about a ventilator shortage. We need more ventilators! People are dying because we don't have enough ventilators! Do something!

So the government got involved and we threw around a lot of money and got more ventilators built. Then we found out that ventilators were killing more people than they were saving. Better treatments were found.

 All the ventilators that were made and purchased at great expense to serve an urgent need are rotting away in storage. They'll never be used. We already had enough. 

Same with virus testing. A year ago Covid-19 tests were hard to get. People were scrambling to get tested. A lot of money was thrown around, and by summer tests were plentiful. Now we have an excess of companies offering testing, and fewer and fewer customers. Testing turns out not to be worth the money we spent on it. 

Vaccines are a similar story. I don't want to cast doubt on vaccines, or suggest that they don't work. And the companies that make them have done a stellar job. But when the federal government keeps butting in and trying to help, that harms more than helps. 

The government doesn't know how much vaccine will be needed when, or how much that is worth. That's what markets are for. We should let them work."

What is the cost to the American tax payer of having an excess stockpile and sharing the vaccine with other nations vs. not having a safety net and not being able to control the pandemic because people will always be travelling and spreading the virus. 
This is a global problem and we have to be a part of the global solution. There is no choice.
To me the cost of excess vaccines is a very small percentage to pay for saving lives and the economy. Alternative has been Trillions in economic stimulus and over 550,000 dead in US alone."
2021-03-26 16:46,speed up the vaccination process - and once those who want to be vaccinated are vaccinated - then think about the surplus.  People are waiting too long to get on a list to be vaccinated - weeks to sign up and then months to actually get the first shot.   Use the military to get it going.   Why are we being told it will be months before those 16 and older can get a shot?
2021-03-26 16:53,"The real dilemma is getting people to follow the rules regarding masks and social distancing.

If a Covid variant gets out before we reach herd immunity we could have a large surge in cases.

And to all the ""children"" out there who think the rules do not apply to them, pay attention.  It was just reported a variant exists that is much more dangerous for your age group.

Put the masks on.  Get vaccinated.  Stop the virus before we have another round of grief."
2021-03-26 17:00,"A glut of vaccines? The mishandeling of this is astonishing. 
I'm sitting here in Massachusetts eligible for the vaccine and I can't get an appointment. The mismanagement at the state level is off the charts. My 90 year old mother, who lives in Arizona can't get vaccinated due the arcane way that state decided to handle vaccinating people. They expect her to drive for an hour and a half and then wait on line for however long it takes. Are they kidding? 

This country is proving day in and day out that it's on it way to becoming a failed state. What's more disheartening, it's worse in Europe! 

As Pgog once quipped, "" We have met the enemy and it's us""."
2021-03-26 16:16,"Biden don't give up any of our allocated vaccine doses to any other countries until we are fully vaccinated here in USA and protected. Either that way, or you definitely lose my vote next time around."
2021-03-26 17:25,"I confess to being extremely dubious about any 'glut' of covid vaccines, let alone anything 'looming' about it. This seems to be the product of the minds that asserted 'vaccine hesitancy' to be a problem when there wasn't any vaccine to be hesitant about. Seriously, the only way to determine whether someone is hesitant or not to take a vaccine is to produce a vial of the vaccine and a syringe and then ask ""Will you take it?""

As for this ostensible glut, the first thing to do (actually, the zero-th) would be to lose this ridiculous appointment system and go to vaccine-on-demand. I don't know anyone who has successfully gotten vaccinated by appointment; they have all been done in group clinics (educators, meds working covid wards, that sort of thing). I am all for distributing these vaccines to everyone in the world, wholeheartedly and without 'reservation' as soon as possible. But I object to this constant raising of theoretical/hypothetical problems in the media simply because we are bored/anxious waiting for the vaccine. I also confess to have given up trying to make an appointment (too depressing) and am resigned to waiting until the vax does become available on demand. Probably a year or two.

Then again, this may be just another case of overpromise/underdeliver that has characterized this pandemic from the beginning."
2021-03-26 18:33,"""no one is certain if or when immunity could wear off""

The current CDC instructions say you're only safe for 3 months after getting the vaccine.    I'm not sure most people realize that.  

So 4 months after the first people got the vaccine (in significant numbers), if those people don't get re-vaccinated after 3 months, then we'll know if it's good for 4 months, and so on."
2021-03-26 18:48,"There are two questions which have not been considered: 1) How often are we going to need the vaccine? and 2) How the vaccine producers are going to react if there is a variation of the virus which gets out of control of one of the vaccines?... and the competition has a better alternative.

Is the Covid-19 vaccine going to be as the flu vaccine?"
2021-03-26 18:53,"To use a phrase popular phrase, aren't we getting a bit over our skis here?

The only takeaway I get is that the law should be changed so that the federal government can recall surplus vaccines, while requiring states to account for vaccines that go unused.

By mid-summer, who's to say that the current vaccines are no longer effective?   One step at a time."
2021-03-26 18:05,"Some articles do answer questions raised in the headlines.  I suspect that had we come up short on vaccines, the Opposition would have had a field day.  Or had we decided to share our stock, the same day in the field.  But with a surplus, the Administration can present plans to use it and that works for me.  The USA knows very well the benefits of helping others."
2021-03-26 17:47,"Why is this complicated? Sell the excess at cost to those who can afford it, and also give away plenty to those who can not. Stage a major diplomatic coup, showing the world that the American way beats Chinese and Russian autocracy. Then, manufacture more as the world needs it."
2021-03-26 17:54,"There's a surplus and the production is on the rise, and the US should share, and share as soon as possible. No vaccines exported to Europe, for example, means a rise of Russia's geopolitical influence there. Send AstraZeneca and don't worry about the nuances of appearances. A little sent there right now would go a long way. I'm an American, but with parents in Europe, as many Americans are. ""Americans first"" is not practical today, if I could speak ""as an American"".  Brazil, I agree, is another good candidate. So many other countries. Again, this is surplus. Share vaccines and save lives."
2021-03-26 17:47,"Our nearby family run Pharmacy here in Burlington, VT. was told to make changes in refrigeration, etc., in order to get vaccines, but then none were sent. Instead one must drive to fairgrounds in next town to get vaccinated. If there is a glut, plenty of places and people can help."
2021-03-26 18:29,"Russia's Sputnik 5 vaccine is 91% effective. 26 countries are getting vaccines from China, the Sinopharm vaccine. We paid our pharmacies to create the vaccine, and now they intend to jack up the price, and 'farm us', since we will need re-ups in the following years. Question: Do we pay companies 2X for things? We paid them to create it, now we support them in charging us? It was CD foresight, pre pandemic, that allowed the pharm companies to 'warp speed' in the first place. Why not make the process free and available to all countries, to better eradicate the disease, and cut down on future recurrences? Why pay pharmacies twice?"
2021-03-26 18:45,"Apparently the Biden Administration has not gotten the globalization message, even though it should be glaringly obvious by now--with the pandemic--that we all share one planet and are intimately interconnected.  What galls me is that the U.S. is sitting on a huge stockpile of the AstraZeneca vaccine when it has yet to receive an EUA in the U.S., and the E.U. and the rest of the world are desperate for more vaccine.  Vaccine equity is the true test of social justice.  I would give the Biden administration a failing grade for global vaccine equity."
2021-03-26 18:44,"State Department estimates that 10 million American citizens live overseas....our family constitutes just four. The US embassy here was able to vaccinate staff and their families (including local staff) but US citizens abroad are advised to ""ask for advice from a trusted medical professional."" Who might that be if I'm asking the advice of my own CDC?  Many of us have been unable or are unwilling to travel back to the US last summer but this summer, my family and many exoat families will travel - unvaccinated but COVID- tested -- at potentially grave risk to ourselves and our loved ones.  We will spend our summer home leave  in isolation and with the hope of finding a way to get vaccinated before we leave. The sole purpose of the journey is the pursuit of a vaccination. We will again forgoe needed medical care another year - no pap smears or mamograms,   blood work , cavity-fillibg or well-child visits.   (Heaven forbid we see our families.)
If the US is sitting on excess vaccine while it's own ""eligible"" and eager citizens are sitting in the earth's far corners....many of us working in public health,  where our local doctors and nurses are working for months unvaccinated .... I simply find the whole hoarding and self righteousness absurd.  There is no more certain way to usher in new variants and to promote vaccine escape  than  to do what the US and EU are doing at this very moment."
2021-03-26 18:42,"Before vaccines go to other countries, the US should vaccinate its citizens abroad. We are desperate for access too, stuck in countries that have botched the vaccine roll out (for shame, E.U.) or don't have the resources necessary to acquire them. So, as we hear from family and friends back home that they are fully protected, we wonder if sending our children to school amid swirling variants will end up killing us. There is absolutely precedent for American embassies rescuing citizens during times of peril, and this is certainly one of them."
2021-03-26 19:12,A nice problem to have when we get to that point. Vaccine diplomacy will be next.
2021-03-26 17:59,There is no point in hoarding excess vaccines when the world desperately needs them. The Chinese are exporting vaccine as diplomacy BEFORE their citizens are vaccinated.  We need to counter their moves because we may need help from other countries in the future.
2021-03-26 17:14,"This is a worldwide pandemic and needs to be addressed as such. Yes, the US should secure enough vaccines to cover its population with a reasonable surplus. However, as we've already seen, this virus evolves and travels with alarming speed. In order to prevent new covid variants that would render current vaccines ineffective from reaching our shores, it's in our own best interest to get the rest of the world inoculated as quickly as possible."
2021-03-26 18:03,"In Los Angeles, Newsom has bottled necked the vaccine supply, and there definitely is no glut here.  Rather, he and his cronies kept speaking of vaccine shortages.  California so far lags behind other states in vaccination apparently because of that.  Now that people are trying to recall him, he promises opening up the vaccine to everyone without concrete plan of how he is gonna do that.  His incompetency shines in crisis."
2021-03-26 13:04,"As the Covid pandemic is a global problem, it needs to be addressed globally....Share! The 'America First' position of this administration is met with increasing criticism internationally."

2021-03-26 19:28,1. push minority and low income vaccinations. 2. Give it to poorer nations somehow prioritizing nations. 3. Thank God
2021-03-26 17:54,There are lots of Americans with summer homes in Canada who must be waiting patiently for the border to open but we are way behind you guys in vaccinating.

Simple, put em in crates with ginormous American flags on the side, load up the C-130s and have American servicemen and women distribute them to needy countries while blasting the Battle Hymn of the Republic. We could use some international goodwill."
2021-03-26 12:49,"Ship and share. To anyone who needs them. Mexico first, then Brazil of course. If Europe is short send some there."

2021-03-26 18:48,"The U.S. government generally treats Canada rudely, with the latest episode being the cancellation of the XL pipeline. And Canada is well behind the U.S. in vaccinations. So, send any surplus to Canada, at no charge. It might restore a bit of goodwill north of the border."
2021-03-26 18:13,"Word is, 8.5 million Americans (excluding military) live overseas. I speak for four of them. Most of us are not high-flyers, jetsetters, wealthy, or connected. And though, by law, we pay taxes both in the country we reside in and US taxes, many of us - specifically, those of us who live in ""emerging democracies"" - have no access to any vaccine.

Here in Ukraine, ardent nationalism (despite widespread vaccine skepticism) combined with stoneage politics excludes us from getting a shot. 

Fly back to the States, some suggest. Yep, a roundtrip air ticket, unvaccinated, having somehow avoided global quarantine enforcement.

Would it be impolitic to suggest that *some* of the ""glut"" could find its way into the arms of the willing, excluded, disproportionately unrepresented American expats? Surely, there's a way?"
2021-03-26 17:57,"I think we will see the pandemic for years and years in the future. WHO is alerting over and over that vaccine nationalism doesn't work, because the virus must be contained all over the world. There are so many variants now that reduced significantly the vaccine efficiency and they are still mutating. And here we are again, making the same mistakes."
2021-03-26 18:07,"Everyone who wants a vaccine in the US should get one, including those people who are not computer savvy. That leaves those afflicted by anti-vaccine disinformation. It is not clear that we are going to do with those who choose to be viral mutation reservoirs. Surplus vaccines at that point should go to Mexico and Canada, then to Central American. Governments should be making plans for this contingency now."
2021-03-26 18:18,"If the U.S hoards vaccines that it does not need , because of internal politics, when there is a shortage in other parts of the world which will inevitably result in loss of life, this will lead to a deep mistrust from the rest of the world."
2021-03-26 19:09,"The disease is not conquered until essentially the whole world is vaccinated, so we need to go full-speed ahead, relabelling if and when needed, and sharing as soon as we can.  This is an opportunity for restoring US global credibility and leadership that won't come again soon.  Because of the variants, we have to move ASAP in our own interests.  I would like to see a ""Covid Corps,"" not just redirecting vaccines  abroad but a full-out effort to make trained personnel available, especially in places like Brazil which is so important to our interests.  Or Cuba since, where possible, we're helping people regardless of their governments.  The ""Covid Corps"" would be a temporary designation and encompass our hospital ships, available military, volunteer medical personnel, relative parts of the Peace Corps, etc.  Like the French Foreign Legion, we would welcome foreign volunteers into our Covid Corps, but it would be a US-led effort underscoring our vision that we see it in our national interests to take leadership in a global solution as helps people where they most need it.   I remember meeting a now departed Japanese who had been a TB sufferer as a child after WWII and was grateful his whole life for the attention he received from American medical volunteers.  Despite the enormous improvement, I don't yet see the kind of big visionary leadership now required."
2021-03-26 15:44,"“You have my word: We will manage the hell out of this operation,” Biden declared.  No kidding around here.  Like him or not Biden focuses on problem solving, not distraction, blame shifting, or division.  And the results speak for themselves.  A glut is what I would refer to as a good problem."
2021-03-26 18:27,"Look, if you don't want the AstraZeneca – if you think it's poison – that's cool. Let us buy it. Or give it to the people of Brazil or Africa. Sell it to Europe. Anything. I had my first AZ dose a month ago in the UK. I get my second in five weeks if there's enough vaccine here to provide for it. It's life-saving stuff, providing 100% protection against hospitalisation and death, and I am so grateful to have had my first dose. If your scientists don't agree that's fine. To each their own. It's not like you're short of options. But know this: Sitting on 50 million doses while prevaricating, contemplating, thinking, or worst of all, deciding what would LOOK best – this is shockingly selfish. It is a crime to sit on stockpiles of vaccine right now. It is *murder* to sit on stockpiles of vaccine right now. Distribute it now. Share it. Sell it. Move it out. Do *something*. To do nothing is mass murder. Nothing should not be an option. May is too late. Move now."
2021-03-26 20:31,"Surplus, I am 66 and still can't get one here."
2021-03-26 19:50,"Time for the Federal Government to ""supplement"" the efforts of states falling seriously behind.

Take NYS, for example, where the Governor very much under attack has either been distracted ... or couldn't see a way to monetize vaccination.... So he and the Mayor of NYC each came up with a poor registration system and competed for arms.

Smart.

Seriously, NYS is ahead of 3 states as of March 25th when it comes to the percent of over 65's vaccinated. (This in a state where a nursing home Covid death scandal is the best reason to remove him from office.)

Those states are Hawaii, Alabama and Arizona. Mississippi edges out NY but a very small amount.

National Guard units have helped deal with hurricanes in the past - effectively, I believe I read. Why can't they do something similar with vaccinations.

This is the NEW YORK Times and it's where I'm writing from, so why not take any and all recruiting stations and make sure that each of them is able to vaccinate upon request!

This is a time we DO need ""boots on the ground,"" just making sure that they can ""give a shot"" as well as they can take one on a range or a battlefield."
2021-03-26 19:37,"The Lend lease program in WW2 sent American supplies to our Allies who needed them. 

Supplying vaccines to our Allies now would    be close to that in spirit. USA claims to be so rich and mighty.   It should be as generous  in this different kind of war. 

(We could also ship off several hundred million guns.)"
2021-03-26 20:31,Let's repair our damaged image worldwide by helping vaccinate every citizen of the world. It will be a great humanitarian gesture and America should lead the way in helping to vaccinate ALL that need it.
2021-03-26 20:39,"One would have expected in such an article the actual numbers of ordered doses.

A quick look into the internet seems to show that the US (population 330 million) has either ordered or has options to purchase 1.1 billion doses of vaccine!  Enough vaccine for 800 million people.

Count ‘em:  300 million each from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, 200 million from Johnson and Johnson and an option on 300 million doses of AstraZeneca."
2021-03-26 18:41,Clearly a time is coming when they will beg folk to get the vaccine. By then it may be proven without any doubt that the vaccines either work or do not.

My understanding is that a higher percentage of Americans would
have to be vaccinated for the United States to reach herd immunity.

If I am correct , what is the plan ?"
2021-03-26 13:55,"This is a no-brainer. 

Flood Europe and Japan and other countries with strong refrigeration capacity with Pfizer and Moderna and ship the AZ-Oxford and J&J extra doses to all the places with spotty power / refrigeration. 

Also make vaccination mandatory in the US, and for travel, inside or outside the US. 

After 80 million old white people have had the shot and haven’t freed up their Social Security, I think we can stop scaring people with the ghosts of Tuskegee."
2021-03-26 19:42,"The US needs to get at least 1 dose of the COVID vaccine to at least 50% of the population in all regions of the US.  We aren’t there yet – only 26% have received at least one dose.

In order to identify what percentage of the US population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, it is helpful to compare with the country that has the best vaccination campaign in the world:  Israel.

Israel had one of the worst pandemics in the world, but it has been rapidly immunizing its entire population, including most of the elderly.  Among those who have been immunized, infection rates and deaths have dropped sharply.  Most of the COVID in Israel is now the contagious UK variant.

Israel now has 53% fully vaccinated with 2 doses, and an additional 6% with one dose. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html</a>

Herd immunity may be achieved in Israel by the end of March.  Can COVID be defeated even if there are significant pockets of anti-vaxxers?  The next few weeks should put this to a test.

The UK has 44% partially immunized, but only 4% with two doses.  Still, the UK seems to be approaching  herd immunity.

The US needs to continue focusing on vaccinating more Americans in all states, before substantial doses can be redistributed to other countries.  That will take at least 2 months more."
2021-03-26 19:52,"We'll take it, please! Mexico as well. It's in the best interest of the US, since we are the second and third largest trading partners.

2021-03-26 19:39,"What will we do after the emergency passes?  Will we dismantle the production facilities and move them to Mexico or India?  Will we prepare for the next pandemic which could be 1000 times worse.  Imagine the Black Plague.  Watch the Andromeda Strain, The Stand, Contagion.  Read about the Spanish Flu which killed the  young and vital.  People refuse to understand, Covid was a 1 out of 10 on the Pandemic Scale.  I'm sorry grandma died but imagine if 80% of children under 10 had died."
2021-03-26 18:02,"Fueled by the Covid pandemic, world trade fell almost ten per cent last year. The world economy - despite massive relief programs - shrank almost five per cent. Many tens of millions of jobs - not only here in the USA but all over the world - hinge on getting Covid under control. In today's world economy, we are all literally connected. 

The only way to stop Covid variants metastasizing - risking even undermining our own now successful vaccine efforts - is to make vaccines available as quickly as possible worldwide. 

It is totally welcome good news there may be a vaccine glut soon here in the USA. Let's plan for it. Let's plan for sending vaccines around the world to all who need them just as soon as we can. Let's start Now!

Our economy and society and the world's will be far better for it. 

This could be the US's modern Marshall Plan. And it could be as beneficial - more likely more so."

2021-03-26 20:20,"Okay, we've put on our own oxygen mask --- now it's time for everyone else.    Give these away to all our neighbors in the world, starting in countries that share our borders (Mexico could use them - don't know about Canada) and then Central America and then South America and just keep giving it away.    This seems like the only logical thing to do.   But first make sure everyone here who could possibly want a shot gets it."
2021-03-26 21:25,"It is pretty sad that people can't read properly or do math.  The excess doses are due in months, not now.  The problem is what to do in 3 months AFTER everyone who wants a vaccination has gotten one.  It is like ordering frozen steaks where you get 20 this month for a party you are going to have and there are 50 more coming in six weeks and you can't eat them all.  You might have a shortage now, but you will soon have a surplus and no freezer space."
2021-03-26 21:10,"It's sad to see how AstraZeneca is being treated. One of the bigger pharmaceutical companies, the British-Swedish company had never really done anything with vaccines. But having nothing to help fight Covid-19 in its portfolio, it decided to step in and make on a non-profit basis the vaccine developed by the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. 

AstraZeneca has made some missteps, sure. Making vaccines is a complex process, with its own quirks, particularly in clinical trials and supply chain issues. A neophyte is going to have to learn by doing. 

But none of the missteps have been particularly troubling. And there's no excuse for the AstraZeneca vaccine -- one that has been approved for use in 70 other countries -- not being approved in the United States. Or for the fact that millions of doses of the vaccine are sitting unused on shelves. 

Tony Fauci and his fellow Faucists owe it to all of us to use better judgment on some of these issues. Stop thinking that they always know what's best and should maintain tight control over this process. Sometimes they don't."

2021-03-26 21:10,"It’s going to make a lot of economic sense for the USA to direct its initial excess vaccine supply to its two nearest physical neighbours, Canada and Mexico, who also happen to be among its biggest trading partners. 

Bringing Canada and Mexico up to the same vaccination speed as America would allow the physical borders to reopen all the sooner, boosting economic activity in all three countries further. 

Ultimately though, no one is truly safer until the world is vaccinated."
2021-03-26 21:55,"Please share the vaccine with the world. China and Russia are doing so, shouldn't the US?

Until the world gets vaccinated none of us are truly safe. Plus, it's the right thing to do."
2021-03-26 21:37,"People refusing to be vaccinated will soon constitute a majority of those dying of the coronavirus.

Yes, America will soon have a glut of vaccines available to anyone that wants one, but many will die unvaccinated while unused vaccines lie in storage feet away from the bed they'll die in.

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them get vaccinated.

America will achieve herd immunity via a combination of vaccinated individuals and the survivors of those unvaccinated after the rest of them die needlessly."
2021-03-26 22:24,"This rather breathless headline about a ""looming glut of vaccines"" sensationalizes quotidian reality. This is not some new problem on the verge of becoming a crisis. Instead, it's a gradual and expected shift that will simply require more of the planning that has been going on since Operation Warp Speed began back in May 2020. 

All along, decisions about export licenses and approvals and orders have been made as they needed to be made. Discussions and negotiations between government people and company people go on regularly. Plans have been made. It's been all business, not political. That Donald Trump left office and Joe Biden took over has meant next to nothing. Most of the people involved are still the same. Most of the issues are the same. 

The objective all along has been to get vaccines developed, tested, approved, made, distributed, and shot into shoulders as soon as possible. Expense has not been much of an issue. Our focus has been on the United States, but not exclusively. We have not restricted vaccine makers from freely taking orders from countries around the world. They own the vaccines, not us. We shouldn't try to control what they do with them. 

It's good to see the progress that has been made in the fight against the virus. It will be better to see vaccines spread to even the poorest of countries. We can help best by contributing money to Covax. Then let other countries decide themselves how to best address their needs."
2021-03-26 15:31,Our vaccines need to be accompanied by our own teams of vaccinators to make sure governments like Mexico don't sell them to the highest bidder.

2021-03-26 21:22,Vaccinate everyone. Those anti-vaccers must be convinced for the benefit of all.
2021-03-26 22:25,"Much easier to send our neighbors and other countries in need - no politics, please - the pill that Pfizer is working on. Works like HIV treatment.
Remember when the Salk vaccine became the Sabin swallow?"
2021-03-26 23:55,"A family member of mine is living on a U.S. military installation in South Korea with a history of two combat stints in the Army and is a veteran now serving the United States government. 
He and his family can not and have no future knowledge of a scheduled date for a vaccine program.
At a time when individuals are scamming the systems, jumping the lines and getting vaccines out of turn, it is shameful that the US is not prioritizing our family members serving in very vulnerable locations across the globe."
2021-03-27 0:54,"From WW1 & WW2, we have spent most of our time, money and  intelligence to have a sufficient stock of small arms to a stock pile of nuclear arsenals for the destructive purpose.

We have been paying a heavy price for our failure to learn lessons from the history of the global pandemic a century ago and a series of its outburst as communicable diseases 
from pathogens since then.

The time is up for the mathematical models to enhance the throughput of the world's total vaccine plants in the near future based on the population density, Health index, PPE availability ,adherence to Hygiene etc.
 
In my expectation, the variants of Covid-19 may sporadically rise its head hear and there for a decade with a descending  order of virulence till the disappearance of its last traces.

My thanks and appreciation to the Prime Minister of the largest democracy, Modiji and the POTUS, Mr. Biden and 
VP Mrs.Kamala Haris of the oldest democracy for their visit to the manufacturing units of the vaccine and follow up.

By the time we achieve 75% of the vaccination of the world, the rest 25% would have reached herd immunity.
But the WHO's motto must be to vaccinate all human being on the earth.

One of the challenges before the science today is to unravel  the origin of the virus an hence the tweaking of the vaccines against the variants also has been challenging.

The reverse engineering of the last variant to the mother virus of the Covid-19 may yield us a definitive picture in a decade."
2021-03-27 0:21,"“How to Handle a Looming Glut of Vaccine”

Since no one knows how long the vaccines offer protection, best to keep some in reserve in case boosters are needed."
2021-03-27 2:09,"What to do with our excess vaccine supply? Are you kidding me? Wasn’t it Biden who said at his news conference yesterday that Democracy is in an existential battle with the forces of autocracy worldwide? Okay, so he may not have been quite so succinct. Still, with Putin pulling out all the stops to put its Sputnik-V into as many African, Asian and South American arms as it can, you’d think this administration understands the stakes of leaving the rest of the world to the mercy (and influence) of the Russians as we waltz our way out of the pandemic. More to the point, you’d think the value of spreading American ingenuity and offering a helping hand to countries plagued by both Covid and corrupt leaders would strike them as a no brainer."
2021-03-27 2:49,"Anyone remember just three months ago? Who would have thought in March that too much vaccine would be described as a “dilemma “?
Thank you Joe Biden for this problem. Please continue making more problems like this for us."
2021-03-24 18:13,"The story reports that tourists and visitors to the island are just getting a supply of doses that the local population is not interested in receiving.  Are we sure that is the case?  And if the Virgin Islands are receiving more supply that is outpacing local demand shouldn't that supply be sent to locales that are demanding more vaccine? 

I have questions about the logistics of how the vaccine is administered.

Only the J&J dose which has only more recently become available is a 1 shot vaccination.  Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots that are spaced 20+ days apart.  

I am assuming most tourists are not staying that long in the Virgin Islands so how do they go about getting the 2nd dose?"
2021-03-24 19:00,"Fantastic article! I am eligible & have been vaccinated in my state. So this article made me consider the Virgin Islands as a vacation destination where Americans can legally go now. Good for us, good for them!"
2021-03-24 19:10,"The problem is that we are vaccinating tourists coming from other countries too, do we have enough vaccines for everyone? Right now no. Right now 80+ people are still waiting for appointments or for getting vaccines in Florida for example but tourists from South America, including Argentina, are getting vaccinated. Tourists , not residents. They sign up with passport numbers or without any number and get appointments. De Santis knows, everyone in Florida knows, he wants their business so he doesn't stop it. But Florida residents are paying the price right now. Is great to vaccinate foreign tourists if we have enough vaccines for everyone, but we don't."
2021-03-24 19:11,So interesting that they are welcoming of vaccine tourism. Makes me long to return to these beautiful islands. I hope their residents stay healthy.
2021-03-24 20:22,"This is all an outgrowth of overly stringent regulations on who can get vaccinated in each state, which are not necessary now that most nursing home residents and employees have been vaccinated along with frontline medical workers. Avail the vaccine to everyone, quit wasting doses, and allow those most eager to get the vaccine to get it. Focus on the hesitants once the eagers are out of the way. We all need to get vax'd eventually."
2021-03-24 20:37,"The disparities created from being motivated by facts versus fictions have metastized from politics to public health and beyond. I can speak with one person I am close to and hear their desparation for the covid vaccine and then speak with another person who will not take the vaccine ""under any circumstances."" 

This is why the stability of our society is at stake, based largely on whether what people believe is fact and science based or misinformation, with a big dose of fear and anger resulting from that misinformation. I hope Biden succeeds in straightening out at least some of the deceived among us."
2021-03-24 20:42,"I have no issues with people in their 50s with asthma traveling to get vaccinated.  Indeed, I don’t understand why there isn’t more focus on vaccinating people with higher-risk medical conditions (of all ages), rather than opening it up to everyone."
2021-03-24 20:48,"This just makes no sense, why is US Virgin Islands getting more supply than their size. As someone who lives in North East I see some states near us having vaccines open for almost everyone but not my state. Government in the islands should there should make vaccines eligible for everyone living there with a grace period of a month or two. Whoever does not  get a shot after 2 months should be left behind and those shots diverted to elsewhere in US. This is a perfect example on how rich can skip the line."
2021-03-24 20:59,"I'm wondering what kind of public health campaigns are going on in these places. Are there TV ads educating the population? Maybe even showing that tourists are getting the vaccines (so they must  not be dangerous since so many people covet them and are taking the risk). TV messaging is crucial and in the long run cheaper than having to care for increased hospitalizations. We need studies about the hesitancy. Are there sociologists on the ground interviewing and investigating among different sectors in the population? Why is it that in a place like Cuba there is no such hesitancy to get vaccinated? This is an important study not just for now, but for the future, for the other epidemics awaiting in line in the near and far future."
2021-03-24 21:03,"Don’t know how to feel about this... As long as the only reason there are extra vaccines is because locals truly refuse to take them (and not just because it’s a convenient excuse for the authorities), I hope that it would both protect locals and visitors (often the vector for new infections, if local rates are kept low), as well as provide an economic shot in the arm (pun not intended ;)."
2021-03-24 21:18,"In Minnesota 50-64 year old people come after all the 20 year old people working in groceries, restaurants, bars, logistics and all of the state's manufacturing workforce. As  a Professor, in my 60s, I am not considered as an ""essential worker"" and as per my state, my turn will come in May. President Biden in any case has asked states to open up to everyone in May. That said many of the pharmacies are now not able to fill the vaccine slots due to not enough uptake in the younger population while those in their 60s not part of the defined essential categories are anxious to get one. However, I would not take the risk of flying to the Caribbean to take a shot. The risk of catching during the journey and worse infecting the non-vaccinated residents of the island is high. It would be very sad if an islander were to die due to getting an infection from me. It is safer to continue to shelter in my own state for my turn."
2021-03-24 18:25,"In Texas, if you want an appointment, you look to the republican red counties. The anti-science views mean there is a surplus available for us science believing city-slickers."
2021-03-24 18:31,A vacation and a vaccination! Can't beat it
2021-03-24 18:53,"Every part of this story is awesome.  People are getting vaccinated, flight attendants have something to do, restaurants have new customers, and on and on.  The end of this pandemic is going to be as uneven and unfair as the beginning.  For those who get the NYT Morning Newsletter, today's top story was ""Bad News Bias.""  So let's take a break from that and enjoy a story that is about nothing but beating the virus and getting back to normal."
2021-03-24 19:51,"I'm happy for all of those who are privileged enough to have the time and $$ to fly to the Virgin Islands to get vaccinated, while at the same time being in a low enough risk group that traveling during the pandemic isn't a worry for them. 

Meanwhile in Minnesota, if you are 64 with high blood pressure (the most common underlying condition among folks hospitalized with Covid-19), you are still deemed ineligible to get a shot.  Just today another young person (20-24yrs old), with one underlying condition, died here of Covid-19, and that group is also still ineligible to be vaccinated in our state because under 50s need to have 2 listed conditions to get the shot.  

I'm sure there is a logic to this somehow, I'm just having a hard time figuring out what that logic is.  Don't get me wrong -- the situation is a hundred times better now than it was under Trump, and getting better every day -- but in terms of vaccine equity, I think we still have a very long way to go."
2021-03-24 20:26,"I had my first shot today. Though I was eligible in first phase in January, I was waiting for Johnson & Johnson's ""one and done"" vaccine.

Governor's weekly televised/online update Mar 14, 2021 announced J&J vaccine now in territory but limited distribution to homeless, home bound, etc.

I called the list of vaccine providers and none had J&J. I later decided to just go ahead with whatever the labs had. Most people I know had already been vaccinated.

I called the number for our widely publicized Emergency Managemment office which is working with the University of the Virgin Islands to administer the vaccine. I had also heard about vaccine hesitancy and thought I could get appointment next day.

The next available appointment was 2 weeks away so I told them I would check elsewhere. One private practice has a recording saying they have a wait list so I called others on the list.

I called one and was able to get an appointment 2 days later (today). I received my vaccine today, but I had to register and show ID.

When I said it looked much easier on national TV where people were getting vaccination while sitting in their cars, I was told that some vaccine providers were not requiring recipients to provide full documentation.

If I have to wait 2 weeks for a vaccination, who are the people on the list? The local government reports say the VI is on target to meet the vaccination goal. WITH SO MUCH CONFLICTING INFO WHO DO YOU TRUST?"
2021-03-24 20:44,Really? Most of the island get shots for their citizens not for vacationers and you must have residency
2021-03-24 21:05,"I'm 64 and can't get vaccinated, despite doing volunteer work out in the public spaces.  I was supposed to get one, but the state moved the goalposts so that instead of people over 60, any adult with a BMI of over 30 can get one. That's 35% of the population. So, a healthy obese 18 year old can get a jab, but not a healthy person over 60. If I had the money, I'd be booking my flight, too. Vaccine distribution in my state has been a clown car in a dumpster fire."
2021-03-24 22:15,"so if they can count it - why can't they ask for proof of residency

I would also suggest to catch some and arrest them, nothing like a  huge fine and 2 days in jail to warn others not to try to"
2021-03-24 19:17,"So, the old expression Rank Has It’s Privileges —  RHIP — has not changed to AHIP￼.... ‘A’ standing for Affluence, like “Warm up the G5, I wana hit the Bahamers Harold￼!”"
2021-03-24 22:26,"Well, get the first shot in the US Virgin Islands, then stay for 3 weeks to get the 2nd shot?"
2021-03-24 22:54,Interesting. I was able to get a vaccine after Walgreens said doses were going to waste because people were flaking on appointments. I signed up and my eligibility wasn’t questioned.
2021-03-24 23:51,The focus of so many NY Times articles these past few months is on the perceived injustice of people getting the vaccine before other “more deserving people”. I’m glad this article addressed the real issue—vaccine hesitancy. Don’t shame tourists for getting the vaccine. Shame the locals whose hesitation made that vaccine available. The goal is herd immunity. We need vaccines in arms to accomplish this goal. Shame those who refuse to vaccinate and put shots in arms of all willing adults.
2021-03-25 0:10,"My understanding is that vaccine tourism is also a reality in Texas.  Many Mexicans are now flying there to get vaccines.  Just as in the US Virgin Islands, Mexican tourists are just waking in and getting their COVID-19 vaccine.   This could be because ,according to reports, 59% of Texans are reluctant to get the vaccine.  <a href=""https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/23/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-white-republicans"" target=""_blank"">https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/23/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-white-republicans</a>/  Texas' loss is Mexico's gain.   The good news is that the vaccines on hand in the Lone Star State are not going to waste."
2021-03-25 1:09,"If we are going to be floating Statehood for DC and Puerto Rico, it’s only fair we offer it to the Virgin Islands."
2021-03-25 1:59,At this point just give it to anyone who wants it. That's the fastest way out of this. We (Nevada) open to everyone April 5.
2021-03-25 13:20,"If the US Virgin Islands has extra vaccine due to the fact people are ""reluctant"" to take it, they should send the vaccine to a place where it is needed. If this was so important why don't we have one global approach or at least one American approach? The answer is America & the Western world is a business and it is ""everyone for themselves"".  I don't fault tourists who have been raised in this environment, nor do I fault people who choose to not risk putting a vaccine in their arms. I fault the US Virgin Islands Government for putting tourism revenues over global health. We need to just skip the swearing-in ceremony of politicians and just have them just swear allegiance to getting what they can."
2021-03-25 11:58,"Just curious ... with the assumption that these tourists are not in St. Croix for 3 or 4 weeks, how do they get their 2nd shot?"
2021-03-25 12:03,"Endlessly trying to convince minorities to get the vaccine is counterproductive propaganda. This is the modern version of ""white man's burden"" Restrict the availability to minorities or threaten to charge for it soon and they may change their minds."
2021-03-25 16:50,Personally I think they're irresponsible traveling to an ISLAND unvaccinated. Stay home.
2021-03-25 16:00,"Opening quote is incorrect ""Nowhere else in the U.S. can you actually just walk in and get the vaccine."" The Osage Tribe Health Center in Pawhuska, Oklahoma has shots available to anyone who presents themselves for the vaccine."
2021-03-23 13:39,"In New York on october 15, the heat goes on in every apartment building in the tri state area.One month later 1.000 people in nyc were in the hospital with covid.The point is you can get this in your own home.The nursing home patients did not go out.Also, nobody realizes that the hospitals were not releasing patients with covid back to the nursing homes.These patients were fully recovered,that's why they were sent back.Also,the same exact thing is still and has been going on for months in ny.The investigation will show that this was normal procedure.If a patient gets pheumonia they will come back to a nursing home after they recover.A hospital does not release someone unless they are deemed recovered."
2021-03-23 14:05,"My mother is 98 and lives at her home in NJ. For months, I have been calling hospitals, her doctors' offices, Visiting Nurse associations, and even her town borough offices, in hopes of arranging for her to be vaccinated in her home -- or even to find a drive thru vaccination site. Her doctor warned that because she is frail and vulnerable, I should avoid taking her to get vaccinated where she is waiting on line with others. It's been so disappointing that no plans were in place to help the population of homebound seniors like her. Fortunately, I reached out to a local independent pharmacy and they were so accommodating. They said the pharmacist would come right out to the car to give her her shot. We were so grateful! It's good to finally see this subject addressed in your article."
2021-03-23 14:24,"The pieces are quickly falling into place in N.Y. and all around the USA for folks of all ages and circumstances to get the inoculation if they desire. Monitoring how variants arise, efficacy holds and transmissibility occurs are the watchwords going forward."
2021-03-23 15:01,"Please do this everywhere, America!"
2021-03-23 14:42,"If people are homebound are they really at risk? I appreciate the noble nature of this, but at the same time the best path for herd immunity is to maximize shots in arms. This feels like a waste of resources given the current race against the clock."
2021-03-23 14:28,"Please come to me on 2nd avenue. I have been isolated for a year and a half, because walking is so difficult.  Just waiting to be helped. Appreciate this article."
2021-03-23 16:06,"Yes! Yes! Yes! My 92 year old mother is blind and in a wheelchair. Both her legs and left arm no longer work. We were able to finally, after months of trying, get an appointment at a county immunization site, but we realized that we could not get her there except by medical transport, and they were not interested in standing in line. When Walgreens started scheduling appointments, after complicated logistics planning, we were able to get her there.

My mother isn’t afraid of dying, she’s a tough old bird, but she doesn’t want to die alone in a hospital ward somewhere suffocating.

What about all the tens of thousands of these people? In what we pride ourself on being the world’s most developed country, why is this so hard?! Is this the best we can do?"
2021-03-23 16:01,"this is the modern day equivalent of a sled dog delivering vaccines during blizzards  during a previous epidemic.

these people are heroes."
2021-03-23 18:18,I'm happy to see that someone is thinking of this issue.  I wish more would.  I don't understand the lack of attention from public health officials on this.  It seems patently obvious that many elderly can't wait on line or walk long distances in a football stadium to be vaccinated.
2021-03-23 17:30,"“she had been unable to travel to her native North Carolina and visit with relatives since the pandemic hit, and she was hopeful the vaccine would give her the freedom to do so”
How is this person declared homebound and needing a doctor to vaccinate her exclusively, yet looking to travel from NY to NC?"
2021-03-23 19:56,"This kind of program seems perfect for the J & J vaccine, since that only requires one shot and it is a bit less critical in storage. And those are tow of the problems with at home care – time and situation control. If there is any way to direct the J & J vaccine to this program, it should be done."
2021-03-23 22:28,Why are primary care physicians not being utilized to administer the vaccine to their patients?
2021-03-23 22:28,"My 86-year-old friend lives alone in Los Angeles. He is homebound, trapped in a wheelchair since his leg was amputated two years ago.  On his behalf I've called Medicare, United Healthcare, L.A. County Health Dept., a local pharmacy, social service agencies, etc. begging for someone to come to his home with a vaccine.  No one has helped.  The usual response, ""we don't have staff to come to him; not enough vaccine available; I'll call him when we have the vaccine."""
2021-03-23 22:45,"I have long wondered why public health officials don't use the networks and schedules already in place. For many suburban areas a group of health care workers can simply notify residents that they will be in your neighborhood on the day the garbage truck shows up. Notification can be accomplished through utility bills, Nextdoor, and reverse 911 voicemail messages. I would be watching the garbage truck and outside in a heartbeat."
2021-03-23 22:54,My friend's husband and two disabled sons are currently in an ICU with covid.  Her sons disabilities are so severe that they were unable to leave the home for the vaccine.   None of their doctors were able to offer any help in bringing a vaccine to them.  We cannot forget about the homebound.
2021-03-23 22:55,"The State of Vermont vaccinated homebound seniors by utilizing the services of the home health agencies from whom they were already receiving care as well as employees of local ambulance services. Homebound individuals who do not regularly receive health visitors could call and request an appointment and vaccines were then delivered by ambulance services and members of the national guard. The service continues as vaccines are made available to new age groups. Given that this is a mainly rural state it was not an easy undertaking but, like the entire vaccine rollout here, it was well planned and well carried out."
2021-03-23 23:13,If they’re homebound then they’re fine. Get schools open first. The Boomers have acted so selfishly as to steal a year from their grandchildren’s education. The Worst Generation.
2021-03-23 22:40,Maybe efforts should be focused on those who have a longer runway in life? People have to pass on at some point.
2021-03-24 0:50,"I spent half a day trying to get a vaccine appointment, now that I qualify.  I had to navigate the system and follow some crazy 'cheating the program"" moves that required some nimble ""am not a bot"" moves that left me exhausted. Elderly  homebound folks without access to internet or little experience using apps to navigate the crazy-difficulties of the system to luck-out on an appointment, absolutely need the vaccines to come to them."
2021-03-24 0:43,"Is this the best utilization of physicians? Doing the job of visiting nurses? Or, is this for the optics? Come on, Northwell, why weren’t RNs and NPs used for this story? Everyone knows nurses give the best shots."
2021-03-24 2:16,"I am sorry people complain. This rollout of vaccines is a logistically complex . I think it is getting better. Trying to vaccinate about 200  million people as fast as possible is mindboggling. Today I got my second shot in Morris County NJ. The site is vaccinating 4000 a day - 20 registration stations, 30  for shots. Well manage, National Guard, police and volunteer all keeping the line moving according to time of appointment. It is impressive to say the least.  Many very old in line in wheelchairs, with canes. 

Yes, the homebound need to be reached as do those in rural and urban areas. Let's give the system time to work out all the kinks and scenarios. The one shot, no deep cold J&J vaccine will provide new logistic options."
2021-03-22 11:18,"Rushing to reopen is - like the last few times when apparently no one learned the lesson - a huge and tragic mistake. It’ll mostly be brown people who continue to pay the cost of these decisions, of course."
2021-03-22 11:37,"Our State is accepting 1 Billion Dollars for its Transit system; however, closing Bus Routes and reducing Subway Schedules. In the South Red States are using the money to lower Taxes.  Both of these issues should be dealt with and money returned if not used for Covid."
2021-03-22 11:46,Biden’s problem is that he trusts science . . . But science sometimes proves itself wrong.  You can never avoid politics.
2021-03-22 12:12,"Math is hard, especially if you only have a journalism degree.
But a little math here might help:
121 million jabs so far
250 million adults
Call it 3 million jabs/day including second jabs
That means that we'll get to 250 million jabs in 43 days.
To get to ""herd immunity"" among adults, or 180 million people, we'll reach that number in 20 more days.
Since there is >80% protection with just the first jab, assume that herd immunity takes place 20 days from now.
So, by the middle of April we've hit the key herd immunity milestone.
In another month, we'll have 90 million more jabs. That'll augment immunity for some, and extend beyond 180 million adults. 
Math tells us: we're at herd immunity by April 15, and have completed all second shots and vaccinated the rest by the end of May."
2021-03-22 12:25,"Too much and too late by the Federal Government.  

Similar, to 2009, the government arrives after the worst is behind us.

The economy will snap back regardless of sending most families checks.  A lot of people, saved and paid down bills over the past 12 months.   The economy is outside idling with a full tank of gas, ready to go.

Instead of targeting areas of need, we have to shotgun approach.  The only targets likely to be hit are the wallets of future generation stuck with this legacy of debt."
2021-03-22 12:33,"Good luck.  As a consulting systems engineer, at one of my clients I witnessed hourly workers quit mid-day when their cellphone alerted them that their bank account had received the stimulus direct deposit. Two other company clients are unable to hire hourly folks regardless of how high they go with wage rates. Therefore, my direct and 100% factual experience is that Joe’s stimulus is counterproductive to attaining 4% unemployment."
2021-03-22 12:35,"The majority of the damage, or rather, problems with, to the economy, is permanent. 

Most of the lost jobs in the service industry will never return and there will be no jobs to replace them.

Our, consumption based economy, has been shown to be the house of cards it really always was.

Schools have been exposed for what they really are. Daycare.

Our ""healthcare"" system has been crippled and revealed for what it really is. A house of cards that collapses from the stress of a finger push.

Americans have been exposed for what they really are. Borderline psychotic. Where the slightest thing (wearing a mask) is imagined as some gross infringement on their largely illusory freedoms.

It's over, and been a long time coming. Get used to it and to living within your means or below for the future. 

And, speaking of the future, pity any children alive or being born soon, there is absolutely no future for them. 

Good night America. It was fun while it lasted. But then again, it's the endless pursuit of fun which brought us to this point in the first place."
2021-03-22 12:49,"Actually Biden made the things worse: By setting the goal low at 100 million shots in 100 days when almost 1.5M was administering when he took office.  He created additional bureaucratic levels to enforce ""equitable"" distribution. Before taking office he and Kamala created doubts in people's minds, especially his base, about the Trump vaccine. After they took office they lied to the people that they had to start everything from scratch. Despite all these roadblocks, vaccination has been going on basically as planned by Trump at a rate of 2.5M daily."
2021-03-22 12:49,"I think only vaccines can save the country now. With a lot of people refusing to social distance or use masks, the virus is probably going to be a problem in the US for years or decades! People better hope it goes away eventually or the vaccines work well! But if it stays around for years, even the young today will grow old eventually, and they’ll sleep in the bed they’re making now by refusing to be considerate of the older and weaker!! The younger or healthy now are acting selfishly, but they’ll not always be young and healthy!! And another pandemic may happen sooner or later! The policies and decisions being made today will determine who lives or dies prematurely decades or years from now! Vaccines may not always be made as fast as the ones this time. I hope the selfishness today isn’t forgotten in the future when another pandemic threatens the old then, who’re the selfish young today."
2021-03-22 12:54,"Schools MUST reopen.  I’m tired of paying teachers not to educate my children.  I know they’re working incredibly hard, harder than ever: but no one thinks it’s working.  And the losses to children, to parents, and to the teachers themselves are now permanent. 
Yes, “kids are resilient” but they’ll take years to return to grade level in reading and math, never mind the terrible mental health and social struggles they have, and that they’re now all addicted to screens.  Addictive behavior is forever.  Parents’ jobs and careers are destroyed in ways that will decimate our families for decades as well as setting women’s role in our workplaces back 25 years.  
And teachers: forget about it.  You complained nonstop that our society saw you as “child care” instead of stepping up to play your part.  Yes: we did expect you to care ABOUT children.  I went to work, in person, every day, because sick people needed me.  My children needed you, and each other, IN SCHOOL.  Screens are no replacement and you knew it.  Our public trust in your profession: damaged forever."
2021-03-22 12:58,"Judging from what we are seeing throughout the country with the notion that we have defeated this virus, I do see Americans returning to in-person everything in the coming months--and this is just the problem--we shouldn't. We have not defeated this virus by any means. A true defeat can only come if we maintain mask wearing, social distancing, an efficient testing program, and, of course, we all get vaccinated. But, as we see from the riots in Miami, I do not see from my fellow Americans the will or discipline to truly defeat this virus."
2021-03-22 13:04,"My fear is that this nearly $2 trillion package will go down as one of the greatest blunders in political history.  The sheer amount of money involved is excessive, and sets the stage for a newfound welfare state that keeps the indigent firmly attached to the spigot of free money without having to work.  The unemployment rate will only drop to the 4% level the Biden administration envisions if millions simply remove themselves from the workforce and live off new child credits and such.   Meanwhile, inflation will rise as the wealthy unleash their $1 trillion in savings after not being able to spend in 2020, devaluing whatever funds poorer Americans live on, meaning they will require even more.  This will not end well, I'm afraid."
2021-03-22 13:08,"Focus on the virus, streamline the vaccination process, and the economy will take care of itself.   Had Trump and his acolytes nor been in such a blind rush to ""reopen the economy,"" we'd be in a far better place right now."
2021-03-22 12:51,"Let's be clear. The headline unemployment rate ( U-3) is meaningless. It tells you nothing. There are currently about 4 million people that have dropped out of work force. If millions more do we can get too 0% for U-3., because they are not counted. 

The measurements that matter are U-6 and the Labor Participation rate. How many people are working is what counts. People don't evaporate. 

Figures may not ""lie."" But, liars sure do figure."

We can't make them and shaming them won't be effective either, so we'll just have to deal with it.  If herd immunity won't cover them then it will be up to them to deal with the consequences.  What is irritating is allowing for immigrants to come across our southern border without being tested and vaccinated as a condition of entry.  Apparently the administration feels that their safety is more important than our well being."
2021-03-22 14:23,"The American Rescue Act certainly provides a significant amount of money to contain the downward economic trend.   The challenge is how the money will be spent and who will monitor its allocation and proper spending.

Today, ABC News is reporting about Biden Administration revolving door appointees.   Most of those who worked in the Clinton and, or Obama Administrations increased their wealth exponentially.   This is not to deny anyone success, but these folks come in “compromised.”   Worst among them is Gene Sperling, who the press has mainly protected with silence.  Sperling was quietly named the American Recovery Act’s Czar.  Way too much power for a revolving door appointee and a single person.   There ought to be an oversight committee/ commission to properly oversee its management and provide transparent accounting online.

There’s a rush to open schools, even though the remediation budget seems to be inadequate.   Ventilation, a key element in keeping schools safe and open has been pretty much been ignored in the rush to open schools."
2021-03-22 14:27,"It seems most important to increase the quantity of vaccines in circulation, distribute them evenly and assure that the maximum number of people get vaccinated ASAP.   The federal government is powerless in trying to force people to be vaccinated.  State and local governments may have more power to set requirements, but the best chance seems to be for private businesses to do so.  Transportation companies, for example, can insist that passengers present a valid vaccination record in order to board a plane or train.  A company could impose a vaccination restriction on whom they hire or retain as they frequently do by testing for drug abuse. 

The FDA approved vaccines have proven extraordinarily effective in preventing death and reducing the serious complications of COVID-19.  It's time to stop playing politics and to get down to the business of controlling the pandemic.  A massive public information program aimed at overcoming reluctance to take the vaccine should be the second priority."
2021-03-22 15:07,"The GOP governors and Trump administration were willing to ignore CDC guidelines, encourage people to go out, discourage the use of masks - and thereby allow 500,000 people to die.  All this, to win an election (they believed) and benefit their wealthy donors, who feared an economic crash if all precautions were taken.

They let us die once, for political purposes, why not let us die again, for the same reasons?

Why should we hesitate to believe that to sabotage the Biden administration, which has made clear that its priority is to serve, not the wealthy, but rather working people, including BIPOC, the GOP, including the governors of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Florida, are willing to allow more Americans die? Hence mask requirements are prematurely lifted, businesses operate at 100% capacity, and the message to Trump supporters, particularly men, is ""real men don't get vaccinated.""

 If the virus continues to spread and additional, deadly variants emerge - perhaps weakening or evading the effects of current vaccines - the Republicans, in their view, ""win.""  Biden fails to stop the epidemic; the economy does not recover; the GOP takes back the Senate, and possibly the House, in 2022.

They are killed before, and will kill again.  To the GOP,  power is only and all, and our lives are entirely disposable."
2021-03-22 15:36,"The Biden  administration should read yesterday’s NYT article on stimmies used for stock market stimulus before taking any victory laps on the stimulus package. Over 90 percent of people received stimulus that weren’t in need of the relief package will put it in the market, the bank,or leisure and entertainment. Not money well spent."

Due to the aid packages initiated by Biden, along with the expert advice of his financial appointees, will have been designed to strategic in aiding businesses to reopen as efficiently as possible.  Those states that have violated the recommended health precautions, such as TX and AL, may be indicators of how quickly the employment figures will rebound.  The down side, obviously, is that there will be a larger number of COVID-19 cases, will have the potential of causing more case of death, and needs for intensive care in hospital, along with other long-term symptoms from the untreated COVID-19 virus.  The number of severe medical problems due to premature reopening, may be an indication of the value of a human life in those states.  One might even ponder the fact that the plan seems like the imposition of the death sentence on people in the state who succumb to the COVID-19 virus due to being exposed prematurely and unnecessarily, prior to the time the serum was available for them."
2021-03-22 16:21,"Stimulus checks are actually not for people of modest incomes.  The stimulus was mainly for people with investments.  The average stimulus recipient got $1,200 last Spring and those with investments got a hundred or more times the $1,200 from their investments that were buoyed up by the stimulus checks.  Even comparing higher investment values from January 1st, 2020, (before the Pandemic,) the increasing value of investments made $1,200 seem like a trivial amount.  

     Like some other postings I agree that unemployment rate only measures those that are receiving unemployment.  Those of us who have collected unemployment know that it ends at some point and then it is assumed by the Federal Government that the person is no longer looking for work (i.e. not in the work force.)  There are those who have not seen their jobs return and who have collected all of their allowed benefits.  They are not counted.  

     Then there are all of those folks who do not have a work visa but are in the US looking for work.   They can't collect unemployment benefits at all but you can be sure that they are looking for work and will be competing for jobs with Americans.  

    Our democracy is in peril if we continue to allow immigrants  to come to the US to compete with Americans for jobs.  By all means help them in their own countries but, let's get the US in order first!"
2021-03-22 16:41,"The pandemic cannot be described as "" the wild card"". It is the central problem facing this nation and the world and it is existential. Unless the money, whatever it takes, succeeds in controlling the coronavirus, the 1.9 trillion has failed despite its benefit to millions who are suffering the economic consequences and a lot of this money, I hope, is devoted to preventing another similar pandemic with another novel virus and to stockpile whatever it takes to combat it if prevention fails."
2021-03-22 16:56,"We really need rapid, oral-nasal antigen testing as available and cheap as a pregnancy test. Both are based on the same technology. Antibody testing and PCR testing do not confirm the presence of infectious virus. With PCR testing, small amounts of viral RNA persist and can show up in the absence of infectious virus. 

Do antigen testing in schools and wherever outbreaks are observed. Antigen positive tests mean you are almost certainly contagious. You can then stay home or go to a medical facility for follow-up testing."

2021-03-22 18:09,"It's not a question of President Biden interfering with the FDA. It's a question of him making sure that he's got the right people in charge, making sure they're not indulging in group-think. Basically asking the right questions about how they're making sure they're doing the best job possible.

The former guy demanded certain actions that he thought would benefit him politically. That is utterly wrong. Doesn't mean that a president has to let the FDA operate without any guidance, without any high level oversight. They are bureaucrats & they need overall political guidance to ensure they do a good job for the people. Don't be so silly."
2021-03-22 12:11,"“For the economy to fully bounce back, Americans need to feel confident in returning to shopping, traveling, entertainment and work.”

Regular widespread testing will go a long way to restoring confidence. For example, a combination of a “vaccination passport” and covid tests, including on-site rapid tests, will make travelers feel more comfortable to climb onboard an airplane. On-going testing of a statistically significant sample of a community’s population will give people confidence to visit malls and restaurants if the tests show a low infection rate community-wide. These are the next steps."
2021-03-22 19:14,"The FDA suffers from Thalidomide Derangement Syndrome.  You cannot get into trouble by saying ""No"".   That becomes the automatic response, to almost anything: Delay approving a vaccine for three months while a Phase 3 trial is conducted (makes sense for an improved polio vaccine, when we already have a good one, but not here).  Delay approving tests because we don't know exactly what the false positive and false negative rates are (won't be zero, but better an imperfect test than none at all).  Etc."
2021-03-22 14:20,"Until something that the antivax folks wants or needs is attached to getting the vaccine, they will continue to resist in the name of freedumb.  You must obtain a driver's license, obey traffic signals, and purchase liability insurance to maintain and operate a car for mobility in our country.  Most public school students must show proof of immunizations to attend school.  Why not (at least until the scientists say it is safe) require proof of Covid vaccination for travel on public transportation, large gatherings (sports, concerts, etc), heck, even church.

Yes, we now have an extra layer of protection available to us but why would we throw caution to the winds as some people do. If one drink is good, then three is fine. One donut turns into two or more. With SARS-CoV-2 cases still averaging 55,000 a day, otherwise intelligent people are abandoning their masks in South Carolina and that includes older people more vulnerable to debilitation and death because their immune systems (all older immune systems) don't protect as well at 60 as they did at 40 and Covid variants are multiplying expanding. A sip is not a swallow and a vaccination is not a guarantee."

Wait until everyone is vaccinated? First of all, that's not going to happen. As long as those they interact with are vaccinated or low risk I see no issue. Life is never risk free. And it is fairly short at that age.

An argument I anticipate is the restaurant workers might not be vaccinated. Yes, but I would argue that these folks have been putting up with much more risk to this point, and I'm sure they want customers, and would rather have vaccinated as opposed to unvaccinated customers."

It is crucial to get this information into the public sphere.

2021-03-25 18:49,"The article claims that older people ""represent the vast majority of Americans who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.""

It has become a habit to preface the word ""majority"" with the qualifier ""vast."" What margin qualifies a majority as vast?

A majority of a population is anything greater than 50%. What percentage is a ""vast"" majority? Obviously, it is subjective. Would you agree that 70% is a ""vast"" majority? Would you require a majority to be over 90% before you would call it ""vast?"" I feel certain everyone would agree that 95% is a vast majority.

60% of Americans aged 65-74 have received at least one vaccine dose. That doesn't seem to be a vast majority, but rather a simple majority. Of those Americans over 75, the percentage is 65%. Again, this seems not a vast majority.

Furthermore, the American population over the age of 65 amounts to only 17% overall. Indeed, doses have gone more to the older than other age groups. Let's just not employ hyperbole in their quantification.

Older people, who represent the majority of Americans who are fully vaccinated...

Our government does not market and promote it's success like corporations do.

The Chinese vaccines perhap provide an answer.....it was large government money, rather than private innovation. The Chinese are the largest maker of vaccines in the world.  I'm not sure if those vaccines are as effective as teh Western varieties.  And I'm quite sure someone in China is profiting from their distribution.

2021-03-21 14:23,"Events like a war or a pandemic can vastly compress time frames. Ordinarily drug companies are given 17 to 20 years of the run of a patent to first recovery costs and then make profits. But remember that when a patent expires the company is not required to stop production. Instead, the intellectual property becomes part of the public domain, free for all to use, for the purpose of enhancing the public good. So what is needed here is to accelerate that process, guaranteeing companies a fair profit while vastly expanding public access that we now think of for example as generic drugs.

The first bottleneck now is not research and development. This is now a production and distribution problem. Just as the United States in 1942 swung its production capacity from consumer products to the machines that won world War II, so today a world at war with this pandemic must simply buy out the necessary resources to provide much more vaccine much more quickly. In America the Defense Production Act of 1950 makes that quite easy. By simply buying the patent rights from the drug companies the United States can quickly enable a massive expansion of production and distribution facilities while still ensuring that the drug companies profit. That is government ""for the people""."

Drugmakers like Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Asterezenak, etc., must keep their money-making impulses in check and do what is beneficial to humanity and their financial well-being in the long run. At least for once, they should consider the interest and well-being of the masses uppermost on their minds than their stock holders' interest. They need to keep in mind the negative impact of the virus on the global economy. Their businesses cannot do well without a robust economy. And there can be no robust economy in the absence of a healthy population. These companies' primary goal should be to improve the people's health first and then their bottom lines. Without it, there will be no healthy people, no strong economy and no substantial profits, upon which depends the survival of their companies."
2021-03-21 14:33,"Governments could have started their own pharmaceutical companies or could simply buyout the existing ones. 

With that said, the issue appears to be capacity. There is not enough manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet demand. The wealthy countries should have bankrolled capacity expansion last year when this pandemic started knowing that it would take 12 to 18 months to construct that capacity and get it online. Instead, the American people elected Donald Trump and were more interested in harassing the Governor of Michigan and suggesting household cleaners as a solution instead of serious planning. 

If government research was used in the making of these vaccines, those governments should have insisted on terms and conditions.  It appears the Biden Administration is going to do this with the patent the Government has been issued. 

Asking private companies to bankroll public health is never going to work. That’s governments job. Private entities have to be compensated for their capital and R&D spending. If you make a situation unprofitable, they won’t produce in the future. 

Also, China and Russia have developed vaccines. They should be under pressure to expand production as much as Western companies."
2021-03-21 14:34,"The speed and success has shown the incredible success of public/private partnership. This is just one example of many. The article states

“But governments cannot afford to sabotage companies that need profit to survive.” This is very true. The challenge is to make this success equitable. For most drug companies it is not a matter of “survival” but a matter of “healthy versus frivolous” profits. The Biden administration has a unique opportunity to perhaps show a way to a solution. The complexity of such a solution is well beyond my pay grade. The balance of long term research, intellectual ownership, incentives for innovations, etc. play a role; even perhaps the reshaping of patent laws."
2021-03-21 14:34,"Like far too many Times articles, this one treats the most important information far too briefly and focuses on controversy and commentary.  It claims that manufacturers ""from Canada to Bangladesh"" just need licensing agreements, without naming a single one or in any way showing why that claim deserves more attention than Moderna's claim in the preceding paragraph that none of them have the right equipment.  This apparent disagreement is obviously the crux, yet it's left unexamined.  At the very least, the article should have addressed why anyone should think companies in other countries aren't going to profiteer if they get the intellectual property.  How are they going to be limited in their future use of the technology so they don't go into low-cost competition with the vaccine developers for future viruses?  All these questions are more important than what didn't happen during the Biden campaign.  This is no time for journalists to be political junkies.  Please, give us more facts about the vaccines and the manufacturers and less about which officials voiced what opinions."
2021-03-21 14:36,"If these companies lose their patent rights by government decrees and governments take over,then what is to motivate companies to take huge risks in possible future pandemics? Start up companies like Moderna risked everything on their rDNA idea and were ready to implement their technology at exactly the right time. Yes government scientists helped unraveling the virus genetic code, but using that and producing a viable vaccine was a huge step."
2021-03-21 14:41,The cycle continues- how many of the scientists working or assisting in this work were themselves from developing countries attracted to western labs for higher pay? It’s another example of the rich getting richer at the expense of everyone else.
2021-03-21 14:44,"Taxpayers fund the basic research that produced the recipe. US govt owns the patent. In future let US govt build and own the means to produce the vaccines also. It’s cheaper. It’s a national economic and health crisis which makes it a national security concern 

There are basic meds not being produced by the private sector because they are unprofitable. Govt should build the capacity to produce them at cost."
2021-03-21 14:44,"This is an opportunity for China to win the world and it will.
More than anything other than its role in climate change, it proves that unfettered crony capitalism puts itself before the interests of the people and the world.  As new variants develop in the unvaccinated world,  we will need new vaccines, and big Pharma will profit again.
Things would be different with Single Payer Health Care, as they were almost 70 years ago when the post WWII internationalist ethos prevailed, and Jonas Salk did not seek a patent or owe it to Pharma."
2021-03-21 14:50,"This article demonstrates what we can do when we work together. The fact that we have vaccines for COVID already is astounding and couldn’t have happened without collaboration. 

Unfortunately, this article also demonstrates how quickly we return to a competitive stance, where, in this case, profits matter more than people and competition replaces collaboration. Clearly, to drug companies saving lives isn’t the goal. Profit is."
2021-03-21 14:00,"“We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first,” Mr. Biden said recently. “But we’re then going to try and help the rest of the world.”

I would have it no other way.

I would have the POTUS do nothing less.

I would not give up a dose for myself, my wife, or my child so that someone elsewhere, within the US or outside of it, can get it instead.

You first take care of your own, things can change in a NY minute."
2021-03-21 14:24,"At least Europe allows vaccine exports. Despite local shortages, vaccines made in Europe are heading to countries around the world, even the USA. 

USA and UK forbid this, and also forbid poorer countries from making their own, its a disgrace."

Pakistan spends 10,4Bio$ on the military and is a nuclear power, South Africa 3.4Bio$ Ghana is spending just 215Mio$. There is money just not for vaccines. Why have nuclear facilities? Why not a vaccine manufacturing site instead just in case?"

Americans are the least trusted country in the world.  Our government ignored its own guidelines.  More Americans have died than any country in the world.  Its leader spread  blame against Asian Americans.  A third wave is inevitable despite more people vaccinated.  

And now we refuse to distribute the vaccine to other parts of the world.  I'm not surprised.  American exceptionalism has been championed instead of American arrogance."

I can't believe I am just reading about this now.  I guess I missed it earlier.  Until now, I thought the worst failure of Trump was his lack of action in controlling COVID in the United States.  I consider his gross negligence and reckless disregard to be directly responsible for the death of the majority of over 500,000 Americans killed by the virus.  Trump should be tried for criminal manslaughter.

Now I see Trump's failure to act is partly responsible for the millions of global deaths.  The man should be tried by an international tribunal for placing patent protection ahead of the lives of billions of people."

2021-03-21 14:38,"Which is it: Trump didn't secure enough vaccine, or he secured too much? We can't have it both ways.

The COVID death rate is about 20X higher in the US than in most of sub-Saharan Africa. Maybe a lack of testing is partly to blame, but I don't think that's the major reason for the gap. We'd be hearing more stories about packed African hospitals from this newspaper and others, and we are not.

The fact is, COVID primarily affects older, fatter people, meaning older people and those with pre-diabetes, diabetes, or high blood pressure.

The median age in sub-Saharan Africa is about 20 years younger than in the US and Europe. That's a staggering difference. And, obesity is almost non-existent there, but in the US and Europe, 20-40 percent of the entire population is obese, and the rest overweight. These are the two main factors for low COVID deaths in Africa. There many be other minor factors (more rural population), but these are the two big ones. Please don't tell me it's 'preparation' as I have lived in Africa and that's politicized nonsense.

I'm thrilled we in the US have secured our doses of the vaccine first. That's what I want my government to do. After we have taken care of our citizens who are dying in droves, we can worry about the rest of the world who have barely suffered from this disease.

This kind of uncritical, unquestioning acceptance and parroting of what is so obviously untrue is unhelpful. Just because they *say* they're worried about innovation, doesn't make it so. To qualify as actual journalism, perhaps try something along the lines of:

""But in Brussels and Washington, leaders claim they are still worried about undermining innovation, despite the fact that an overwhelming preponderance of evidence suggests it is profits for a few already very wealthy members of the 99.9% they are worried about undermining."""

Let alone the cruelty and immorality of this, how can these people not understand how dangerous it is TO US to let this virus percolate around the world indefinitely?  We’re already seeing versions that are vaccine-resistant, more infectious and deadlier than the original.

Taxpayer-funded research produced these breakthroughs.  We should share them with the world, period."

2021-03-21 14:42,Another triumph of capitalism -- money outranks global health.
2021-03-21 14:44,Why do we forget that we are all in this together? It isn’t that some of us win and some lose. It’s that we win or lose together. All of humanity is on the same team. Humans versus COVID.
2021-03-21 14:08,"If drug companies truly cared about their stated missions: all forms of “making people healthier and happier”, they would not resist the calls to share their know-how in this case. The fact that they prioritize profit over hundreds of thousands of lives shows that the Friedman inspired style “profit is the only permissible objective for a company” of capitalism is utterly bankrupt. How can we criticize China and Russia for anything at all, if we let this happen?"
2021-03-21 14:32,"This piece is undisguised advocacy. “the government said calls for equitable access to vaccines and treatments sent “the wrong message to innovators.”” Loaded sentence. When the US has vaccinated most of the country by summer, it will be in a position to help vaccinate people in other countries. Other developed countries will do the same. China and Russia are already shipping vaccines to poorer countries. It’s being called vaccine diplomacy. The US will surely do the same thing as soon as domestic politics make that possible. Fox and Republicans would savage Biden for doing what this opinion piece proposes."
2021-03-21 14:34,This is a perfect opp for the US and the wealthy west to make friends out of adversaries. It's time we stepped up and treated those countries with less access to vaccines as friends/family/neigbors. Let's put aside our petty differences and duplicitous agendas and make space at the table for everyone.
2021-03-21 14:37,"Serum Institute of India (SII), a privately owned company is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world and produces vaccines for the bulk of poor countries at less than $1 a shot. SII signed up an agreement with AstraZeneca early on and is supplying Covaxine under the Covax scheme of WHO. President Biden has given them $200 million to double the capacity to increase their output. However, what Indian and South African countries want is to be able to produce Pfizer and Moderna vaccines without paying any royalty. More importantly they want permission to freely export this world wide. So it is not meant for consumption in India, but rather for private profits. Much of what seems at the surface is really about money. So before Americans divide amongst ourselves on the ethics of making the research of NIH/Moderna a public good (world), we need to be mindful that the demands are coming from the private sector in the developing world. President Biden has loaned doses to Canada and Mexico and probably will also help Latin America through AstraZeneca which is unlikely to get approval by FDA for Americans, simply because AZ knows with their low efficacy no one is going to take their shot in the US. Finally US has had more deaths than any country in the world and thus it is not fair to ask US to give vaccines to other countries with much lower infection and death rates before their own population is vaccinated."
2021-03-21 13:53,"The only reason why there are going to be vaccines in the first place is because of ""rich countries"" currently there are contracts for billions of vaccines and it will take time but they will be available. How exactly are these recipes going to be used. It's not as if countries in Europe don't have them and they're behind. By the time a country gets this recipe and starts production 5 billion vaccines will already have been made available by even just one of the manufacturers."
2021-03-21 14:15,"“But public records show that the government used unusual contracts that omitted its right to take over intellectual property or influence the price and availability of vaccines.”

Is it typical for our government to retain the right to take over IP and dictate pricing? Seems like the kind of thing they’d do in the Soviet Union, not here."
2021-03-21 14:20,"The insanity I read in these pages is sometimes mind boggling. Exactly which members of Congress, indeed how many citizens, would tell their constituents and neighbors that, after paying for the development of vaccines, they will vote to send half, a third, a quarter of the vaccine abroad, and support closing of businesses and schools in the U.S. for another year? And, by the way, the infrastructure of most of the third world has no apparatus to store, transport, distribute, and administer the current vaccines. Phooey.  The world is far from perfect, we have our own problems requiring resources, and Gebrekidan and Apuzzo aren't going to fix it."
2021-03-21 14:34,The article must be presuming the West will not agree to spreading vaccine info. They want their own populations to be vaxxed but do not want the responsibility or expense of paying for the less affluent. Got it. What is the threat to the richer nations if the pandemic continues to be a curse? Will the drug companies boost people with existing vaccinations to protect them against new variants? Clearly in a have or have not scenario there are holes in the thinking here. There is no benefit to anyone if all of us are under threat for infection even if the vaccinated can lose that advantage to a new Covid variant.
2021-03-21 14:08,"I don’t really see a controversy here. Why should drug companies just give away their intellectual property? They could easily partner with companies in other countries and co-manufacture. Any number of arrangements could work — sending a team to help retrofit manufacturing facilities, donating a certain amount, selling it at a reduced rate, etc. Seems like the NYT is trying to stir up controversy when this vaccine effort is a moving target on new territory."
2021-03-21 14:50,"China has been filling the gap of ""greedy"" Western countries- effectively using it as an arm of their diplomacy.

The fallacy of this typical American/European approach is that the virus can mutate easily- both in terms of infectivity and lethality. Ineffective strategies in developing countries will result in continued reinfection in the more vaccinated/developed countries as well. Of course the disparities one sees globally are mirrored domestically. 
 
So I would advise the US and Europe to do two things. One they are good at and one they are not. Think selfishly and think globally."
2021-03-21 14:52,I am always against forcing companies to give up their intellectual property. And I think the sadfish argument for developing countries is cynical at best. How about this: the elites in those countries can take the money they use for private jets and dystopian trips to Dubai and refunnel it into RnD for vaccines. The West has succeeded because we worked hard for it. They are not our problem.
2021-03-21 14:53,"The failure to provide for vaccinating the planet will ultimately haunt those responsible: governments, Pharma and the WHO. The main driver for this failure is money. Patents exist for profits and even in this dire calamity money and politics influence every decision. The failure does not end with this but has been present at every stage of the fight against the pandemic. It began with government officials in China acting slowly to sound the alarm about human to human transmission, it continued with the WHO, our own CDC failing to grasp the peril, then the threat, even when it was upon us was played down for political reasons by our former President, who made additionally no plans for distribution of the vaccines and scorned the importance of masking. Despite multiple warnings there was an inadequate stockpile of PPE. History will record all this and the culprits will be held to account in that way."
2021-03-21 14:56,"This is what happens when science illiterates are put in charge of public policy. Whether it is climate change, public health or the myriad of other topics that is founded on science, politicians and government officials will make bad decisions simply because they don't understand science and therefore don't comprehend the scientific advice experts are giving them."
2021-03-21 15:00,"This seems like it should be a price negotiation.  The government funded the research and there is a public good.  But companies have logistical and manufacturing knowledge, as well as manufacturing capacity.  They need an incentive to cooperate with scaling production in a way that shares knowledge.  Even if they are not greedy, they may be concerned about ways of 'sharing knowledge' that mean they can't ever make money from related activity for future vaccines.  To a degree they should get a piece of the action.  It might take international treaties to ensure payments between governments and compliance."
2021-03-21 15:00,"The current global patent regime is an ineffective and costly way (in both $$ and lives) to encourage beneficial innovations in healthcare. It is, however, very effective at generating biomedical company profits, enriching a small number of lucky inventors and research institutions, and increasing the global economic power of industrial countries. 

Too many life-improving therapies are not pursued because they can’t be patented. Too many devastating illnesses are under-researched because the beneficiaries are mostly poor. Too many of our limited healthcare dollars go to reward those few companies rich enough to buy up and profit from medical innovations once universities and small companies have done all the hard and risky innovative work. 

We need to rethink intellectual property (IP) laws, and not just patent laws. IP rights are a legal boon, granted by society to those who create things the society needs, wants or enjoys, which grant the holder of the right (ie., the patent, copyright) the power to prevent others from using or copying their innovation. The sole purpose of the monopoly rights IP laws grant to those creators is to encourage them to create more things society needs, wants and enjoys, not to maximize the wealth generated by innovations. Unfortunately multiple changes to IP laws over the last few decades have been about enriching those who hold valuable IP rights (usually not the creator) rather than increasing innovation. It is time for that to change."
2021-03-21 15:06,"I’m pretty convinced that were it not for the profit motive, the vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and J&J would be far from the point of being tested and ready for mass production of billions of doses by now. The AstraZeneca vaccine is admirably being produced as a not-for-profit medicine but it is having a lot of problems being produced at the scale that it was promised. The Russian, Chinese, and Indian vaccines are all cheaper but have yet to be tested as rigorously. It’s also good that we have many different vaccines to choose from as it will probably help to deal with many of the emerging Covid variants. If we insisted on global fairness from the beginning, I just don’t think we’d be looking at the possibility of returning to ‘normal life’ in the US later this year. It’s what capitalism is good at— getting things done quickly and efficiently, even if not in a way that treats everyone fairly (citizens of low income countries in this case)."
2021-03-21 15:06,"It takes tunnel vision to characterize the uneven distribution of vaccines throughout the world exclusively to nationalism, in which richer nations hoard supplies for their own use while denying them to poorer nations.  The ultimate blame lies squarely on the head of capitalism, a system which places the narrow interests of private corporations over all competing interests, including the general welfare of society. If capitalism cannot or will not provide for society's needs, then it must be forced to do so by any means necessary. Will the ruling elite allow this to happen, or will they resist it with every fiber of their being?  Of course they will resist, but our political leaders have the power to make it happen nonetheless. We must wonder if they have the moral courage to do so."
2021-03-21 15:08,"“But governments cannot afford to sabotage companies that need profit to survive.“

Publish the salaries for the top paid people at these companies along with the company’s  profits (and campaign contributions). Somehow I’m not too worried that an equitable sharing philosophy will hinder their ability to survive very well."
2021-03-21 15:18,"All medicine, worldwide, should be not for profit.  It is immoral for rich countries to decide who lives and who dies based on which companies are allowed to make the highest profits of the suffering of others."
2021-03-21 15:25,"So we are to understand that scientists and drug companies would not have made the vaccines for the good of humanity. They would only do it to make billions in profit. That’s certainly the way our inequitable for-profit health care system works, so I guess we can’t even conceive of drug makers working to save the world because that’s the right thing to do.

If our government gives pharmaceutical companies  billions to create vaccines, it should absolutely make sure the global distribution of the vaccines is equitable. To do anything less is morally wrong and ultimately self-defeating, as the virus cannot be eradicated until the entire world is vaccinated."
2021-03-21 15:26,"The US’ and every other country’s first obligation is to protect the health of its own citizens. 

Further, it is clear that the US and Europe are not out of the woods yet as far as Covid is concerned.

Of course it is appropriate and necessary for rich countries to help poor countries since they could continue to spread the virus and the economies of the rich countries depend on commerce with poorer nations.

However, if the rich countries succumb to the virus then there can be no hope or assistance for the poor countries.

Given that the US, Europe and other developed areas have not yet vaccinated all of their vulnerable populations, much less achieved herd immunity, it is basically suicidal to divert vaccines from rich nations to poor ones.

Helping other nations build up their vaccine-production capabilities is a much more viable and feasible approach."
2021-03-21 15:37,"During my career, I negotiated and managed approximately $15 billion worth of pharmacy contracts. The primary leverages Big Pharma truly understands are volume and competition. The EU has understood this dynamic quite well in the past, but I fully understand why they, and all other government entities feel at a disadvantage in this moment. We are all grateful for what pharmaceutical manufacturers have done, but we find it is not enough. The US, in my opinion, is still mired in the relationship, or buddy system, which opens up decision makers to flattery, greed and subtle misdirection from their goals. Although this suffering world may currently feel itself at the mercy of drug makers, there are levers that can be pulled related to Pharma's overall business. Their Achilles Heel is anything that has the ability to adversely affect their stock price. That may mean nationalizing non-Covid parts of their business, or other emergency measures meant to make the world whole again."
2021-03-21 15:42,"Like the emergency procedure on an airplane, first you put your mask on, then you put the mask on your children.  If you don't put your mask on first, you might pass out before you can help your children.  

While the world is not our children, the premise is the same.  And it isn't new.  Polio, small pox etc. were all developed by affluent countries and after getting their own people covered they spent billions getting the world taken care of.  

Countries choose all the time, what to spend their money on.  Most choose to spend their money on weapons, because the enemy they see appears more dangerous than the enemies we don't see.

The US and it's rich neighbors had the privilege of being able to do both.  The US Government invested billions, and has for decades, in medical research to prepare for the next big thing.  Fortunately the key stone for Covid-19 vaccine was ready years before we needed it.  Thank you Dr. Graham and team!  But they didn't do that for free.  The American people paid for it.  Part of that Republican horror of public funding for things that aren't immediately profitable. 

The US has already purchased more vaccine than it will need and you can rest assured we will deliver those vaccines to the world.  We always do. 

By the by, I don't remember Trump thanking the Obama, or Bush administrations for funding that research, which made his administrations vaccine efforts even possible.  Hmmm?"
2021-03-21 15:43,"Even better, the UK now plans to import millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from India, because it can't produce enough at home.
The plan has however been twarthed: despite Boris Johnson's declarations, India has effectively decided it should get priority on these doses."
2021-03-21 15:45,"With vaccinations slowed and delayed and denied, we know there will be new variants that will be resistant to the existing vaccines we in the Western world are getting. We will need boosters to fight these variants in perpetuity if we don’t vaccinate the entire world as quickly as possible. 

I don’t want to say that a program of perpetual boosters while the developing world, and who knows how many in our country who have already been vaccinated, suffer, is an attractive way to generate profits, but it is in fact a way to generate profits."
2021-03-21 14:09,"This is plain nuts. The greatest threat we face now from the pandemic is the emergence of a vaccine-resistant variant with greater lethality or transmissability, or both. The easiest way to stop that is to achieve global herd immunity as fast as possible; to remove the petri dish from the virus. (I realize that is no guarantee that such a variant won't emerge anyway, but that is a probability that only increases the longer the virus runs rampant in our species.)

This is pretty simple. Americans, and Europeans, should support use of their taxes to finance global herd immunity because they directly benefit from reduced risk of emergence of a deadlier variant."
2021-03-21 15:49,The patent will not be issued until 3/30/21.  It appears like there is time to address this problem.  The potential profits to vaccine producers relied on billions of US tax payer dollars.  The US can negotiate with vaccine producers to cap profit margins and to require a percentage of the profits to go back to the US government.  This money can then be given to global distributers to hasten vaccine distribution throughout the world.  Why can't this happen?
2021-03-21 15:03,"Isn't it amazing that in all this self flagellation about what ""rich western"" countries could have done, there is not one word about the responsibility that China owes the world for unleashing this pandemic? Trump was poor in his choice of words but accurate that China should not be allowed to get away. No matter what the Western countries do to make vaccines available equitably to the world they should equally make sure that the culpability of China in this global misery is never forgotten."
2021-03-21 15:31,"The claim that ""patent sharing never came up” is ludicrous. Our government is being run by lying corporations, and we’re paying the price. We have not learned a thing from our mistakes, even though we had plenty of opportunities. It does not bode well for the future."
2021-03-21 15:38,"This ‘article’, like so many on the left, is simply an unconscious restatement of the old ‘pick up the white man’s burden’ idea. It expresses ideas and view points based on a morality that is assumed by the left that we all share with out acknowledging or referencing that the left’s whole moral scheme and outlook is based on religious morality and a Judeo-Christian ethic. All while generally denying God and religion. It also ignores the evidence that all of us do not share their foundation less world view, a castle built in the clouds and the mountain of evidence that it is an utter failure. It ignores the claim they make on one hand that all of the nations of the world are free, independent and coequal and that the west can’t tell them what to do but at the same time tells us we are responsible for solving their problems and taking care of them. The left is always pursuing an imaginary, future of human perfection and the attainment of a new Eden on a world of corruption, decay and entropy. Thus the left continuously denies the importance of individual importance and perfection in favor of doomed collectivist ideas, group think and interest groups."

Government, with its ability to fund basic research and provide “insurance” and private industry with its ability to focus resources to yes make profits by supplying what people want and need have again demonstrated their profound powers of partnership to address a humanitarian need.  And yes there are all sorts of issues regarding control, profit sharing and all the rest.  Part of that is figuring out how to share this to all humans on the planet because without doing that we run the risk of new more deadly strains and a much longer lasting pandemic.  The black death recurred off and on for over 500 years and we are still experiencing recurrent infections from the 1918 influenza pandemic.  However there are some positive stories as well.  Small pox has been eliminated and we are close to the same for polio.  I think we will see a different story once the initial crisis is over in the rich western nations.  Our leaders have to respond to their citizens as that is the source of their power, but once the initial crisis is over the demand will be for them to address the globe to prevent the disease’s return.  Lets give our leaders a chance and reserve our judgement for now as they are focusing on what they were elected to do.  This will be a bigger problem going forward as national governments are not well designed for problems that are increasingly global.  That may well be the biggest challenge of the 21st century"
2021-03-21 15:41,The world’s healthcare system is a joke thanks to the capitalist notions of the US. The need for profits and the importance of showing how capitalism is the best economic model have made our future untenable and it’s unlikely to change any time soon. The only hope for the future is a collapse of the free market and a spiral into war which the Chinese will obviously win.

Just look at the inability of the US government to assure a sufficient supply of N95 masks to protect its population.

Throughout 2020, I was inundated with both official and anecdotal information about how awful the US were handling the pandemic, how much death and destruction occurred there and, to a lesser extent, in Europe.

This indicates the West should indeed inoculate the majority of its vulnerable populations prior to ""rescuing"" the rest of the world. Yes, COVID mutation will continue with global vaccination efforts, but variants are already here and will continue regardless of what we do at this point. That train has left the station.

Moreover, I see many, many comments on numerous NYT articles regarding how awesome Russia and China are with their ""vaccine diplomacy"" and the latter's 3rd world infrastructure projects, so... sounds like a problem solved."

A human rights approach to medicine is desperately needed.  This pandemic has the potential to create an opening towards that conversation.  Even for selfish reasons of self-preservation, in light of the threat from variants of the virus, it makes absolute sense to give vaccine access to everyone over the pursuit of profits.  With the HIV virus, the rich were able to take some comfort because they can choose who they can sleep with.  This is approach does not work well with covid-19 because we cannot insulate ourselves completely.   
Civil society activists must organize to oppose international intellectual property using the language of international human rights.
Norms must be renegotiated by countries, communities, and corporations within and between different levels of societies building on the Doha declaration.  

Access to health must be an international public good protected by governments.  The argument that this approach weakens innovation has been exposed by Covid-19.  If I’m not protected, you’re also not protected.  At least not fully, even if you try to insulate yourself by living in gated communities and suburbs."

Can’t the Times say that western societies earned there way to the from of the line by a socio-political evolution toward a free society with internal controls to stamp out corruption? I have no problem letting developing countries to buy the vaccine at cost, or making Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and Buffett give up a billion each to pay for the shots at costs for children in Burundi and Bolivia, but making them give away all our trade secrets that are patented legally under a regime we devised and are still devising?

The Times notes, but does not give appropriate emphasis to, the fact that patents do not reveal what is needed for manufacturing - stability testing, preservation steps, fill and finish validation, or even how some components - notably lipid nanoparticles and mRNA - are composed.  Much of this information is not patented, but kept proprietary.  Further, there is no guarantee that “generic” vaccines will be effective or safe, since biological medicines are not as easy to copy as small molecules.

As another commenter pointed out, this is a complex recipe and cannot be made easily. To acquire the material needed to manufacture these vaccines is not easy. Suppliers that currently contribute to manufacturing the Covid vaccines are very strained. Even if these companies had the machinery to produce the vaccine, do they have properly trained personnel, controls in place and proper equipment to test whether the vaccines being produced is safe and efficient? 

I am all for equitable access to vaccines for everyone. However, please report from every perspective such as:

What are the challenges for manufacturers outside the US if they are given these patent licenses?
 Also, how long will it take even for Merck to produce the J&J vaccine with a 'sweetened' deal?
 As well, what are the governments in these other nations doing to prepare their manufacturers or doing to reach out to collaborate with Moderna etc? Moreover, why is China charging some countries double the price of Moderna for their vaccines?

But, since it is in rich countries that the virus is thriving, the main global threat goes in the other direction.

From the point of view of global health, it is a good thing to focus on vaccination in those locations first (while not ignoring the need to vaccinate globally soon thereafter)."

They are given billions of dollars to create the vaccines in the first place, and they then make billions more selling the product they made with government funding back to the governments. It's a sweet deal, but it costs the rest of us dearly.

These vaccines are largely, if not wholly, taxpayer funded. They are rightly the property of all the world's people, and should be made available to all the world's people at no additional cost."

Enlightened self interest suggests tha we have better be concerned with the lack of access to vaccines in most of the world.

The European Union does have problems that come from the fact that it remains a group of nations with different budgets, and economies.  The US, with a unifying federal government and Constitution, but an administration rooted in deep political division, treated states as competitors for the vaccine and other supplies instead of leading a cooperative effort. 

The US struck deals which got us a supply of this vaccine - this time around -  but has failed over and over again to act to reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals and all medical care in this country."

Actually outfitting a company in South Africa would cost a bundle and make money for X facotry somewhere in???  and how long would that take and how much would they produce?  (Are you seriously suggesting the difficult to store vaccine be made here?) 

It would seem that by the fall, there will be no more Western arms to jab and the Gates foundation can take on the job of distributing a vaccine  --  J & J or AZ most like bigen the storage requirements of Pfizer and Moderna -- to the poor of the world at large.

The United States is far from being out of the woods, with deadly variants circulating throughout. Whether by personal choice or lack of opportunity, many of our own population remains unvaccinated.

It's worth reading the entire WAPO article. The Salk vaccine was funded by government and private money. The March of Dimes, founded in 1938 by FDR, got millions of Americans to contribute and so become directly invested in the research. This surely added to public trust in the eventual vaccine.

This holds for not only medical science, but basic science and engineering, too.  Not that private individuals who happen upon a great idea cannot patent it, but finding things like Warfarin and insulin and polio vaccines, need to be more public than private.

Today, investors can buy patents, and then with hold them on outrageous terms. The courts will enforce that.

It is a problem with the US law. This problem has been developing for a long time, as the legal intellectual property industry lobby pays lawmakers to write ever more unreasonable law of intellectual property.

As for intellectual property, India has long discarded patent protection for drugs it wants, and every government of size has intelligence agencies that should easily breach any drug company.  Finally, did anybody anywhere expect a constructive response from the last US administration?  ""I don't take any responsibility at all"" was the slogan."
2021-03-21 16:41,"This article proposes using patent law against those who would abuse patent law.

It proposes doing that by having the government as holder of a critical patent do to the other patent holders exactly what they would otherwise do to the whole world.

The problem is that this is two wrongs. It does not suggest righting the wrong, it suggests doing it back to them on this one occassion.

The fundamental problems of two wrongs is more than philosophical. The US is in heated negotiations with China, Russia, India, and the Third World via the UN to assert its extreme version of intellectual property law. 

The US is in the wrong. This not only puts that on display, it makes it unavoidable. It makes it life and death to stop the US.

Over reach here creates greater vulnerability. Our own government and industry ought in their own interests see that this is self-defeating.

Actually, the world might be a better place if they do self defeat. But that is a larger question than this article directly addresses."

While that is true in the broadest sense, it's also true that the effect of those diseases hit different populations differently for a wide variety of reasons, most of them sociological and cultural with some genetics in the mix. 

But when it comes to highly contagious pandemics in a highly interconnected world, there is no question that just as Covid 19 advanced geometrically across the globe, so would its eradication have to retrace the steps to provide antidotes with the goal eradication. 

Put simply, the sooner that wealthier countries acknowledge that when it comes to global issues like the environment, disease and other forms of human suffering, however privileged, there is no real way to escape the consequences.

This is a diplomatic threat to the US conceptions of patent law and intellectual property rights.

The threat is made worse because the US concepts are over-reaching and vulnerable already even without this challenge.

The US has so broadened its patent laws and sweeping intellectual property rights that it is already on the defensive diplomatically not just with Russia and China, but with India and much of the rest of the world.

In that context, the US over reaching on this matter of life and death could do great harm to its already vulnerable position.

Of course, since I describe our patent law as over reaching and our intellectual property claims as over broad, it should be clear that I do not sympathize with the rent seeking behavior of our legal/investor industry now abusing this.

The US patent laws are greatly expanded, and they serve investor interests by things like vastly over priced insulin, or the behavior of Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical chief who bought up patents and then vastly increased prices of critical lifesaving drugs (now doing 7 years for cheating investors too, not for abusing patent law).

US intellectual property law more generally has been vastly expanded by lobbying lawmakers for abuses most of us don't know about.

The risk and sweat is funded by taxpayer dollars and Big Pharma gets to reap huge profits by charging exorbitant prices.  

In 2018, ""...the Pharma Big 10 — racked up almost $69 billion in worldwide profits… on over $330 billion in sales. Big Pharma’s profit margin of 15% to 20% is about three times higher than the average across the largest 500 companies across all industries... price gouging [is not limited to] the American people. Medicaid and Medicare — faced price hikes of around 40% each on frequently prescribed medications.”

To top it off, big Pharma is one of the largest tax dodgers across all industries.  Trump’s tax law “… wiped out an estimated $70 billion of the U.S. tax bill drug corporations owed on half a trillion dollars in profits they stashed offshore.”

It’s the American way.

Ah, yes, another citation of this old canard that innovation requires greed and the prospect of unlimited wealth.

Rather than cash in on this, he's moved on to look for the next bright idea that will save lives, a universal flu vaccine.

Without the profit motive, I'm sure that some bright people will be discouraged from entering this field. But I have always been convinced that they will be replaced by more Dr. Grahams, who undertake the work because they are curious and want to satisfy the itch of why things work the way they do.

The other feature this article underscores is the fact that governments in the US and Europe did not pressure Pharma to produce vaccines for the good of people because in many instances government administrators were in previous lives executives in the very companies they are now negotiating with. When someone like Alex Azar becomes Secretary of HHS, he already is convinced that profit is necessary for innovation. After he secures those deals in government, he goes back to get a booster shot of that ideological conviction, back in industry.

The first is that, under some peculiar construction of equity, some countries -- defined by their historical failure to develop functioning economies -- are entitled to what more viable countries have produced.  The second is that the solution to under-vaccination in such countries is to confiscate the intellectual property of the private companies who cooperated with governments to create the vaccines and to compel them to distribute vaccines free or at great discounts in the under-developed world.  Perhaps some of these countries actually would have sustainable economies if they didn't have such a backward view of economics and public policy.

Governments desperately wanted the rapid development of Covid vaccines and negotiated the terms of of their development with private companies.  Those negotiations certainly included ownership of intellectual property and the terms of distribution.  The covid developers deserve the benefit of their bargain.

Given the curious circumstances under which this plague has been thrust upon us and speed at which the virus appears to be mutating, we likely are going to need the cooperation of vaccine developers for years, if not decades, to come.  Let's see which companies commit the required level of investment and effort if the governments renig on their original commitments.

Let's face it, profit is what gets things done; not self-righteous and self-serving claims of equity."

I agree that many medical inventions are subsidized by taxpayers, I am just a bit skeptical if private enterprises would have enough motivation to develop new drugs and medical devices if they were deprived of most of possible profits.

Understand this: The biotech company Moderna has been around for a decade.  Before COVID-19, Moderna’s work was focused on developing treatment for cancers, genetic diseases, and other problems. It had not sold a single vaccine.  Investors had risked money, and researchers had devoted their lives, to ideas (like how to use messenger-RNA) that may or may not have worked.  Years of research by a company that did not make money formed the foundation for the quick creation of a vaccine.  

As with some other companies, the government helped Moderna with the rapid testing and production of the vaccine.  More specifically, as with at least six other companies, the Trump administration (taxpayers) paid for production of millions of doses of Moderna’s vaccine before anyone knew if it would work, or if it would be approved.  Not every vaccine worked.  Merck's vaccine failed.  This is why Merck has now agreed to produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Other vaccines that do work have nothing to do with messenger-RNA patents.

Leave Moderna and companies like it alone. The development, production, and distribution of multiple COVID-19 vaccines is proceeding world-wide at an unbelievable pace.

This article does not mention this.

Drug companies have to be careful with sharing technology with unfamiliar manufacturers, especially those in developing countries.  Manufacturing vaccines is extraordinarily difficult, and even seemingly minor issues can result in ineffective or even unsafe vaccines.  It only takes a few bad doses to undermine public confidence in a vaccine to the point where people will refuse to take it; look at AstraZeneca in Europe.

Wealthy countries have many more resources than poor ones, including food, housing, and most medical care.  It's not just Covid vaccine availability.

2021-03-21 16:56,"There is a huge difference between the USA and the EU. The EU exports covid vaccines, the USA does not.

The next question is who is even able to produce vaccines and does not do it.
China and Russia are producing several of their own. India has it's own and is producing AstraZeneca.
Several countries are producing some covid vaccine in license.
As it takes time to start a vaccine production from scratch, how much production would be added in reality if vaccine licenses would be free?

Contrary to all the bad propaganda covid vaccine production is ramping fast in the EU. There will be considerable amounts available for distribution outside of the EU in the second half of this year."
2021-03-21 17:23,"The truth is, this pandemic is global. The virus is not going away, until it is gone from every corner of the earth. If life needs to get back to normal, the vaccination rates should have parity across the different regions in the world.

That said, if the US Government has poured billions of dollars into fast tracking the development of vaccines, (including contract to buy the finished product) the pharma companies that produced these vaccines did so at zero economic risk. So why not make the recipe public?"
2021-03-21 17:46,"Every country has a primary obligation to ensure the health of its citizens.

In this pandemic the developed countries are not even close to stopping Covid within their own borders, and if they fail to do so the poor countries will be totally out of luck.

Therefore it is incumbent on the rich countries, from whom the vaccines emanate, to ensure their own survival so they can help the rest of the world survive.

Yes, it will take longer for many countries to vaccinate their populations, especially in the poorest nations, where electricity, running water, and refrigeration are not widely available.

The solution to this problem is not to divert vaccines from the developed nations, but to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution capability as fast and as widely as possible."
2021-03-21 18:19,I have real doubts about the ability of other companies to make mRNA vaccines effectively.  To just let people do without a partnership with Pfizer or Moderna could be a disaster and destroy all vaccine credibility.  I think that a viable approach might be for the governments to promote partnerships with other vaccine companies that Moderna and Pfizer feel are competent and can supervise their procedures and practices.
2021-03-21 18:05,"Here is a strange paradox filled with ethical dilemma:
The pandemic is driven by the US and Europe, countries with the most capacity to have prevented the disease and the most medical capacity to treat the disease. The developing world is not the driver. See WHO's weekly epidemiological update and www.misterioso.org.
The vaccines, in a logical world, would be given to the underdeveloped countries first. None of this is quite ethical, is it?"
2021-03-21 18:09,"I think this is nuts. 

American taxpayers and Western companies should give their intellectual property so that companies in other countries that made no investment in research can make copycat products and make profits off of patients in their countries?

I am all for paying additional taxes in order to increase production capacity in the US and selling the vaccines at cost of production to others (or giving for free) to other countries. That would still help the world and would also help to rebuild our domestic pharmaceutical industry, which has already farmed out a lot of its manufacturing to India and China."
2021-03-21 17:55,"There is a stark reality when it comes to lethal pandemics. The wealthy come first. As the pandemic vaccinations reach full coverage in the wealthy nations the intensity of the manufacturing and distribution will drop off, using scarcity to extract a little more money from countries that can ill afford it.
     The capitalist countries are creating, voluntarily, an open door for the Chinese to gain a stronger foothold in less developed countries. If we truly want to limit the growth of communism why do we keep creating fascist opportunities that allow them to leverage their influence around the world? Communism is adopted as a last violent shift away from capitalist authority- but that final shift is driven by decades of 2% antagonism and and flagrant disregard for the lives of the working poor. Seems like we could figure it out before we are on the steps of the guillotine , don't you think? 
      The super wealthy and powerful are protected by the well paid uniformed soldier/children of the working poor, until they aren't. Gates is on the path to reconciliation- where are the rest. If you hate the left extreme work on solutions that lead back to the center, or face the consequences. It is about the population math that your grandchildren will face.

2021-03-21 17:43,"this is exactly why I've been saying this pandemic isn't close to being over.   variants will spring up in poor countries that capitalism is too greedy to help.

   change my mind."
2021-03-21 18:20,"Any chance by releasing the vaccine recipe, like the textile, electronics, car manufacturing industries et all, the manufacturing will go to cheap labor countries where quality control drops and knock offs proliferate? Is that a goal we want to achieve? Minor point- when you think of letting say Bangladesh manufacture your vaccines think of Steve Jobs, when he was living his last days on hospital machinery and medicine those drugs and machines were designed and manufactured in your more better developed countries. When was the last time you saw firefighting or scuba life support gear made in Red China?"
2021-03-21 18:21,"This situation with the sharing of the vaccines and their patents reminds me of being on a leaking boat which has two levels.  Everybody on deck has all of the amenities completely ignoring the fact that the boat has sprung major leaks. The crew and a few of the passengers who are paying attention are below deck using every tool, and all of their collective ingenuity to stop the leaks and save the boat. Because they know what the stakes are.  We have damaged the environment to such a degree that it is now returning the favor.  We have entered the age of the global pandemics replete with mutations; if we don’t pay attention to the life and death situation happening under our collective noses then we will as human beings not survive in a world we recognize. How can we ignore what is happening in other nations without our resources?  There is only one boat."
2021-03-21 18:31,"""But governments cannot afford to sabotage companies that need profit to survive."" Really? Survive? There is no threat to the companies survival.

2021-03-21 18:52,"I would not be so quick to try to force the people, drug manufacturers and their scientists, who develop vaccines to share the work they did to get where we are today without insuring their patents will not be overturned or shared without their permission or without adequate and fair compensation. You may be able to do that this time around, but if another situation like the one we faced with covid-19 comes up again I think that the drug manufactures will not be so cooperative and will not wish to partner with people who hurt them last time around."
2021-03-21 19:01,"The issues raised in this article may have a greater immediate impact upon middle power nations, like Canada, that effectively traded away its own vaccine production capacities in the march towards globalization. Sure, share the patents, but if you don’t have the technology to produce in any significant way, open patents are useless in a time of crisis.  There will be some hard discussions in many middle power countries that had to wait for its vaccine abroad."
2021-03-21 17:43,The biggest problem are governments like in Brazil (Jair Bolsonario) which are not willing to vaccinate their people and even deny the virus at all (same as for the US under Trump). Those leaders act irresponsible regard their own people and the world.

2021-03-21 18:33,"So the article says “public records show that the government used unusual contracts that omitted its right to take over intellectual property or influence the price and availability of vaccines.” Does this refer to the Moderna contracts also? Or just the other ones the US spent money for that didn’t include their patent? ie will the US gov be able to get money back for licensing out their patent to Moderna et al., like what happened with Gilead."
2021-03-21 18:34,"My daughter has just published her dissertation and will soon get her Ph.D in bioinformatics—gene-based disease research. Her dissertation  is about sickle cell anemia, which could benefit black people around the world. It took her longer to complete her research because she was recruited by a start-up genetic research company that pays her $120,000/yr. 

Medical research at universities and private companies suffers for gender bias, but has improved substantially over the years. Asians—especially from China, India, and Pakistan— are all heavily represented as well. 

Gene research involves many diseases, but cancer is the most high profile. If my daughter had to take time to address sickle cell in Africa and if her employer had to share its contributions with Bangladesh, that would slow the operation and make it less profitable, which would have a negative trickle down effect on my daughter and her Asian co-workers. 

Business-wise, medical start ups are a lot like high tech start ups. But the employees in medical start-ups are much more diverse. Medicine is a service industry. My daughter was attracted to medical research largely for that reason. She first wanted to be a veterinarian, but that was financially iffy. 

Medical research is moving toward being gender balanced. If you undercut its profitability it will probably become majority underpaid women. So helping poor countries hurts American women. Choose your poison."
2021-03-21 18:46,"Without sharing the vaccine broadly, we will make sure that a mutation will produce super covid for which vaccine will not work and that super covid will make its way back into the rich countries."
2021-03-21 18:48,The article finds it unfair that the US taxpayers who financed the vaccines should be vaccinated first. I don’t—and I am sure the authors are not willing to wait for their vaccinations until after most of the rest of the world is vaccinated.
2021-03-21 18:47,"Not only rich countries deserve blame. The Presidents of both Brazil and Argentina, Bolsonaro and Fernández made it impossible for Pfizer to manufacture the BioNTech vaccine in those countries by refusing tp grant it an exception from responsibility, knowing full well that the vaccine has received only temporary approval in the countries where is being made and/or used.

The plan by Pfizer, that had already received preliminary approval was for the vaccine to be made in already identified labs that met the requirements in each country and then shipped to Mexico to be put in vials.  As a result of both Bolsonaro and Fernández intransigence the three mentioned countries are suffering from insufficient supply and tens if not hundreds of thousands of their citizens that could been protected have died from the virus.

That was probably a crime against humanity."
2021-03-21 19:06,"This gets it exactly wrong.  Protect IP and provide generous funding for both production/shipment/administering/licensing of vaccines, in ways that don’t trample the pharma companies.  Vaccine production is booming and poor countries will have huge volumes of vaccines this year, largely funded by the US and other developed countries and without overrunning the drug companies.  The challenge will be the last mile, not whether those countries will be able to get adequate vaccine supply.  If the US and other govts had forcibly taken the drug companies’ IP, vaccine production volume and the fate of citizens in poor countries would be worse, not better.  And if that were the pattern over time, we wouldn’t have had the fast invention and scale-up of vaccines in the first place.  

Yes, you are better off living in Switzerland than Swaziland.  Quick/early covid vaccine access is just one subtopic. It doesn’t have to be anyone’s fault; it’s just so."
2021-03-21 18:15,"I imagine China's probably got one in the works. If they pull it off, they'll probably graciously give it to developing countries, maybe for goodwill, maybe for ""belt and road"" stuff. Should this happen, I imagine they will be seen as heroes, and the US and wealthy European nations as a bunch of self-centered greedy (insert expletive here). Brilliant. 

Sure, use it here first. I'm all for that. Start vaccinating working people before the vaccines expire on the shelf. But pursuing pure profits in this case is self-destructive."

Obviously there's a need to ensure vaccines are produced as quickly and inexpensively as possible to speed up global roll-out, but I'm not sure how much more can be done right now.  Given the huge motivation of not wanting to let Russia or China claim the moral high ground and win friends all around the world, I'd actually be surprised if every string that can be isn't being pulled to get Western vaccines distributed to poorer countries."

2021-03-21 19:02,"This article is pretty poor by NYTimes standards. A couple of comments, in no particular order:
- Why is the responsibility of the West (US/Europe) to provide vaccines? Why not put more of the blame on China, where the virus originated? It is obviously in everyone’s interest to get the world vaccinated, but it is not solely the responsibility of western governments. In fact, I think it takes away agency from developing nations to assume they are not also capable of making vaccines 
- I agree with many others who noted the vast amount of deaths and cases that the US (and Europe) has suffered. Certainly we as a nation are entitled to vaccinate our own people before sharing doses with the world, given the terrible situation we’ve experienced. Further, sending doses abroad before Americans are vaccinated would be political suicide (with the possible exception of the AstraZenica vaccine, which is probably less favored by the American public)  
- I also agree that the Western commitment to intellectual property is - in part - WHY these life saving vaccinations were developed here. Now, that’s arguably a bit reductionist, but having IP protection is certainly correlated to innovation and higher standards of living 
- Finally: what about other alternatives? Contract manufacturing where IP would be protected, but doses could be distributed to developing nations at cost? Do these nations even have the necessary ingredients to manufacture the Pfizer/Moderna/J&J vaccines?"
2021-03-21 19:02,"Just a quick reminder here that it’s not us vs them. What happens “there” will have consequences “here”. There’s no finite amount of vaccines, or rather, it will be less so if we share the recipe with as many manufacturers as possible."
2021-03-21 19:08,"Even from the most cynical and selfish perspective, until the rest of the world is vaccinated the COVID virus will continue to evolve. The mutations will be more infectious because that’s how evolution works. The mutations will most likely eventually infect the vaccinated if enough vaccinated people are exposed to it because that’s how evolution works.

So vaccinating the rest of the world should be a top priority.

Also it’s just the right thing to do."
2021-03-21 16:58,"You seriously think that the American taxpayer will cheerfully fund vaccinating the whole world? If you do, I want to see you on my Arizona souther border today offering to become economically and socially responsible for a couple of dozen unaccompanied minors.  And I don't mean little eight year old girls; pick up a selection of 17 year old knife scarred tatooed gang members.  And you can become legally responsible  right now to feed, house, medicate and ecucate them.  That seems a bit more likely than the American taxpayer saying, but of course, my tax money should go to vaccinate the entire overpoulated planet, now excuse me while I send my money overseas, take my kid by the hand, and get out of here."
2021-03-21 19:08,"The US government has confiscated land for public projects under eminent domain.  Under the same power, the US government could pay a 'just compensation' to pharma companies and take ownership of the patents of coronavirus vaccines for public domain use."

Granted that the entire world should be immunized and we must make that possible sooner rather than later. This may well be considered a warm-up for much more virulent pandemics to come - in other words, COVID may prove to be a comparatively innocuous practice session for horrors sure to arrive in future. 

Nevertheless, developed countries with aging populations and high obesity rates may be paying a pandemic price for their abundance."
2021-03-21 19:19,"Good article, that reveals some of the complexities of medical patents, etc. What needs to be made explicit is that humans get on airplanes and travel around the world. Excluding any country from vaccination is excluding us all. There needs to be an even playing field for receiving vaccines. b/c doing so, protects all of us. Such disease doesn't stop at a border or an airport. I see no consistent testing globally either or limits on who can travel where, when. Even without the challenge of variants, while the arguments continue over medical patents or ""recipe sharing"", COVID will continue to spread."
2021-03-21 19:24,"Slow rollout of the vaccine not only prolongs the pandemic, but makes it much more likely that COVID will be around permanently as new strains arise that the current vaccines don't work against.

2021-03-21 20:08,"I don't really blame those who haven't grasped the import of this article. It's just not saying something you'd be expecting.  It is saying that the currently dominant wealthy country has just granted itself the legal right to prevent poorer countries from manufacturing the vaccine unless they transfer huge sums of money to wealthy countries. 
It's not saying that the USA is keeping vaccine manufactured in its own borders for use by itself until its population is vaccinated. It's saying that the USA has granted itself the right to prevent other countries from manufacturing it for themselves.
The capacity to manufacture vaccine safely exists Right Now in many places. Bangla Desh for instance. For heaven's sake - Bangla Desh!  It happens to have a fully functioning modern pharmaceutical company that is already producing vaccines for other diseases. What it does not happen to have is deep pockets."
2021-03-21 20:10,"For some of these companies like Moderna and Novavax this is their first product ever to even come to market. Surely these companies and shareholders should be allowed to make a profit for the years of time and money used to build their vaccine platforms. Novavax was on the verge of bankruptcy before they got funding from CEPI and Warp Speed. And if they were stripped of their intellectual property their stock would plunge 90% and most likely end up bankrupt.

Having worked in the Pharma industry, I was at a presentation with our company CFO who spoke about the 80 percent profit margin we enjoyed. The fact is without taxpayer involvement that led to the mRNA discovery, we would still be waiting for a vaccine. Big Pharma doesn't want to wade into such basic research. Something the government is still better at than the private and non-profit sector."
2021-03-21 20:24,"This pandemic is the culmination of moral failings with new moral failings as the cherry on top. It's not just the problems discussed here: We're again valuing American lives over foreign lives by failing to include the vulnerable in other countries in our prioritization plans. We should be dose sparing with the mRNA vaccines at the very least, prioritizing primary coverage instead of giving a  small group of people excellent coverage. Many of our policy problems come down to a lack of basic public health knowledge, not just consideration for others. Instead, there's a relentless clinical perspective on maximizing benefits to the individual, even if more people die as a consequence. Although he did great things in standing up to Trump, Fauci has really struggled to grasp public health concepts throughout---from not understanding travel flows to discounting asymptomatic transmission and writing off rational vaccine distribution. 

Maybe we'll learn... next time? Until 2020 I wondered if I would ever have to switch my lab's research plans if one of the viruses whose dynamics we study were controlled through international coordination, as we did for smallpox and to some extent SARS.

2021-03-21 19:55,worth noting that the Oxford Astra Zenica vaccine was produced under an agreement that it would both be produced and sold at 'cost' price and that its technology would be shared with an Indian mass-production company.  I can't help wondering if that is why there has been so much spinning against it. Big Pharma are you up to old tricks???
2021-03-21 16:14,"Enough with the we are the world open borders global nonsense. We already send poor countries billions every ear and have been doing so  for decades. What are they doing with the money? Many of those countries also refuse to curb their population growth and  prohibit birth control or abortions. They have created their own problems. 

Also not everyone in America or Europe is rich and I wish the people in the Times bubble started realizing this. We financed these vaccines with our tax dollars and still many Americans can't get vaccinated. It's still a joke in so called rich countries to even get an appointment.

We just got a Johnson and Johnson vaccination for my 98 year old mother and it was a last minute sheer luck opportunity. She is in good health but for various reasons two shots would have been too much for her. Was this shot suppose to go to someone in another country first? 

China started this so let China vaccinate the rest of the world. Americans should come first by having our needs met first and nations need to concentrate on manufacturing their own essentials.  TVs being imported is one thing but the importing of essentials needs to end."

I even think that it’s just plain dumb to let Russia and China firehose vaccines out there, with no US response.

But I wonder about how bright it is to ship the technology to make mRNA vaccines everywhere, because if you can use them to rapidly create and adapt vaccines, you can use them for...other things.

And I don’t get the heypresto part at all: do people think you put the patents out there, and the labs, materials and trained personnel just spring up out of the ground?"
2021-03-21 19:29,"The article says, ""A growing chorus of health officials and advocacy groups worldwide are calling for Western governments to use aggressive powers — most of them rarely or never used before — to force companies to publish vaccine recipes, share their know-how and ramp up manufacturing.""

Yes, it's the right, humane, Socially Reponsible thing to do - which is why BIG pharma/medicine will not allow it.  They have already received preposterous government money - OUR hard-earned taxpayer dollars - to ""research and produce"" vaccines.  But, as usual with predatory, morally/ethically bankrupt, socially unconscious, insatiably greedy BiG ""investors"" that is not enough.  There is never enough for them and their 9.9% operatives.

Dr. Salk developed a vaccine to stop polio.  He tested it on his own family and employees.  When it proved safe and effective he GAVE IT TO OUR GOVERNMENT so other labs could produce it and stop the spread of this deadly disease.

When asked if he was going to patent the cure he said, ""Can you patent the sun?""

Today there are greedy people who would try to.  The real sickness in our world is corruption and unregulated greed.  WE THE PEOPLE must demand that they are curtailed right now.

The COVID 19 vaccine must be made available to every person on the planet who wants to be vaccinated free or at a reaonable price to stop the spread.  It must be protected from being hijacked by the greediest among us for their private profit.  OUR lives depend on it."

The West in particular has mobilized a number of vaccines to address its own infected populations. The capital that has been marshaled came from the public.  Product created by this capital must be used to assist us all to overcome this event, and events like this in the future.  We are not free to walk away.

Capital, and its ownership, is not the only issue here.  There are perhaps difficult barriers to assisting others regardless of what our biotech capital issues may be. Leaders still lie to their citizens.  Sixty percent of India’s population of 1.3 Billion can’t conduct a conversation with their government about a minimum wage. Faulty scientific and social information about pandemics and vaccines abound. Variants are abounding. The pandemic has wheels and clocks.

We can, and must seek to use the current hubs of technology to broaden the availability of solutions for everyone. This future cannot be marred by drug companies continued sale of patented drugs to their recipients that bankrupt world-wide public health performance.

The western world could provide and treat AIDS and it let Africa suffer. Besides, nobody would vote for that, this scolding tone comes from an extreme moral minority rather than objectivity.

That would mean innovation would be controlled by big bureaucracy just like the WHO which has proved itself to be remarkably incompetent with its many absurdly false statements and guidelines - masks not needed, COVID-19 not airborne, no need to close borders because that will affect poor countries, slow to declare a pandemic a pandemic ....

So far the Western pharmaceutical companies have done a brilliant job in developing the most effective vaccines in record time.

We now have a handful of great candidates and the issue is how to accelerate manufacturing, especially of the vaccines capable of being distributed without an ultra-cold supply chain.

China and Russia have some potentially good vaccines as well but less well-proven. 

Superpower competition will drive vaccine distribution on all continents.

By the end of May (as in March, April, May) the USA will have enough doses for its entire population.

According to The NYTimes, 90% of the American population will have been vaccinated by August. Where will all the production go then? Surely not into warehouses.

Worldwide demand will be so great that politics and economics will steer those extra doses to where they are needed. The issue will be decided by supply and demand, and all the anguished, liberal hand-wringing on this page will have been rendered moot.

We need to remember that it is not in BigPharma's interests to wipe out COVID. What is in their interests is to keep it endemic and mutating so they can profit not only from churning out patented vaccines year after year but from developing treatments for the chronic conditions of long-haulers. COVID is BigPharma's latest cash cow--just what it needs now peddaling opiates to anyone with a mild twinge has gone out of fashion and SRIs are out of patent. 

If Western governments had a shred of common sense and cared about the public more than industry, they would nationalize (and internationalize) pharma research now and get rid of drug patenting altogether. It does much more harm than good."

 Now we also know that North Korea has about 30 nuclear bombs, and produces about 6 more every year. They have apparently mastered the Teller-Ulam design, which means each bomb would have a yield of at least 250 kilotons, or about the equivalent of eight Hiroshima bombs.

So let's assume for a moment that, to defer the cost of their nuclear program, the North Koreans decide to sell thermonuclear bombs for about $100 million each.

The poorest country in the world is the Central African Republic. It has an annual budget of $300 million.

In other words, every country on Earth can now afford both a thermonuclear warhead and an ICBM.

Look at Singapore. Their government invested in a failed platform (Arcturus) but got equity in return for the investment by their state fund. Their plan was to sell the platform (if it worked) to 1/2/3 world countries and make profits off their investment. Not to give away patents feom an American company for free or give away vaccines for free. 

Our government could have equity stakes in Moderna and Novavax and still buy from the same companies boosting shareholders returns (taxpayers) for distribution to poorer countries. This will prevent pharma from being scared to partner w the US for fear of patent protections being stripped out for their platforms for other diseases. 

We can buy distribution for poorer countries. But we’re not China or Singapore in that we don’t mandate one platform for investment and distribution to other countries. We put Americans first (not America) in our jobs and pharma industry to ensure that platforms can be used in the next pandemic. 

Otherwise the Biden administration would be committing the gravest hari kuri of the greatest American scientific and logistics accomplishment in medical history. 

Why give that up freely to hurt our industry and jobs and research scientists just because other countries failed to buy the right platforms for their country like Asia (not India) and invested wrongly (like Temasek)?"

2021-03-21 21:19,What's the solution?
2021-03-21 21:19,"This was a moral failure and a smarts failure. We all know what the Former Guy administration thought about morals and smarts. From the get go, America and her government should have acted in the interests of people everywhere--and acted in the interest of getting everybody everywhere vaccinated. We gave Pfizer, Moderna and the others billions. The least we should have asked of them was a bit of decency all around, and not this shamefully selfish and inhumane refuse to let other companies elsewhere (that is, to license them to) make the vaccines. At this point, a lack of capacity is no excuse. Neither is the argument that other countries don't have the super-cold capability to distribute and administer some of the vaccines. The agreements signed by the prior administration should have included stipulations for licensing the vaccines to companies overseas who do have the capacity to make them. The J&J vaccine is perfectly adequate, for Americans or for humans anywhere on the planet."
2021-03-21 21:22,"Let me get this straight -- the US poured billions of dollars more into developing vaccines than the EU did. After they were successfully created, the US paid >$250m for retrofitting Merck production lines for J&J even though, according to WaPo, ""the Merck deal on its own is not expected to ramp up fast enough to impact vaccine supplies significantly in the next three months,"" by which time almost all US adults will have been offered the vaccine. In other words, the J&J/Merck deal negotiated and paid for by the Biden admin is mostly to help boosting global supply (and they did this for the vaccine with the easiest distribution -- no super lower temperatures and it only requires a single dose!). 

The US has ordered more doses than are required to vaccinate the whole population; no doubt it will be donating its excess (as it is doing to CA and MX with its AZ) free of charge. And it donated 4x more than the EU - 4 billion - to Covax, the global vaccine alliance. 

That's a lot of help given. We'll see how long it takes to vaccines to make their way round, but I'm not actually so sure that in this instance waiving IP would have done that much good, given how much $ and how long it would take to scale up supply chains, if they could even be scaled (supply problems in the EU for AZ mean AZ probably can't be manufactured elsewhere anyway)."

Just look at the US - 3% of the world's population but 20% of global COVID19 fatalities. And Europe does not fare much better - for the same reasons.

Most developing countries have extremely young populations in comparison - which makes them more resilient to the virus.

If you look at the data - virus spread, hospitalizations, fatalities - the vaccination needs to happen where the virus rages the most - the developed, ""rich"" countries.

In the meantime, limit international travel, close national borders, enforce quarantine of those crossing borders and implement disciplined testing. Regions with less vulnerable populations will just have to wait their turn."
2021-03-21 21:32,"In the main, this is a good article.  However, it does seem to target the US/European pharma, and notes that Russia is in the process of licensing their technology to other companies around the world. 

The article does NOT ask why China is not being expected to do the same, ditto for the Indian manufacturers (I believe there are two who have developed their own vaccines) a

But the article does not address the possibility that the vaccine manufacturing process for adeno-virus based vaccines may be different from those used for traditional inactivated or killed vaccines, and therefore the technology transfer process may involve a somewhat different skill set.

McKinsey put out a white paper that dug into the complexity of tech transfer, the hundreds of people and thousands of hours required to ensure that quality is maintained with biological production processes etc.

But maybe there's still an opportunity for the EU to recover from past missteps and to invest NOW to ensure production capacity for the next generation of vaccines which will likely be needed as variants continue to emerge.  These will also have to be produced at scale and the EU generally has a larger pool of skilled workers  and infrastructure in place to do so than most LMIC countries."
2021-03-21 21:33,"People everywhere need access to effective vaccines to get the pandemic under control. This is a global problem. We have surely learned that we do not live in a vacuum, have we not? One vaccine resistant variant from somewhere in the world can send us all back to the beginning.  Most of the cash needed to do the science and quickly manufacture billions of doses was put up by the public.

Makes you wonder where and who these vaccinations really go to.
2021-03-21 21:42,"If the U.S. and western governments want the Pharma companies to own the patents, the know how and at the same time ask these companies to increase the product to satisfy world demand in fairly short order, then maybe the West could fund manufacturing plants in a few countries and lease it to these vaccine manufacturers. This is one way they could protect their patents and know how. 

The U.S. is throwing money left and right on all sorts of initiatives maybe they could front a few billion dollars to fund a couple of large plants.

We cannot reach herd immunity if three quarters of the world population have not been vaccinated."
2021-03-21 21:49,"Vaccines are a unique product.  The willingness of people to use them is based on a belief that they're safe, effective, with quite small chance of serious side effects.  It's easy to say that manufacturing should proliferate to companies around the world but harder to imagine the consequences of a manufacturing effort getting it wrong and producing an unsafe version of one of the vaccines.  Consider the effect of the recent suspension of the Astrazeneca vaccine on vaccine hesitancy, and multiply that should it happen to the Pfizer, Moderna, or J&J vaccines.  Even Merck, already one of the premier vaccine makers and manufacturers, will require several months to be able to make the J&J vaccine to standards.  To those arguing for spreading around the manufacturing capability, be careful what you wish for - you may get it."
2021-03-21 21:52,"So many commentators here insist that only the profit motive is effective in producing advances in vaccines or medical science in general. While it is true that over the last 50 years or so profit has become the driving force in American life and our heroes now seem to be those who achieve billionaire status with no concern about how they got there and with little regard for morality or ethics, people seem to have forgotten Salk and Sabine who turned down billions in order to help humanity and they also seem to forget how much of the vital research was actually funded by the government with taxpayer money. It should be the function of the government to do what is best for all the people, not merely what produces the biggest profit and the most legalized bribes for officeholders.
   The point of the article was that the US government was in a position to enforce conduct by big pharma that not only would have been morally and ethically more responsible, but also would have provided greater safety to our own people, and they chose not to. The current administration should be moving hard to recover what little bit of that policy is still achievable.  Vaccinating every person in the US with the existing vaccines will prove of little use if we allow mutations to develop in other countries which are resistant or immune to these vaccines and which will inevitably make their way to the US."

2021-03-21 22:07,"This is the best argument I have heard yet, for _every country_ to invest in basic research as part of its public investment strategy at all costs.  The pandemic has esposed -- and continues to expose -- every shortcoming of every society it affected, and this is one of those shortcomings.

With investment in basic research, the countries that do so could have actually been active collaborators in the project to find a vaccine, and would thus have had a say in access.  Instead they must now rely on the goodwill of the rich countries.

The worst thing is that the poorer countries are in a deadly spiral downwards where under-investment in basic research renders these countries unable to muster the resources necessary to invest in basic research at the levels needed.  In the circumstances of the pandemic, that left poorer countries completely unready, and helpless once a vaccine formulation was found.  Again, just another of the shortcomings exposed by the pandemic."
2021-03-21 21:56,"At the moment we simply have not enough vaccine, we are not even close. That's why there is no point in complaining. Of course countries, that can produce vaccines, will use these vaccines for themselves. Everything else would be political suicide. We just experience in europe the backlash of a tampered roll-out.
And it is not just about financing the research. Producing vaccines also means building up an infrastructure. There will be vaccines, that are cheaper and easier to produce than those from moderna and pfizer, and very likely these vaccines will be available to all the world. But the vaccines we do have right now do need a ridiculous logistics. Building that up would need a big investment. I simply doubt, that anyone will finance the production of the vaccines in poorer countries."

Governments can allow their companies to produce a patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner in the case of an emergency like the current crisis.  
 
The industry explanation that the companies are licensing their vaccines as quickly as possible, but that finding partners with the right technology is a problem is a more logical explanation."
2021-03-21 22:34,"We are  living in precarious times due to covid-19. The normal rules of corporate interest that protect the profits of vaccine manufacturers will have to be set aside, because the only way the whole world is immune against the contagious coronavirus is that everyone receives a jab.   
While Western vaccine manufacturers have been urged to waive their Covid-19 patents, which  would allow cheap copies of their vaccines be made and sold, the Chinese and Russian vaccine manufacturers have been spared from this pressure.  
Nevertheless waiving intellectual property rights will not be enough to resolve the issue of vaccine access. The West could allow developing countries to produce their own inexpensive vaccinations instead of relying on charity. But it may take time for them to get their act together and reach the desired capacity."
2021-03-21 22:28,"Is there any evidence that requiring US firms to give up their intellectual properties will help vaccinating the world any faster? After all, such a move would not alleviate the numerous bottlenecks that pharmaceutical firms and governments already face in getting vaccines into arms, such as the special coating lipids necessary to stabilize mRNAs, super-strong glass vials, specialized syringes, ultra-cold storage facilities, and so forth, all of which are in critically short supplies around the world. Furthermore, providing a recipe for making a vaccine is of little help to someone without the manufacturing experiences, and all experienced manufacturers (such as the Serum Institute in India, Merck in the US, and Sanofi in France) that don’t have successful vaccines of their own are already in great demands to enter into production partnerships with those who do. Mass producing a vaccine is an extremely complex process that would take an experienced and well-equipped manufacturer with vast supply chains months to master, even with the active assistances of the likes of Moderna, J&J, Pfizer and BioNTech. The idea that vast new supplies of vaccines will appear as soon as these companies give up their intellectual properties is a pure fantasy."

2021-03-21 22:48,"We now have plenty of vaccine in the pipeline for everyone in the US to get vaccinated in the next 6 months or less. Besides being the right thing to do, finding a way to vaccinate the rest of the world holds two significant for benefits for the US. First, it cuts down the odds that we repeat the wrenching and expensive pandemic experience in a few years when new vaccines are needed to stop the new strains from abroad.  Second, it would engender some international good-will.  In the meantime, China is taking the lead on making their vaccine available to countries currently priced out of the market."
2021-03-21 22:51,"I completely agree that the government pre-orders should have come with stipulations about exporting manufacturing for the rest of the world, but look who was in charge.  Also, the authors breezed by the manufacturing plan in India by the company Serum.  This has been on the table for over a year.  No surprise nothing happened under Trump, but it sounds like Biden is pushing that.  A billion doses is a big deal, and Serum has said they can make more.  How are the patents involved (or not)?  When will they start? This is a big omission in this article."
2021-03-21 22:54,"Unfortunately whenever the governments of the West put any pressure on the pharmaceutical companies, the companies seem to take their displeasure out on Americans by making us pay more for life saving medicines.

Of course nobody will admit this and it’s not the sort of thing that’s easily proven:  but it certainly seems this way doesn’t it?  How else do you explain how eager the pharmaceutical companies are to generate their global profits and fund their R&D budgets on our backs while selling medicines at cost everywhere else?"

How about the moral responsibility to the countries that didn't give billions but whose citizens volunteered their bodies?

2021-03-21 22:55,"A few days ago a US delegation had a testy exchange with Chinese diplomats. Biden called the Russian president names. But to take on these countries, America will need allies. Here's the catch: both are happily distributing their vaccines around the world without trying to extract profits. They're both collecting a lot of goodwill right now, and one can only assume that lots of countries are rethinking their allegiance. Their old ally would rather make sure one of their industries (already awash in cash) turns an even bigger profit instead of helping them while their people are dying.
Just a few decades ago the US didn't have the slightest problem with distributing their (e.g. polio) vaccines around the world without trying to extract profits via IP law. I'm sure the poor pharmaceutical industry went almost bankrupt over this.
US foreign policy is a sad shadow of its former self. The carrot has all but disappeared and the stick is now worth 700 bn/year. Trump isn't the problem, he's just a symptom of a country that's no longer capable of looking at the bigger picture. What bothers is me is that Europe has fallen into the same trap of overt nationalism. Silly me thought we're better than this."
2021-03-21 23:08,"It's in the best interest of citizens in rich countries to have the whole world vaccinated so that no new variant of the virus emerges. However, we are not going to get there by giving away patents especially under the auspices of the World Health Organization.  Hate to tell the two journalists we don't live in the United Federation of Planets and by going by the comments, they haven't convinced most readers either."
2021-03-21 23:08,"Once we have spare doses, we should lend (to wealthier countries) or donate (to poorer ones) our excess doses.

Already, J&J, Novavax, and AZ are licensing technology to their trusted Indian partners, probably with strict non-disclosure agreements in place.

Between the USA, EU, and India, we have the potential to vaccinate about 4-5 Billion people by end-2022.  China & Russia can take care of their own populations (plus their client states).

But we should NEVER EVER give away the base technology.  That would be incredibly stupid.  Of course countries around the world want our technology. They can go develop it themselves (without using our patents in the process)."
2021-03-21 23:08,"I’m slightly confused by this line of reasoning.  Why does the author call out patents held only Western countries?  Doesn’t the Chinese government have a significant role to play in vaccinating the world?  Shouldn’t we be pressuring them to provide vaccines and the IP to make said vaccines? Why wouldn’t we pressure them to ramp up production and release the IP to make the CanSino and CoronaVac vaccines available globally? 

I know it’s easy to overlook China, but based upon on their actions surrounding the initial outbreak of the virus don’t they have a moral obligation to help vaccinate the world?"
2021-03-21 23:11,"""American and European officials gave up leverage that could have guaranteed access for billions of people"". It is interesting that both continents were trying to find a way to blame Israel for not vaccinating the Palestinians. Of course, Israel WAS vaccinating the Palestinians who reside in Israel just not the ones in the disputed territories who for 75 have been swearing to the elimination of Israel. How ironic."
2021-03-21 23:16,"However and whenever this ends, I think the key here is the global infrastructure and manufacturing capacity. Even if you share the patents, how quickly can you ramp up production? Even in the US, the manufacturing is behind schedule."
2021-03-21 23:18,"While there is a scarcity of vaccinations, there is no way governments are going to be sending vaccinations to other countries. You can make all the arguments you want but that is the truth."
2021-03-21 23:22,"The authors need to be reminded that nothing is free. Public goods must be subsidized by government (remember Econ 101?).  Unlike China and Venezuela, the United States cannot simply order vaccine companies to do the government's bidding. Ours is not a predatory state and our economy is not dominated by state owned enterprises.  Instead rich countries must come together to strengthen support for covax and other WHO led initiatives through financial contributions - to subsidize this public good. 

And sure, let's use the US patent to put pressure on big pharma to make deals with developing countries within an international framework. But let's do it within the confines of our free market system and in a way that won't bankrupt the innovators who will create the next vaccine when the next pandemic hits."
2021-03-21 23:27,"There simply is no simple, efficient, and practical solution to all this. Exhibit #1:  There is a huge amount of what used to be called ""human capital"" involved in getting from discovering the problem to implementing the solution.  Exhibit #2:  There are huge costs and equally huge risks.  Exhibit #3: like all other markets, this is a global market.

The people from Exhibit #1 have other options, so if we try to exercise control that way we face the real risk of driving out the very talent we need.

The people from Exhibit #2 have other options, as well.  If we make the overall enterprise less profitable than other enterprises, the financial capital will flow away from cures.

The people from Exhibit #3 have other options and will ship their product to wherever the best business outcome results.

It's fine and dandy that Bill and Melinda Gates have approved motives and approved contractural language, but even if they were willing to donate every penny they have, they couldn't make a dent in the looking global problem.

The only logical conclusion is to establish a national research, development, and production facility and perform those functions as a public service.  What we have with this editorial is the recommendation that we wreck the system that got us a vaccine in an unbelievably short time for some nebulous goal.  Good luck with that."

Yes – after times, after receiving an mRNA-based vaccine…

Find me the country – or its eldest cohort – that would be this confident, based on the efficacy of a legacy-technology vaccine…

There’s actually a global-scale clinical trial ongoing:

The answer here is not more tribute disguised as charity.  Rather western nations should threaten to cut off the charity spigot if these nations do not proceed forthwith with mass vaccinations paid for out of their own treasuries.  They would immediately stop the civil wars and gilded monarchies and start vaccinating their people.

When the deals were being done Donald Trump could have made sure underdeveloped countries at least had humanitarian use of the patents so they could use them to begin to acquire vaccine from manufacturers in developed countries who could also help them set up their own manufacturing infrastructure so when (not if) the next pandemic pathogen emerges they can contribute significantly to managing it themselves. Donald Trump didn't do it for two reasons. His famous appellation for ""those countries"" tells you all you need to know about the racism aspect of his decision and his ""why should I help anyone but myself"" tells you the rest.

I think Joe Biden would like to be able to remove the patent problem but 1) if he tried he'd be tied up in court for years and 2) at this point in the progressive program he wants to implement healthcare is a if not the major component and getting sideways with BIG PHARMA - or small pharma - on the patents would guarantee PAC expenditures against his program Like You Wouldn't Believe."

It's not that the companies don't want to make more, they aren't able to. I don't think that breaking the patent would make a big difference - it's not like the tollhouse cookie recipe. Plus there is the incredible refrigeration challenge. I think it is much more likely that the J&J vaccine is something that could go around the world.

First, hasn't Moderna announced that it won't enforce its property rights until the pandemic is over? If so -- and the article doesn't deny it -- then why do US and EU need any leverage? Don't developing countries already have a green light to produce the vaccine?

So, second, there seems to be more in play than the right to produce the vaccine. One hint seems to be contained in the article's cryptic reference to Moderna's ""delivery system — the cassette player — that is its most prized secret. Disclosing it could mean giving away the key to the company’s future.""  What does that mean? And are the authors suggesting that the US and EU should have used ""leverage"" to take that away from Moderna?

If so, ""leverage"" means theft, unless governments fully compensate Moderna for its forgone profits.

Glib talk about ""leverage"" is understandable, but if governments act in bad faith, there better not be any more pandemics, because next time drug companies may not want to collaborate with the governments. If we truly care, don't let's be myopic."

I lived in northern Central America for many years and most foreign aid (whether money or goods) is stolen. Medicine sales to those governments is a racket. They out to tender specifying strange quantities (e.g., a pack of 11 or 17) and then close the bidding within minutes as soon as the their criminal friends have made their bids. If you send money to those countries to manufacture vaccines, it will be stolen.

2021-03-22 9:32,"for years the federal government( my money) has financed research which has greatly enriched corporations. When does this end. WE the people should hold these patents for the profit of our federal government- which should then be used to either pay down the federal debt- or sent as checks to We the people. Yes we will need to vaccinate the world-so lets keep profit out of this. Do not want these corporations to dictate who gets what. Do not citizens realise that the fear of the ""Big Federal Government"" has led to the"" Big Private Enterprise "" making the decisions about our lives. I prefer the Federal Government ( my money) to be in charge of those decisions."
2021-03-22 8:55,"Your article does not mention the decision to distribute the British/Swedish Astra Zeneca Vaccine globally at £5 a shot, which is the cheapest western Vaccine. It was designed by Oxford University, England and is being mass produced by the Serum Institute of India to the rest of the world. It makes up half of the response for poor countries."
2021-03-22 9:33,"This column doesn't seem to root in reality. No one, not even the globalists, would want to risk the ire of locals by giving away the much sought after vaccine at this stage. China and Russia could afford to do that because of their autocratic regime. Even for President Biden, who remains a globalist a la President Obama, needs to be careful in exercising vaccine discretion by sending only 4M doses of AstraZeneca COVID vaccine to Canada and Mexico.

Every educated and scientific based leader knows you need to vaccinate the World to make everyone safe from the pandemic but giving vaccine to others when there is an acute shortage at home is not a good way to keep education and science as the basis of governing when the populists of all strips will use it to seize power"
2021-03-22 11:30,"It's nice, but unfortunate it is necessary, for one of the co-authors to explain misconceptions in the comments I perused. 
Those readers missed that getting vaccines to the poor countries of the world did not have to come at their expense. There were creative--but missed oppotunities to use government leverage that would have increased capacity, including within those countries that, with appropriate support, could have helped.
However, the motivation to keep them in mind has to be there--even when we're scared and frustrated.
Is this part of JFK's Inaugural Address really a relic?: ""To those peoples...of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required... because it is right.” 
That was in the same speech as the maybe also forgotten: “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.”
Or, as the U.S. attempts to re-find itself, do we still identify with these, despite all we have been through?
Do we still care about those in poor countries in even worse straits than most of us, particularly if it doesn't cost us much or anything, but even in some cases if it does?
Is it accepted that ""We're all in this together?"" Or is that aphorism, as well as that speech, best forgotten?"
2021-03-22 11:07,"Producing vaccine is a rather complicated and complex process. Do people really believe that companies like Pfizer, for example, intentionally produce less than what they cold have achieved? 

Serum Institute of India (SII) is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer who was authorized by AstraZeneca and Oxford University to produce vaccines rather early last year. As of now, Serum Institute of India has produced around 3-4 million bottles, Yes, the numbers sound impressive but please consider the total papulation of India and the fact that everyone needs 2 shoots. Please also don't forget that production on may important vaccines, i.e. measles, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis, have been placed on hold to give room to manufacturing of COVID vaccines. IS THIS ETHICAL?"
2021-03-22 13:34,"This article is fundamentally confused about the patents involved.  The patent soon to issue to the NIH has no legal force until it issues, and even then, has no legal force for anything but making and selling in the U.S.   Moreover, the U.S. won’t be asserting its patent to prevent the doses being made for the U.S. (which would be self-defeating, and implicitly licensed since the U.S. is the purchaser).

This notion of “sharing patents” between companies is also confused.  The contents of all patents are public — disclosure is the quid pro quo for the limited monopoly.  The thing the companies would need to share is all the unpatented trade secret knowledge that helps them make the vaccines.  That trade secret knowledge is often far more valuable, and will last forever (instead of just a 20-year patent term) as long as it stays secret.  Asking a company to give up their trade secrets is always going to be a nonstarter.  The more realistic option is to contract that the companies must make the drug for the other countries at cost as a condition to getting the contract to sell to the U.S.  But that presupposes that the U.S. (or whatever other wealthy country you pick) is prepared to then pay more for its own doses, as the company can always just say no if this makes it more beneficial to come to market on its own dime rather than with government funding.  This article unfortunately ignores that last part, which is no doubt how all the wealthy countries got here."

2021-03-22 13:43,"We've heard all of this before with developing medications for HIV. The US and other governments along with publicly funded universities provide massive support for research but then the patents to medications are the property of the large pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, we watch people suffer and die in parts of the world (even here) who can't afford medications. I remember showing my HIV medications to people living HIV in South Africa in 2000 (young people) who took the pills and examined them like they were diamonds. It was a moment I'll never forget as a reporter writing about HIV. Countries are supposed to play by the international rules while their citizens die. How ironic, that the strand from South Africa is now spreading around the world. The point is this: like with HIV the virus continues to spread beyond borders infecting rich and poor alike. This is public health 101. Everyone gets treated if you want to stop the spread."
2021-03-22 14:12,"The US, UK, EU nations, China, Japan, and other wealthy nations should compensate the drug companies to license to other companies the right to produce extra doses of their vaccines. There is a delicate balance to be achieved here. The drug companies need to be rewarded for their remarkable achievement so that when we need them to do this again they will remember how much money they made this time, but we also need to get as many people in the world vaccinated as fast as possible. So, we must make it worth it to them to license their patents to reputable manufacturers. Some strong arming is appropriate, but, in the end, we need them to understand for the next time that doing right be the world is good business."

2021-03-22 15:31,"I'm surprised the article didn't reference the prior situation re. medication, the 2001 TRIPS Agreement/Doha Declaration regarding universal access re. medication  - how it worked and how it failed. One wonders if this was the real reason for the US leaving WHO.

Another angle which doesn't seem to be brought up in this article is who were the trials on? Those people were key in the formation of an effective vaccine. I would imagine they were either paid a pittance for their involvement or nothing at all."

2021-03-22 15:31,"Canada, with population of only 37.5 million,  is a rich country but poor in vaccines.  My friends in  UK India, and US who wanted a vaccine have had one, with second dose in 3-4 weeks.  We are still waiting in Canada.  When I get my first dose, the second dose will be four months later, that is, if I get my first dose in mid April, my second dose will be in mid August!  US and Europe have been too possessive of vaccines forgetting that the the whole world needs to be vaccinated at the same time in order to reach herd immunity."

Take one vaccine technology, say Johnson and Johnson, and build production facilities in the US.  Someone will be sure to say how hard that would be, but we've accomplished hard things as a country in the past.   Pay J&J a certain amount per vial and sell the vaccine to other countries at cost.  Then in 5-10 years, convert the plants to making a number of vaccines for the US population.   This solves the problem with sending intellectual property out to manufacturers in other countries and provides jobs for Americans."

Many of the vaccine manufactures have reached deals with COVAX to provide doses to the developing world.  For example US developer Novavax has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to provide 1.1 billion doses to low and middle income countries this year.  For the two mRNA vaccines the cold storage requirements of these vaccines makes them impractical to distribute in much of the world.

I believe the agreement with Mexico may be similar, but for 1.5 million doses."

So, please, don't shame the US for wanting prioritize its citizens first. Supposedly. I cannot get an appointment and neither can my friends who are their 80s. Pretty absurd.

You think less affluent countries' rollouts are going to be more organized than the US (it's so piecemeal and chaotic) and not at all prone to corruption and graft?"

2021-03-22 14:53,"It's bad science to ignore the needs of other/poorer countries, because as we allow the virus to run wild, it will mutate and it will come back to the US and kill our people.
 
Helping poor countries by sharing patents, will take away nothing from our ability to vaccinate our own.

Pharmaceutical companies have a habit of stealing government research, patenting it and then charging the government an arm and leg for the ""research"" that the government has already paid for.

In short, they're thieves.  And when an organization is so focused on profit with little regard for public health, we need to be very skeptical."
2021-03-22 17:01,"I think it is not nefarious for the US to prioritize vaccination for its own citizens.  Over half a million people have died here.  Also, is it really time to attack the ""evil"" drug companies that are busy trying to save our collective fannies?  

If the WTO wants government rather than corporate vaccines, the Chinese and Russian vaccines are available.  Have they shared the ""recipe""?  No?  Hmmm.

I agree that once the US gets its pandemic under control, it should target helping other countries get access to the vaccines, but breaking intellectual privacy laws is probably not the best way to do it.  

Many countries are not priority for the vaccines because they do not have the level of transmission that we see in the Americas and Europe.  India and Nigeria have had relatively few cases per capita, and that is a good thing!"

2021-03-20 16:27,"Europe and the EMA for years have used their monopolistic clout and “value assessments” to drive down drug prices in an anti-competitive fashion.  With the vaccines, they were complacent and bureaucratic, seriously miscalculating the market,  the need,  and the demand for treatment. The US wisely invested in R&D to gain a competitive advantage for its citizens. The E.U. was not “conservative” in any way that term is understood, and the US embraced free-market principles by proactively investing at risk in innovation, and not relying on centralized buying."

""“In a crisis, it always becomes clear that the E.U. is not a country,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, of the German Marshall Fund.""

Still, it's a very efficient system and almost everyone i know over 50 has now been vaccinated."
2021-03-20 16:35,"Is there, possibly, a connection between the failures of the EU and the fact that they are largely Socialist systems? It is surprising that money is not spared for health care, education, or other social services, but when it came to vaccines during a pandemic, fiscal conservatism reigned."
2021-03-20 16:42,"The older vaccine technologies have a track record of failures in development and problems and delays during manufacture.  The newer mRNA technology is better on both of these counts and also it produces a cleaner vaccine with less chance of unwanted side effects.  By betting on the older tech, they were actually making the riskier bet.  I'm not sure who was picking vaccines for Warp Speed, but they knew what they were doing."
2021-03-20 16:43,"A good summary. The EU's goal of providing vaccines to all member states, both big and small at the same time, was laudable. The execution has been a disaster so far. The EU Commission should never have been allowed to run it. They don't have the expertise. It has gotten too powerful without appropriate accountability.  Von Der Leyen, Kyriakides, Breton & Gallina have blundered. They should be considering their positions. But they won't. 
This has dented citizens' trust in the EU and if it does not reform, other countries will follow the UK to the exit."
2021-03-20 16:47,"I’m writing from Finland which is in the EU. Maybe the vaccine roll out here is somewhat slow, but as a small country we wouldn’t have any vaccines if we were out of the EU. We would have hopeless fight against bigger countries in this issue. Mistakes have been made but things are getting better."
2021-03-20 16:48,"I also would like to bring some additional light about AstraZeneca. In two days in August 2020, AZ happily signed two contracts with both the EU and the UK for quantities vastly superior to what it could produce. In each case these contracts contained clauses that ensured deliveries could not be hampered by deliveries to others parties. AZ then waited till December 2020 before deciding on which subcontractor would have to produce these doses for the EU. Then in January, AZ sent millions doses produced in the EU to the UK despite the fact that the EU had prepaid for these doses and that the EU was counting on these doses to jumpstart its vaccination campaign. In effect the EU paid to kickstart the UK's vaccination drive. Finally, AZ repeatedly lied to the EU about why it was underdelivering, but had no qualms trying to export from the EU to Australia.
So yes, the EU should have checked on AZ earlier, but AZ's behavior is far from blameless too."
2021-03-20 16:50,"What a difference between this article and recent NYT piece from March 18. 
""Europe was more fiscally conservative""-this statement is an essence of their problem, not ""widespread hostility to science"" as per Paul Krugman.
I was never a big fan of Donald Trump, but his vaccine procurement was in my opinion core of our better vaccine rollout.
Surely his motives were probably entirely political ,but as a result we have more vaccine doses than other countries ( with few exceptions)."
2021-03-20 16:50,"In reality the EU was simply expressing its character, ie a penchant for low risk, communal, thought out positions. 

The US would be closer to that but clearly it’s government and it’s vaccine operations had one priority and that was to re-elect the occupant on the White House at that time.  The vaccines have been safe and of high quality, so the US choice paid off, but it could have gone the other way as well. 

The UK used nationalism and a local vaccine plus a serious reverence of experts that the US did not have, and is in a sense the more interesting case as they converted a liability (access to mostly one vaccine only) into a plus."
2021-03-20 16:52,"Sounds like the EU is learning the wrong lessons from this pandemic, and future responses could be even more fragmented and chaotic. Still, wasn't part of the slow response due to complacency over the control of the virus outbreak early on? And for perspective, how much of the US investment was ""wasted"" on candidates that did not work out 9yet)?"
2021-03-20 16:54,"There is luckily light at the end of the tunnel. Starting mid April, the EU will get a much higher supply of vaccines from different suppliers. And in a two month time, the Curevac RNA vaccine should be ready too.
The EU has acknowledged the issue of supply, and is now massively increasing production. Its current capacity is now on par with the USA, and should double to 150-200million doses per month around June. The EU could very well end up being the n°1 supplier of vaccines to the rest of the world. In contrast, the UK produces 6 to 8 million doses per month."
2021-03-20 16:56,"Since healthcare companies are highly regulated, free market solutions can only be imagined, though the vaccines could have been sold 6 months earlier had it not had to wait for approval, and even the AstraZeneca halt was because government decisions over free people's choices.

And most EU have nationalized health.

And if you aren't high risk, lack of being vaccinated isn't as horrifying as implied here.  

Trying to balance liberty and risk is a fool's errand."
2021-03-20 17:05,"Don't pat the US on the back too hard - we could have done much, much better.  Our main advantage was the federal government's monetary control, which prevented states that develop and manufacture vaccines from holding other states hostage.  

Where we failed was letting states go their own way on the basic science of masking and distancing, but Europe didn't do much better, again because of a weak central government.

There are some perks to having more autonomy among states, but for crisis response, a strong central authority can be better - when led effectively..."
2021-03-20 17:12,"If the EU is slow, then other parts of the world are going to be glacial.  It feels like the reality of a mutating virus is out there, but leaders, health officials, and media are talking/advising/reporting in terms of simple human expectation:
That the virus will meet a final end.

Is every Joe and Jill Blow on the planet being led to connect dots and believe that herd immunity equals end of virus?

I don't understand how false expectation helps me and everyone else.  In some corners, the virus' destruction was mocked from day one.  With the vaccine rollout, respect for the virus' reach is trending toward zero.

If it is true, when do we get a dose of ""The virus with its variants will never completely go away""?

What? That is not impressed upon us -- until the virus HASN'T gone away?  By then, social distancing will go the way of the mask and the dodo bird."

2021-03-20 17:19,"It really is quite frustrating watching how slowly the vaccine rollout is here, and hopefully we can learn from this. It's worrysome as we enter a third wave, though.

What is nice is that I do not have to constantly refresh websites to try to find a vaccine appointment when I am eligible for a vaccine. Instead, I will receive an invitation by mail, where I will then make an appointment to be vaccinated at the hospital where I am an outpatient. This is automatic - my doctor has already informed the authorities where I am in the list. The general public will go to the government health authority's vaccination sites starting in May. It is quite organized in that respect, at least."
2021-03-20 17:27,"My father-in-law in Madrid is 80 and js still awaiting his first shot here through the public health care system. Comparatively, my parents back in the states have been fully vaccinated over a month now. The execution at least in Spain has been clumsy, slow and mismanaged. To my knowledge; there are no wait lists in any of these public health centers to expedite the process and get people in to replace missed appointments. The incentive is just not there to organize that. I’ve been living here for 20 years and am so disappointed in what I’m seeing. 30 year old forest firefighters getting a shot ahead of my father in law??? Thank you for a great read."
2021-03-20 17:29,"An article that examines the relative slowness of vaccination in Europe should also focus on Oxford University’s partnership with AstraZeneca. The initial choice of partner by Oxford University was Merck, for AstraZeneca was then really not considered a vaccine specialist, while Merck was much more experienced in vaccines research, development, clinical trials, and mass-manufacturing. Yet UK political considerations led Oxford University to choose AstraZeneca over Merck as its partner. One day, one should really examine whether its relatively lack of experiences had also contributed to this vaccine’s comparatively slow rollouts and regulatory approvals in the EU and the U.S."
2021-03-20 17:38,"I believe there is a lot of nuance between the US and UK approaches that the EU could learn from. The UK seems to be emphasizing that more people get single shots even if they need to wait longer for a second shot, while the US seems to be more focused on getting people both shots before opening up the vaccine availability to more people. There are arguments favoring both approaches but so far it looks like the UK approach is better. It may be due to the different vaccines (UK is largely the AZ vaccine, US is not using that one right now but is entirely using the Pfizer/Biontech, Moderna vaccines). So there’s a lot to learn from the two different approaches and the EU may be able to optimize based on the outcomes."
2021-03-20 17:47,"Here in Cyprus they just started with 65 year olds.  We are still in partial lockdown with 0.60 to 0.85 percent positive rate.

2021-03-20 17:48,"The American success comes a large part on ""buy now, think later"". From both operation warp speed and Joe Biden.
Europeans are very cautious. One event that left me a lasting impression was when I began living in Europe years ago, at a flea market in Germany. I wanted to spend 2 euros on some black specialty tape. The German couple urged me to think twice if I needed that tape at all, although it was a good price. I thought come on, just 2 Euros what do I have to lose. But somehow, they dissuaded me from the impulse buy. They thought spending 2 Euros to clutter up the home was not worth it. 
It's a little bit of the same mentality when the European leaders purchased the vaccine. 
This week I called Germany and found out my 75-year-old friend will only be fully vaccinated mid-May. Therefore, my 30-something 40-something friends in Germany likely won't even have their turn before the end of this year.  It was quite upsetting for me to find out that their cautiousness got into the way of safety.
I do tell my German friends though, Americans suffered enough from the Buy Now Think Later mentality. It's ok that Americans, for once, benefit from it."
2021-03-20 17:48,"I love Europe for many reasons. But the bureaucracy, conceived broadly in terms of the extensive written and unwritten rules that dominate government, business, and everyday life in Europe, is so deeply rooted that improvisation in an emergency is unheard of. Institutions do not deviate from their rules and individuals rarely take over the roles of authorities, except in minor instances of deviations from unwritten rules. While the article focuses on delays in procurement and approval, the distribution is really the key problem here. Governments need to understand that you need to stop at nothing to vaccinate populations as fast as possible, which means with little to no regulation, red tape, or bureaucracy. Make major efforts to direct vaccines to the elderly by taking it to them. But use public vaccination sites and mobile distribution to vaccinate whoever shows up. While the elderly are at most risk, younger populations are doing the most to spread the disease. When you exhaust your supplies, which Europe is far, far from doing right now, you take emergency measures to replenish them. You know this in advance and prepare in 2020 by nationalizing whatever you can't buy; you suspend patents if necessary. In short, you make a wartime effort to end the pandemic."
2021-03-20 17:49,"The article points out several reasons 
about why te vaccine rollout is currently slower in the EU compared to the US, but some bias is 
easily detectable in several arguments. For instance, it is mentioned that the EU has been behind the US in making a deal with AstraZeneca, when the US has not approved the AstraZeneca vaccine either because clinical triala outside the US are not accounted for in the regulations. I could not imagine the media reaction to a similar behavior by the EU, surely pointing to incompetence and rigid bureaucracy. 

Besides all that, a simply reason of why the EU is lagging behind US or UK is that they are exporting vaccines, while the US and the UK don’t (the 3 million agreement of the US yesterday is testimonial). The EU has exported since they have records starting in middle February, more than 35 million doses. This constitutes about 10% of the popularion, so added to the current administered doses that would put the EU among the same levels as the US despite starting the campaign a month later. If we estimate the doses exported in December and January as more or less the same 20-30 additional million doses, which is plausible, that means that the EU has just been too naive expecting that free market rules would apply 
in the other side.

Comment should be made in the article about the US and UK success relying mainly in their ban to exportations (official ban US, or de facto ban as UK, I don’t care). And this is not fair for delveloping countries"
2021-03-20 17:50,"It's very interesting to see the US take a decidedly socialistic approach by the last administration when it mattered (to the wealthy). And the vaccine roll-out is going relatively well because the new administration invoked the DPA  and other means to increase production and delivery, and including required supplies like syringes. In a huge crisis, socialism and big government are the answer. 

It sounds like we owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. Slaoui."
2021-03-20 17:50,"The header says: “While Washington went into business with the drug companies, Europe was more fiscally conservative and trusted the free market.”

There is virtually no connection between this header and what the article says. Among other things, the slowness of Europe is not attributed to the “free market” but to EU government red tape and safety concerns. And no attempt is made to detail the “business with the drug companies” in the US which included taxpayer funded research on this type of vaccine, and then taxpayer rip-off in the pricing procedure for acquiring the product.

Simply put, the Trump Administration made vaccine production in the USA a taxpayer funded bonanza while the EU was “fiscally conservative”."
2021-03-20 17:52,"Hmm...this article follows the op-ed by Paul Krugman, also largely blaming the EU for its response to the pandemic.
The issue is deeply complicated for a union with so many members and positions that cannot be compared to the differences say, between policies in California, Texas or New York, which may differ in policy, but fall under one central government.
Europe, and here in Italy, adopted strict and unified measures for all during the pandemic, and as the third wave is striking hard, we don't have adequate vaccines.
After initial deals failed to deliver with Pfizer and AstraZeneca in the first trimester, we are now 2+ months behind the US and Britain, who concentrated on their own populations.
Now the roll out has re-started and most(70%) adult Europeans will be vaccinated by the summer- this is the goal. Most people here have accepted the wait, although now the pressure is on.
Europe has respected its contracts in sending vaccines produced here in the EU to non EU countries which previously ordered them. But now, Frans Timmerman, vice president of the EU has announced the possibility of hoarding such vaccines produced here to inoculate EU citizens first....familiar story...
In any case I don't think too harshly about such a policy that considers the global situation in a pandemic- rather to blame could be the EU's along with the industrial nations' inability to organize for an apparently inevitable global health emergency."
2021-03-20 17:57,"I thoroughly disliked Trump but I have to admit he set up our current success by prepaying for large numbers of doses from multiple manufacturers. There is a lot of redundancy in our approach.

As far as the EU goes, they are very similar to the US in that they have many states with their own prerogatives, rights, and cultures all vying for power with the bloc and with each other. The big difference in the US is that by law, the Federal government overrides the states in may regards plus we have had 240 years to work out some of the kinks.

I am not worried about the EU and the vaccine. They will figure it out. This is just a bump in the road."
2021-03-20 18:00,"“While the human and economic toll is vast, this era of COVID 19 offers us an outstanding example of the randomness of success or failure. While the situation is still playing out in a complex system, it shows that small or minor factors can result in massive and unintended consequences on both a macro or micro level.”

We rely upon statistics of questionable accuracy  to bring order to pandemic chaos. The assumed accuracy of unreliable statistics is behind analyses of the success and failure of various countries’ efforts to deal with the pandemic. But the inherent lack of reliability of these statistics and the purported explanations of comparative success or failure result in false confidence concerning cause and effect. There is much reason to believe that the spread and control of COVID is effectively random, based as it is on countless chance occurrences and random local decisions."
2021-03-20 18:00,"The US —Trump Administration, that is — made important and successful bets in Operation Warp Speed.  For that, they deserve immense credit.

However, it’s important to note that Operation Warp Speed did what Republicans habitually oppose and deride, and deride with regard to pandemic economic stimulus legislation:  “throwing money at the problem”.  As the article demonstrates, throwing money at the vaccine development & production problem worked.

No Democratic Administration could have gotten away with it.  Cascades of Republican criticism, derision, and obstructionism would have hobbled the effort, just as with Obama Administration economic and health care legislation.

Republican-implemented liberal policies and methods are saving the day."
2021-03-20 18:03,"Europe didn't 'trust the free market,'  they were late to reserve and purchase vaccines.  I have no idea why, but believe it is tied to politics and money.  The UK did a good job reserving the vaccines, and were criticized for their plans by the EU.

But the real mistake was to halt vaccinations based on negative reports regarding 0.00001% of those that received the shot.  Perfection is the enemy of good."
2021-03-20 18:04,"At the end of the day, the Americans were surprisingly entrepreneurial, not socialist, going with moderate-risk, high-payoff mRNA technology, without worrying that the companies involved were tiny and unproven.  The Europeans went with a safer bet, they thought. To add to that, the Americans calculated the cost of the technologies  (billions) compared with the size of the economy (trillions), but the Europeans calculated the cost of the vaccine-- the way you or I might fuss over the cost of a quart of milk. Now they are crying over it."
2021-03-20 18:09,"This is looking like the biggest deal right now, especially if you're European, but I think it's not. Let me elaborate. The vaccination campaign pursues two goals: first the reduction of deaths and severe cases, then the possibility of losing restrictions and opening up.
When it comes to the first goal, the vaccinations came sadly a little too late for the winter wave in all countries. Perhaps it helped a little in the UK, but in Germany cases were going down in January anyway and up until February, and given that deaths come with a delay it's hard to imagine we could have prevented a lot by starting a few weeks earlier. Now the most vulnerable people are vaccinated in Europe too and I expect the current surge in cases to be far less deadly.
When it comes to the second goal, it might be that the US and UK reach the critical mass a month or two before the EU. But if last year is any indication, we might see cases go down in the summer anyway and then it doesn't matter if it's done in July or August or September.
To summarize, the selfishness and chauvinism this little spectacle has brought us are probably for nothing. Our answer as Western world here is greed and envy instead of solidarity and graciousness. I fear this is going to drive deeper the wedge in our already fragile alliance."
2021-03-20 18:17,This article neglects the fact that the German government invested 350 million Euros in BioNtech where the the two Turkish immigrant scientists developed the vaccine that is now made by Pfizer and is critical to the vaccine rollout in United States.Now the German government has invested 350 million Euros in Curevac to develop a multivalent vaccine or next generation.GSK will manufacture and sell this vaccine in most of the world except Germany.The pandemic is not a static situation as we see the spread of the variants and their increased lethality.Those multivalent vaccines will be vital  to controlling the spread of these rapidly mutating variants.
2021-03-20 18:22,"We Canadians owe profound, long-term gratitude to the EU. Without Europe, Canada would have had no vaccines at all. The EU permitted its manufacturers to sell us vaccines when other countries didn't. Also, I admire the way the EU made sure ALL its members, inc. the economically poorer ones and the ones that lack vaccine manufacturing capacity, received vaccines. They have a winning formula: One for all, and all for one!"
2021-03-20 18:54,"I am an American living in central Paris, currently not yet eligible for the vaccine at age 59 with no health problems. You would never even know that a vaccine is available when you walk through this city. No signage, no public relations campaign, no vaccination centers. There are small testing tents outside a few pharmacies but nothing related to the vaccine. It’s a colossal failure, a catastrophe that can’t yet be measured."
2021-03-20 18:56,"This is a strange outcome.  I thought the US approach was the obvious approach, to pour billions into the vaccine development.  Perhaps the one thing the US had over Europe was that we didn't care if we made millionaires out of the drug companies, because the lockdown was so economically harmful.  Was it our lack of attention to 'fairness', that people might get rich and not complete deserve it, but that we didn't care about that?  That's my take.  It was one of the things I specifically addressed when I suggested pouring the billions in, that we shouldn't be concerned that it might not seem 'fair'."
2021-03-20 19:00,"The mention of the 'free market' is a total non-sequitur, since a) the EU's delay is primarily attributable to the late signing of contracts for vaccines, motivated by a desire to secure the lowest price, and b) the vaccines 'market' is hardly a market and not free anyway - the medicines are not available to private individuals or entities for a start."
2021-03-20 19:02,"Sadly, this crisis will only reinforce the ideas that Britain's deal to leave the EU was a good one, and that the EU as a block is simply a fractured collection of dissimilar countries each with its own interests and tied together only by cumbersome laws and a common currency."
2021-03-20 19:07,"It may be the case that the U.S has a flexible, liberal system where people who turn up will be vaccinated but it’s not right to simply say that the U.K. is the same. In the U.K appointments are offered by invitation according to priority of need via the NHS/local General Practitioners Practices. It may be true that if doses were to be wasted they would be given to someone who was not due to be vaccinated but the process is invite driven. I was called up earlier than I expected based on my age and health but the system had accounted for me being a carer. The U.K. has got many things wrong regarding the pandemic but the NHS and the vaccination effort have been very successful."
2021-03-20 19:16,"The EU as defined by Brussel Bureaucrats invested  no money in vaccine development.
Then they tried to use their size to negotiate the cheapest price possible for the vaccine. Muscling in on the investments the UK made in AstraZeneca. 
AstraZeneca  contract clearly stated best effort to fulfil the EU order.  The CEO of AstraZeneca is an honorable person and he refused to bow to the EU bullying.
Even now the EU is trying to bully the UK into supplying the EU with vaccine by threatening to stop Pfizer exports to the UK.  Despite the majority of countries in the EU having stockpiles of AstraZeneca vaccine unused. 

The biggest laugh is the UK is the only supplier of a Key component of the PFizer vaccine. If the UK decides to control exports as the EU is the Pfizer vaccine can not be produced."
2021-03-20 19:23,"The article mentions that the EU was late to secure contracts compared to the US, but it should be mentioned also that the UK's deal with AstraZeneca was actually signed *after* the EU's. 
The reason thr UK is being served first by AstraZeneca therefore seems to have more to do with politics (AstraZeneca is part-British) and the fact that the UK contract has more enforceable penalties for non-deliveries.

The EU prides itself in playing by the rules, but in this instance it needs to be more assertive -- for instance in ensuring that vaccines produced in the EU are offered to EU citizens, instead of being shipped to the UK as they are now."
2021-03-20 19:29,"Trump's 'Operation Warp Speed,' to his credit, was successful.  What Trump can also take credit for (but won't) is NOT having a solid plan to actually get people vaccinated.  He likely would have passed the buck to the States again who would be competing with each other for vaccine like they did with PPE last year. We all know how well that went.

By sheer luck we had an election and the new Biden administration transition team quickly realized there was no real plan. Had 2020 not been an  election year I doubt the US would be seeing such a successful vaccine rollout."
2021-03-20 19:35,"Bill Gates suggested starting production of potential vaccines well ahead of the completion of trials and subsequent approval with the risk of a lot of wasted effort and cost, but with the reward of getting getting to start inoculation at maximum volume once the approvals are in. It seems this wasn't done, at least not full monty, but ramping up production was left to the manufacturers (spurred by the pre-orders by EU&UK&US and US' Warp Speed though). I wonder whether Mr. Gates' plan would have been realistic and whether it would have made a significant difference to the current zero-sum game."

The way it seems to me now, that (apart from the AZ contract, which certainly could've been negotiated more skillfully) EU simply bet on different horse than US (and bet less).  The question is how informed the betting was - i.e was it a mistake or a judgement call that didn't pay off.

Not knowing the details, I can imagine a scenario where the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines don't appear as fast and the other companies EU has contracted are succesful and US is not as much ahead..

Also as a EU citizen which does not live in Germany or France, I'm extremely grateful for the EU-wide program even if it ran into a few hitches - I don't even want to imagine being left to gentle mercy of my local government - both competence and purchasing power-wise. I'm pretty sure that's something Americans from smaller, poorer states can empathize with..."

I called the local vaccination center here in Ile-de-France this week to ask for an appointment. I was turned down, despite all the condtions I cited above. I was told that the best guess is that I might qualify for a vaccine by June or July. The EU has seriously mismanaged this crisis. I just hope that I don't pay with my life."

NO.NO.NO. You’re talking about taxpayer’s LIVES! That bean counter should be the last person in all of Europe to get a vaccine, as punishment for thinking that she's good at her job. 

As much as it pains me to write this, the Trump administration got this right. They threw money at the problem, and hedged their bets. Biden has also opted into the additional vaccines in the contracts. So now we actually have vaccines to administer. Meanwhile the EU bureaucrats are passing the savings on."

Some states are farther behind than others. Places that probably should have gone back into lockdown in the US did not because people are more worried about their civil rights than community health. 

NY has an abysmal system for appointments with the savviest computer uses getting appointments over people who need them first. We knew vaccines were coming, so why wasn't a system in place when it happened. It was embarrassing that West Virginia was way ahead of NY in vaccination rates. How are we going to have bragging rights when more than 40% of GOP men say they are not going to be vaccinated even when their hero finally said they should. (It was another opportunity for him to get in a racist comment.) We also could have bet on the wrong vaccines. Luck played a big part."

Just Trump.
But somehow a pro-business Republican desperate to be reelected made the deals that gave us the earliest vaccines, and despite the chaos of federalism, we are still ahead of Europe. I don't imagine DT will ever be given any credit for the early and diverse rollout of vaccines (or a trade policy aiming to be less dependent on China's monopoly of supply chains, or an end to ""endless wars"" started by previous presidents, or overdue criticism of CCP totalitarianism), but maybe, in the interest of learning from history we should take a broader view of what works and what doesn't."
2021-03-20 17:42,"What should have been mentioned is what angers the Europeans quite a bit:
Whereas the EU has so far exported more than 40 million doses of vaccine (about half of them to the UK!) the USA as well as the UK have an export ban on locally manufactured vaccines! So there is a growing feeling in the EU that they are being treated unfairly.
Michael Gove, an english mnister in Johnson´s cabinet said explicitely in a BBC interview when asked if exports would be allowed: ""No!""
And the US has stockpiled millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and refuses to export them though until now the vaccine has not been approved."

The closing happy talk that despite the problems ""they are only 5 weeks behind the US"" seems unconvincing given the misguided creation of a vaccination phobic public. Anyway a more apt comparison is neighboring Britain or Israel whom they lag by far larger margins. But stay tuned. In 5 weeks will the EU be 8 weeks behind the US and 5 months behind Britain?"

The richest, of course, would have kept the lion's share.

Seriously? 
That is the take-away?

Europe  trusted the progressive fantasy of government central planning - slow to approve - slow to purchase - slow to roll-out and quick to suspend vaccinations.

The lesson her is obvious - at least to most folks."

It never gives any publicity to the fact that the UK taxpayer funded the development of the Oxford vaccine and that Astra Zenica, alone amongst the drug companies is supplying the vaccine on a non profit basis. All the major European countries have significant stocks of vaccine, their problems are not availability but incompetence in roll out."
2021-03-20 18:39,"I’m hesitant to applaud the American government when the FDA’s ridiculous regulatory regime doubled the vaccine testing time, and prevented rapid tests from hitting the market until November. 

Myself and many other healthy individuals would have gladly participated in challenge trials throughout April and May to speed up clinical testing and avoid the deaths of thousands across the world. The potential risk to a few hundred lives via challenge trials at the beginning of the virus seems like a drop in the bucket when compared to the mass death we’ve seen in the past year."
2021-03-20 16:47,"Let’s get to the bottom of this

The fraction of the population vaccinated per time is set by supply and demand

The more vaccines are produced, the faster a population can be “jabbed”

Given that, Europe failed to do what the US and Britain did

To cite The Economist, UK,  from over a year ago

“ There are not many factories that can mass-produce vaccines, so new vaccines often wait in a long queue. Aware of this problem, the American government has built dedicated manufacturing facilities that can produce vaccines rapidly for emergencies. Britain is doing something similar."" 

                                 The Economist, February 8, 2020

That is, at its core, this is a demand and supply problem

Those who follow my posts know that I am not a Trump fan.  But in this case, he did right."
2021-03-20 19:39,"“Pricing has been important since the beginning,” Sandra Gallina, the E.U.’s main vaccine negotiator, told lawmakers in February. “We are talking about taxpayers’ money.”

Someone should have informed Ms. Gallina that dead taxpayers from a surging pandemic don't mind the extra costs of vaccines.

Prominent European heads of state derided the AstraZeneca vaccine for its 77% efficacy, planting the seed of doubt. Never mind that AZ's 77% was measured against ALL new variants of COVID-19 whereas the 95% for Moderna and Pfizer was only tested against the original virus. But try explaining that to Macron and Merkel.

After deriding AstraZeneca's vaccine, EU leadership then changed its mind but the damage was done. The US took the right approach: lockdowns aren't going to solve the problem and the economic costs of more lockdowns are exponential versus throwing a few billion toward vaccine development. Thank you, President Trump and team."
2021-03-20 16:59,"To say I utterly detest the man is an understatement; but the Trump administration’s decision to spend $10 billion and to get into bed with the drug makers seems to have has resulted in a far better vaccination rate in the US than in Europe. Yet we must not forget that as a result of his inaction to mandate the medical communities’ recommendations to mask, distance etc. the US has the numerically highest number of cases and deaths by far, and is among the countries that have highest number of cases and deaths per 1 million population. Trump’s focus was always the American economy, not the wellbeing of its citizens; his intent was never to save lives – he just got lucky that in these unprecedented circumstances it has worked out to have that result."
2021-03-20 17:27,"Yes, Washington “went into business” with the drug companies. For example, according to the Scientific American “For Billion-Dollar COVID Vaccines, Basic Government-Funded Science Laid the Groundwork. Much of the pioneering work on mRNA vaccines was done with government money, though drugmakers could walk away with big profits”

Could, and are. racking up profits, in part because prices charged to the government were orchestrated for escalation by the Trump administration, instead of requesting some consideration for taxpayer support.

So EU’s “fiscally conservative” approach might not be an error in judgment so much as an effort to avoid such “business”."

Europe is behind for a number of reasons, but huge amounts of vaccines are coming in April from their own factories. 
Summer festivals like Werchter are canceled but with the new variants avoiding such events might not be a bad thing. 
Without the European expertise in vaccines (Janssen, Pfizer, ...) and production capacity the world, including the US, would be much worse off."
2021-03-20 19:35,"I don't know about the rest of Europe but I do know that Germany went into the vaccination stage of the pandemic tying one hand behind its back. Instead of doing what Berlin wanted which was to pay more money and get enough vaccines ASAP for 90 million Germans, Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn put all their eggs in the Brussels basket and let lame Brussels do the heavy lifting as if they could. So Europe doesn't have enough vaccine right now or for the next month and infection rates are skyrocketing in Germany just like in the Czech Rep., France and Italy. Spahn will probably lose his job but that wont save the CDU, Merkel's party, from voter retaliation this year. Germany will probably get its first Green chancellor.  They already this week took a beating in two state elections. When the health of millions is at stake and when an economy needs to be kept shut down when people aren't vaccinated then going all in with Brussels was a mistake that the Germans probably wont forget in a hurry. But then the Greens shouldn't be expected to act any differently when they take power. They are even more married to Brussels than the CDU. Europe is great until it isn't. Like this month."
2021-03-20 18:17,"“Washington paid for the development and the trials; the companies had essentially nothing to lose.”

Not Pfizer.  Pfizer did it all alone, knowing their was a market if they succeeded of course, but not wanting to be a party to Trumpian political influence over sound science.  

This isn’t talked about enough, but there is room there for an investigative journalism article of its own if/when the Pfizer folks start being ready to talk."
2021-03-20 17:37,"My guess is that once the USA has taken care of its citizens with the vaccine (the citizens who will actually accept the jab), President Biden will announce a new warp speed international vax program for those nations who have little access at the moment. It could move faster than you think given the massive ramp up in doses that is underway.

Some will say that the Biden administration will do so for selfish reasons, to help eradicate the opportunity for additional variants to breed overseas and wind up here in the States. Others will say that it is just the American way, reasserting itself under a wiser and more compassionate leadership.   Probably a bit of both. In either event it will be a wonderful opportunity for the World to work together.

Our planet just got a very big lesson. Starting with lack of transparency by China (to this day), the politicizing of science in the USA, and the distrust of modern medicine throughout the world. Can we learn anything from it?

Add a strong taxpayer R&D system for med related devlopment of various vaccines and economics of scale (unlike Europe, Americans do tend to get far more vaccinations; including yearly flu) the system easily handled an extra $10 billion to ramp up (we have large plants able to make essential precursors)  to make many vaccines. In a way, warp speed was almost a given."
2021-03-20 20:23,"Besides procurement, the shortages appear to be compounded by the reservations some places have over the side effects reported as associated with the Astra Zeneca (AZ) vaccine. If that pipeline becomes reduced because people try to vaccine shop, it will take longer to get shots in arms in more than a few countries.   I wonder if until AZ has an explanation to these one off reactions if some of the drugs being trialed to treat COVID side effects could be given with the vaccine to negate the issues that some people encounter. (just a layman speculating, so just thinking out loud). If they were convenient to take, it might keep AZ's capacity in the game and add very little additional time to the vaccine appointment."

The crisis,  only 2 months into the current administration, from throwing open our southern border,  having broadcast our intentions to undo Trump's policies,  is but one example. The same is true of the Iran situation, where we have given one of the most dangerous countries in the world  a huge negotiating advantage by laying out our cards in advance.

2021-03-20 20:05,So old school liberal economic policy a mix of government and business teamwork did the trick here with the pandemic just like it met with success decades ago with our manned moon landings. This is the formula then for future Herculean efforts like a manned mission to Mars and of course back to the moon.  And most importantly the end of the scourge we know as cancer. Meanwhile Europe broke ranks with similar economic policies and went all out with Reaganomics and failed and faces catastrophe.
2021-03-20 20:25,"“It is hard to explain to our citizens why vaccines produced in the E.U. are going to other countries,” Ms. von der Leyen said.

Isn't the answer obvious? They hadn't the faintest idea how to handle this. They treated COVID vaccine development like a negotiation with a manufacturer for a generic drug. And worst of all, undermined public confidence in an effective vaccine by halting the rollout based on emotion and politics rather than science. That last action may be the most damaging of all.

Meanwhile, here in Wisconsin, I got my first Pfizer shot today at the Milwaukee County vaccine drive. The sign up was easy, the execution, assisted by FEMA, was outstanding. I got my shot within a minute of the scheduled time. And for those eligible, vaccine appointments are easy to come by. The Trump administration got this part of it right and deserve credit. As does the current one for a great rollout. One only needs to look at Europe to see what might have been. Today, it is good to be an American."
2021-03-20 20:29,"Perhaps a few details of the EU procurement process.
At first, 4 EU countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy) started negotiating with AstreZeneca, and were ready to sign in June 2020 a contract for 400million doses for them. It was then decided, to avoided unnecessary competition between EU countries, to transfer negotiation of vaccine contracts to the EU. The EU then asked each country what vaccines they wanted. Many choose the AZ vaccine because it was cheaper, easier to store and based on a traditional type of vaccine instead of the untested mRNA vaccines. Only once that was done could the EU start negotiating the different contracts. Signature of these contracts required the approval of each country."
2021-03-20 20:43,"My 90 year old mother in law, who suffers from dementia, lives in Barcelona.  She is still waiting for her first shot.  The government has refused help with distribution from it's (not insubstantial) private health care network, the military, or any group not tied directly to the social security system.   It's a very European way of dealing with things - ultimate faith in government to get things done - even when the evidence points to the contrary."
2021-03-20 20:52,"I should say that the analogy is more like this: Europe (and its ""precautionary principle"") treated this like a problem; the U.S. treated it as a war.

The difference? Problems have solutions, which cost money; war has victors and vanquished, and saving no amount of money is worth being the latter."
2021-03-20 21:01,"This is quite a verbious explanation with a lot of kitchen table psychology. But if you cut to the core, it's pretty simple:

A lesser rate of vaccinations in the US (and the UK) would have meant a higher rate in the EU. The article itself admits to the zero-sum-character of the ""accquisiton"" of early production batches, as well as the aggressive strategy of the Anglos to snap up almost all of the jabs for themselves, despite the fact that both the J&J and the Pfizer vaccines were developed in Europe. So, where the EU actually went wrong', was by not acting in quite the same self-serving way like you. 

That could have been 'explained' in a much shorter article."
2021-03-20 17:06,"The article begins: “While Washington went into business with the drug companies, Europe ... trusted the free market.”

I guess the idea is that the EU didn’t “go into business” with the drug companies. The details of the Trump engagement with the drug companies still are somewhat opaque. But it is clear that taxpayers paid twice for their vaccines: paid to help develop them, and paid again escalated prices to get the resulting vaccines.

Yes, the EU was more “fiscally conservative” in not abetting such “business”."
2021-03-20 20:44,"California also tried to roll out the vaccine 'perfectly' including threatening providers who gave vaccines 'out of order' and found it created too many delays. When we simplified the plan we were able to scale up vaccinations. The biggest risk is not giving vaccine doses. 

Given the current risks from Covid VIRUS in Europe vs. the risk from vaccines, the right population strategy is to give lots of vaccines.
Given the degree of FUD re the AZ vaccine, the best European  tactic would be to open up vaccination with it, and go for the important goal: stop pandemic spread!
DON'T hold second doses for a month to perfectly immunize a few. Instead go for good immunity in many.
There will be more vaccine in a few months.

I deliberately delayed my second dose so it would be used as a first dose for someone else.

In an emergency situation, ""Good enough, NOW"" beats ""Almost perfect, in a few weeks or months.""

The European (and to a lesser extent the US) regulators, in an effort to have perfectly safe vaccines, lost sight of the HUGE risk of dying of Covid, which swamps the teeny risk of vaccines.

The US could also win diplomatic points by releasing the stocks of AZ vaccine for use in Europe while we await approval here."
2021-03-20 20:43,"From an European perspective the current pandemic is no less than some of the wars that Europe has experienced in the past. During the world war two the transatlantic collaboration was the lifeline for Europe to avoid a total collapse of its civilization the way we know it. Currently Europe is facing a similar challenge in facing the Covid-19. But unlike in the past the transatlantic bondage appears to be much weaker. It would be understandable had Trump been in the helm at Washington. But with Biden being president Europeans had a different expectation, that America First would go away sooner than later. Particularly after Biden had promised that America was back.

This, however, did not happen. At least when it comes to vaccines. This certainly is a lost opportunity. The USA has a huge reserve of unused vaccine. It would indeed be a brilliant gesture of goodwill to share a fraction of that reserve with allies of the free world at the other side of the Ocean. It certainly would create a bond of enduring trust between the two. 

Biden, of course, still has that opportunity to do this. What he needs is a long vision of partnership and the leadership skill to persuade the American people that such an action is mutually beneficial. President Biden surely has both these abilities. Europe is waiting! To paraphrase ABBA ""take a chance"" Mr President!"

The UK put more money into the Covid vaccine research (US made the largest) than the entire EU. The EU commissioner at the time congratulated the UK on its generous contribution. The UK then spread its chances by advanced purchase of several vaccines (like the US).
The fallout and the politics from then on is just horrible."
2021-03-20 20:24,"The companies that are paying more per dose are receiving superior access to the vaccines... exactly the outcome you would expect from a free market.  The E.U. tried to pinch pennies and set itself behind.  This is not merely bad politics but bad economics: penny-wise and pound-foolish.  To say nothing of lives lost, the purely financial cost of slower reopenings will be vastly greater than any investment in vaccines."
2021-03-20 20:46,"The USA suppressed the spread of Ebola and saved the lives of an unknown number of people, by leading the effort to address it. Unfortunately, the America First policy of Trump and the long time isolationist sentiments of many Americans allowed this pandemic to proceed without much international efforts to suppress it, each country must address it mostly alone. The result has been that a far less lethal disease has killed and will kill millions. Ebola, a far more deadly disease killed relatively few.

The anti-vaccine attitude arises from a arrogant attitude of people who reject rational explanations that annoy in favor of imaginary explanations which satisfy emotionally. Such foolishness is hard to affect. The Pasteur invented microbiology and methods to address diseases caused by microbes, but French people seem to be far less accepting of such methods than Americans. It seems to carry over to vaccinations."
2021-03-20 20:17,"Just for information - I only know how we do it in Denmark. But here we have been cheated out of deliveries from the vaccine producers. Every week they told you get this and that amount, and then we got 1/3 or something.  EU have complained on our behalf as other counties have experienced the same. 
We have set up the infrastructure to vaccinate 10 times more than we have got vaccines delivered. 
So, don’t blame the public health systems or that we try to work together, blame producers. They should have e said here, patent is yours to use so we can produce 10 times more than we our self can handle... we would have compensated, but Ofc not in the absurd amount of money they now can make, from a global catastrophe."

There is a saying about unions - (u)you - (n)ever- (i)ndependently - (o)rganize - (n)egotiations - (s)illy!
Each of the European countries standing by themselves most likely would have had a better chance with more favorable outcomes handling the pandemic. But the elites had other ideas with the EU leaders/European Economic Forum leading the charge for taking advantage of this horrible pandemic with their ""Great Reset"". They should have taken care of their peoples instead of their ideology. 
By the way this article gave capitalism a thumbs up - how crazy is that!
From the great country of Texas we will pray for all ya'll in Europe. Texas knows first hand how important Europe was in the development of our infancy as a country and then a state of the great US.

We had some very good experts on this, like Christian Drosten, who is a researcher at the charity in berlin, but he has no department to act on a pandemic like Anthony Fauci has.
So a lot of political actors jumped into this gap, and many of them have failed big, some of them even have been indicted for corruption. As far as my count is up to date, four members of Merkel's party already had to step down for unjust enrichment.
Kudos to the americans, they simply had the guns ready when the villain had shown up. And with the consistent leadership the loss of lives would have been fraction of that, what is now. Because up to date it still 894.98 death per million in germany and nearly twice as much, 1,637.37 in the US."

Let US not rest on our laurels, there are several challenges still remaining.
1) Over 29.5 million warriors in the US, survived COVID infection out of the over 30 million that were confirmed positive. While chances of reinfection with the original strain that originated from Wuhan, China or the emerging new variants are very rare without receiving any of the 3 vaccines that are being made available, longterm effects are troubling to millions post COVID. Wayne Kent Taylor (WKT),  the founder and CEO of Texas Roadhouse took his own life. The 65-year-old was suffering from the after effects of COVID-19, according to a statement from the family. According to Peter Romeo who published this sad story in Restaurant Business, the statement indicated that WKT was suffering from a severe case of tinnitus, commonly known as a ringing in one’s ears, as a result of his bout with COVID. Symptoms post COVID can be loss of taste, smell, fatigue, clots, vascular dysfunction, neurological and mental health issues.

2) In the USA, children have not received any vaccines against COVID and the trials are just beginning and possibly later in the year there could be FDA approval forthcoming. In the meantime the possibility that COVID will be booted out will be remote."
2021-03-20 21:02,"AZ so far delivered less that 30% of what it committed to supply. Ineptitude among EU officers probably, but I hope there will be consequences for this company.

Meanwhile Europe is exporting vaccines to Canada and Mexico. And the US? And the country of their Queen?"
2021-03-20 17:46,"The headline gets it half right: Europe tried to be cheap, while the US didn't worry about cost. 

It glosses over the other piece though: European governments’ general suspicion of big business meant that they treated the negotiations as adversarial. Lots of concern about liability, profiteering, and all the other things that lawyers worry about, and not enough about the practical risk that people would continue dying while they waited for a vaccine.

That adversarial mindset, predictably, yielded a thicket of red tape, political ""stakeholders"" contributing nothing but complaints, and made lots of bureaucrats feel powerful and important. Meanwhile, the US put a scientist (Slaoui) in charge and gave him the authority to make decisions without asking politicians for permission. He treated the drug companies as partners, let the government assume much of the financial risk, and focused on the prize of working vaccines.

Did drug company investors pocket more public money in the US vs Europe? Sure! Does it matter? No - they were providing a valuable product that our country needed.

NYT, quit patronizing your readers with this simplistic ""free market"" and ""fiscally conservative"" sloganeering. That's certainly a piece of the puzzle, but it's not the big picture. The real story here doesn't fit nearly into a Team Blue vs. Team Red narrative."
2021-03-20 19:22,"Europe's problem has been bureaucracy and public relations, as noted.  I suspect some EU member states are re-evaluating membership perks.   In America,  Moderna’s mRNA-1273, which reported a 94.5 percent efficacy rate on November 16, 2020 had been designed by January 13, 2020.

As described in the article, Operation Warp Speed's partnership with Pharma delivered the necessary volume of vaccine to America.  

The doubt that was cast on the vaccine during the Trump administration by democrats probably set us back by months.  Not Good. When Harris was asked in early September if she’d get the vaccine, she said: “I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump, and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he’s talking about.”   The democrat's push against a 'Trump' vaccine fueled distrust that still continues."
2021-03-20 18:04,"Difficult to imagine an analysis that misses the target so badly. Merkel and Macron made an ideological decision to put the EU in charge of procurement although it has no relevant skills. The EU demonstrated numerous failings, including utter sloth,  but faith in the free market was hardly among them.  They were simply incompetent and arrogant from the word go, negotiating terrible contracts and then undermining public confidence in a way that was utterly political and designed to undermine the British.  In France, the vaccination effort is kneecapped by unimaginable bureaucracy.  This is a complicated story but your rendering of it fails to convince this reader who has watched this fiasco unroll."
2021-03-20 21:21,"The EU may be slower than some and faster than others. My attention, however is focused on that we are on the brink of being done with the phase of the pandemic that requires severe restrictions on our daily behavior and the economy. 

At least in our part of the world the main reason for lockdowns, travel restrictions, mall closures, etc. has been the need to ensure that the health care system is not overwhelmed by the covid patients. 

Now that the old people have been vaccinated for the most part, apocalypse no longer follows if the epidemic spins out of control. The younger age groups end up in hospitals and grave yards so infrequently, that we can handle it - if it turns out to be necessary. 

In other words, when I look at the current situation, I do not see the need to find those who are guilty of not running things perfectly and punishing them. Instead I am happy that we made it! The big picture is wonderfully positive (at least for the rich states in the US and Europe and elsewhere where mass vaccination programs are already running.)"
2021-03-20 20:41,The EU tries to negotiate everything.  Serves them right.  I see it with Aerospace business.  They object to an America first.   Talk about a hypocritical and parochial group.  Don't ever look for Europeans to come to the rescue!
2021-03-20 19:39,living in Germany as a foreigner I can say the EU is very risk averse and that Germany is clearly calling the shots here (see AZ) and therefore responsible for this embarassing and revealing outcome. The leadership has failed us.

Sadly, Brussels is now capital to neo-liberal orthodoxy run amok.
They could have done what Biden-- and Trump with Operation Warp Speed-- have done with the Defense Production Act and ordered the pharmaceutical and other related industries to produce, distribute, and administer vaccines at lightening speed.  And last year when this nightmare began they didn't do anything for months to manufacture masks despite the fact that they're the worlds' leaders in the textile industry.  But God forbid that government get in the way of business.  The Invisible Hand that neo-liberals like Macron and his allies worship is powerless against a virus, but everyone's happy over there as long as the French can buy German cars and the Germans can get all the cheese and sausage they want from French farmers.

And forgive me for correcting this article, but we have now achieved 50 percent of the adult population receiving their first “jab.” 

I got mine this week.  And we did it by priority. I was group 5, 65-70.  I got a letter in the mail, I went online, and I booked an appointment within a few minutes last week to get the “jab” this Tuesday.

And I voted Remain with Brexit, but clearly on this point the UK being independent may have helped.

However, we must not forget, that we still have one of the highest deaths per capita and this must be investigated.  Although I will give our “floppy haired clown prince”, sorry - Prime Minister, some credit.

I was also hugely impresssed that I walked into a very organised  vaccination centre, our local theatre that’s been dark for the last year, and was getting a cab home 15 mins later...

God bless our NHS, for the last 53 years, you guys should consider totally free health care for everyone, or is it a slippery slope to communism?

And a final thought; As a Brit I really don’t understand how  republican voters always seem to vote against their better interests, perhaps someone could explain this."
2021-03-20 16:37,"“I think we relied a little bit too much on the free markets,” [a Belgian official] said. “What you really need to do from the beginning is really make sure you produce the vaccines on your territory and that they’re destined for your own population.”

This is a very unfortunate lesson to take from this, but it may be inevitable.  It’s especially unfortunate that at the time this hit the US was led by a short-sighted nationalist bigot who greatly damaged international cooperation that may prove essential when the next pandemic hits.  Viruses don’t respect national boundaries, and it is impractical for 180  nations to produce vaccines on their own territory.  We need to learn from this on how to not just have a “gunfight” as one official described it, but a rational global response to a global threat."

2021-03-20 21:20,"It is possible that 100,000 or more preventable deaths will occur because of the poor EU policy and attitude towards vaccine development.  In addition to the hundreds of billions lost to slower opening of the economy in the EU.

The EU was so focused on price as opposed to results seemingly not understanding the importance of government investment in vaccine development and/or commitments to purchasing finished product.

A great deal of credit for the US effort goes to Dr. Moncef Slaoui mentioned in this article, but mentioning his expertise as a former 
GlaxoSmithKline Plc executive who was chief advisor to Operation Warp Speed and a familiarity with mRNA technology as a Moderna board member.

The EU effort lacked this kind of leadership and the US is very fortunate to have him guiding our efforts.  

Also not mentioned is Israeli PM Netanyahu's successful efforts to get the population older than 15 vaccinated.  Israel spends a much higher proportion of GDP than other countries for defense, but Netanyahu still allocated funds paying 50% higher than the US per Pfizer dose *and* Israel served as a Pfizer results laboratory.

Countries such as Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Australia all outside the EU could have afforded to spend the same as Israel but they chose not to invest in their population."

On the contrary, they block, since 1.1.2021, more than 100 medicines and critical ingredients, which were used for and benefit hugely critically ill CV-patients (<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medicines-that-cannot-be-parallel-exported-from-the-uk"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medicines-that-cannot-be-parallel-exported-from-the-uk</a>). This will cause many deaths, probably more than the sorry delay in the EU will cause. Nobody seems to know about this. Boris Johnson simply lies when he says to be against export blocking. The EU should - and will - learn from all this. For one thing, that they - we - need more unity, not less. We are powerless as individual countries, against states, as the US, UK, China, which say they are for 'free markets', but act in the opposite. That is precisely why Trump, Putin, Jinping and the like, are striving to undo the EU. In the meantime, we should keep exporting vaccines doses, certainly to poor countries, but not to rich ones. Contrary to what this article tries to provoke, this is not a sprint, but a marathon. Saying that 'Nobody is safe, if not everybody is safe' is probably a bit of an exaggeration, but it should - definitely - be our guiding principle. Of all democratic countries, please. Claro!"

2021-03-20 21:37,"This is the best article so far in the US media but it is still flawed. Read between the lines, the vaccine procurement to date is a zero sum game. So if Europe was faster it would be at the expense of other nations. What did Canada do wrong other than be neighbors with the USA? 2/3 of the approved vaccines in USA are European. The USA is using export bans to prohibit cooperation in vaccinating the most at risk globally. This is morally indefensible."

Only one export request was not granted. The main export destinations include the United Kingdom (with approximately 9.1 million doses), Canada (3.9 million), Mexico (3.1 million), Japan (2.7 million), Saudi Arabia (1.4 million), Hong Kong (1.3 million), Singapore (1 million), United States (1 million), Chile (0.9 million) and Malaysia (0.8 million)."
2021-03-20 17:38,"I'm not going to lie, I feel pretty grateful to be in the US at the moment. All of my friends in Europe (and even Canada) were making fun of America all throughout 2020, pitying us while partying and traveling maskless all summer and essentially declaring the pandemic over. Granted, they had things far more under control than us in the beginning and didn't have to deal with a science-denying man-child leading their nations.

Now, the tables have turned, and we've got one of the best rates of vaccinations in the world considering our country's size and things are economy is beginning to pick up as life reopens. When Biden promised 100M doses by now a few months ago, I cringed thinking it was unrealistic and thought it was unattainable. I feared he was setting himself up for failure. I'm honestly impressed how much progress has been made. I would estimate 50% of my friends--all 20s and 30s--have at least had one dose. Just imagine if Trump was in charge still...good God.

Ironically, now my friends in Europe are envious, restless, and annoyed that the EU has really dropped the ball on the vaccine rollout. 

I don't write this to sound as though I'm bragging or like we're in a competition--I write this because it just goes to show that this virus has humbled us all...just when we think we have it down, have the answers, or the better government, we're proven otherwise time and time again."
2021-03-20 21:36,"The economical engine of Europe failed to create jobs during the past decades, the cost cutting policy proved criminal during the Covid19 crisis, its' like saving lives was a waste of money !!!

And this is where it hurt most Europe, what kind of mentality animates some prominant leaders ? the market before everything ?

With the yellow vests demonstration in the street, french population fought hard such principle and was awarded with extrem violence from the government, as if human life doesn't matter.

The worst enemy of Europe is clearly its own economical system unable to work, it never worked and will never work, only disasters following disaster.

Europe has to learn that spending is much better and healthy than saving or cutting cost, otherwise this patchwork of countries will no longer exist. This is all about the BCE, banks and politicians."
2021-03-20 21:39,"Three words 

""Operation Warp Speed.""

'Nuff said."
2021-03-20 16:44,"There is an interesting comparison to be made.  In 2020, we had no central leadership.  As a consequence, this nation, the wealthiest and most advanced scientifically, was leading in Covid's mortality and morbidity rates, every state ""doing its own thing,"" and too many heeding politics rather than good medicine.  Enter President Biden, and we have what we always should have had: a hub in Washington DC, specifically the Oval Office, where a POTUS at the helm of our Ship is navigating us into calm waters once again.  The European Union needs to be just that, a union of common purpose during times of crises like this Pandemic."
2021-03-20 21:29,Thank you Trump.
2021-03-20 17:06,"I am an American based in Germany and am heartbroken at the ineptitude of the vaccine rollout here, which has been governed by an unthinking reliance on elaborate rules and a paranoid fear of vaccinating one person too soon.   In Berlin, some vaccination centers were letting up to 90% of their appointments go unused, and the local politicians were crowing when they managed to get that down to a mere 60% unused. As it is, vaccination centers are scarcely open, compared to Israel, the US and the UK,  where some centers are open 24s hours a day.   Here in Berlin, the maximum is 10 hours a day, and one facility is only open for 5 hours a day.

The policy decisions here have lead to a shocking waste of life, money and hope--and there is no end in sight. I have no confidence that this country can manage a mass vaccination program, even after there is ""enough"" vaccine.   It would require a major mea culpa from Angela Merkel's party, in an election year, and some kind of massive reboot."
2021-03-20 21:38,"You can thank President Trump for the quick rollout of the vaccines whether or not you like the man. Money was no object and he put America‘s health and financial well-being first. His critics said it would take years to devise a vaccine but they were wrong. It took just months to get it developed and within no time the vaccine was being put into peoples arms. 

President Trump should get much credit for the quick rollout that has occurred in America. Of course, it will not be forthcoming and the only thing that they will say was that he was not responsible for the great success in the vaccines. And it should have been sooner they will add.￼

Those who like Trump know full well that we would not be in this positive place if he hadn’t worked diligently to get drug makers to develop a vaccine. Many lives have been saved because of President Trump’s due diligence. For that we should all￼￼￼￼ be thankful to President Trump for his quick response.￼"
2021-03-20 21:58,I’ll give Trump credit for Operation Warp Speed and I’ll give Democrats and Republicans in Congress credit for funding it generously to get the US as many vaccine doses as quickly as possible.  The national vaccine rollout could have gone a lot smoother and was seen as disappointingly disorganized.  Trump’s haphazard COVID policy and all-over-the-place messaging cost him the election.
2021-03-20 22:14,"I will support the „european way“ one million times. It takes longer, but it works. The development of 3/4 of the vaccines was financed by EU money. I love the EU and what we have achieved."
2021-03-20 22:28,"This only underlines the lesson in matters of public health, regardless of political systems: government must step in, coordinating the entire response from prevention to funding vaccine development, clinical trials, and distribution.  There remains sufficient flexibility as to whether the researchers and vaccine providers work for private or public institutions.

I don’t usually like war analogies, but in the face of a pandemic, it is quite appropriate and requires single-minded collective focus.

(Now if only Trump would clearly encourage his supporters to take the vaccine whose development he touted...)"
2021-03-20 22:47,"It is certainly true that vaccination program is slower in EU than US or UK, but the author of this article did not take into an account many parameters. First of all US is paying way more for one dose than EU does. Second, EU made contracts with vaccines suppliers which is not honoured by them as they are selling to highest bidders and claiming production sites difficulties for vaccines shortages. It is like with every crisis, richer will be richer. That is why EU is so grwat about it , because everyone is it treated equally."
2021-03-20 23:15,"The US and UK have made sure that all vaccines made in their own country go to their own people first.
The result is that these companies only export those manufactured in Europe to third countries. and that's about 50% of the production.
So it was a big mistake to work with US and UK companies.
I hope Europe will lose its naivete.
Britain was less naive.
Oxford originally wanted to work with Merck. However, the UK government realized that if they did not choose a domestic company, they would be victims of America-first."
2021-03-20 23:24,"Having lived in Paris for two years, including the first 8 months of the pandemic, it doesn't surprise me that France has botched the vaccine. France (Macron) was great at shutting down rapidly to slow the spread, but the same rule-following culture that allowed an effective lockdown has been disastrous when it comes to vaccines & containment.

French life is governed by strict rules handed down from above. This extends to holidays, which is why trains were packed immediately before & after the first lockdown. The French travel & vacation at the same time, all together, at the exact moment when vacationing is sanctioned by the government. This means the crowds move together.

Schools have no choice in whether or not to open, or how. They must follow orders from on high. This meant that in June, all French children were required to return to school, so that Paris became packed again, everyone returning on trains from their earlier exodus. In a country where it's difficult to to do basic civil functions-like opening a bank account or paying the cable bill-online, it's unsurprising that there is no simple way to make vaccine appointments. 

While the US offers room for personal decision-a nanny or schoolteacher qualifies as childcare, a farmer or McDonald's worker qualifies as food/agriculture-in France everything requires multiple forms, approvals, & paperwork, very little of which can be done online.

The US is not exactly limber, but its flexibility & speed is a saving grace."
2021-03-20 22:27,"The most disastrous mistake was not buying enough of the vaccine developed in Germany - BioNTech. Only people over 80 receive that. I got AstraZeneca which isn’t nearly as effective against the mutations now prevalent throughout Europe. 

Miss von der Leyen was arguably the worst Secretary of Defense Germany ever had. To reward that, she was promoted out of Germany and heads the EU now. Brussels often is such a dumping ground. A sclerotic bureaucratic monstrosity, slow to react, and stingy at the worst possible moment. 

Germany is rudderless. Constant lockdown changes, horribly slow vaccinations, gas and electricity prices sky high - Merkel cannot be gone soon enough."
2021-03-20 16:26,"“We are talking about taxpayers’ money.” They penny pinched on cost of the vaccine and tried to pile on the regulations and legal liabilities. So they saved a few Billion up front and ultimately will pay many Multiples of that in income lost by its citizens. You can add the extra 10,000 plus deaths a week for a month plus due to delays in vaccinations if that counts for anything. This should be a wake up call but my money in on nothing will change in a meaningful time period."
2021-03-20 16:45,"Of course,  I don't know what the financial negotiations were all about and, therefore, I can't tell  if EU was right or wrong in resisting  Pharma's demands.   The US and UK decided to give pharmaceuticals what they wanted.  Johnson, who had botched the management of the virus, in an attempt to salvage his reputation, paid whatever was requested. 
The EU does not have our tolerance toward drug producers and sought to deal with them according to their custom, negotiate the price.  However, in this case,  they did not have the advantage of waiting out the opposition and found themselves falling back.   The event  illustrated how governments become the pawns of huge corporations in time of crisis."
2021-03-20 22:00,"Is it possible that as deplorable as Trump was, he can be given some credit for the decisions made to put the US in a more superior position than our more sophisticated European brethren?"
2021-03-20 23:25,"A few points that were missed. Firstly, the EU did negotiate with AZ on price and liability: but one of those efforts was completely pointless, as AZ are selling the vaccine at cost.
When AZ couldn't meet their ""best efforts"" schedule for the EU, the EU promptly had a melt-down. They had never considered that signing 3 months later meant plants were set up 3 months later, and they had teething problems (just as the earlier UK ones did). The EU then, instead of having a quiet chat with the UK government to look for a solution, politicized everything. They trashed AZ, the UK, suspended the NI protocol (briefly), and stated the vaccine was ineffective: well before the ""blood clots"" issue.
The EU now is still casting threats around everywhere, and lying like Trump's administration. They are threatening the UK and AZ, whilst simultaneously sitting on millions of doses of AZ vaccine that no-one wants because the EU stated it didn't work or killed you. They claim that the UK has an export ban, which it doesn't: we leave it to the manufacturers to fulfil their contracts, wherever the world they may be.
The EU are in a hole, behaving badly, and do what they always do in this situation: fire up the PR machine, and cast Trump-level lies everywhere. They failed, badly, in their acquisition of vaccines; yet the greatest irony is if they had just asked the UK for help, honestly, then it would have been given."
2021-03-20 23:02,"A large part of the problem is the bungled leadership of von der Leyen a failed politician in Germany who has unsurprisingly mismanaged the Vaccine effort for the EU. 

Any repercussions ? of course not."
2021-03-20 22:26,"A broke clock is right twice a day

2021-03-20 16:47,"This is a case that highlights the difference between the European model of cost conscious universal health care and the rampant money machine of the US health care system. 

The US system of privatization of public research really catches fire when opportunity arises. The development of the Hep C treatment Solvaldi was financed almost exclusively through public money. but the treatment cost about $84,000 per patient,  reaping billions for Gilead, who enjoyed a temporary monopoly for a potential market of 3.5 million infected with Hep C. 

The US system is like an oversized pickup truck compared to a European battery powered micro coupe. They both get you to the grocery store, but at much different costs."
2021-03-20 22:55,"'Mussolini made the trains run on time.'  and strongman Trump delivered the vaccines on time.  And government picking up the costs of testing, treatment, and vaccination is Socialism.   Seems to be working so far."
2021-03-20 23:34,"The EU should get on with vaccinating it's population, rather than blaming all and sundry for the mess it got itself into.  This is a time for humility-we must all be grateful for having access to ANY vaccine-and Europe's leaders need to stop playing politics with people's lives."
2021-03-21 0:12,"I’m surprised to note that this article on the ineffective rollout of the COVID vaccine by the EU compared to the US fails to note the gold standard as the target for both groups: Israel’s #1 place in the world—under PM Netanyahu’s leadership—in obtaining and distributing COVID vaccine to its population—Jewish and Arab—over age 15.

The high percentage of Israelis covered by medical insurance, the sophisticated computerization and of its HMOs and the integrated data sharing among them were major factors in the success of the vaccine distribution and enabled Pfizer to quickly obtain valuable data on vaccine distribution and results.

Following the Israeli COVID model in close coordination would be one of the many benefits for strengthening the EU’s relationship with Israel, who is now partnering with the Arab world against their common dangerous enemy, Iran."
2021-03-20 23:58,So at last we find that the Trump administration did something right.
2021-03-21 0:04,The jury is still out. I feel it's a early for the NY Times to declare the US and Britain the winners in the distribution of vaccines. Let's see where things stand a number of months from now.
2021-03-20 23:52,"Oh, the irony! ""Europe excels in health care,"" we hear. ""The US response was a chaos,"" they bemoaned. Well, looks like reality disagrees."
2021-03-21 0:21,It's not really that bad.  The mistake was not recognizing that you don't dither in a pandemic.
2021-03-20 23:55,"Consider 3 strategies for vaccine supply.
  1. Manufacture some; import none; export half.
  2. Manufacture some; import none; export none.
  3. Manufacture some; import as much; export none.
The EU has followed strategy 1; USA strategy 2; UK strategy 3.
If EU had followed strategy 2 instead, it would be nearly as vaccinated as the USA.  And if UK had followed strategy 2 instead it would be no more vaccinated than the USA.  The main explanation for the vaccination disparities between EU, USA, and UK, which the article dances around, lies in these strategic differences.  
As a European I appreciate strategy 1, and invite all the players to play that way.  Again their vaccination disparities would be small and the unproductive parts of the world would be thankful.
Strategy 3 is not one that can be played by many players, and has a bad smell."
2021-03-21 1:03,"While this was an informative read, I think it overcomplicates things.  The EU was primarily hurt by two things:

a) a distrust of corporations
b) a faith in developing a united response

Well, ""a)"" indicates an ignorance of what makes the American economy outperform the EU economy over the long run, and ""b)"" handicapped the entire continent, whereas if each country had gone off on its own, the countries with worse problems may have been willing to pay more and get things under control, maybe even getting started before the US.  

In short, faith in bureaucracy over competition is what did them in."
2021-03-21 0:49,Surprised didn’t give Biden credit!  EU believes in the precautionary principle which proved to be disastrous
2021-03-21 0:35,"I got my COVID vaccine.  

I must admit I felt an appreciation for the work of Trump and his administration for accomplishing the development and delivery of life saving vaccines in record time.  When I learned how Operation Warp Speed was established and funded by the reapportionment of 20 billion dollars I was doubly grateful."
2021-03-21 2:23,"Why COVID herd immunity is probably impossible. Even with vaccination efforts in full force, the theoretical threshold for vanquishing COVID-19 looks to be out of reach. Ending transmission of the virus is one way to return to normal. But another could be preventing severe disease and death. Given what is known about COVID-19 so far, reaching herd immunity through vaccines alone is going to be rather unlikely. It’s time for more realistic expectations. The vaccine is unlikely to completely halt the spread, so we need to think of how we can live with the virus, Even without herd immunity, the ability to vaccinate vulnerable people seems to be reducing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. The disease might not disappear any time soon, but its prominence is likely to wane."
2021-03-21 1:14,"This article is somewhat misleading. Pfizer did not accept US government funding to develop or manufacture the vaccine, unlike Moderna and AstraZeneca. Since the Pfizer vaccine is produced in the US it can't be exported due to America's ""me first"" policies. Canada, with no covid manufacturing plants, contracted with Pfizer Europe for their vaccine supply."

2021-03-21 2:52,"We were a little slow in starting vaccinations in HK, but we are catching up - currently vaccinating the age range 30-60, which may actually mean that we are moving ahead of the UK, and similar to the US. And of course, our cases have always been an order of magnitude less than the U.K. and US, so this is less critical."
2021-03-21 3:26,"The first efficient and certified vaccines came out of the US administration wilful massive spending on biotechnology, some more advanced than any invented before. History will recognize that the US administration, once again, demonstrated that, when the situation gets dire, as in World War Two, it can muster the entire economy of the USA, by switching to command and control. In other words, the US is for ""free market capitalism""... Until it is clearly inappropriate. Paradoxically, the Europeans have long embraced ""free market capitalism"" as the end all, be all... So the notion that Europe is always more ""socialist"" than the US needs to be revisited."
2021-03-21 3:44,"It is important for political leaders to treat the challenges flexibly at the emergency of this pandemic. Because even specialists of infectious diseases have not understood the nature of the corona virus satisfactory. 
But concerning the policy of vaccine, I’m not sure the ways of the US and the UK have been better for the world. They have bought up a lot of vaccine only for their nations. Quite a few people all over the world cannot be vaccinated at all. From the global point of view, I cannot praise the vaccine policies of these two countries."
2021-03-21 5:08,Europe emphasized early lockdown while the US invested its resources in vaccine development.  They are strategies that differed in effectiveness depending on the various stages of the pandemic.  Just which strategy is more effective wouldn't be known until the pandemic is over and total death/economic loss tallied.
2021-03-21 6:22,"Many thanks for an interesting angle on a complex problem. [By the way, the contrast with your Feb 11 article - A doctor was fired after giving out Covid-19 vaccine doses that were about to expire - helps re-contextualize.]
Living in Switzerland, a mini collection of 26 independent states, the issues you point out all hold, and despite being a very rich country, the vaccination effort is embarrassingly delayed.
One thing I do think this crisis emphasizes, though, is our blatant inability, as a world, to enable our international institutions. When some ""third"" world country has a health concern, we refer to and support the WHO; but me-first is the name of the game when the stakes touch our country, ""...to the consternation of countries that will wait years for full coverage."" (para. 13) Even Ms. von der Leyen apparently has a hard time explaining to citizens that they are part of a global problem that should, by any reasoned argument, be tackled globally.
We wish to be global while we are unable to think globally. No need for an expensive study to be sure of this: think climate change, or nuclear armaments. It's staring us in the face... but we just interest ourselves with the details of our misguided approach."
2021-03-21 6:30,"I am an expat living in a small county in central Germany with a population of 135K. Up until now there has been only one vaccination location which has been handling 30 residents a day, do the arithmetic to reach everyone! Since the onset it has been a back and forth political and logistic circus, one day they state this the next day that etc. especially with the Astra Zeneca which has become a question of mass hysteria and some believe it now to be a death drug.
There is now hope that starting in mid April where doctors, dentists and pharmacists can do the deed, but still unresolved is the availability of the various vaccines.
We have been under a partial/full lockdown for over a year now and to add to the insanity hotels here in Germany are closed but I can board a plane to Spanish Islands with no restrictions, go figure?"
2021-03-21 6:35,"So grateful to Operation Warp Speed and yes, the Trump administration, for placing the health of those living in the US above upfront costs.  Not only are American citizens receiving vaccines, but all who live and work here. I’m proud of what was accomplished and also how the Biden administration has handled the continued rollout."
2021-03-21 7:48,"The Astrazeneca vaccine was in fact developed in the Oxford University. At the beginning, the university wanted to give the rights to the vaccine away for free, so that anybody could start produce it.
It is the UK government, out of fear of not getting access to this vaccine if produced only by US companies, that pushed for the university to transfer its rights to AstraZeneca, on the condition it be provided at cost.
AZ however has very little experience producing vaccines. So AZ relies on a series of subcontractors (Catalent, Novasep, Halix, Serum Institute of India...) to do the production itself. This means AZ's production line is not as robust as those of Pfizer for example, and increases the risks of mishaps and delays.
Also, because AZ has to sell the vaccine at cost, it has very little incentive to invest in production capacity or to intervene or help its subcontractors in case of delivery problems, as is the case in the EU.
This is another breach by AZ of its contract with the EU. The EU paid €300millions upfront for AZ to expand capacity in order to deliver and have doses at hand in January to start vaccinating people. AZ essentially took the money but did by far not enough to ensure adequate supply for the EU. And now that it is massively under-delivering the EU, it is clearly not interested in solving the issues."
2021-03-21 8:19,"An appeal to change and global justice

 I would like to underline the excerpt, in which the authors point out the philosophical dimension of the problem. 

It was articulated very clear in this article, that the American, British, and Israelian strategy of vaccination resulted superior to the European. This has given those countries a big bonus to recover from the economical and social consequences of the current crisis.
Although it can be regarded as admirable and worth applauding action, we have to remain conscious about those other countries that do not possess the economic resources to guarantee their population a vaccine. 

The corona crisis is making the rift between Rich and Poor bigger and more noticeable. Countries with a poor health care system, financial problems, and extreme poverty have once again drawn the short straw. 

Having said this, it appears inexplicable to me how such an urgent and crucial good as the vaccine, is being handled in the market. 
I support the slightly utopian position, that access to such goods, should be guaranteed outside of the mechanism of a free market. 
I think the pandemic has challenged us in many ways as a society in rethinking much of our prevailing structures.

It has come to a time to start pursuing other alternatives to assure the just and moral allocation of limited goods shifting the focus away from profit and wealth to basic human rights."
2021-03-21 8:30,"""The United States and Britain have been more flexible, erring on the side of giving more first injections.""

This is not true for the US. The FDA has resisted calls from leading epidemiologists like Osterholm and Jha to space out the vaccinations, calling it ""following the science.""

However, the latest science shows that there are probably no downsides to delaying the second dose to allow more first doses. In fact, for the Asta Zeneca vaccine (not yet authorized in the US), the evidence suggests this might even increase efficacy.

Having just gotten my appointment in Berlin für the Modena vaccine, I can say that the system here is quite efficient. After getting my authorization automatically in the mail, it took me only ten minutes to shop online for the shortest waiting period and preferred vaccine appointment on the official site."
2021-03-21 8:51,"Check out the rates in Central Europe.  Hungary is #5 in the EU/UK for COVID deaths per 100,000 people.  The fatality rate is 3.27% and rising.  The schools were fully open until last week despite surges.  Vaccination plan is absolute chaos and essential shop workers, transit workers, teachers are not even on a priority list for vaccines.   For some reason when they talk about the disaster in the EU they tend to focus on France or Belgium but I can tell you that things are extremely bad in Eastern and Central Europe.  They do not have enough medical staff to run ventilators and they have students working in intensive care. The media here likes to pretend that everyone is fine but that's just because they have been ordered to do so or they will be shut down like most other independent media here already has.  The EU should have been more prepared for vaccination...they had months to sort this out."
2021-03-21 9:53,"Well this is only part of the story. The EU got the identical contract with Astra-Zeneca as the UK and the EU paif exactly the same price for Biontech as the US. So it cannot be ""money"" or ""negotiating"", neither can it be that the EU signed the contract later. The EU invested more than 30 billion Euros into the development vaccines like the one of Biontech. Germany paid another hundred millions of Euro. Whether waiting for deeper checkups makes sense or not can only be said from the hindsight. 
But there is another ""big"" difference. The EU - contrary to the US and UK are exporting millions of vaccines to other countries, because the EU on a general level regarded the pandemic as a global and not as a national level. The EU didn't hinder exporting preliminary stages in the prodcution line to the US and UK and thought that those two would then export some of the finished products. A German producer is a global leader for producing the necessary glass vials. There are no export restrictions. The US is hoarding millions of Astra Zeneca doses and is not willing to export a single one, although they are not using at for the time being. 
So the difference is that on a general level the EU relied on international cooperation in fighting the pandemic - which definitely makes the most sense, whereas the US and the UK go the ""nationalistic"" way. Biontech was developed in Germany and was heavily subsidized by the German government and the EU. How would the US react in such a situation?"
2021-03-21 10:05,"Having initially denied the pandemic and fallen behind in terms of prevention, both the US and UK rushed back on vaccination much quicker than Europe. At the end of the day, the true yardstick of relative success/failure will be unfortunately the number of deaths ..."
2021-03-21 11:19,"This article explains pretty well the differences between US and EU approach to vaccination and the reason why. Living here, however, one does not sense any panic or resentment of how things are handled. Better safe than sorry is prevailing attitude. Sure, it is a fact of life that, for whatever reason, the US seems to be ""first"" in almost everything, from innovation to social trends, and for this it is admired. Nevertheless, not many in EU are willing change the life style."
2021-03-21 11:49,"Yes, the US is very successful in vaccinating its people, but it does not mean that they have a better health system. It is first and foremost not about your health, but about first and foremost the economy."

Even in pre-pandemic, you had to book an appointment for your doctor days in advance. A person getting rejected from a vaccination center because of a wrong form is such a typical German problem (and at the same time, a bless) – no one stands above the law and regulations. 
As an individual, this was well predicted. Endless wait without a promise, I’m just afraid that as a young foreigner, every delay would pile up and crush on my invitation. Maybe my mail might get lost by the postman (another very common problem)."

The EU from the start has walked the walk of supporting equity of access and solidarity with poorer nations. And yet it alone is accused of ‘Vaccine Nationalism’ by the Anglosphere media. Rather the facts are:

- The EU sought to negotiate and leverage its scale to assure poorer, Eastern European nations in the bloc would have access to doses at affordable rates, rather than the wealthier western and Northern European nations trumping them with their greater means. This has not been a consideration for the US or UK.
- Yes, the EU trusted in contracts that suppliers provide doses to member states. This trust has been sorely disappointed.
- The real Vaccine Nationalists are the UK and the US, who have shipped zero doses offshore. 10 million doses of EU produced Astra Zeneca have been shipped from A-Z facilities in the EU to Britain, 40M total export. Yet, Zero, nada, from A-Z factories in the UK to the EU. 
- A-Z has unilaterally cut its commitment to the EU by 75% for the first half of 2021. They cite ‘production difficulties’ in their EU facilities, yet such difficulties did not prevent supply the its UK customer, paying a much higher unit price, nor the shipping of millions of doses from the EU facilities to the UK. 
- Yet, with 20 000 deaths a week in the Europe, any complaint by the EU is ‘Vaccine Nationalism’ for the UK/US press"

At 69 y/o I got the second Pfizer vax in my arm three weeks ago.  Kudos to the scientists and medical people who worked so hard and effectively to blunt the horror that was Covid-19.

Was the failure of Europe to attain anything resembling a unified government. This was particularly on display during the Great Recession, and now again with the great pandemic and vaccine rollout.

But let us (the United States) learn and draw the best lessons from Europe:

UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE

[Especially while pandemic and health are on the front burner, with staggering effect upon all of us.]

2021-03-21 6:31,"Europe was went wrong from the get-go. But America was so busy dumping on Trump that it willfully ignored this glaringly obvious fact. European leaders did NOTHING, not to prevent the spread of the virus, not to assign blame for its source, not to develop a vaccine. nada. Meanwhile, warts and all, Trump set in motion the discovery of vaccines at an historically unprecedented pace, and set in motion a vaccination program for which Joe Biden is now - with the willful complicity of the media - taking full credit."
2021-03-21 8:20,"The writers of the article didn't mention that EU produces vaccines for the whole world, even US, while US don't allow vaccine exports. Canada imports vaccines from Netherlands, instead Michigan."
2021-03-21 4:04,The Key is and will be the Raw materials in addition to zero culpability for drug manufacturers.
2021-03-21 9:17,"Trump/Biden beat the Europeans, but was that so difficult?  The missed opportunities for the US were two-fold. The US could have shut borders and locked down the country early like China did (they haven’t been wearing masks since last May) and the US could have reclaimed global leadership by coordinating global vaccination efforts and over spent to ensure every country had their share ASAP. Instead the US mismanaged control of the virus, even worse than Europe, and is letting China and Russia vaccinate, and thus buy off, the developing world. Europe set such a low bar, the comparison should be really China."
2021-03-21 4:19,"This is my twopence on the vaccine rollout in Europe.  First, the EU as a trading bloc entity may be best equipped to get a fair deal on the vaccines.  However, what the EU does not have is a uniform healthcare policy - and the time to try out a mass vaccination programme ensuring uniform treatment of a 50 year old in an Italian village and a 70 year old in Paris IS NOT in the middle of the pandemic.   Even with the best pandemic plan in place, this would require momentous amounts of manpower, co-ordination and commitment from both the EU and national governments.  They are not equipped.  Secondly constantly undermining the Astra-Zeneca vaccine, while trying to impose export restrictions is bizarre."
2021-03-21 7:53,"Don't forget that the US enforces an export ban preventing Astra Zeneca from delivering vaccines to the EU.
I guess that even under Biden it's still America First. So, Yes, the EU will take nationalistic lessons from this."
2021-03-21 9:43,"I live in Switzerland which is not in the EU, but the vaccine rollout has been an absolute disaster here too. I am outraged that the richest country in the world and one that prides itself in its ""clockwork precision"" and attention to detail has not managed to procure enough doses of vaccine, and has seemingly no plan, no idea, no clue what to do next.

The Swiss authorities and the hapless health Minister mr. Berset are showing themselves to be utterly incompetent when faced with a real crisis. Nobody I know has been vaccinated, there are no doses, I can't even sign up for an appointment, local doctors say ""there are no vaccines"" and thry are not given any information by this clueless incompetent government.

And to add insult to injury, business owners forced to lock down for months are not getting any compensation as the government doesn't even respond to their requests (which by law should be approved). My fitness center and many others will likely go bankrupt as we wait for lockdown measures to ease up. 

And as the country goes on in a comatose state of semi-lockdown, virus variants are spreading like wildfire as the vaccination program goes too slow.

In 10 years this is the first time I am really angry at the Swiss political class and I hope that all these incompetent paper-pushers get kicked out at the next election."
2021-03-21 8:13,"NYT-
“While Washington went into business with the drug companies, Europe was more fiscally conservative and trusted the free market.”

But of course! Health is a commodity and a profitable business in the US, not a basic human right of all citizens."
2021-03-21 8:22,"The article portrays this crisis as entirely homemade and conveniently fails to highlight the dubios continuation of Trump’s “America First” policy by the Biden administration and the similarly selfish handling of vaccine export restrictions by the British. While the EU has allowed exports of 34 million vaccine doses to partners around the world (incl. the US and the UK), the EU itself had to scramble with the pharma companies to build new supply chains that work around US and UK export restrictions. Similarly close partners like Canada would have been left out in the cold by the US restrictions had they not received supplies from Europe. Blatant egoism and national selfishness are on full display, in spite of what Joe Biden said about the importance of international institutions and collaboration during his inauguration. This continuation of “America First” has about as bad a PR effect as it’s initial proclamation. It adds insult to injury. And much like its opposite - the generosity of the  American people that was on full display during the Berlin airlift - it will not be forgotten.

But he did some things really well, and this was one of them."
2021-03-21 6:01,Man I sure am glad we had Donald Trump to get us off on the right foot with the vaccines.
2021-03-21 9:31,"The “management” of the pandemic and vaccines in the Netherlands has been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster, due to the arrogance of the Dutch health minister, de Jonge and the PM Rutte.  THere has been no mask requirement until recently, and only when indoors.  There is no enforcement of the laws.  No social distancing.  People do as they please.  For months, nothing was done.  The number of positive results now climbs every day by the thousands.  Deaths are on the rise.  People still think it’s ok.  Dutch friend of mine said “these people are old and obese, they’re going to die anyway, so what’s another 6 months difference” if you can believe it.  That’s their attitude.  And there is no word on the vaccine schedule.  Funny, considering that the JnJ vaccine was developed in Leiden, the Netherlands.  It’s an absolute disgrace."
2021-03-21 2:41,"But would that look strange, the French newspaper « Le Monde » doing a big story on all the ways the Americans messed up their management of the crisis ? I am not sure. Maybe, maybe not.

Talking about your own errors is one thing. Always a good thing, perhaps. Talking about others’ mistakes can sometimes look questionable, maybe."
2021-03-17 16:31,"Where's the data?   Yes it stands to reason that more cancers are being detected at a later stage due to fewer screenings, but the story doesn't provide anything other than anecdotal evidence to back up the hypothesis.  That violates the principles of science -- and science journalism."
2021-03-17 16:35,"I'm an acute care physician (aka Hospitalist) and admitted two stage 4 pancreatic cancers this week. Granted pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage, but still. Lots of grim stories of new diagnosis of late stage cancers the last 6 months. The last couple of months have been heavy on oncology. Instead of being diagnosed as outpatients they are getting so sick before diagnosis they need to hospitalized and often are never able to leave. It has been quite depressing."
2021-03-17 16:41,Cancer screening is a complicated issue. Even many physicians are woefully ignorant of the value and lack of value of routine cancer screening. For cancer screening to work it must not only detect cancers but more importantly it must save lives. Unfortunately there’s considerable evidence that the cancer screening that we are told is do important in the USA like mammography and PSA do not save nearly as many lives as we once thought and likely increase false diagnoses of cancer which subject patients to unnecessary and damaging treatments.
2021-03-17 16:41,I was very nervous going for my routine screening in May. VERY nervous. But I masked and washed my hands and made sure all the technicians did the same. And we all came out better for it. But it was nerve wracking.
2021-03-17 16:48,"I was finishing my cancer clinical trial participation as the pandemic began.  

And my post trial evaluations and tests led to my blood being drawn at home and  telemedicine visits except when I needed a shot.

I went to the hospital for my 1st and 2nd COVID-19 vaccinations.

 I am a tad late on my colorectal screening.  But I wanted to be fully vaccinated first."
2021-03-17 16:54,"It will be more interesting to see data than anecdotes. We still don't know if the decreased screening will mean higher rates of mortality, or perhaps lower rates of unnecessary and invasive treatments for false positive screening results.  This story is written from an angle, and it's not a scientific one!"
2021-03-17 16:57,"I lost my father to liver cancer 3 weeks ago because I was too scared to send him to the doctor when he complained about stomach pain. When we found out, it was too late - he lived for less than 4 months after the diagnosis. I knew none of the warning signs of cancer, or that he was at risk- the doctors never advised us to get regular screenings in all these years. I still cannot believe how this all unfolded."
2021-03-17 17:10,"My mom was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in September and died in December. The diagnosis happened after I took her to the ER because she was very pale and weak one day and had passed out—I thought she was having a heart attack. She had missed her usual primary care checkup and blood work in the spring and I wonder if they would’ve found it earlier, though I also understand it comes on fast. But it felt like a death sentence to take a woman in her 80s to a hospital for routine care at that time. The PCP made everything virtual anyway."
2021-03-17 17:19,"how about the fact that the last time I went to my annual skin cancer screening, I was told that my insurance, Fidelis silver, doesnt cover it as preventative care anymore? 

Since when is a skin cancer screening not considered preventative care, typically completely paid for by insurance?

I have been diagnosed and treated for basal cell carcinoma in the past and have a father who's surviving metastasized melanoma on his pancreas."
2021-03-17 17:31,"Pedestaling data over anecdote is a classic power-play in science that has often dehumanizes and gaslights those with less power. That being said the anecdotal, qualitative accounts of phenomena, lead to and give reason for the collecting of data. So its fair to assume that an article such as this foreshadows whats to follow in qualitative research, and the hypothesis that might lead them. Not every journalist has to do both. 

To add to the qualitative, my mother works in mammography. Since her center has reopened, she has noted with unease, cancer is indeed on the rise. Should data confirm this, it would be interesting to understand to what extent this is from postponed/neglected appointments vs. from the distress of the pandemic itself. Chronic psychological stress can lead to chronic inflammation which makes the body prone to depression, anxiety, heart disease and cancer. All of which could very well see a spike in this time."
2021-03-17 17:48,"Even worse than these stories-the millions with no health insurance. Who NEVER get screenings until admitted to the ER because symptoms or pain is so bad.
Because ""freedom""."
2021-03-17 18:03,"Obviously a dilemma.  I'm overdue and concerned.  However, no symptoms (if there were I'd go in).  But when I hear that daily temperatures aren't being taken and nurses have gone to work sick because of lack of sick leave, I have chosen what seems to be the lesser of two evils. My niece who works as a nurse was exposed twice -- once by a patient and once by a fellow staff member.   

I will go in for mammogram a month after my last vaccine to avoid a false positive from enlarge lymph nodes -- it's the best I can do.  I don't think I'll have trouble with booking an appointment.  (Oh, one more consideration: I'm post-menopausal and the new guidelines for non-risk woman is every two years.  I discussed my decision with my doctor and she validated my choice.)"
2021-03-17 18:10,"Regular screenings (since I was in my late 20s) have saved me, (and allowed me to identify what caused the abnormalities and thus take preventive measures, while not having them have caused several acquaintances to find their cancer in late stages, some too late to save."
2021-03-17 18:15,"I was very nervous but I went for a mammogram last October as the Covid cases were down. Only one other woman was there at the same time, I felt glad that I went. And I went to the dentist too, starting last June - I was quite scared but I didn't want to miss it as I need regular cleanings."
2021-03-17 18:32,"Patients haven't necessarily skipped their screenings. At the beginning of this pandemic, they were often made to delay treatment because of covid fears/protocols."
2021-03-17 18:42,"When I read articles like this and the ensuing comments, I like to ponder how the information pertains to me, a purely scientific study of one person, case in point 73 year old male of European descent.

Last June after Covid was well settled in, I received information from Medicare that I should take advantage of a no-cost regular check-up. Two friends of mine were recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Even though my PSA was extremely low when I c checked in 2011, I thought I should take advantage of the  Medicare recommendation.

Cutting to the chase, the exam was done, a bill arrived on my doorstep for nearly five hundred dollars, including the cost of the PSA. After long waiting time calls with Medicare, the issue seemed to be how the exams were coded by my physician.

Cutting to later in the chase, after the re-coding for things like the cost of putting a blood test needle in my arm, the bill came down to one test Medicare and my supplemental insurance don't cover to the tune of around a hundred and fifty. And guess for which one test I'm still being charged? I think you know the answer.

Anyone have any ideas of what's going on with our health care system and what seems to me a bait and switch by Medicare? Come on in, the first test is free. After that . . ."
2021-03-17 18:48,"95% of cancers can be prevented with a proper lifestyle, I wonder why we aren't hearing about prevention, we are only hearing about treating symptoms. Is big big pharma and money the problem? Is money more important than lives? Yes."
2021-03-17 18:56,"I too am a health care provider. Americans are not just missing screening exams but not coming in for obvious problems like the patients in the article. Many patients are living isolated lives. In the past, family and friends would have noticed that something is wrong and begged the patient to seek help. Without the feedback, patients are afraid and in denial and will not seek medical care. I know of patients who receive positive biopsy results but have delayed treatment for months. By the time, they make it to an oncologist, they are stage 4. I work with a major cancer center. We expect our survival data to dramatically fall. Literally weekly we meet a patient who ignored all warning signs."
2021-03-17 19:33,"In February 2020, my PCP noticed a dark spot on my scalp and referred me to a dermatologist for evaluation. My appointment was scheduled for March 18. Days before, I got a call from that office telling me that all appointments except for emergencies were cancelled until further notice. Asked if it was an emergency, i said no. In the next few months, the spot grew and began to bleed. Still I thought it was no big deal. i had had basal cell and squamous cell cancers in the past and assumed that this was one of those. When the dermatologist's office called me in June to schedule an appointment, I learned that I had an invasive melanoma, stage 3. Following five hours of scarring surgery, seven week of radiation and now immunotherapy, I am hoping to have a chance of beating it. If not for covid, that small spot would still have been a melanoma, but most likely in situ and most likely removed without complications. My advice? Get to the doctor if anything unusual is going on with you. It might be serious,"
2021-03-17 19:38,MGH primary care is discouraging annual Physicals which I believe is dangerous. Medical staff have been vaccinated now and there is no excuse for delaying in person visits. I was offered a virtual Physical which I turned down. We have to return to regular screening.
2021-03-17 19:42,"There has been a big media campaign here for months to convince people not to skip their regular health screenings and/or ignore worrying symptoms because of fear of catching Covid in doctors’ offices and other health facilities. I’ve visited my GP, my gynecologist and dentist several times in the past year, had my yearly mammogram (I had breast cancer 10 years ago) and felt fully confident with the precautions each practitioner was taking- including, besides masking and disinfecting, leaving all personal possessions outside the consulting area and the airing out of the examining rooms after each patient. My GP told me he was very concerned about not seeing many of his older patients with ongoing health issues, but at least he’s now able to vaccinate for Covid  in his office. If only we didn’t have such a shortage of vaccine here!"
2021-03-17 19:48,II managed to get a 3 month delayed diagnostic mammogram/sonogram last May. It was ok and have another one scheduled in May. Also had a 5 year colonoscopy and had a polyp removed. Didn’t have to fight the medical world but  had fights with my husband who didn’t want me going for these tests.
2021-03-17 19:48,"Several comments here so far have been focused on what I believe are tangents like ""Big Pharma"" and ""life style prevention"", etc.

To me, a 70 year old recent colon cancer survivor - now just two years distant from my last cancer surgery, and only 18 months distant from my most recent aborted-because-of-severe-heart-side-effects-chemotherapy, the point of this article, albeit seemingly more anecdotal rather than ""facts and data"" driven, hits home directly.

Yes, health care is expensive, and yes, it is often misguidedly and/or misdirectedly expensive for the wrong reasons and very much so for the many, many people who can't afford even basic competent healthcare.

Nevertheless, it WAS a real dilemma during the last year trying to decide whether to climb into the various medical facility caves of the Covid beast or continue to shiver outside in the frozen uncertainty related to random aches and pains, gnawing concerns about recurrence, knowledge of added risks as an old guy with ""co-morbidities galore"", etc. etc.

I'm not wealthy by any means, but I'm well off enough to be able to say it wasn't about money in my case. It was ALL about so much of ""healthcare"", never mind simple ""life things"", having to be canceled. ""To protect you"".

I'd never ask anyone to walk in my shoes in all of this, but for anyone who might have missed the point, this intensely difficult last year for all of us, was especially difficult for people who simply shouldn't wait for various health needs."
2021-03-17 20:13,"Screening for cancer is vastly over rated and extremely expensive. This article and many of the comments on the article exhibit ""confirmation bias"" - you notice things that confirm what you believe. Nobody sees the patients who did not die of Covid 19 because they did not get infected in a visit to the doctor, the mammogram clinic or the colonoscopy center. Nobody notices the people who were not killed in auto accidents driving to a doctor office visit. (I had 3 patients die in car accidents on the way to the doctor.) Nobody sees the patients who did not die because of adverse reactions to the tests or procedures that were not done. Colonoscopy is not a perfectly safe procedure. 
This situation is a great natural experiment. In a year or two will will get the statistics on cancer incidence and mortality and be able to determine if screening really makes a difference in the general population."
2021-03-17 20:24,I'm living this. My husband couldn't get medical attention until June and now we know it was too late.
2021-03-17 20:33,"I am a four time cancer survivor and was scheduled for my yearly exam during Covid.  I went, regardless of any misgivings I had.  Luckily, everything was good but I am more than aware that things can go wrong at any point.  We tend not to fear the right things.  Yes, Covid creates many risk factors but cancer is impatient.  One comment regarding Ms. Prieto.  My husband died from pancreatic cancer and this family should know that this specific cancer diagnosis is grim and regardless of Covid, the outcome would likely not have changed.  Unless it is an islet cell pancreatic tumor, which is rare, the disease moves swiftly to its end."
2021-03-17 20:44,"Screening for cancer is a tricky subject because we tend to over-treat. In our for-profit system cancer is a money maker.  In many  cases, cancers are detected that would have never hurt you (an incidental cancer).  Before speculating about the ""great cost"" of reduced screening we need more data. It's possible that reduced screening has little clinical effect."
2021-03-17 20:51,"This should not be surprising considering all the focus this past year has been on preventing COVID transmission and COVID deaths, at the expense of all else (i.e., mental health impacts, the prevention/treatment of other types of physical illnesses, 
and deaths due to other causes all taking a back seat/being afforded less importance and less empathy, than anything COVID-related)."
2021-03-17 21:03,"It is worthwhile reporting on this- there has been a large reduction in all sorts of (non COVID) medical care for the past year, even unexpected events like ER visits and heart attacks.  At this point, what we have is anecdotal evidence.   This is something that can and will be studied extensively as it represents a good natural experiment.  The gov't maintains very detailed cancer mortality data (SEER).  If there's a spike of deaths in a few years that then subsides we'll have a good estimate of the value of screening (and MD visits).    I strongly suspect that we'll see a very small increase in cancer mortality.   Let's not forget, though, that hospitals also (unfortunately) kill people, so fewer hospital stays likely lead to fewer deaths from medical mistakes.  Unfortunately with all the COVID deaths it will be difficult to determine if the overall mortality rate actually dropped or not ."
2021-03-17 21:14,"At the beginning of the pandemic, doctors offices were canceling appointments, so I deeply sympathize with those who had their screening tests delayed (my mom among them).

Once offices opened up, I decided that if I double mask and head out to Target and the grocery store every week, it's okay to venture out for my mammogram and to have a suspicious mole removed. My doctors' offices were nearly empty, my physicians and staff were masked and scrupulous with hand washing. I felt completely safe and am happy that I don't have to wonder if I sacrificed my health. Hoping that I'll be vaccinated before my upcoming colonoscopy, but if not, I'm going anyway."
2021-03-17 21:38,"Last summer when an irritated nipple didn’t resolve easily, I sent a photo to my doctor since he was readily seeing patients virtually. I probably wouldn’t have bothered with an actual office visit for it—three kids in virtual school were too much to justify it—and he recommended a biopsy based on the image. I received a breast cancer diagnosis, luckily stage 1 since we got it early. I don’t think I would have jumped on it otherwise!"
2021-03-17 18:15,"One more example of how our US preventive health care community sits on its stethoscopes, instead of moving into this century:

2021-03-17 20:34,"Get a colonoscopy!!!
They’re completely painless.  

I put off getting one for five years. I finally did — and the polyp they would have found and easily removed had grown into a cancer tumor.  

A major surgery removed the tumor, along with some of my colon. Luckily, testing showed that the cancer hadn’t spread. Had I skipped the colonoscopy, I’d be on the path to terminal cancer.  

So please, get a colonoscopy. It’s the most preventable form of cancer."

Everyone who's died of neglect and from missing needed medical care due to the Republicans' negligence should be listed on their butcher's bill. It reminds me of their neglect during the height of the AIDS pandemic. Depraved indifference, needless suffering, and death, over and over. I'm sick of their misanthropy, their selfishness, their ignorance, their greed, and their total lack of accountability. I can't think of a single thing any Republican has done in the last twenty years that's positive. They hold us back and drag us down at every opportunity. Why do we tolerate them?"

Even the particular folks who lost loved ones to cancer, to heart disease, etc. received less attention and sympathy.  COVID was the topic du jour...the headline grabber...the click bait.

The human experience includes birth, challenges and triumphs - big and small, and eventually, death.  How is this news?  Yet, with COVID, and in this current world in which we live, where everything is fodder for click bait, for social media Clicks, Shares and competitions in suffering, COVID has been allowed to dominate, at the expense of the majority.  How is a COVID illness or a COVID death any worse than any other type of illness or death?  Why is it any more deserving of 'attention' or empathy?

Sheesh.  Everyone is so self-important nowadays.  In fact, none of us matters to the planet.  We are mere specks.  Here today, gone tomorrow.  The universe continues to do its thing.

2021-03-17 18:50,"Sorry I couldn't resist. Another anecdote. I'm told that after fifty I should have a colonoscopy. So this is twenty years ago. A physician's assistant is managing my appointment. After being told the procedure, I ask what this might cost. She says around twenty-five hundred dollars. I asked whether that would be covered by my insurance. She tells me it depends on whether she codes the procedure as preventative or elective. Preventative is covered; elective is not. Seems to me, I tell her, this is preventative, isn't that correct? She responds, ""I haven't decided yet."" So, I walk out of the office, good-bye, no colonoscopy then or ever. Now apparently colonoscopies have fallen out of fashion. Maybe fate played some kind of role. Preventative or elective? You make the call."

We all saw the increase in undiagnosed illnesses, along with increased domestic abuse, substance abuse, mental illness and suicides, and emotionally scarred kids. We saw Covid being poorly managed via draconian lockdowns and fear mongering. Even now, with a functional cure in the form of vaccines, the hysteria and pandemic theater continues. Even more will suffer and die. It's called common sense and everyone with half a brain sees this. We should be vaccinating everyone over 16, with an allowance for a full return to normal life within 2 weeks of an second mRNA vaccine dose and 1 month after the J&J vaccine dose. We won't. Too many moral scolds and virtue signalers are interested in keeping the populace imprisoned in the name of ""safety"".

2021-03-17 18:17,"Yet another ramification of Trump's massive failure to manage COVID. Given his denial and lack of organization & coordination across the nation, people (including me) postponed their annual tests because they feared getting sick. One at a time, states and cities eventually developed safe procedures but the process was too gradual & very haphazard. One ounce of presidential leadership would have stimulated health facilities to trade ideas and be able to safely accept patients. 

But there was no profit for Trump so why bother. Trump and his republican cabal need to be prosecuted and held accountable for so many deaths."

I would welcome more articles like this, also on deaths or serious complications from un- and under diagnosed and thus untreated diabetes, Hypertension, and related cardiovascular disease.  How many heart attacks and strokes could have been prevented, preventable kidney failures went undetected, how many people lost eyesight due to the necessary diversion of resources and precautions related to Covid19?  We will be paying a high price for years to come.  The worst part is that much of it was preventable, save for the poor handling of this pandemic by a federal administration that was both willfully ignorant and incompetent.

1/3 of cancer survivors are under age 64. Their lifespan is only shortened by about ten years.  Its not cost effective to ignore that they produce more than they consume in health dollars.  Advocating no screening means they will be presenting with more advanced cancers and have a shortened lifespan.  Cost-benefit of screening and treating outweighs cost-benefit of killing them."

The bad and ugly are countless useless tests, procedures, screenings etc. etc. they have been proven all but useless like PSA tests, chest X Rays in the past, pills for pre diabetes, etc. etc.

They have done much more harm than good thanks to our de facto criminal health care system where profits come over good health.

Some procedures are valuable and can save lives.

The trick is to know the difference."

I was just about to pull the trigger on a treatment choice when Iowa's revered Trump wannabe, who masquerades as a governor but is only a politician, shut down all non-emergency care.  Guess what?  Cancer isn't an emergency, at least not in Iowa.  Then in mid-March I tore a meniscus in my knee.  Couldn't even get an MRI to confirm the diagnosis, let alone low-risk arthroscopic surgery to repair it.

So with the ban on ""elective"" surgery I'm forced into radiation and androgen-deprivation therapy for the cancer, and don't get surgery on the knee until the end of June.  In Iowa, at least, many of the health care delays are of the politicians' making, not the patients'."

COVID is a blip that made the violence of our system more obvious. That’s all."
2021-03-18 11:51,"Although I was not personally afraid to go to the doctor's office, I felt for a while last spring that the medical establishment was giving off messages essentially saying, 'stay away unless you're really sick.'  I had a symptom, which for a while I thought I'd just bring up at my annual wellness in July. Then it got worse. I did go to see my internist, had some tests, needed a procedure and am now fine. Luckily for me, it was treatable, but the atmosphere seemed to be 'don't come near unless you must.'"
2021-03-18 12:27,Medical establishment created this situation. We were advised not to visit primary care offices. We were asked to delay the specialist visit and go to the ER if we did not feel well. What did the medical establishment expect?

I was so angry as I could have found it earlier (or maybe I was lucky as it wouldn’t be there earlier - I’ll never know). I’ve treated it and going to be well. For those saying they don’t care about screening and want to live a worry-free life: you obviously never dealt with cancer. Go screen! It takes 1h and can save you months of being miserable & your life.

Women: please also do monthly self checks - the earlier you find it, less chance of spread to other places and less chance of dying. I see hundreds of women in my center... Don’t think as I did that you’ll never get it. Sadly it’s way too common."
2021-03-17 11:13,"My son is a junior in high school.  The horror of the college application process is upon us.  Having completed this process two years ago with my eldest son, we thought maybe it would be easier this time.  We where wrong! My son commutes FOUR hours a day to get to his high school.  He leaves at 5:30 am and comes home at 6;30pm.  He is driven to be a good person and student and has very good grades.  My son attends a very selective, academically tuff Jesuit high school and thank God the school is the only catholic school in America that is tuition free as the commuting costs are over 500 dollars a month.  Having been in lockdown mood for one year, the colleges campuses are closed for visits but open via zoom.  No friends, no eating out with his buddies, no sports, no socialization has occurred in over one year and yet my son keeps his head above water and struggles with his coursework.  Of course, being in such a prestigious high school, make applying to college much more intense as the Ivy League schools are applied to in force.  What my son did learn over the COVID lockdown is that going to an Ivy League school is not the most important thing in the world.  Yes, going to Stanford was/is his dream but the reality of it all now is different for him.  Seeing Senators Cruz and Hawley representing the best Ivy League traditions was not lost on my son.  He said to me, “how can anyone think that way who went to such a great school”.  So, the process continues a true horror story."

2021-03-17 11:58,"Depending on which college  or university a student was submitting an application may have been influential on the context of their essay.

Yet, would a student who normally displays more talent amongst their classmates still choose to select an obvious subject matter like the pandemic or would they be bolden to entice the readers at the admissions office by writing about a subject matter with less media attention?

It is quite often easy to be a rider on a bandwagon, but the drive and vehicle to steer your own path has only one seat."
2021-03-17 12:24,"Not interested in the 2020 Election? No, my guess is they were counseled against taking a partisan stand in their essays, not knowing the political leanings of their admissions officials. 

Our seniors passionately debated the issues of 2020 in their gov’t classes, organized fundraisers, invited speakers to zoom assemblies, and registered to vote in droves. When I despair about the state of the world, today’s high school students inspire me."

Pity the admissions officers, having to read through essays that sound exactly the same."
2021-03-17 12:13,"And how many of these ""student essays"" were actually, written, drafted, coached by parents?  Well, let me relate my experience as a science fair judge.  It was a running joke amongst the judges relative to awarding ribbons to the parents instead of the students.  The parental science projects would stick out like a sore thumb.  I imagine the analogy holds for college essays.  I propose a blue book essay exam where the applicants are placed in a room (auditorium), provided with pencil, paper, and 1 hour to express their thoughts.  THEIR thoughts, not their parents.  Perhaps the cream would rise to the top as their parents nervously paced the parking lot.  Perhaps not......."
2021-03-17 13:12,I felt moved by these students’ voices. Their words feel authentic to me. Some of the cynical comments here about students getting too much help or writing about the same topics are off base. Any topic written from the heart can make an effective piece of writing. Thanks to all these students for sharing a piece of their lives in a difficult year for all of us.
2021-03-17 13:13,These essays are lovely and inspiring.  Gives me faith in the next generation.  I loved reading them all.  Wish we could see the whole thing and not just brief excerpts.  Kudos to all the students here and best wishes on their college journeys.
2021-03-17 13:19,"This article is misleading. Having been through the college application process this year with my daughter, I can tell you that the applicants were actively encouraged to NOT write about COVID. There was a separate prompt for the students who were directly and significantly impacted by COVID. However, social justice was emphasized by several schools in their supplemental essay prompts. In the long run, the schools still want to know what drives and excites students."

The notion that a 200-500 word essay (with varying degrees of proof reading, outside help, assistance, etc) can magically perfectly sum up your 12 years of work (but mostly your back story) and impress some random admission officer is beyond unfair and entirely random.

The essays may hold up but in an interviews, it doesn’t take FBI skills to see who is incapable of an original thought or any form of introspection. I’m not going to analyze who wrote them and will thus give the students the benefit of the doubt; the NYT featured essays that centered on these topics intentionally so judging the subject is moot.  These essays were thoughtful and reflect the range of emotion, upheaval, angst, and  yes, pride that has engulfed these young adults. My own child has struggled with the isolation and uncertainty tremendously. These essays reflect what I am seeing in my own household."
2021-03-17 14:17,"I thought the essays were wonderful to read. Too bad some universities discouraged writing about the pandemic when it could have been a great opportunity to express something uniquely of the students own heart. It was a year like very few of us, if any, can say they’ve experienced before. I, too, have sat on admission boards and read student essays."

My daughter is applying to a private HS for 10th grade in response to her alienation from virtual school this past year and I watched how it took days to answer the open ended questions about her life. This was important work for her as well as a window into her life for the school. It reminded me of my applications to HS, college, and medical school many years ago, and how I much I learned about myself through them."
2021-03-17 16:50,"I served on several committees to evaluate students for a large university's college decisions on admissions. The standardized test scores of applicants, GPA, AP classes and class ranking were essential to the initial process. They reduced the pool of the overwhelming number of prospective students. Sadly, often we never even got to read all the essays of those who did not satisfy the predetermined measurable requirements for consideration. Even though the standardized tests have been waived this year the other academic measurements of a student's  performance over three years still stand. In the case of those who border on making the cut, their  essays may then be considered in the final decision to offer admittance. 

That said, I personally would love to be able to read every single essay like the beautiful ones in this article and factor them into the rigidity of the system of academic requirements. The question of how to be able to do so with a finite predetermined number of applicants to be admitted determined by the incoming class size among thousands of contending applicants continues to be a challenge. Congratulations to all the students in this heartening article. You have all made the cut in my humble opinion!"

Reading words here such as ""melanin mistaken as a felon, my existence is now a hashtag that trends as often as my rights, a facade at best, a lie in truth..."", and hearing similar profound truths each week from my students in our Zoom classroom in the midst of this pandemic, students I've never met in person, but feeling like I know better than any I've met in a physical classroom, is to be reminded at this late autumn stage of my life's journey how incredibly old and wise the souls of some of our young people are, experiencing and writing from the springtime of their lives...to be able to express such a deep, abiding awareness of universal truths, and holding them up for older folks like me to see and learn from. It's a humbling and truly life-affirming gift that these students are sharing with us (what if they never wrote?) echoing and adding to the ancient voices, whose sage words of wisdom are passed down through the ages, and then are passed on to others by people like me, ironically to students like themselves. It's clearer than ever to me that, in addition to turning to the pages of ""The Daily Stoic"" to tap into the wisdom of the ages, we need to pay attention, and truly LISTEN to our students."

To ll of you applicants out there, as a current professor and periodic member of our Admissions Committee, we pay a LOT of attention to essays -often more attention than to grades and definitely more than we do to ""standardized tests"".

For one, we were discouraged to write about all of these ""current events""--COVID, the protests, etc, because they were said to be too common and trite. This points to the larger issue of the fact that college essays are not just your own truth. While it's true some people's essays may show deep reflection, a college essay is NOT a representation of who you are. A college essay is written for one specific purpose: to sell yourself well enough to get into elite and problematic institutions. The college process, including the essay, is toxic. So, so, many essays have fake passion and/or exploit personal trauma, and every college essay has to end on a positive note. This means they are not a good representation for my generation at all--much of the despair, truth, and real reflection will not show up in them. I enjoy reading a college essay as much as the next person, but it is frustrating to see the NYTimes sugarcoat and exaggerate this experience as ""a platform for seniors to reflect on the pandemic, race, and loss."" Do better."

How many do I know that have died by, or suffered lasting health consequences to COVID - (emphasize LASTING health consequences) - 1. My son's gymantic trainer's mother died from COVID.

2021-03-17 18:04,The F rench government spends fifty six percent of GDP. There is no excuse for this. What in the world is Paris doing with the tax money it collects? This is also one of the EU countries that is bungling the vaccine roll out.  If my grandparents wer still alive I would thank them for having made the trip across the Atlantic.
2021-03-17 18:51,"Amongst all of the terrible number of tragedies happening worldwide, Europe stands out.  Boris the buffoon and his supporters have never looked better, walking away from the handling or to be more accurate, mishandling by the EU.  The EU leaders, like our own Donald Trump are responsible for prolonging the misery, increasing the scope of the disaster and literally killing more and more people."
2021-03-17 18:31,"I guess France hasn't adopting giving each resident $1000, or maybe $2000..."
2021-03-17 17:41,We are sacrificing the young to save the old.
2021-03-17 17:38,Europeans should be furious at their governments and the EU for this insanely botched vaccine rollout. Somehow they aren't. I love Europe but apathy is a strong force there.
2021-03-17 17:58,"Why has hunger been renamed to the more benign term food insecurity? These people aren't food insecure, they are starving."
2021-03-17 18:01,This is capitalism not the pandemic.  Macron wants to liberalize the economy and create more misery so his clique can enrich themselves.  If politicians can't even keep people fed then it's time to get rid of them.
2021-03-17 19:17,What happened to the robust safety net that European countries supposedly have that some of our politicians keep saying we should emulate?
2021-03-17 19:26,"Grocery shopping in France is super expensive. Especially in Paris where most corner shops stock tiny containers of jam, mustard etc. People usually don’t buy large quantities since they don’t have the space or money. Grocery stores are usually far away form city centres and the grocery stores in the city are small compared to American standards and much more expensive. This is heartbreaking and I wonder what will happen politically since the right wing party of Marine Le Pen now has an opportunity to profit from this chaos."
2021-03-17 20:48,"Students and other vulnerable groups should be eligible for a provision with basic supplies. But this requires some bland red tape already in place. This solution should to be a obvious, but like always politicians take some detours for grandeur or flashes of wit.
One euro meals, probably served at the canteen off a campus that is locked down - someone explains me why this even should be considered to be an options ?"
2021-03-17 20:48,"This is a looming crisis and keep in mind, this is the ""1st world""! Shocking for Europe and the US (""In the United States, nearly one in eight households doesn’t have enough to eat"")!!! We fight about such petty things here (""banning Merry Christmas"" for example?) while our infrastructure crumbles, our water becomes undrinkable, our forests burn and people get evicted and starve, the second an [avoidable?] catastrophe comes along. And I say avoidable, because the powers that be at the time were actively dismantling the CDC etc. at the very time we needed it most - and then not to rehash recent history, but ignored science and played personal gain-politics while [Rome] was burning. If I was an alien watching this I might be tempted to say, ""couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of guys""."
2021-03-17 20:59,"As someone with family in both countries, I must point out that the young people in France are likely to bounce back much more quickly than their counterparts here. They have free health care and no student debt. Their tuition is usually less than the cost of books for a year at CUNY."
2021-03-17 21:29,"Student life and precarity go hand in hand, in my experience, whether you live in France or the US. Unless they have a job, students have to rely on the generosity of their government, their family or their friends or get a loan, which is possible in France too.
I'm glad these students are getting the help they need even though they also have to swallow their pride, as they realize for the first time maybe, that they are among the poor and the needy. No shame in that, it happens... May they pass it forward when their fortunes have turned..."
2021-03-17 21:59,"This is the cold, hard reality of the pandemic.

While most of the news coverage has been about COVID-19 and its symptoms and direct deaths, little to no attention is being paid to anything else.

The news conveniently ignores the mental health decline of millions of people. The news conveniently ignores advanced cancers or other ailments that fail to get diagnosed. Or the generation of young students who will never fully reach their educational potential. And now, the hunger of needy people.

For anyone continuing to bemoan the lack of lockdowns being taken seriously by Republican governors, I'd urge you to see the other side of lockdowns. When the cure is worse than the disease, you have to wonder which side has it right."
2021-03-17 22:00,"This is a true story of what is happening here in Paris. While the pandemic continues and the Covid infection rate is 30,000 cases a day, the government stops the Aztra vaccination program because less than 0.001 have had a blood clots out of 18 million vaccinated people. Thousands die a day in Europe because of Covid while the politicians, both national and European Union, cast blame on everyone but themselves.

The only solution to the lack of vaccinations put forth by France is tighter lock downs. There are no cures nor treatments for Covid only vaccinations."
2021-03-17 22:07,"For how much praise Europe got compared to the US when it comes to covid, pretty much every euro country is doing worse than even places like Florida and Texas when it comes to deaths/capita and similar metrics.  Germany was the gold standard, and then it got utterly smashed in the last wave harder than nearly every other country/state.  And they still aren't out of it, Italy and Germany are seeing another mini-surge.

I don't think Sweden got it correct either, but it doesn't appear strict lockdowns and mask mandates work any better."
2021-03-17 22:48,"These stories are so incredibly sad. I wish there were more ways these students could be helped. I have a kid in school in the UK - who is terribly lonely, in lock down. The loneliness of these young people away at school is heartbreaking. They need human connection and plenty of hot meals."
2021-03-17 22:50,Is there a way to donate to this student foodbank?  I could not find any information on that.
2021-03-17 23:14,"Same same here in Australia, even though geographic isolation has protected us from the extremes of Covid, as we too are subject to all the consequences of globalisation.
So many “certainties” lost, in education and other sectors, so many doubts for the future ..."
2021-03-17 23:37,"High unemployment among the young was common in France before the pandemic. When I went to a conference in Paris in 2018, there was a panel discussing “alternative life strategies” for young people who had no hope of ever getting a job. The vaunted workers protection laws were often to blame - if it is too hard to fire a worker, most employers will be wary of hiring. But the current situation is so much worse because of the devastation of the pandemic and the botched vaccination rollout. I’ve always been a Euro-patriot. But really, what can be said in defense of the European ideals when the countries most successful in vaccination are the UK, Russia, China, and Israel - the roll-call of the most reviled targets of the left? The same is true of the US: red states far outstrip California and NY in vaccinating their citizens. I suspect that a serious rethinking of the idea of Europe itself will be in order when the pandemic is over."
2021-03-17 23:45,"Welcome to the club, France et al. This is the end state of the neo-liberal experiment: a highly educated population that is so used to being strapped for cash to pay for day-to-day expenses that when something as basic as food starts to become hard to get, there is no rioting in the streets (then again, it's hard to riot when you're hungry). We've had this in the USA for longer, but it was bound to happen elsewhere sooner or later (anyone who thinks that the USA is singularly susceptible to corporatization of the public good suffers from a weird negative variety of American exceptionalism). The only meaningful way to fight this starts with community organizing (which seems to be happening here) and end with a solidarity-based liberal left-wing movement taking power. The French should feel the urge for revolution better than anyone else!"
2021-03-17 23:52,"This broke my heart and slammed the tears button.  My wife and I were art majors fifty-five years ago.  We have spent months in Paris during seven long trips there.  

Our students have it rough already with the banks having saddled them with onerous, usury, and perpetual student loans.  The latest round of stimulus checks is a small token compensation  compared to other western countries that provide subsidized or free healthcare, ditto free higher education.  Additionally, the lack of efficient public transportation are all things young people could use to boost their start in life.  These and many others are perks U.S voters continually vote against.  To be young and to wonder where your next day's meals are coming from make the U.S. a second world country."
2021-03-18 0:03,"Let enough people know the pain of hunger and poverty watch out for real change.

Income inequality almost never resets itself except through violence -  in some form. If this happens, current proposals for 90% tax rates will seem mild in comparison."
2021-03-18 0:52,"Wow.  This reminds me of the stories my dad told me about being a poor college student in the 1930s at CCNY in New York.

One story was that he and two other students would get together each day to pool what little cash they had (we are talking pennies) to buy a quart of milk and a loaf old day old bread from a local baker.  They split that food three ways for lunch.  the way my dad told it, one of the guys had that as his only food of the day.

My dad also told me the story of when he graduated, straight into the Depression, and went looking for work, he was interviewed and asked:
How many people in your family?
My dad said ""5 of us, my father my three sisters and me.""
Then came the question ""How many of you are working?""
My dad responded ""My father and one of my sisters.""
Then came the response. "" I need to give this job to someone with 5 people in the family and NO ONE EMPLOYED.  Sorry.""

That was a good 80+ years ago.  Looks to me like not a great deal has changed, when you look at the big picture.

We (my wife and I and all of our kids and grandkids) are exceedingly fortunate these days, to be able to afford shelter and food for all of us."
2021-03-18 1:26,"The French students will graduate with - NO - student debt.

Our students in the US carry the burden of over $1 trillion in debt, as they try to gain a toehold in our economy.

Our US students will be economizing on food, visiting food banks and so forth for decades and decades of their lives."
2021-03-18 2:27,"I was always hungry at that age, 17 to 25. In my student years hardly ever had enough of anything to eat. Meals  were creative and unconventional. Breakfast would be a empty-ish peanut butter jar filled with apple cider and plain yogurt .. all very cherished and expensive ingredients. It was a drinkable grey-sludge. I would take it to morning class and my professors would scowl when the inquired about it.  One of my favorite dinners was a paper shopping bag filled with popcorn, nutritional yeast and a bit of soy sauce.  I got these ideas from creative, healthy  hippies.. it was tough, though my weigh was a stable 130lbs. for  a decade. After a while, I couldn't eat those concoctions anymore,  I 'burned out' on it."
2021-03-17 17:11,"Heartbreaking reality unfolding worldwide. I pray sincerely from my heart to my creator, Have Mercy on Us."
2021-03-17 21:29,"Same is happening here in the USA. Democrats had the audacity to pass a 2.9 tril slush fund for special interests, and not opening schools or the economy. 
$ 10,000 federal bonus’s for employees who never missed a check!!! Can you imagine how insulting that is to people unemployed, or worse yet poor misfortune children who usually only get fed at school, who aren’t now because blue states are closed. It demonstrates just how elitist and out of touch the left & democrats are. I’m hearing everyone from both parties complaining."
2021-03-17 21:50,"There's no food stamps in France and the poor are totally abandonned by their government who direct the stimulus money to a small number of people who already have a job. Needless to say that such people are not spending money, but saving it...
students face a terrible situation when family can't support them, Macron's way of managing the crisis is just insane and useless."
2021-03-17 20:31,"If Jeff Bezos were to hire 100 bistros to produce the food they usually serve, and distribute the food to the hungry, he could sustain the Parisian restaurant industry and keep all these people healthier.  Or New York's or Topeka's or Austin's.  Probably all of them.  And he would probably continue to be the world's richest man.  But.  He's Jeff Bezos so he he wants to hoard his money and count it."
2021-03-17 19:27,"No question about it.  I feel sorriest for the children and young adults of today.  It's a real tragedy.

But how very brave of Mr. Naves to be studying philosophy.

Perhaps, someday, he will save the world.  There must be a reason for all this suffering ..."
2021-03-17 20:13,"This article may be very good for an American or an English person knowing little of the french safety net. But for someone living in France, it is obvious a good part of this article is invented. 

- if Ms Chereau's father was laid off after 20 years in his company, he was entitled to a minimum of 6 months' severance pay by law. And if his company is bankrupt, a gvt agency pays.

 - then there is the unemployment benefits : 57% of the gross salary, ie more than 70% of the previous net salary. During 2 to 3 years.

- and there are allowances for students whose parents can't pay. I used to receive them (560 € / month). 

There are people who are in difficult situations, that's true : self employed people mainly.

I wonder who invented this part of the story : the interviewer or the interviewee..."
2021-03-17 17:03,The European Utopia may not be all it is cranked up to be.
2021-03-17 21:56,I can't imagine ANYONE should ever go hungry in wealthy countries.  How hard is it to pick up an extra few cans of beans when you go to the supermarket?  Drop them off at your local food pantry.  And those who have great wealth should be ASKED to contribute.  Send them a copy of this article.
2021-03-17 22:07,I'm so tired of  the word food insecurity! Let's get back to calling what it really is: HUNGER!  The euphemisms created to soften the meaning of words which are descriptive and clearly connote the   real condition must stop. And why are the euphemisms created?   So some political folks weasel out of addressing the real problem. I miss George Carlin.
2021-03-17 23:06,"Starving on ne meal a day in an advanced first world democracy! why has the Government not stepped in with food coupons students and those who are facing food insecurity can use to buy their own food at grocery stores? Bad job President Macron, shame on your Government.

We have an equivalent problem here in the U.S. the new Biden Government is addressing, you should as well."
2021-03-17 20:15,"The basic needs of the many must always out weight the wants of the few... 

Where I work and with what I do... The very first question I ask a person in crisis; ""Are you hungry?"" as I hand them a nutrition bar. 

This simple act is due to the fact that people cannot think, act or understand clearly when they have not eaten. You'll be amazed at how giving someone, something to eat will end a problem before it starts. 

Pride and stereotype; Most people that are in need of the basics of life (safety, shelter, food and water) are not lazy. They are not trying to ""cheat"" you of anything. They are just hungry and fraught with shame that they have to beg for their daily bread. 

In our world of plenty this is a problem that should have ended long ago..."
2021-03-17 21:30,"This is tragic and should be an international travesty, but it also highlights the utter cognitive dissonance that exists with many European commenters who frequently critique US domestic policy."
2021-03-18 12:06,"Wall street supporters who just want their assets and wealth shouldn't lose a dime to inflation told this person,  If you do not have anything to eat, eat cake.

We saw this same play break the neck of Greek society.

All you can hear, I fear inflation, how I am going to buy things then.

If Europe didn't want to same or worse mistake as they did in 2010, they must come up with a big-spending aid bill.


According to one NYt news,  25 trillion dollars will be lost within this decade due to pandemic-related economic slowdown. 

And the only concern is inflation, the be ready for a very bitter, very unsettling youth of future.


You only harvest what you sow. 

Know it.

Kudos the Biden."
2021-03-18 14:13,"This article is full of misinformation comparing apples to oranges.
Using American or other international students to prove hardship in France is not a fair analogy. 
-  International students pay tuition, have rental expenses and no 
  family around to offer accommodations or food. Once they stop 
  working, they have no means to support themselves unless they 
  have student loans.
- French and other European students do not share these 
  problems. During mandatory  lockdowns, many governments 
  in Europe offer monthly financial assistance to employees and 
  employers. Less than twenty four hours after you file, the money
  is in your account.
International students have the option to get a gap year or study from home. Many who rent in expensive cities choose to return home and save on rent and other expenses.

This is a global emergency and no country should be single out for  problems students face. Paris is not expensive because of the virus and international students have a lot of universities to choose from. Maybe returning back to the States can easy hardship,"
2021-03-18 14:15,"This is such an unfortunate situation and governments need to step up to ensure their citizens are not hungry.  

In the opening paragraph, I cringed when I read 'waiting for handouts' as it reads negatively for me.  While a handout is something given to a needy person for free, it is often used to depict individuals as lazy. 

These are students are waiting for much-needed substance to nourish their bodies and minds so they can focus on their full-time jobs of being students and hopefully run a more compassionate government in the near future."
2021-03-18 15:35,"My feelings and thoughts on this situation, in addition to the immense sadness and anger at the fact that universities would not take any responsibility for the basic needs (food and shelter) of their ""customers"", yes customers: these institutions are being paid by someone to educate these young people!

I also have some thoughts on the types of food being handed out...where is the protein? pasta, rice and ""vegetables"" do not provide enough nutrition alone to sustain a growing adult

Have people forgotten the potato?  the potato has protein, fiber, electrolytes and crabohydrates...it sustained and maintained life during the last major period of starvation and deprivation in the EU: World War II...

Also another source of immense protein and fibers, from the Americas: dry beans...black, pinto, red and white beans...these along with rice and pasta would keep people well nourished"
2021-03-18 18:59,"By now it should be abundantly obvious that the baby boomers have absolutely shattered the social contract and pillaged the economy to enjoy what they can while the generations after suffer. First it was the rising costs of education, then it was the impossibility of obtaining housing, then it was wage stagnation, now the young are literally starving because we shut down the economy for a year without a plan. All except the last solely so boomers could enjoy lower tax rates.

I am not anti-lockdown, but to put people between 18-65 out of work *with no plan to help them* to save mostly those over 65 is literally sacrificing the young to save the old. 
Where does it end? Are the older generations going to start eating the young next?"
2021-03-18 21:14,How can one contribute money to these students or to these food banks?
2021-03-18 23:07,"the french leader Macron said about the pandemic it was a war. well, he did not behave as if it was one. during a war you just don't wait for things go away. maybe he believed what Trump said...
during a war you need to put all your ressources to fight the enemy. by choosing a path in between, he and many western leaders simply made the crisis linger. and if they don't vaccinate all their citizens by the end of April, who knows what will happen. how many variants wll emerge? what will happen to all tjose people?"

2021-03-19 9:09,"I have to wonder how many commenters have read the article, considering how they’ve overlooked the fact that it was written in France. There’s nothing in it about baby boomers, left vs right, crushing student loan debt, or paying your cell phone bill instead of eating.

It hurts to read this because I was a starving student once; I remember weighing 85 lb in college, and not for fashion. I wish there were a better way to distribute calories and macronutrients around the globe..,, we’ve certain got an excess of calories in our food supply over here."
2021-03-19 9:13,"In the U.S., student poverty is caused by rapacious colleges and universities. College tuition rises - at rates far above any inflation measure - must be curbed. 

Almost all colleges and universities are tax-free under IRS Code Section 501(c)(3). The solution: change the law. 

Any entity - educational, religious, medical, etc. - with 501(c)(3) status, can pay any employee no more than is paid to the US President (about $600,000), who runs the largest US non-profit. 

""Pay"" should be all-inclusive, i.e., not just W-2 wages, but all benefits, e.g., housing, health care, car lease, phone, pension, etc.

An educational, charitable, or religious organization - that wants to pay its CEO (or any other employee) more than is paid to the US President - can do so, but must give-up its tax-free status . Few 501 (c)(3) beneficiaries will be affected, as few pay anyone more than is paid to the US President.

A few decades ago, a career in academe ensured a middle-class lifestyle. Now, some enter academe to gain independent wealth. 

Colleges and universities use their oligopoly (few sellers, many buyers) to impoverish not only students, but parents, who trim retirement savings to meet tuition bills. 

Debt-burdened students defer marriage and buying homes. Retirees - whose home is often their main asset - find fewer buyers and so get a lower price. Students, in middle age, will have to help parents, unable to save enough to provide for themselves, because they paid tuition bills."

There are a lot of sources out there that indicate even further duration of positive test results exist and do not incur the patient is infected or infectious.  This is a very common finding. Let's just make sure we are being clear that this finding isn't surprising and does not prove causality that COVID may have been the cause of his symptoms."
2021-03-22 13:27,"Thank you for another interesting podcast. While I certainly believe that Ivan’s psychotic symptoms could be from covid, we cannot assume that with certainty. There is so much fear about the virus and I think this podcast will heighten people’s anxieties. 

As a clinical psychologist, I think it’s important to realize that we know almost nothing about Ivan’s life, family history, etc. You mentioned that he had just spent months in a submarine. How could that experience have affected his mental state?

Again, I am not discounting the possibility that covid caused his psychotic symptoms, but we must not jump to that conclusion. There are too many unknowns about this patient and too many unknowns about the virus."
2021-03-22 14:22,I urge Ivan to seek additional support from a functional medicine practitioner who specializes in mental health. The Institute for Functional Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic can help him find the right doctor who can work in coordination with his medical team to calm down the immune response that is causing the severe inflammation in his brain and body. Best of luck.
2021-03-22 14:39,"I was diagnosed with “an unidentifiable viral bronchitis” in January 2020. The “bronchitis” subsided after various treatments by the end of February, 2020. The extreme fatigue, racing heart, low oxygen saturation, headaches and nausea, etc. continued from 3 days a week in March to once every 3 weeks by October 2020, and continued until my first Covid-19 Moderna vaccination in Jan. 2021. Although no Covid “existed” in the USA in January of 2020, my physicians thought I must have contracted it, maybe during the battle with “viral” bronchitis and didn’t know it, as there was no other explanation for the fatigue, nausea, racing heart and headache during 3 days, after which I felt fine until the next attack. The symptoms have completely disappeared and I feel better, progressively even better, since the second vaccination. Will the 3 days of agony return? Is the disappearance related to the vaccinations? Who knows! But I have had no reoccurrence since five days after my first vaccination. I am definitely a happy camper and true believer in the long haul symptoms disappearing with the vaccinations. I haven’t felt as good as I feel now since January, 2020. Anecdotal information with no real explanation, but my experience reinforces what other long term sufferers have described following getting vaccinated."

After traveling home to NY from Peru in January 2020 my mother claims she had the worst flu she’s ever had and claims she had covid before it was really acknowledged in the US. She claims I picked it up in my travels and brought it to her. Although I never had severe symptoms, later that year I too started experiencing severe paranoia where I even began to believe some of my family and friends were trying to steal from me or steal my identity on line and ruin my credit or set me up to cover up some other crimes they were committing. I am also a very rational person and knew my thoughts were irrational but at the same time I was very much tortured by my own thoughts. I hope the vaccine will bring some relief and that doctors learn more about the virus."

As Ivan described being plunged into a sudden mental-health crisis, his story felt so familiar to my own experience with postpartum anxiety after the birth of my second child. While my condition was brought-on by an abrupt withdrawal of hormones post-pregnancy, the symptoms we experienced were eerily similar. I wish Ivan well and hope his doctors can continue to provide treatments and relief that Ivan and his family so desperately need."

I hope you will extend your reporting to investigate the original source of the c-19 outbreak which might lead to a better understanding of the virus and why it is so mercurial.   The lab-leak hypothesis is becoming harder to ignore as more stories like this one come into the light.   No rhyme or reason why one person experiences respiratory symptoms while another has neurological symptoms, and still others have psychosis or no symptoms at all.  C-19 is a changeling.  It is as if the virus was artificially pushed to become more virulent and unpredictable--perhaps to build a super vaccine that might be needed in the future?"
2021-03-22 21:25,"I must say, this is some of the worst science reporting I've ever seen. Quite the disappointment coming from a source I usually trust and appreciate. Not only is viral caused pyschosic a well known phenomenon in may viral diseases, including influenza, but there is nothing about this guy's story that indicates his symptoms of paranoia were caused by Covid. Like a previous commenter pointed out, do we really think two weeks of isolation in a submarine didn't have anything to do with it??

You're claiming this has been reported in dozens of Covid cases......out of 123 million. People are already afraid of Covid. This psuedo science, fringe case reporting is embarrassing."

2021-03-22 12:38,"""It can be estimated that roughly 10 to 30% of persons with positive PCR test results will still have positive PCR results a month later, especially to the extent that their initial viral inoculum level was high, that they were severely diseased and that they were elderly or immunosuppressed.
In the event of persistently positive PCR more than 3 months after initially positive PCR, in the current state of knowledge re-contamination cannot be excluded as a possibility""

<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532802"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532802</a>/

There are a lot of sources out there that indicate even further duration of positive test results exist and do not incur the patient is infected or infectious.  This is a very common finding. Let's just make sure we are being clear that this finding isn't surprising and does not prove causality that COVID may have been the cause of his symptoms."
2021-03-22 13:27,"Thank you for another interesting podcast. While I certainly believe that Ivan’s psychotic symptoms could be from covid, we cannot assume that with certainty. There is so much fear about the virus and I think this podcast will heighten people’s anxieties. 

As a clinical psychologist, I think it’s important to realize that we know almost nothing about Ivan’s life, family history, etc. You mentioned that he had just spent months in a submarine. How could that experience have affected his mental state?

Again, I am not discounting the possibility that covid caused his psychotic symptoms, but we must not jump to that conclusion. There are too many unknowns about this patient and too many unknowns about the virus."
2021-03-22 14:22,I urge Ivan to seek additional support from a functional medicine practitioner who specializes in mental health. The Institute for Functional Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic can help him find the right doctor who can work in coordination with his medical team to calm down the immune response that is causing the severe inflammation in his brain and body. Best of luck.
2021-03-22 14:39,"I was diagnosed with “an unidentifiable viral bronchitis” in January 2020. The “bronchitis” subsided after various treatments by the end of February, 2020. The extreme fatigue, racing heart, low oxygen saturation, headaches and nausea, etc. continued from 3 days a week in March to once every 3 weeks by October 2020, and continued until my first Covid-19 Moderna vaccination in Jan. 2021. Although no Covid “existed” in the USA in January of 2020, my physicians thought I must have contracted it, maybe during the battle with “viral” bronchitis and didn’t know it, as there was no other explanation for the fatigue, nausea, racing heart and headache during 3 days, after which I felt fine until the next attack. The symptoms have completely disappeared and I feel better, progressively even better, since the second vaccination. Will the 3 days of agony return? Is the disappearance related to the vaccinations? Who knows! But I have had no reoccurrence since five days after my first vaccination. I am definitely a happy camper and true believer in the long haul symptoms disappearing with the vaccinations. I haven’t felt as good as I feel now since January, 2020. Anecdotal information with no real explanation, but my experience reinforces what other long term sufferers have described following getting vaccinated."

2021-03-22 11:47,"This episode created a light bulb effect for me as I had a very similar experience to the one in this story. After traveling home to NY from Peru in January 2020 my mother claims she had the worst flu she’s ever had and claims she had covid before it was really acknowledged in the US. She claims I picked it up in my travels and brought it to her. Although I never had severe symptoms, later that year I too started experiencing severe paranoia where I even began to believe some of my family and friends were trying to steal from me or steal my identity on line and ruin my credit or set me up to cover up some other crimes they were committing. I am also a very rational person and knew my thoughts were irrational but at the same time I was very much tortured by my own thoughts. I hope the vaccine will bring some relief and that doctors learn more about the virus."
2021-03-22 14:40,"Great as always. However, Michael stated that coronavirus has only been around a year which is not accurate. The coronavirus has been around forever. Covid 19 has only been known of for about a year.

2021-03-22 16:44,"My heart goes out to Ivan and his wife Emily and their three children as Ivan struggles with mental health symptoms brought-on by Covid. As Ivan described being plunged into a sudden mental-health crisis, his story felt so familiar to my own experience with postpartum anxiety after the birth of my second child. While my condition was brought-on by an abrupt withdrawal of hormones post-pregnancy, the symptoms we experienced were eerily similar. I wish Ivan well and hope his doctors can continue to provide treatments and relief that Ivan and his family so desperately need."

2021-03-30 10:46,"Thank you for explicitly saying that LW1 demonstrated ""irrational anxieties"" and that, indeed, a person who had not recovered from COVID, was, in theory, a greater risk to them if correct PPE is not used.  The office clearly stated that they used full PPE for treatment.  

LW1 is unable to parse the science, and unable to trust the dentist to do so.  While they didn't need to suggest another office for treatment, I'll bet they are hoping good ol' Jack decides to take the hint.

From the beginning, I was concerned about COVID shaming.  I treat children in a wealthy community, in which gaining 5 pounds or driving a car over 3 years old will subject you to shaming.  Wealth and education are no match for fear."
2021-03-30 11:07,"It is that last sentence in the dentist's letter that really offends me: he has dismissed his patient and her concerns. I would rather have read a sentence inviting the patient to call the dentist to discuss concerns personally, no different from discussing anxiety about dentistry in general, and a task all dentists should be willing to undertake. The dentist could have acknowledged the basis of the patient's fear, and then explained that the recovered hygienist is actually posing a lower risk to patients' health. But the tone of this letter, which is very defensive, suggests that the dentist's tone of voice would be less than reassuring."
2021-03-30 11:25,"How is exploiting a loophole in the vaccination registration process to placing you in front of someone for whom the vaccination was intended not unethical?   ""The first clue should have been my friend in another state made me an appointment..."""
2021-03-30 12:22,"Everyone in the dentist's office should be eligible for vaccination throughout the country. You better believe I am going to ask if the staff has been vaccinated. If the answer is no, I will be looking for another dentist. HIPPA has absolutely NOTHING to do with this question because the dentist is not the hygienist's ""health care provider.""

The dentist sounds like a prig. Assuming other dentists are in the area, I would go elsewhere, like the snarky note says. Who needs to be treated like that by their own dentist?

Just last week I watched my daughter-in-law bury her 74 year old grandmother because someone who knew better could not be bothered to mask up. Although this issue is not about mask usage, the dentist's response would be enough for me to look for services elsewhere. 

If someone cares so little about the health of others as to dismiss the valid concerns expressed, I am not going to give them my business. Ever."
2021-03-30 12:23,"For me, how long ago the hygienist had Covid is relevant.  The LW says the hygienist was treated for Covid, implying that this wasn't a mild case.  If the employee had it six months ago and is completely back to normal, I would be fine with that.  If it's day #15 and the hygienist is still coughing, but ""better"" than yesterday, I wouldn't be thrilled about that situation despite the CDC saying it's okay for the hygienist to be back at work.  The CDC notes that 5% of specimens from people with severe cases have detectable virus 15 days out, although they have not been found that far out for mild cases.

BTW, LW1 is correct that the dental office should not be talking about HIPAA when HIPAA does not cover the employer-employee situation.  That doesn't mean that employee confidentiality shouldn't be respected, but the office shouldn't cite a law that doesn't apply in this case."
2021-03-30 13:13,"I agree with the dentist in LW1 - if the patient doesn't trust the office to take the appropriate precautions regarding a hygienist who has recovered from COVID, there's nothing stopping the LW from finding a new dentist. 

At this point, more than 10% of the US population has been infected with and recovered from COVID. To treat those 30 mil people as if they are still contagious is unreasonable, particularly when all evidence suggests those individuals are significantly LESS likely to transmit the virus. Trust the science works both ways.

This would be a totally different situation if the patient suspected the hygienist had an active COVID infection, but there's nothing here to suggest that is the case or even that the LW is concerned that's the case."
2021-03-30 13:15,"As we know that many people who are infected are asymptomatic and we don't have universal testing which, to be effective, would have to be done repeatedly unless it was positive because whether or not you are infected can change from day to day, the questioner would have no way of knowing if someone had been infected and didn't know it.

The most important thing, as the response states, is whether those in the practice use appropriate PPE.  If not, that would be a reason to seek another dentist as one would wonder how carefully the practice followed other  health safety guidelines unrelated to Covid.  There are many other infectious diseases that dentists and there assistants can transmit if they are not scrupulous about preventing this."
2021-03-30 13:25,"By the way, the practice could have simply lied and said that that person hadn't been infected (if she had).  That it responded responsibly indicates it did care.

I doubt there was anything else that the practice could have said to put the person's mind at ease.  As we've seen with the many people who have expressed unfounded concerns about the vaccines including the one that the vaccines can actually give you Covid, which, by the way, has been repeated by anti-vaxxers about virtually every other vaccine, there are people who believe what they want to believe."
2021-03-30 13:58,"As for the person going to the dentist.. life is full of risks.  During this time of COVID, she knew she was taking a risk by stepping outside her door.  By going into a dentist's office.  Does she expect to be informed, or to somehow know, of every person she comes into contact with, and who may or may not  have 'had' COVID?  Also, she as the patient (with her mouth wide open at the dentist) is putting the other (masked) people at the dentist's office into far more danger,  than vice versa."
2021-03-30 14:17,"HIPAA and other federal laws provide Patient Rights & Responsibilities, the first one being ""the right to respectful treatment by a competent provider"" along w/""informed consent"" for any procedure. A copy of a provider's specific policies is required to be posted in the office & provided to every patient.

Jack didn't express ""irrational anxiety"" given that 5 family members had Covid, including one who died. He made a simple request. Based on a simple answer, he would make a decision as to whether to make an appointment w/this provider.

He received an officious, partially correct, shaming response (no doubt written by an office worker rather than the DDS). The safety precautions should've already been posted on the practice website, in the office, or provided by the scheduler w/o reference to anyone's Covid history. I doubt he needed the suggestion to go elsewhere; he could easily decide this wasn't a practice that was ""respectful"" to patients - especially those designated as high risk for Covid by virtue of Jack's age."
2021-03-30 14:35,"Thank you, Mr. Appiah, for your thoughtful and fact-based responses to these very timely questions, especially with regard to the dental office. As you note, ""Dentists...should understand [that] one element of good medicine is an understanding heart."" I do feel that the writer might have felt more reassured had the email from the office directly addressed his understandable anxiety: ""Thank you for expressing your concern about how our office is addressing the safety of our patients and our staff during these perilous times. Please know that we are dong all we can to meet and exceed guidelines to prevent infection for your protection as well for our own."" 

As a pediatrician, I frequently get asked about the safety of vaccines in general. I realized long ago that when a parent asks this questions, they stem, not from intellectual curiosity, but from emotion, from love for their child and fear for their safety. As such, responding with statistics and policies shuts down communication whereas opening with a statement that validates these emotions - ""Yes, I've heard these things too. They are very frightening, and I can see how much you love your child."" - allows me to more successfully move to a place of agreement and partnership. - ""I want the same things for her that you do, to be safe and healthy. May I share a few things with you?""  This dental office might do well to approach this in a similar way without, as you note, that final self-pitying comment."
2021-03-30 14:39,"The opposite side here - I had Covid in January and since have been to many doctor offices, specialists offices, the ER, eye doctor and it aggravates me when a medical office worker falls apart when I answer ‘Yes I have had Covid.’  It has happened twice including this week.  It’s ridiculous - it reminds me of people being secretive about cancer in the 1960s.  The medical personnel who treat me - now clearly not sick with Covid but a long hauler - with acceptance are knowledgeable and what I expect.  A long hauler with an eye condition, nothing visible."
2021-03-30 14:49,"The tone of the letter from the dentist's office was unnecessarily snippy and certainly not thoughtful or diplomatic.  

Why didn't the person who wrote the letter to the patient explain what the author of this column said and educate the patient that those who tested positive and recovered are less likely to transmit the virus?

It would have been better to delete that last sentence and invite the patient to call the office to discuss concerns. If the patient still feels uncomfortable and decides to leave this practice or ""take a break"" from dental services until covid subsides that is another option."
2021-03-30 15:35,"Two small edits would make the letter from the dentist completely acceptable. Lead with ""We understand and share your concerns about health and safety measures, and we follow all C.D.C. guidelines to protect the health of our patients and staff."" Skip to ""C.D.C. guidelines state..."" and continue to ""...everyone that comes into our suite."" Conclude with ""If you have any further concerns, please contact our office. We are happy to discuss our safety measures with you in more detail, or reschedule your appointment until you and/or our staff have had the opportunity to be vaccinated, if you prefer."" There's no need to talk about HIPPA at all. The letter makes it sound like they are really hoping this patient will leave their practice. I would have thought any health services office would be trying to hang on to as many patients as possible right now. Maybe it would be a good idea to look for a new dentist in case this one is having staffing problems and can't reasonably meet the needs of all existing clients."
2021-03-30 16:44,"My dentist, my eye doctor, and my internist have all asked me to fill out forms about my exposure to Covid-19, taken my temperature upon entering their respective offices, and stated that I could be turned away if I ""failed"" their screening tests. Not to mention that I was advised to cancel if I had any symptoms. All this took place ""in public,"" i.e., in the presence of other patients.  How can they equate this with not letting me know if one of their personnel has been ill and assigning me to another person?"
2021-03-30 17:06,"As a physician, I strongly believe we should do whatever is possible within reason to make a patient comfortable, especially if it does not endanger them, even if we may not rationally understand all their fears. Hence, especially if there were 3 or more dental assistants, I would just have the one of the 2 without COVID-19+ treat him. With 3, he can't identify for sure who is COVID+ so confidentiality is still maintained. As I get older, I find a lot of professionals do things out of authority/ ego, etc. when in the end, it's really to me about serving and making the patient comfortable.

If the patient were my mother - she sometimes has anxiety about COVID-19 beyond the facts - I would advise him to seek another office. One that is competent AND also makes him feel comfortable. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

For LW#3, I agree with Dr. Appiah but for me, ""how someone does something is how they do everything."" So if they cheat, steal, lie, take advantage, etc. in one circumstance, I don't assume they'll do better in another. Travelling for non-necessary reasons during a pandemic can be interpreted as not caring about other people's health and lives."
2021-03-30 19:02,The dentist query begs the question of why would the dentist allow a worker to work with patients without having received the vaccine. I would change clinics.
2021-03-30 19:29,"The dentist may have been right scientifically, but they were rude and lacking in empathy. Maybe the dentist is feeling stressed, a gross under-exaggeration for the state of most health care workers these days. But ""Your request to not be seen by someone who tested Covid-19 positive was not appropriate."" The office ""may not be a good fit..."" Whatever happened to bedside (chairside?) manner? If someone is intelligent enough to offer scientific reasoning to the patient as to why their fears may be unfounded, then they should also have more experience in easing patient anxieties, particularly in a dental office, where a number of adults had other fears (like of drills and pain) in pre-Covid times. Hopefully LW1 can just drop this place and find a more welcoming office. And while I appreciate Appiah's advice I would not label the LW's fears as ""irrational."""
2021-03-30 10:44,What will people fret about once we all get vaccinated?
2021-03-30 14:08,“Your question was not appropriate” ?  Find a dentist capable of writing things with a touch of politeness.

2021-03-30 18:23,"For LW #1, a third party told the writer that the Hygienist had COVID?  Why are people going around talking about another's health and whether or not they have been ill?  How do you know it's true and how would you feel about others you may or may not know discussing your personal health?
Even as a manager/employer, I am not entitled to know what my team members may be ill with, just that they are unwell and that there is medical information to support their absence.  I am also not entitled to tell others why a team member is away without their permission.  So if I had a team member who was off due to cancer treatment, all I can tell the rest of the team is that person will be off for an extended period unless they give me permission to share why they are off."
2021-03-30 18:54,Jack -- Postpone your cleaning until after you are fully vaccinated. You are eligible in every state and clever enough to either get an appointment for vaccination or find resources that can schedule your shot.
2021-03-30 10:39,"Why would you be concerned about someone who has recovered from COVID-19? As reinfection rates are low your chance of being infected, especially with the standard anti-infection protocols practiced in the dental office, by that hygienist are nil.
You are reacting from fear and lack of knowledge.
Don't call out your dentist, or hygienist, for doing what is proper and safe for both the patient and members of the dental team because you failed to educate yourself."
2021-03-30 11:50,"As far as the person who believes people who had Covid should wear big signs around their necks or a scarlet letter, the answer is a big, fat no.  However, you should have disclosed that your family has been a hotbed for the coronavirus and produced a clean Covid test prior to going to the dentist, so they could decide whether you were putting their office at risk.

In other words, you cannot discriminate against people who had the virus and recovered. They had to have clean tests before returning to work.  Who is the person gossiping about employees' health?

As far as the ambulance driver, get the vaccine now, so after the semester, when you return to work, you'll be protected and ready to get back to work protected.  Good luck and thank you for your service on the ambulance!"
2021-03-30 12:33,"I recently learned that my facialist got sick with covid a few days after giving me a facial.  She wore a mask throughout the treatment.  I did not catch the virus.
Hygienist wear masks, in which case you should be safe."
2021-03-30 12:37,"Once again someone being legitimately offered a vaccine is deciding they're too good and holy to take the darn thing because they know better and if they ran the universe they'd organize the whole process differently, with more and more detailed agonizing with each questions.  Nobody is going to save yours and beat the bushes for someone who needs it 17% more than you do. If they've got leftovers it will go to whoever is handy...happened to my daughter, someone at the student health services stuck their head out the door and started pulling in people off the street.

Just go already so we can get this over with, please."
2021-03-30 13:19,"If my dentist made that ""nasty"" comment about finding someone else I certainly would never ever see that dentist again. That was beyond rude and threatening. There are lots of dentist and most need patients now.
Every medical  practice loves to use   HIPPA when they don't want to disclose information. A friend is a  HIPPA  lawyer and tells me this is not under HIPPIA  as this dentist was not the hygienist provider. HIPPA does not mean not disclosing information it's about controlling that information.  HIPPA is an economic nightmare with zero value in protecting privacy. People you have no medical privacy, none.
Protect yourself as the CDC information is  making a best guess as the science  has not been done, can't be done. We do not have research on theses issues and we do not KNOW everything  about  how this virus is spread.
Why get your teeth cleaned now, why take any unnecessary risk?"
2021-03-30 14:37,"Letter 1 reminds me somewhat of the hysteria at the onset of the AIDS epidemic, when simply being around (or treated by) someone was was gay meant that ""you could get AIDS"". Yes, perhaps the parallel seems strained, but is it that far off when someone who had COVID but fully recovered and was no longer symptomatic following the standard guidelines, still is perceived by the patient as an on-going threat?  Even someone who was vaccinated may, in theory, still be able to pass on COVID if they are re-exposed (they might not get sick but they could pass it on).  Are we down to the Medieval point of walking about yelling ""unclean""?  And remember, the ""information"" the writer has ""was told by a third party!

I'm sure I will be excoriated by some for being insensitive to the elderly letter writer, but acknowledging his concerns does not mean that we must alter medically established policies and privacy of others simply to please that one patient.  However ill-put, the end advise remains the best - go somewhere else."
2021-03-30 14:42,"For LW #1:  It's worth pointing out that the inquiry commences with the letter writer ""being told by a third party..."".  This sounds a lot like gossip.  Is this supposed to be convince anyone that the inquiry has substance?  

For a query like this, try substituting the word ""flu"" for ""Covid"".   Does it convey a common sense inquiry?  Or one tinged with fear-based irrationality?  Very likely the latter.  The dentist's reply was completely correct, though a bit lacking in compassion.  

As illustrated in this letter, the Covid-phobia is becoming insufferable."
2021-03-30 19:02,"The only thing at all I would add to the response to Mr Schwartz is that if you had been under the care of that dental hygienist at the time she  tested positive, then you have a right to be notified, not of  the identity , but of the exposure, so that you can seek a test, and quarantine."
2021-03-30 19:20,"College Student/EMT
Get vaccinated as soon as you can. You aren't taking someone else's place in line. You will prevent infection in people you don't even know. 
It's wonderful that we prioritized many vulnerable members of our community.  But vaccinating my 91 year old mother would only protect her.  She doesn't go anywhere near anyone to whom she would spread it. You getting vaccinated protects you, your family, your friends, classmates, and members of their bubbles.  
Incidentally, Covid tore through my family just a month ago, including my 91 year old mother.  She's now ineligible for another 2 months. But all over the world the disease is still spreading because so many young people remain unvaccinated.  Get your shot. You are saving more than just your own life."
2021-03-30 10:51,"What you don't know can harm you. If I suspected a health provider had contracted corona virus, I would avoid that person and that practice for several months even if I had been vaccinated. Discretion is the better part of valor, especially if one is older."
2021-03-30 11:58,I think you need a new dentist.  I would have no confidence in that person's judgment.  I switched to a periodontist a few years ago based on some questionable decisions about the former office.  Best thing I ever did.  Take your money and walk.
2021-03-30 14:22,"At vaccination sites run by NYC DOHMH people ARE asked to prove NYS residency when they arrive for their appointments.

2021-03-30 20:24,"That dentist office sounds like a nightmare. Under normal circumstances I would agree that an employee’s privacy should be protected. But when we’re talking about highly communicable and infectious diseases like TB and this novel pandemic, then I think clients gave a right to know, especially in a medical setting where bodily fluids and close proximity are part of the equation."
2021-03-30 21:39,"I chose to leave a dentist who charged a fee for PPE last year, and didn't have great answers when I asked if they were also separately billing my insurance for PPE, since most insurers very quickly allowed billing codes for PPE. Given the absurd cost of dental care, adding charges for PPE (when dentists, above all other providers, already used many forms of PPE due to the nature of their work). 

I found another great dentist who doesn't charge separately for PPE. If my dentist sent me as rude of a response at the letter writer, I'd stop going there."
2021-03-30 22:32,"My former dentist literally asked me to leave his office when I told him I had Covid six full months earlier. I told him because I am a long hauler and my teeth were incredibly sensitive.

What I learned is that a dental practice is a business. If you do not like the way they handle the pandemic and understand the science, change offices. 

I found a terrific new dentist, who I never would have otherwise found, who was not only understanding, but really gentle and kind."
2021-03-31 0:22,"My issue with going to the dentist wasn't the staff but the patient in the next room having his teeth cleaned or ground down.  They're obviously not wearing PPE.  18 days after my second shot I went to my dentist and their idea of ventilation was a fan in the window of each room.  As a practical matter, it was probably the best that they could do but I think I made the right decision to stay away, especially as it turned out my hygienist, like a lot of people around here, hasn't taken the vaccine and doesn't intend to, and used only a surgical mask.    My teeth were fine, only a bit of tartar needed to be cleaned away."
2021-03-30 23:29,"I had outpatient surgery at a local university hospital in December. They told me they'd put my mask back on me in the OR. They didn't but it took me a while to realize that. In the mean time in post op 3 nurses, including the one taking care of me, were not wearing masks. The hospital refused to let me know if anyone in post op tested pos for covid during the time period it would have affected me. I wasn't asking if the person taking care of me did as I knew they wouldn't tell me that, just in general if anyone working that day did. In my opinion, under the circumstances of COVID that is just wrong."
2021-03-31 0:03,"I think a new dentist is in order, not because your previous dentist wants to keep confidential information confidential, but because of how snippy that response was. 

The dentist could have accomplished the same thing while acknowledging the legitimacy of your concerns and reassuring you that all appropriate measures were being taken. Your dentist decided to criticize your request as ""not appropriate"" and encouraged you to find a different provider. 

I think you should find a different provider who isn't a jerk."

Notwithstanding everything the Ethicist says, correctly, and call Jack's anxiety ""irrational,"" what is in Jack's head is in his head. Jack should indeed find another dental office and specify at the outset that he does not want to be treated by anyone who has had Covid. Basically, the Ethicist's advice is ""Trust the science."" Yeah, right."
2021-03-30 23:55,"Whether the LW's dental office puts her at risk or not, she was basically asked to find another dentist in the last sentence of that letter. Who would write something like that to a person seeking reasonable answers?"
2021-03-31 0:03,"What I would want to know in the case of the hygienist would be how that person's ""recovered"" status was determined. Did that person simply declare themselves recovered? Did they return a negative test? People come to work sick all the time for financial and other reasons--there are powerful incentives to be less than fully honest about one's health, so I don't think the letter-writer is crazy to be concerned about close contact with someone who was recently ill."
2021-03-31 0:17,"LW1. We routinely castigate those who will not wear masks as ignoring science, so the Dentist is entirely within reason to stick to the facts.

2021-03-31 0:52,"I am also in my late 60's and was called by my dentist 2 days after seeing her in her office that has multiple dentists and hygienists. She told me that someone in the office that day had tested positive for Covid. I innocently asked was that person there when I was there. She could not tell me. I was not asking for names, all I wanted to know was what my exposure was. 
No way. Thanks for nothing."
2021-03-31 3:19,Unless it is an dental emergency you should not be going to a dentist at all during the Covid epidemic.  Close extended contact to your entire face with instruments going in and out.   Risky for Covid and not worth it even if the workers are masked.  Masks are really important but they are not magic either.  My very elderly father with no vaccine shots wanted to go for a dental cleaning a few months ago.
2021-03-31 12:42,"Every Dr. / medical officer I have visited asks for information about my travels, current health, contacts etc. So I ask the office the same kind of questions before confirming an appointment. If the office is reluctant or refuses to answer .. so be it. I go elsewhere."
2021-03-31 12:48,I am temporarily living in a state which has been fast to open groups for inoculations ( republican state where a lot of people are refusing to get it). As I am able to avoid most situations where I’m exposed I hesitated to get it but in the end even my 20’s daughter with not severe asthma got the shot. I still feel a little guilty - but the non stop texts I get telling me that appointments are still available has alleviated all thoughts that I took someone’s place in line.
2021-03-31 13:01,"According to the articles I’ve been reading the last few days, the dentist’s reliance on the C.D.C. 14-day quarantine for safety is still unknown.  The most recent reports acknowledge that it is not known whether people who receive the vaccine can still carry and transmit the disease, it is not known whether protection against one variant of Covid provides protection against the other variants, and it is not known whether people who are symptom-free for months and then begin to develop symptoms can transmit the disease during the months-long period when they were symptom-free."
2021-03-31 14:29,"As a Primary Care Provider, I can assure the writer that the dentist is at as much risk of contracting the virus through contact with your mouth than vice-versa.  To Mr Appiah, I can also add that the past year has been extremely difficult for providers as well as patients,  which also should have been mentioned in your response.  I agree, it would have been more gracious to say, ""We hope with this information, you will continue to choose our practice for your dental care.""  But I can tell you that we have long queues of anxious, depressed patients who are now coming to us in droves; it is also a very stressful situation for us, who also may have children at home who are impacted by the last year of shelter in place."
2021-03-31 15:22,"It's one thing for a dentist to say that they cannot or will not comply with a request.  But to say that that request was ""not appropriate"" is tantamount to saying ""you're crazy to even ask,"" which is just false.

We're a year into a pandemic and every authoritative source of public health information has stressed -- repeatedly -- that our knowledge of this disease is imperfect.  We do the best we can with the knowledge we have and manage risks with measures that we believe (with significant error bars and uncertainly) will mitigate the risks of infection.  If a patient wants to be more cautious, that's their decision, and the dentist can hardly claim to be certain that they're wrong.

It's also pretty rich to see a dentist claim to be a font of scientific knowledge, given the dental community's lackluster support of evidence based medicine and the lack of rigorous testing of widely used treatment protocols (How many patients actually need braces for medical rather than cosmetic reasons? Good question)."
2021-03-31 15:24,"Covid-19 vaccine policy all has to do with the goals. To prevent deaths, the wisest thing is do it by age. Start with the 100 year olds, then the 99 year olds, then the 98s, and so forth. To prevent asymptomatic or mild cases in people that could be transmitted to become more asymptomatic or mild cases to their peers, or an occasional bad case (but probably not death if the transmitted-to person is under 55, and almost certainly not if under 35), come up with some complicated and unfair scheme that everyone will try to game. Like the one we have."
2021-03-31 16:13,"I am very fortunate to have a dentist who has been extremely concerned about keeping patients safe and update on what's going on in her office. I can't imagine that she would ever send out a letter like this. However, I actually side with the dentist here. If what the woman had heard was actually true, I don't think the dentist was under any obligation who the hygienist was who got Covid. Obviously she was no longer contagious or the dentist wouldn't have had her come back to work, nor would the hygienist want to come back to infect other people. It was insulting of the patient to imply that the doctor would allow this. 

Also people who have had Covid also have antibodies against the disease at least for awhile. The patient would have been just as likely to be infected by an asymptomatic person who was working at the office. I doubt if any medical or dental office does Covid tests everyday. I think that there has to be a certain amount of trust in the doctor/patient relationship. If the patient had so little trust that the dentist was doing all he could to keep his patients safe, he was correct to tell her that  possibly his office was not a good fit."
2021-03-31 17:14,"The dentist's email was itself ""inappropriate;"" the patient's anxieties are NEVER ""inappropriate.""  That's like informing a patient in pain that his discomfort is ""inappropriate.""  

This patient's anxiety in this situation is very appropriate.  We've all been told relentlessly, and at short intervals, over the last year that there is a lot we don't know, and that don't-know stuff covers such issues as, ""how long is a recovered patient still contagious?""  ""Can a recovered person get the infection twice?""  The CDC has waffled disastrously around the topic of masks and their effectiveness.  First we're told that non-medical people don't need them; then it turns out we can't go outdoors, even in an isolated location, all alone on the beach, without one; then we learn that medical-grade masks are unobtainable; then intricate analyses of the various kinds of masks we can get are done, to inform us that not just any mask works; now they want us all going around with TWO masks at the same time, advice that deserves to be ignored imho.  (Can a demand that we wear 3 be far behind?)

A patient worried about all this should not be treated like this patient was treated.  Patient anxiety, like patient pain, should be addressed promptly and appropriately.  And compassionately.  Given the situation, this patient's anxiety is well taken.

The advice to leave that dental practice was good advice.  Take it."

2021-03-31 14:15,"I disagree with the Ethicist  regarding the person who
has an appointment to be vaccinated in another state.
No, that individual can not ""proceed with an easy conscience.""

Both the Ethicist and the individual who plans to jump states to obtain a vaccine know that states are allocated a finite number of vaccines which  are meant for residents of that state,  and in the case of some states,   are meant for those who reside or work in that state.

There has been considerable news coverage regarding those who have  jumped the vaccine line by jumping states.


The individual who plans to jump states could   have contacted the government of the state  in which  this individual plans to be
vaccinated,  instead of writing to The Ethicist. The state-jumper did not do so because he or she KNOWS the answer that he/she does not want to hear.  He /She knows that he /she  is TAKING a vaccine away  from someone who lives  in the other state.

This is a matter of life and death, which both questioner and Ethicist know.

The unethical response of the Ethicist is more unethical than the questioner's unethical intent, for the Ethicist has given the green light to jump the vaccine light to  millions of NYT  readers.

Across the board,  Mr. Appiah is the most unethical ""Ethicist"" of all the NYT  ""Ethicists"" who preceded him.

Shame on Mr. Appiah for telling millions  of NYT readers that it is ethical to jump the vaccine line by jumping states."

If you can get a shot at a shot, take it. The faster everyone gets jabbed, the faster we are more likely to see our way out of this morass.

Don's stand on ceremony, wringing your hands and saying there are people more deserving than I am by whatever metric. Take the shot. For every one of you who stands back, there are 10 who have no qualms about rushing in to take your place.

As far as the person who is hesitant to recommend the errant skier for a position that's 100% remote work, what's wrong with you? Jealous? Did he kick your dog? Throw up on the sofa?

Because they went off skiing and flew on a plane to get to the destination has nothing to do with judgment that would have any effect on professional situations. You can't say, 'well he did A, so when B come up, he will do this bad thing all over again.' You have no real idea of the circumstances of the ski trip or what it took for him to get there or what happened once he did. 

If anyone is grossly judgmental, it's you (and me, too, when it comes down to it). It's a job, not the Nobel Peace Prize."

I agree with NW when NW says, ""My concern is . . .  that his recent travel indicates poor judgment.""

2021-04-01 7:06,"I picked up covid19 in a medical facility as a patient for another reason in August but was not hospitalized. Prior to that and afterward I wore masks in public and observed social distancing. During my illness sheltering at home, my daughter left food for me on my porch. It was no picnic. The county health department monitored my progress by phone while I was ill. Once cleared by the same, my life resumed as before. However, I learned quickly to not say I had covid19. People got really weird as if I were still contagious and trying to infect them, even now. Getting my first vaccination I was informed by the medical staff that, since I had been sick with covid19, my first vaccination would be like a second. My second vaccination is tomorrow and supposedly will be as if I had a third. I am fortunate and safer to be around than many others, am still considered a pariah by some. Some I used to call friend I now realize aren't. Be considerate of others and thankful to be well."
2021-04-01 22:41,"I live on the South Carolina coast.
I am fairly certain neither my GP or dentist (both of 17 years), have gotten or will get vaccinated for COVID due to their political ideologies. 
I would like to see an in-depth investigation into this problem as I believe this is happening all across the country.
Problem is- I don’t think medical professionals will admit their refusal of the vaccine.
So where does that leave the rest of us who are trying to do the right thing for our communities? We live in a small town, so we are very limited in our choices for a new doctor or dentist.
If the current administration were to mandate proof of vaccination, I fear (yes, actually fear!), the blowback from those who simply will not get a vaccination. I believe they would see it as an infringement on their right to privacy. Not to mention the plethora of conspiracy theories that will claim absolute proof of vaccination is a way to control their minds. As ridiculous as that is- It is a very real thing that tens of millions of Americans actually believe."
2021-03-31 2:59,The dentist most definitely should have told you.  Those who test positive need to be required to wear some sort of identification.  The public must be made aware.
2021-04-02 1:32,"The writer with dental concerns struck a nerve. I am an 82 year old grandmother and am fully vaccinated. My daughter and grandson use the same dentist. They went for a cleaning about  a month ago. She reported to me that her hygienist, a 20 something, told my daughter that she had not been vaccinated and that she wasnt sure she believed in vaccines! I was horrified! I thought all health care workers were required to get vaccinated. I have my appointment coming up but I sure don’t want to be face to face with an unvaccinated hygienist. NJ has highest per capita infection rate in the country. I love my dentist but it seems so irresponsible to have this hygienist  on his staff."
2021-03-30 12:32,"Originally I could see some valid concerns on the part of the dentist who owns the shop but when I read that the hygienist would wear an N95 mask all of the patient's concerns went to the forefront.  I constantly see photos of people wearing N95 masks with exhalation valves as if they serve any possible protection against transmission from the wearer to a nearby person.

Those valved masks are for construction wearers and provide protection in one direction only.  The valve is designed to open on exhalation so they provide no protection for someone nearby.

Even that could be dismissed except in the US somehow an anti-mask argument has evolved where the words of an edict issued by someone who politically may be against wearing a mask may have the effect of law.  In other words a mask that provides no protection for others can classified as a mask that protects others in an anti-mask state.

Since we have to do better for people than trust politicians with a bizarre political stake in this issue the Dentist's office will have to shoulder that burden."
2021-04-03 11:56,"It strikes me that those writing comments defending the behavior of this practitioner and staff are likely related in some way to the medical profession and who might be concerned that their practice or livelihoods have been or will be adversely impacted by the pandemic.

If it is to be, it's up to me."
2021-04-03 12:28,"The inquiry states that the patient contacted the dentist with a request that a particular hygienist not be assigned to him.  That request could have simply have been honored with no judgments or other verbiage from the dentist.  

On the issue of disclosure, did the dentist have an ethical duty to disclose to patients that someone in the office had tested positive for Covid (and then relate what precautions were being taken)?  IMO, the answer is clearly yes.  
Whether that ethical duty conformed or conflicted with his legal duty regarding disclosure or dissemination of this information and, if the latter, how to properly resolve the conflict, is the difficult unanswered question."
2021-04-03 13:12,"In the high-rise, 400+ unit apartment building where I live, whenever a staff member or resident comes down with COVID, the management notifies the whole community via email -- not revealing the afflicted person's identity, but basically to reinforce prudent masking / distancing / hand-squirt protocols in elevators and common areas. 

The notifications violated no HIPPA rules and I would rather know than guess whether the infection is present in our building. I appreciate being informed.

Should a dentist's office be so different?"
2021-04-03 13:16,"Once again, science is being challenged by political beliefs and well intentioned non-scientifically backed beliefs. There is no medical or public health reason to reveal or shun those with resolved Covid infection. And despite the American quest for freedom to be contrary, all health care workers should’ve required to be vaccinated against Covid just as they are required to have other vaccines for protection of patients."
2021-04-03 13:29,"I always enjoy this series and think most of the responses are sound (although I do not always agree with them I enjoy the thought process). But this question on Covid is of another order. 1) How about the Practice sending out a letter to its clients saying a staff member has contracted Corona, has recovered, has quarantined for xx # of days. But in concern for patient safety, erring on the side of caution the staff member is now assigned to non-treatment duties for 3 more months. 2) There are people who are ""long term"" Covid sufferers (lots of articles in the NYT) where the disease drags on (how does one know this person is not in this category). In this case I don't think The Ethicist was considering all sides of the issue. I wouldn't want to be treated directly by a healthcare worker who had had Covid (if I knew). In any case, I think disclosure is important."
2021-04-03 14:12,"The first letter writer's request is completely inappropriate. It is not acceptable for a patient to request private health information, and the dentist was right to refuse the request.

The request is also irrelevant. Whether the provider has had COVID-19 does not reflect whether he/she is infectious. In fact, most transmission to others occurs before the diagnosis has been made/confirmed.

I fail to see how knowing if the hygienist has had COVID helps the patient to make an informed decision. If the patient is this concerned that standard PPE and precautions are not adequate, then he should consider delaying the visit. Dental cleaning is not emergent."
2021-04-03 14:52,"I am a health care provider and subscribe to many professional ListServs and other types of public forum.  Our professional association has counselled that it is in violation of HIPAA to reveal health information of any kind regarding the staff in a medical office.  This would include recent infections, vaccination status, etc.  Health care providers are also refusing to see patients who refuse to wear a mask or have their temperature taken upon entry to the office.  Some of my colleagues have reported patients deliberately coughing or spitting on them.  This has been a rough year for us all, no matter whether you are the health care provider or the patient.  If you have doubts or concerns I suggest it is best to postpone care that is truly not essential to keeping you alive.  I myself have not tested positive and have been fully vaccinated."
2021-04-03 15:06,It is my view that every patient of this dentist who was exposed to COVID 19 by his hygienist has the right to be informed.  In fact the dentist in question has a moral and ethical obligation to do so.  Patient health takes precedent over employee privacy!
2021-04-03 15:24,"Just want to put in a word for dentists and health providers who have been so very vulnerable through this whole long pandemic, and who have kept their offices open to serve ailing people - despite the constant fear of close exposure to a disease that can be transmitted without symptoms, and the sometimes extreme economic difficulties due to the downturn in patients.  While a snippy tone is less than kind to an anxious patient, it's also likely the expression of months of frustration and difficulty, weariness and worry.  Health providers are people, too, with their own anxieties, and their own triggers. Maybe not being trusted to take good care of their patient, after months of being trustworthy and struggling to protect themselves and provide good dental care, was just a last straw for them.  Kindness is needed by everyone!"
2021-04-03 15:44,"Interestingly, no mention is made of that “third party” who shared a rumor that someone else had recovered from COVID. I wasn’t in that conversation, so I don’t know how it came up. There does not appear to have been any actual danger, yet the knowledge was distressing to the letter writer.

I can understand why people have been sharing information more than we normally would. We’re still in emergency mode and trying to make sense of what we’ve all been going through. But part of a return to normal life will be getting some control of this type of gossip. Be sure you have the person’s permission before sharing information about their health. If you hear something, think first before passing it along.

We’re surrounded by people who have been infected with this virus. Many were not tested, and may not even have been aware of it themselves. We won’t ever have complete knowledge who did and didn’t have the virus, and somehow, we have to live with that. Continuing to take precautions is wise, but discrimination against the previously infected (the scarlet C) does not make anyone safer."
2021-04-03 16:41,"A hygienist uses tools which can cause mild bleeding from gums, especially  if the patient has periodontal  issues as I do. I have heart issues which have been treated including an aortic valve replacement, and must take a massive dose of amoxylicin an hour before each hygiene appointment. Because of that both my oral and heart health are doing fine. The receptionist's explanation that anyone who's had COVID-19 and been showing negative tests for 10 days is fine to be around people. There's a huge difference between that and having a potentially invasive procedure with the individual's hand in a patient's mouth using very sharp instruments. My dentist has ways of communicating the appropriate safety measures as if everyone was recently recovered. That violates no one's privacy while assuring patients they have the right dentist who is taking the right steps. If the receptionist's comments and explanation represents policy at this practice all the patients need a new dentist. If not the office needs to close for a day for proper training in how to communicate the actual procedures to patients for all staff who have patient contact. I have morbidly issues in all 6 categories but have still kept all appointments  for needed dental treatment because my dentist's procedures have been reviewed by my doctors and found to be excellent."
2021-04-03 17:45,"While the dentist may have been technically and scientifically correct with regard to COVID - and legally correct with regard to HIPAA laws - the dentist fails the EQ and empathy tests. And, after reading the final sentence, I'd find another dentist, not just for this particular question, but for what can be expected from them in the future."
2021-04-03 12:36,"I would hazard a guess that the 1st letter writer was rude and aggressive in demanding to know which hygienist had recovered from COVID and THAT'S why the dentist included that last line. If the letter writer had made a polite request, it seems unlikely that the dentist would have responded that way. If the letter writer was indeed rude, the response from the dentist was entirely appropriate. The dentist has a moral obligation to protect their staff from abusive patients and is quite right to do so. My presumption at the letter writer's rudeness is based on the fact that the fear and entitlement expressed are so completely irrational that it follows that they made the request in an equally irrational manner."
2021-04-03 13:35,"“Possibly, though, I wouldn’t have added that slightly barbed final comment (“If this policy makes you uncomfortable, our office may not be a good fit for you”). Dentists, of all people, should understand the power and prevalence of irrational anxieties, and one element of good medicine is an understanding heart.”

￼I disagree. Understanding “irrational anxieties” and catering to them are two different matters. The dentist’s office took the time to give the patient a detailed explanation of its compliance with all Covid protocols. In my opinion, that showed not only “an understanding ￼heart”, but, importantly for a medical office, a fact and science-based policy. After that it is up to the patient to decide whether they are a good fit with the dentist’s office￼."
2021-04-03 16:53,"In response to letter writer #1, the author states: 
""As it happens, people who have recovered from Covid-19 are thought to have immunity to it for some time, and people who have immunity to the virus are less likely to transmit it.""

This is a vague statement. Who thinks that? That people recovering from Covid-19 a) have immunity and b) are less likely to transmit it?

I believe that these matters are open to discussion every day and are not established as facts. No one really knows if that is true or not, in my understanding. Every day there are reports that having Covid-19 may not bring immunity and that people who are  recovering can have the virus again. 

Using the passive voice (i.e,,"".,.people...are thought to..."") lets the author off the hook. Who thinks that?"
2021-04-03 19:24,"What is really important is for the dentist to explain clearly what procedures are/were followed by the business to test all others who work there, deep clean the office, and notify patients of any potential exposure. That does not require identification of the person who was sick. Anything less is both unprofessional and EQ deficient, and something that would definitely convince me to find a new dentist -- even without the rude closing sentence."
2021-04-03 12:41,Change dentists - the barbed comment at the end of the communication is inappropriate.  You can get the same result and not insult your clients.  Grade: F.
2021-04-03 13:12,"LW1 is sadly misinformed. the hygienist recovered from covid is highly unlikely to transmit it. his concern is absurdly misplaced. more likely to get it from an asymptomatic carrier.  and the staff use PPE. 
bravo to the dental office for taking appropriate precautions and not giving in to a misinformed request."
2021-04-03 15:15,"It appears to me our beloved Ethicist today is rendering medical opinions rather than perspectives on pure ethics. HIPPA privacy obligations were created before the emergence of Covid, and they don’t reflect the particular dynamics of the coronavirus. I think every patient has the right to know the status of whomever it is that might infect them. There’s not one universal source of information about the spread of this virus, and in fact the WHO and CDC have been criticized for giving conflicting accounts about the dynamics of transmission. So, it’s every man or woman for him or her self in this battle to survive. This patient’s request for information was entirely proper, and the indignant tone of the dentist in responding alone would inspire me to never go there again.￼￼￼"

here I disagree, I've worked with people who were not well regarded by their subordinates.  when I joined up, I was told by an old hand to look out for how someone treats their wife / partner / child, is how they will treat their subordinates, and to be careful taking life risks if they were your only saviour.

Change  ""If this policy makes you uncomfortable, our office may not be a good fit for you.""  to  ""This office meets or exceeds all CDC guidelines and standards of care for a dental practice in this current stressful environment.  We hope you continue as a valued patient.""

Note:  I am not a professional editor, and I tried this at home."
2021-04-03 19:48,The response from the dentist was so rational and reasonable it strikes me they are obviously not American.
2021-04-03 13:16,"Why not just let the patient decide which hygienist to see? It doesn’t have to involve COVID, HIPPA, or snarky responses."
2021-04-03 11:58,"I like my dentist. Solo practitioner in my neighborhood. Never upcharges for unneeded services. I last saw him in early March 2020. Our encounter was an infectious disease epidemiologist's nightmare: 

Dentist [with his hands in my mouth]: So, what do you think about Coronavirus?
Me: [mrphgm]
Dentist: It looks like it's pretty well controlled in the U.S. [in March *2020*].
Me: [ngrm!]
D: I guess it's really just like a mild flu.
Me: [nnrr!!]
D: We'll have a vaccine by summer [2020].
Me: [silently screaming, ""Nooooooooooooo!!!""]

Now a year later, I'm two weeks out from my second mRNA vaccine and ready to have my teeth cleaned again!"
2021-04-03 15:45,"Re the dentist's barbed comment, I had the same reaction. Who would want to go to a dentist who has played the shame game? Given her family history with COVID 19, I'm very sympathetic.  The problem is if she goes to another dentist, she may know even less about the hygienists. I would (I really would) ask the dentist for an apology for that remark. If he does, it's a level field again and you can decide what to do from that better place."
2021-04-03 13:18,LW1 heard about the hygienist’s COVID status ‘from a third party’.  Is that a reliable source of information?  The only thing to bank on is the medical care provider’s visible protocols.
2021-04-03 13:55,I can't wait to never talk about covid again.
2021-04-03 21:54,"I found the patient's question to be reasonable. Self preservation is natural, and I believe moral, behavior.  She felt she was unnecessarily being placed at risk and acted accordingly. You may feel her concerns warranted or not, but I view them as reasonable, particularly given her age and health history, and well within her purview to exercise. Still, the dentist has choices, too. If a patient choses not to be treated by one of his/her staff, the dentist is free not to treat the patient."
2021-04-04 0:02,To those people who think the patient was reasonable: Why would you want to use a healthcare provider who wasn't willing to protect both the privacy of his or her employees and the health of the patients in the practice? People who have had COVID-19 and recovered are probably safer to be around than unvaccinated people.
2021-04-04 0:10,"My bigger concern is whether patients who do not yet qualify to be vaccinated have a right to know whether their healthcare providers have received the vaccination. The young female radiology tech who very competently and with great care did my mammogram in February and came face-to-face with me during the procedure, had not been vaccinated. I let her proceed but wondered if I had a right to ask for a different tech."
2021-04-04 1:51,"A friend was diagnosed with Covid last month. Thankfully she was never sick enough to be hospitalized. Her doc said stay home 10 days, after which she was free to resume normal activities, if she FELT well enough. No return visit or other reporting needed. Btw this is the exact same advice I received from my doctor.

It doesn’t appear to be common knowledge that the never-hospitalized majority are instructed to reenter society based on their own perceptions.  

That the dentist checked the hygienist’s temp and O2 most likely does not prove the hygienist was no longer contagious.

All the patient knew was the hygienist (1) got Covid, (2) was treated (not necessarily cured) and (3) had returned to work, possibly under pressure to do so. Many comments mentioned the patient’s supposed ignorance of the science but, if we use only the facts presented, he’s not wrong."
2021-04-03 22:03,It is part of any health-care provider's job to make the patient feel comfortable. I would consider such rudeness disqualifying.
2021-04-04 13:19,"I have a different hygienist dilemma. An hour after I got my first shot, I received a call from my dentist's office letting me know that the hygienist I saw a few days earlier tested positive from Covid. Telling more than they probably should have, the contact tracer told me the hygienist contracted the virus while attending her daughter's dance recital. I quarantined (so fun) and eventually tested negative.  Now, I think the recital was a completely non-essential activity and ill-advised considering the hygienist works on several patients a day who cannot be masked. I have always liked this hygienist but would prefer not to see her again because of her poor judgement. Is that fair?"
2021-04-04 15:31,"As for the safety of going to the hygienist to get your teeth cleaned, I personally can and will wait until I am fully vaccinated. The exposure that many seem to be missing is not the hygienist themselves or even any of the office staff as they are all wearing masks the entire time. It's the patient, who is asymptomatic or just  hasn't shown symptoms yet, who is maskless  for 20-30 minutes in a small room while having their teeth cleaned just before your appointment and you are then exposed, as you take your mask off and breath in what is left in the air after they have left. The hygienist and anyone else who has recovered from COVID is no longer contagious."
2021-04-04 16:13,"HIPAA has a public health exception.  I wish people would understand they may not use the privacy law as an excuse to withhold information that is necessary for specified public health purposes. 
 
Congress did not have Typhoid Mary in mind when it protected health records."
2021-04-04 16:54,"When making a dental appointment I said I'll go only if everyone there has been vaccinated. The receptionist said one employee has not been, but couldn't tell me who it was. She said there's one day a week when that person isn't there, and that's the day I made the appointment for."
2021-04-04 17:29,It's not a patient's business to know personal health information of their providers. This hygienist recovered and was wearing a mask. What more do they want? What if the hygienist was HIV or hepatitis positive? Should the patient be entitled to know about that? No. This breaks HIPAA and can cause the person to lose their livelihood if enough patients refuse to see them.
2021-04-04 19:53,"The nurse at my doctor’s office, after nearly a year of safety working there, got covid from her OB’s office right before her delivery. She tested positive in the hospital and was left to take care of herself and her newborn for 72 hours there. It was a week later that she couldn’t breathe and was hospitalized. One of my oldest friends fell, was hospitalized briefly, got covid and died. It is perfectly appropriate for a patient to ask questions. That dental patient could have used a polite education, but got snark. It’s not as if he couldn’t get covid in that office, just not from that particular hygienist."
2021-04-04 15:20,"What I find eye opening about this conversation is how many people refer to the patient as “she” and refer to the dentist as “he.” The letter writer’s name is “Jack.” Is it because the patient was nervous, and considered by some irrational? My dentist is a “she” and I unconsciously pictured this dentist as a “she.”"
2021-04-04 9:41,I think I am having a flash back. Didn't you all  refuse to be treated by dental hygienists who were HIV+? Isn't this just more of the same?
2021-04-04 13:43,That rude last comment by the dentist's office is not uncommon in healthcare today.  Patients are often told for various reason a different doctor might be a better fit.
2021-03-31 11:22,"The actual dentist likely did not write or approve the letter; such things are usually dealt with by the practice manager. 

I had to laugh as it sounds exactly like the kind of first draft I’d write when a client annoyed the heck out of me. I generally sit on such things and adjust after a night’s sleep. 

This one would have annoyed me because it involves gossip (reminds me of the AIDS crisis); it’s irrational (you’re safer, not more at risk, if the hygienist has already been infected); and yes, it is asking me to break not only HIPAA laws but also trust with my staff.

My better angels would likely have reminded me that the patient was just feeling vulnerable. But possibly not. Sometimes the way a client acts, or the things that they really do say—not necessarily as reported to the Ethicist—mean that you’d be very happy if they took their business elsewhere.

Regardless, the patient need not worry about finding a dentist with a better “bedside” manner as suggested in other comments. Assume it was the practice manager."
2021-03-31 14:25,"If the dentist, hygienist(s) are all wearing PPE, they are not the concern. The unmasked patients having AGPs (aerosolized generating procedures) are."
2021-03-31 15:19,"Your fear is understandable but the dentist is correct, they cannot share staff’s personal medical history.  They can inform you of the basics, that someone had Covid, is recovered, and PPE is in place.  Hygienists are at greater risk of contracting Covid from an open mouthed patient than you are from a N95 masked, shielded and gloved hygienist.
My dentist has a super Covid procedure in place; fully covered hygienist, park and call to say you arrived and admitted when coast is clear, thorough cleaning, and no hanging out in waiting room.  I am going for second time during Covid on Thursday and am perfectly comfortable doing so."
2021-03-31 20:06,"I think the response to the first letter, the Case of the Covid Carrying Hygenist, is overly conciliatory. If the hygenist had exposed patients at work prior to getting a diagnosis, those patients would deserve notification. But once the hygenist has recovered there is no science that indicates there is any risk of post-recovery transmission. The letter writer is being paranoid and the office was perfectly within its rights to shut that down."
2021-04-01 12:48,"I think the advice column world has sufficiently answered all vaccine questions.

I'm eligible but relatively young/healthy/working remotely/don't need it, is it morally wrong to take an appt offered to me? No

I'm eligible but having trouble getting an appointment. Is it wrong to use a friend/neighbor/acquaintance to help me get a vaccine? No

My friend isn't eligible but got the vaccine through nefarious means - can I resent them? You feel whatever you want, there's benefits to more members of the population being vaccinated, however it is understandable you would be upset with this friend. 

I'm not eligible but my doctor friend told me their hospital had some expiring doses so I went to go get one - am I a horrible person? No

No more vaccine letters ... please"
2021-04-01 15:17,"Missing from the dentist's letter?  I can assure you that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no person working in this office poses any danger known to me of infecting any patient with COVID.  If any  hygienist(s) working in our office are known to us to have had COVID, they have recovered and are, by conservative CDC guidelines, no-longer infectious.  This would make it less likely that you acquire COVID in my office because that person is unlike to re-acquire COVID and so is less likely to be unknowingly infectious.   This neither confirms nor denies the rumor you have heard."
2021-04-01 15:34,"LW1 sounds like an obnoxious Karen, sending emails to the dentist and tying up their time with fears that are not fact based. As a business owner who has been besieged by absurd emails for the last year (last week I received an extremely rude email from a woman that my staff at the bar I own had cut off from continuing to drink, which they are legally obligated to do), I sympathize with the dentist. The customer is not always right and after being treated like garbage by said customers for the last year, many business owners are justifiably fed up."
2021-04-02 19:31,I think the dentist’s reply was perfect. Propose that the LW find another dentist.
2021-04-04 20:31,"The dentist was unnecessarily rude  and ignorant in the way he treated this patient.  This was a missed opportunity to reassure and educate the patient.  Privacy was not an issue because the patient had not requested the identity of the hygienist.  The dentist provides a service which he is amply reimbursed for.   If this is how he responds to patient written requests, via rude emails he will not profit for long."

2021-03-23 12:24,The only country that has donated vaccines to poor countries in the developing world without restriction is India. India has donated several million doses to places far outside of its Geo political reach including Barbados and Jamaica. Most of these are via grants at no cost of these countries. They’ve also donated to countries that do not have a well developed a vaccine structure such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This is despite the United States and other European countries hoarding more vaccines that they can give to their own populations.
2021-03-23 12:26,"We need 7B doses of J&J, Astra Zeneca, Sputnik or the Chinese vaccine or 14B doses and refrigerated shipping and storage for Moderna and Pfizer. We don’t yet have the capacity.

Yes, we need to get vaccine out quickly, but to be realistic, getting the raw materials, manufacturing capacity, shipping and distribution, and final distribution to actual arms is an unfathomable job. 

Rich nations are first because they have the money, the manufacturing ability, the ability to get raw materials, and the ability to distribute, and as yet, they still don’t have full supply or effective vaccinating capability.

Yes, the world needs the vaccine. And yes, that should be a global focus. But for heavens sake be realistic. Logistics in some places will make a hard job harder."
2021-03-23 13:09,The world does not need the vaccine.  There are cures for the disease which are easily available.  Let's stop hiding in a hold.  Let's start talking about the cure which can cost a dollar for a week's course of medicine which cures the disease.

2021-03-23 13:12,"It’s too late to open source the development of vaccines, but it’s not too late to suspend the patents on vaccines so that we might have a chance of eradicating Covid globally.

2021-03-23 13:58,"Rich people always get the advantages in life and poor people get the shaft. The vaccine isn't our only line of defense. Masks are a cheap, though imperfect means of protection. We're advised to continue masking whether or not we're vaccinated anyway. Besides, only a tiny fraction of people who get the virus get terribly ill, much less die. We keep concentrating on death rate. Although tragic, only a tiny percentage of patients die from the virus, and much fewer people die from the virus than we even suspect since many affected people are never tested. Even if people don't get vaccinated, herd immunity also protects people from the virus."

2021-03-23 14:21,"It took less than a few months for all of us to accomplish most of the COVID spread. In January no one outside of the experts knew there was something TO spread. 

By April we were cowering behind closed doors in towns and cities closed for business, amusement, living. We all pretty much closed down for much of last March - May.

As with a house fire, destruction is faster than remediation, so too with COVID. 

It will take a long time to bring enough vaccines to far flung places, impoverished places with little infrastructure for refrigeration, inept or effectively no government, places where corruption corrupts absolutely on both sides of every transaction to the detriment of the citizens.

Supply allocations are an excruciating necessity for scarce resources.  These allocations are logistical problems often twisted by politics into patronage, privilege, or punishment.

In a literal nutshell, people being human contributes to a highly imperfect, imbalanced, unfair, strategically dispassionate “methodology” required to distribute among all persons on earth desperately short-supplied vaccines. 

In the retail marketplace surge demand translates into price increases and/or increased production which effectively control demand via strategic gated access.

Controlled supply dictates price which controls demand which then identifies the markets to which supply is accessible by way of financial or other markers. 

No novel Pandemic has ever met an effective novel vaccine."
2021-03-23 14:30,"Every country has a primary obligation to ensure the health of its citizens.

In this pandemic the developed countries are not even close to stopping Covid within their own borders, and if they fail to do so the poor countries will be totally out of luck.

Therefore it is incumbent on the rich countries, from whom the vaccines emanate, to ensure their own survival so they can help the rest of the world survive.

Yes, it will take longer for many countries to vaccinate their populations, especially in the poorest nations, where electricity, running water, toilets and refrigeration are not widely available.

The solution to this problem is not to divert vaccines from the developed nations, but to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution capability as fast and as widely as possible."
2021-03-23 14:26,"Death rates in Africa are lower than in New Jersey. For once, can we cut the PC nonsense. People in the developed world are world travellers, most people in the developing world rarely travel more than hundred  miles from their homes. Maybe the solution to this problem is to eradicate this disease where it is currently stronger thereby preventing it from spreading to parts of the world not as equipped to deal with it."
2021-03-23 14:30,"It’s a global disgrace. None of us are safe until all of us are safe. What better way to show the world the values of the US than to have a global vaccine initiative?

Our commoditization of everything is literally killing us!"
2021-03-23 14:54,"The harsh reality is that governments do have a duty of care to protect their own citizens first if their health, lives and livelihoods are at risk. There will soon be more vaccines available, but manufacturing and vaccinating billions of people takes time. At least many developing countries have far younger populations, so are significantly less at risk for severe COViD than richer countries with older populations"
2021-03-23 15:08,"With the U.S. about to have an oversupply of vaccines and the cost of some being only $2 or $3 per dose, the U.S. could easily pay to vaccinate most of the world for $15 billion. This would protect us from vaccine-resistant strains emerging, and do a great deal to restore America's reputation in the world when we are competing in soft as well as hard power with China. It would also be a good form of reparations for countries like the Philippines, which we invaded and colonized, Southeast Asia, where we bombed untold numbers of poor farmers, and Central American countries where we repeatedly intervened."
2021-03-23 15:43,"I'm curious as to the contributions the Gates Foundation is making to address this crisis.  The piece on their website is somewhat dated and does not address specifics of how they are collaborating with pharma, utilizing strategies for distribution or drawing on their 20 years of experience in impoverished countries.  $250million is significant, but it could be parlayed into so much more through advocacy with developed countries."

I served in the Peace Corps in a southern African country about a decade ago. HIV/AIDS and TB were and still are prolific, no doubt adding to the crisis there. Each day I try not to be overcome with great hopelessness and grief when I think of my community members, host family and the many, many others who showered me with kindness, hospitality and expanded my knowledge beyond anything I offered them as a young college graduate. 

Articles like this destroy my faith in humanity even further. I look around at maskless Americans, many of whom had the privilege to already be vaccinated, and seethe and mourn. 

This pandemic has taught me so much about human behavior. I learned that many smart, seemingly caring people can easily disassociate their own personal actions with their impact on the greater global community. 

I fear for those left behind. For my host mother whose face I picture most days. For my host father with the twinkle in his eye. I wonder if I’ll ever be able to visit, to shake their hands and thank them. To bring them gifts and share a meal. It breaks my heart that I cannot do more for them and the many others who suffer needlessly. History will judge us harshly, and rightfully so."
2021-03-23 16:25,"The issue with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine access is more than patents. These are a new platform, with technical issues for production, in addition to the well known issues for cold storage, etc.

It is also premature right now to offer extensive vaccine to other countries when our essential workers still have not been vaccinated, and there exists huge racial disparities in vaccination rates, mostly due to issues of access. That said, we should start to plan about what to do for when the most vulnerable in the US have been vaccinated."
2021-03-23 16:52,"It would be beneficial if every country pulled together and shared doses, especially considering the threat of even more mutations that could undermine the vaccine effort. We would have to spend more time in a pandemic reality, but that's a small price to pay for more security. Rich nations aren't entitled to better access -- they just have more money and resources. Nations like Kenya don't deserve to be left behind simply because they can't pay. I know that's a controversial statement in our capitalistic society, but people deserve to be able to live their lives regardless of their socioeconomic status."

If we, the USA, want to be a global leader, this is the responsibility that comes with it. Otherwise, we need to make our fortunes and take our vacations here in these United States.
