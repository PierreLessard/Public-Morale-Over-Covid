See: “A Report From the Front”
<a href=""https://spectator.org/a-report-from-the-front"" target=""_blank"">https://spectator.org/a-report-from-the-front</a>/


On April 20, 2020, Dr. Paul Marik, Chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the Eastern Virginia Medical School, published a Critical Care COVID-19 Management Protocol based on the consortium’s findings. In the protocol, he states the following:

 Hyper-inflammation (“Cytokine storm”) – a dysregulated immune system whose cells infiltrate and damage multiple organs, namely the lungs, kidneys, and heart. It is now widely accepted that SARS-CoV-2 causes aberrant T lymphocyte activation resulting in a “cytokine storm.”

""It is essential to recognize that it is not the virus that is killing the patient, rather it is the patient’s overactive immune system. The flames of the “cytokine fire” are out of control and need to be extinguished."""
2020-10-28 16:59:59,"As someone who has lived with systemic lupus and taken hydroxychloroquine for the last 20 years after being diagnosed in my early twenties, I am hopeful that more resources will be put towards diagnostics and therapeutics for this ""invisible"" autoimmune disease, as well as many others, as a result of the similarities to COVID-19's aftereffects. Lupus most negatively impacts women (90% of people with lupus), and in particular women of color, including African American & Latinx populations, who also have more detrimental outcomes including higher rates of death than white people with lupus. 
I never thought I'd hear the name of my life-saving maintenance drug come out of the mouths of late-night comedians, much less the President. While it was scary to worry about the hydroxychloroquine supply chain issues for myself and other lupus sufferers, I cling to optimism that better treatments and outcomes are closer on the horizon than ever before."
2020-10-28 18:18:10,"Perhaps I stand alone in seeing this information as vital to understanding how little we know about the short-term impact and long-term consequences of this virus, and therefore why the greatest precaution should be taken to prevent its spread. It underscores that a nation w/ an inadequate healthcare system like ours should be more cautious, not less, in our response."
2020-10-28 18:45:48,"It's already known that a certain number of people who survive a severe attack on their bodies by a bacteria or virus will have lifelong complications. I survived necrotizing fasciitis and now have a sleep disorder where I get about 1 episode of REM every 6 hrs sleep , as well as hypersomnia. I also have very bad fibromyalgia and the symptoms associated with it beyond just constant pain ; brain fog , sudden overwhelming exhaustion , digestive issues , nausea , and a constant elevated white blood cell count. It isn't just a covid issue , it's an issue for multiple types of survivors."
2020-10-28 18:49:01,"“It’s possible that even moderate to mild disease may induce this kind of antibody response,"" said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.

The more we learn, the more questions abound.  Long shot question: As someone who was just tested for Lupus/RA/PsA, etc. and tested positive for ANA, alone with elevated high C-reactive protein and SED rates, I'm wondering if a person could be asymptomatic Covid-positive but go on to develop these autoimmune diseases."
2020-10-28 18:49:15,"And how do we know that a vaccine, particularly one with the untested new mRNA technology, won't trigger something like this months or years from now?
I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I just got a flu shot.
But there is NO WAY I am going to be a test subject for a vaccine created by a new technology, that has not been tested over TIME as vaccines normally are, when they are not touted as a political stunt."
2020-10-28 18:55:22,I know of a case where someone has had chronic inflammatory problems---severe---after being on life support for infectious disease complications.  It's very very scary---and the medications are extremely expensive and risky.
2020-10-28 19:24:04,"Take it from someone who already deals with serious auto-immune conditions which limit my life -- WEAR A MASK! And do not get anywhere near people who do not.
    You do not want to take any chance on Covid triggering auto-antibodies.  And good luck getting the auto-antibody testing or affording the treatments for autoimmune diseases that this article mentions if you don't have top notch private health insurance."
2020-10-28 19:50:47,Good luck getting your insurance to cover treatment for an autoimmune disorder related to covid-19 infection!  They won’t even cover treatment for RA. Treatments and outcomes aren’t really part of the equation in a for-profit health care.
2020-10-28 19:41:49,"Autoimmune diseases can spring from the flu or thousands of other causes. It’s not shocking that post covid people may have autoimmune disorders. We don’t understand autoimmune disorders but a large portion of America have them and the figures keep rising. We have almost 25 million in the us. Vitamin D really needs to be studied further it too has an affect on autoimmunity. It would be awesome if the NYT gathered data on these patients to see how many of them pre covid were D deficient as D is playing a real role in covid. 
 “ Deficiency in vitamin D has been widely regarded as contributing to autoimmune disease.”"
2020-10-28 20:20:18,"I’m glad the issue ‘autoimmune disorders’ associated with covid19 is finally coming to light. So far, they have not been deemed as risk factors (unless the patient is on immunosupressant drugs), although my own Rheumatologist has keenly recommended to be extremely cautious and avoid situations where we might be exposed to the virus as much as possible. I’m sure she isn’t the only Dr. giving this type of advice."
2020-10-28 20:28:16,"I suffered from post-viral syndrome after I recovered from the swine flu. It took me over two years to feel completely well. I went to my doctor several times, but she saw nothing wrong with me. The debilitating fatigue was real, however. I finally went the “alternative” route: qigong classes, acupuncture, and Jin shin jyutsu. It was a long and lonely road to recovery, but what gave me the most strength was what my acupuncturist said at the beginning of the ordeal: You’ll get better."
2020-10-28 20:52:43,"Is this a random effect, or is it something that might be traced to some particular COVID patients perhaps infecting several others? If one person can be a spreader perhaps the spreader can pass on a form of COVID that is somewhat different from others. Reports seem to point toward variability."
2020-10-28 18:24:24,The photograph looks like something from a futuristic horror movie; quite terrifyingly so.
2020-10-28 21:43:50,"Why not inject anyone positive for covid with just a very good adjuvant? Will that not help stimulate the immune system and cause a better production of antibodies against covid? And it might short circuit any autoimmune response. Better still safest vaccine ever, no need of trials because all of us have taken vaccines which anyway have adjuvants.

While at it, please take a good multivitamin. Ensure it has enough Bcomplex, D3, and vitamin C. Most now have micronutrients like Zn. It’s easy enough to pop in the morning. As a vegetarian, I found after taking a small amount of Bcomplex daily, all my eczema vanished. In any case wear a mask, reduce the amount of covid encountered."
2020-10-28 21:37:41,What does this mean for plasma/antibody donations?
2020-10-28 22:25:49,"Every week, if not every day, there is a new wrinkle in the Covid 19 story. Then the experts, a term that should be loosely used when referring to Covid 19, pipe up with their take on the subject. Warnings will be issued, so many that I'm unsure if any of them are still relevant. 

Currently the only warnings I'm paying attention to are wearing a mask and maintaining an anti-social distant of 6 meters. I'm also planning on planting a hedge of Toxicodendron diversilobum to keep strangers at bay."
2020-10-28 23:22:24,Post 1918 pandemic many suffered from encephalitis lethargica. Be vigilant everyone. Take no risks.
2020-10-28 22:18:39,"The study’s website medrxiv.org specifically cautions: “We also urge journalists and other individuals who report on medical research to the general public to consider this when discussing work that appears on medRxiv preprints and emphasize it has yet to be evaluated by the medical community and the information presented may be erroneous.”

But while this article mentions the lack of publishing in passing, they immediately add credence to the possible finding, instead of caution: “The results were reported Friday on the preprint server MedRxiv, and have not yet been published in a scientific journal. But other experts said the researchers who carried out the study are known for their careful, meticulous work, and that the findings are not unexpected because other viral illnesses also trigger autoantibodies.”

Many (most?) researchers are careful and meticulous, and yet there are reasons these unverified, un-replicated findings can be wrong other than a lack of care (bias, improper sampling, improper blinding, confounding factors...)."
2020-10-29 00:01:17,"My son was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease at age 10. At the time, we recalled that he had a very bad virus a few months before onset of symptoms. We since learned, as many know that IBD ( Inflammatory Bowel Disease) like other auto immune illnesses, is often triggered by a virus ( in addition to other factors  less well understood and genetics etc. ). It seems to make sense that COVID could yield such an auto immune response.
I am not a physician but I have been learning about this disease for 15 years and have been staggered by the research that physicians and scientists are yielding from these studies. I hope that the same BIOLOGIC  drugs now offering some relief for some IBD patients could help COVID survivors."

2020-10-28 13:31:12,"I am in awe of those frontline hospital and home healthcare workers , especially Nurses and Aides, who bravely and with dedication go to work each day giving aid and support to Covid patients.  They carry the burden of knowing the risks of disease or even death, but give their all to care for us.  Pray for them, pray in thanksgiving and for their strengthening and protection."
2020-10-28 13:52:16,"The article is a little confusing.  At a high level, it seems common sense that nurses would be at a high risk of infection given the contact with patients.  But, the article (and I assume the study) goes on to say that how they were infected (work versus outside of work) could not be determined.  The other important point is that the sickest and presumably fatal cases were found in obese and/or older individuals.  I'm curious about the impact on future employment opportunities if a very reliable vaccine isn't found.  The health conditions that significantly raise the risk of covid19 severity are not considered to be disabilities.  What mechanisms are in place to assist a front-line worker (or any worker) with say, obesity and type-2 diabetes, that doesn't want to enter an environment that has a high risk of exposure?"
2020-10-28 13:56:14,"While the nurses are heroic beyond their calling, sadly non medical people discriminate against them, excluding them from  any tiny interaction whatsoever. They are treated as lepers by even their family.  I know.  My beloved only son is on the front lines. I am 70 years old and remain his canary in this deep coal mine of pandemic and bear witness to the mistrust hurled at him and the ensuing hurt.

Have a little respect people!"

2020-10-28 15:47:22,"Is this news? That since nurses have the most contact with patients (aides as well) that they would be the most likely to be infected. And why are supplies of protective gear still ""uneven?"" With all of its manufacturing capability and manpower, is the US unable to produce protective gear for nurses and healthcare workers? 

And no surprise that the hospitalized people tended to be older or maybe have comorbidities--that is on par with the general population. So what is the point of this article? Is this breaking news that nurses are treated as being expendable and with no respect from employers? One of the main reasons I escaped from healthcare and never looked back."
2020-10-28 15:55:26,"I am furious at our country and a government that will not protect our people.

""The nurse inhaled. Strapped over her mouth and nose was an N95 respirator, the disposable filtering mask that has become the world’s most reliable and coveted defense against the virus.

For that, you can thank liberal trade economists 

“In Praise of Cheap Labor” a article  by Paul Krugman praising outsourcing of ""labor intensive products"" become the go to reference 

These ne0-liberal trade theories were readily adopted by politicians, eager to please their donors, whose profits increased when production moved overseas

But those theories were not thought through. The possibility that international supplies lines are vulnerable and may collapse in time of crises was never considered

Furthermore, if my kids get sick I have to use my vacation days to quarantine with them. My kids are currently attending school in person because my husband and are both essential workers and work out of the home.  I already don't have many vacation days and I am saving them for days my children are not in school. It seems impossible to be both a good employee and a good parent these days.

In addition, staff on the COVID side (negative pressure rooms - all air goes through filtration) are forbidden from eating and drinking in the ward. After 7 months she has not become ill, although several of her colleagues have. All of them recovered. 

It's pointless to be bitter about things that woulda-shoulda-coulda happened in the past. It's even more pointless to complain about things we didn't know about, or had no means to deal with, at the time. Just drive on. This too shall pass."

The article states that 6% of people hospitalized with COVID work in healthcare, and that 27% of those hospitalized healthcare workers are nurses. The implication is that healthcare workers, and nurses in particular, are suffering excessively because of their frontline positions. But this is not the case. In this country 12% of workers are employed in health care. Therefore health care workers are hospitalized at less than the rate that would be expected given their percentage of the overall workforce.  Regarding the 27% of hospitalized healthcare workers that are nurses, this is in line with the fact that 30% of hospital employees that are nurses. A large study published in JAMA 8/11/2020 found that in a large Long Island hospital that was heavily hit by COVID, health care workers had a much lower COVID positivity rate than the general public."

She worked at a well known children's hospital and loved her job.  But the hospital management, in its infinite wisdom, understaffed the wards, wouldn't back up the nurses if something went wrong due to the understaffing, and treated the nurses like peons rather than the skilled professionals they are.  She left that hospital and went somewhere else.  I don't know if things improved for her.  I do know that she loved the children but was very concerned that her work wasn't of a high enough quality due to how stretched she was when it came to working with critically ill children.

2020-10-27 14:51:01,This is yet another example of the determination and ingenuity people are bringing to managing life safely in the pandemic.  I hope this starts a lasting trend toward teaching kids in the outdoors more.  It has so many benefits.
2020-10-27 14:57:33,"What beautiful spaces for learning! I hope the pandemic is an opportunity to consider how to incorporate outdoor learning into public education. Post-pandemic, it would be great for kids to spend part of the schoolweek in nature classrooms. I'm not such an idealist that I think school should be outside all day/every day in normal circumstances. Both I do think these spaces could enliven both creative and scientific learning for kids who are listless in traditional cinderblock classrooms -- not to mention offering a break from screens."
2020-10-27 15:20:26,Smart!   This should have been done in Sept when good weather would have made it more feasible.    This country needs flexible thinking during this crisis ( and it is a crisis Mr Trump) and we as a country are not capable of it.   Kudos to those who  implemented these programs.   Visionary and practical.
2020-10-27 15:45:57,"A nice alternative but quite limited obviously due to the weather, and today’s typical high school and middle school classroom tech setups. This makes socially distanced indoor in-person learning and distance learning the best alternatives during a pandemic."
2020-10-27 15:56:23,"I would love to do this all day as a biology educator, just take a break from the work that requires sitting at a desk and to do more environmental education for awhile.  Every day in front of Zoom I reminded of Dolores Umbridge saying, ""Wands away!"" while I pull out yet another Google Slide show about cells or biological molecules.  

We've also experienced (this school year) hot dry east winds at 60 mph and 90 degree heat and choking wildfire smoke in September, 20 mph southwest winds with sideways soaking rain for multiple days this past October, and last week temperatures in the 30s. 

Our students, many of whom are in poverty and typically avoid cold wet weather by staying indoors and wearing a non-water repellent hoodie, would need an investment in raingear and boots.  And probably we'd need some type of open air shelter.  For the 1600 kids in our district, we don't quite have the park space for all of them.

But it's nice that some school districts can do this for some students."
2020-10-27 15:58:14,"And this brings to the forefront environmental inequity.  While we have worked hard to get an outdoor learning garden, it can accommodate a fraction of the school.  Between lack of attractive outdoor space (it is a remediated brownfield site) and large class sizes, many urban schools have ""no place to go."""

2020-10-27 14:51:19,"It’s really surprising how few people know that as we’ve learned more about how the virus spreads, it looks like aerosol transmission is more and more the culprit. The NY Times published an article about the lack of a nuanced explanation, saying it looks like the risk of catching the virus may be 20 time higher indoors than out of doors! If that is true, it should be front page news and the recommendations on mask wearing should be made different for indoors that out of doors. Why are people out of doors, 6 feet apart and still wearing masks? Because they don’t understand the nuances of the aerosol threat. In addition to more activities outdoors, we should be trying harder to replicate the outdoors environment inside the classrooms by keeping all the windows open and using fans to keep air moving. In my belief, windows and doors should be kept open with fans blowing air around in all public spaces. But we are told “just wash your hands and keep 6’ apart”... we need new guidelines based on the elevated risk posed by aerosols."
2020-10-27 15:05:18,"Oh look, people getting it done! Hope more districts will do this. Here in Seattle, they made theoretical noises about outdoor education and then did nothing about it."
2020-10-27 14:41:32,"Seems like a shift in the timing of ""school"" is needed.  Time off from school during the most frigid months and school during the summer months in the areas of the country where that schedule works with the most clement weather."
2020-10-27 16:14:08,"This will have benefits beyond protection against COVID. There is solid evidence that small children exposed to natural light are less likely to develop myopia. There is also good evidence that being outdoors for extended periods reduces the incidence of depression and anxiety, and, of course, being outdoors raises vitamin D levels, a benefit for teachers as well as students. 

Obviously, schools won't be able to do this all year everywhere. It's hard to imagine South Dakota, or even Chicago, holding outdoor classes in January, for example, but kids are a lot tougher than we give them credit for, and schools should be adopting outdoor instruction as much as they can."
2020-10-27 16:25:05,Wonderful - a little creativity goes a long way. But I see a lot of kids in these photos sitting in the gravel and with tables that pencils can poke through — bring the desks outside?  Outdoors doesn’t need to be more uncomfortable than necessary.

2020-10-27 17:06:39,"I have been praying for this.  Thank you for presenting this multi-viewed essay on how school should be handled.  The Scandinavian schools, which have been doing this for decades, report students more engaged, their creativity enhanced, interdisciplinary learning structure resultant in higher academic scores and greater self satisfaction.  I’m aware that there will be places where this is not possible—sadly, especially in places like California and western Colorado at the moment.  In Scandinavia, they say, “there is no bad weather, only bad clothing”.  Much truth to that.  Would that schools were funded so that children in poverty could have access to protective outdoor clothing to participate more fully in the “nature design” school.  One of the biggest fallacies of US public education is the idea that people were EVER meant to spend all day sitting at a desk!!  Our basic biology depends upon moving, soaking up sunlight, interacting socially, seeing how biology intersects with botany, chemistry with meteorology, arts with nature, movement with mood.  This results in a much deeper curriculum—our current one based on testing, has become “a mild wide, an inch deep”.  Basic human neurology does not divide one discipline (subject) from another.  Rather, they are all connected, and the natural world shows that in great magnitude.  As a veteran/retiree of 35 years in public school music and choral performance, I say, rejoice in this model and keep it forever!"
2020-10-27 17:29:37,"I realize that urban schools are limited in their options for outdoor education. The last school that I taught at before retirement was in a wooded area, with a sizable stream running through the campus. As a middle school science teacher, this was an ideal spot to teach classes on stream ecology, botany, and geology. The fact that my students often came back into the classroom wet and muddy was no problem. I even had help from Americorps volunteers and TVA professionals at times.
    Perhaps we should use outdoor opportunities as a factor in choosing sites for new school construction, at least outside of cities. 
   I certainly miss (most) of my time as an educator."

I was the Educational Coordinator with an ingenious NGO, under the umbrella of UNICEF, providing training and educational supplies for teachers and students in Western Equatoria.  My counterparts, colleagues and I felt that more important than expensive classrooms was well trained teachers.  If available, most of the ""classrooms"" were constructed with local materials, ie. mud bricks, grass roofs, etc. More importantly than the facility was GOOD WELL TRAINED TEACHERS who could hold classes under the trees when necessary, and provide valuable instruction.  
    During my 10 + years working in both East and West Africa, education was so highly valued that nearly every child, when asked what they wanted most, replied ""an education"". This priority must be considered, when planing and prioritizing educational options for students in the USA during COVID restrictions.  Let's continue to focus on providing quality education - regardless of the physical setting -  thereby enhancing student's desire to become educated."

2020-10-28 00:33:41,"My children have been educated pre-K through 8 at two different Waldorf schools in New England and have thrived! My child is currently at the Waldorf School of Lexington in the Greater Boston Area. They are in school 5 days per week in person, spending a ton of time outside. It's not new for the students or teachers, as they are accustomed to being outdoors and emersed in nature throughout the day and from the time they were toddlers. As the other schools in the area—both private and public—are fully online (like my high schooler's school), or just 2 days in person, the Waldorf school has been able to stay in their class pods, masked, outdoors, with not a single covid case, and their curriculum has hardly changed."
2020-10-27 14:38:02,"Bravo. Excellent reporting on how Trump's dangerous foreign policy and strongman friends in Latin America have played out against poor, indigenous and disenfranchised people. I personally know many Cuban doctors who were heartbroken to leave Brazil and elsewhere, where YES, they volunteered at pay well above their normal rate at home, the hefty taxes on their income going to universal health care. on the island. PAHO and the region's poor paying the bigger price to prop up Trump's Florida vote machine."
2020-10-27 14:46:21,"Why does the Trump administration fail so significantly to realize the diplomatic success that can be found by aiding countries? The people of Ecuador were lovely when I visited a few years ago, staunchly democratic and looking forward to the future. We may have driven them to desperate choices, and for sure they will not forget our negative actions during their time of need. Brazil has another, more immediate scapegoat in Bolsonaro, but it is unlikely they will forget his connections to Trump, and therefore the United States. If we wish to lessen Cuban influence, or, more likely, lessen funds to Cuba, surely we could find a better way than this. The end result is to create less goodwill for the U.S., in an entire region."
2020-10-27 14:02:22,"This is a article about COVID, but, it's also an article about US policy towards Cuba. The trump admin actions and  accusations of Pompeo are just the latest example of US imperialism. 
Cuba has a different social and medical system than the US. Cuba has socialized medicine; the Cuban doctors work for the govt. Yes, for foreign work, they earn a salary that is a very good one in Cuba, and the govt gets paid considerably more. So? The money is not going into the pockets of a few at the top. Rather, it is used to finance medical care and research in Cuba. The doctors are not slave labor, as some in Miami would suggest. And, Pompeo could care less if they were slaves. This is just another excuse by the US govt to try and strangle the Cuban economy. Cuban doctors have been working in underserved nations around the world for over 15 years. It's not new. 
Trump doesnt care if people in South America die from COVID; he needs votes in Florida. He doesnt care if he strangles the people in Cuba with sanctions; for the past two years, the US has been systematically tightening sanctions.
By the way, Mr Trump, who is ""very hostile to the leftist government"" of Cuba, applied, back in 2008, for permits to build hotels in Cuba. 
Trump and the GOP deserve to lose the election. And, Cuba,  a small nation, living under the threat of the US for the past 60 yrs, deserves to have the cruel US economic blockade lifted."

I couldn't have been more horrified about the developments in Brazil throughout the pandemic. As for trump, his disgusting and (typically wrongheaded) defunding of the Pan-American Health Organization is of a piece with his breaking ties with the World Health Organization in the middle of a pandemic. The loss of all those Cuban doctors could be seen in the tragic reports from Guayaquil and Manaus this summer, just as an example. I don't have polite words for trump or Bolsonaro. Thanks for keeping our eye on trump's many crimes!"
2020-10-27 14:47:48,"I agree overall with the story but you've put a spin worthy of a certain other news network on the part about the Cuban doctors.  Those doctors are Cuba's most valuable export because 75% of the money Brazil pays for them goes to the communist government and only 25% to the Doctors. The government controls where the doctors go and any defiance from them can be punished with exile from Cuba and never seeing their families again.

In the past few years many of those Doctors have sued in Brazilian courts to try to change this, but those efforts have mostly failed because the Brazilian government didn't want to anger Cuba.

Bolsonaro had promised to change that, so two weeks after his election Cuba recalled all their doctors, who had to comply or face exile.  Perhaps it was foolish of Bolsonaro to do this, but he didn't drive the doctors out, Cuba's government took them away from the communities that needed them because they didn't want to lose their cash cow."

Yet there is no proof offered for this proposition, which is a ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" logical fallacy.
The article also condemns the exit of Cuban doctors from Brazi; however, within a few months, most of those Cuban doctors had been replaced by Brazilian doctors.
The main opposition to the Cuban doctors in Brazil was not ideological, it was professional jealousy. CFM, the National Medical Council, which licenses doctors to practice in Brazil, complained loudly from the start that none of the Cuban doctors had received medical training in Brazil, so they could not be licensed. Nor would they permit any Cuban-trained doctors to take the licensing test, because they had not attended a Brazilian medical school."

You're both right on!  Forget Trump doing what's right and prudent and in possible long-term best interests of America or our safety and position in the world.  

It's axiomatic that WHATVER Trump does is ALWAYS about whatever Trump's ego-driven interests are--currently, votes, and always, money.  His ego won't let him countenance being bested by Obama in ANY way, including not being elected to a second term, like Obama was.  Hence, T's all-out efforts to win at whatever the costs, including the lives of those dependent on the Pan-American Health Organization, Cuban doctors, etc. All the better to gin up Cuban votes in Florida, consequences to anyone else, including American democracy, be damned.  Then, more votes gives him a chance to assuage his ego and (possibly) not be bested by Obama and to stay in power to make/take more money from working Americans and pad the pockets of his corrupt corporate cronies.

The lies we tell ourselves are the hardest ones to un-believe.  In Trump's case, it's the lie that at the end of his life, Trump will have more ""wins"" than Obama.  Obama's 'win' column will always surpass Trump's, because Obama's will always include three points that make a difference in whether a life was well-lived and mattered and that Trump will never win: service, decency, and empathic humanity."

2020-10-27 19:21:43,"""the former Brazilian health minister who worked with Mr. Bolsonaro to expel the Cubans""

This is not true.  Cuba revoked the licenses of the doctors before Bolsonaro took office.  Cuba recalled them but many of them didn't leave because they had gotten married and started families there.  Brazil did not expel any of the Cuban doctors or revoke their licenses.  Earlier this year, when the doctors wouldn't leave and had turned to odd jobs to get by, Cuba relented and reissued licenses.  Trump and Bolsonaro are such powerful world figures that both of them were running their countries before they even won their elections.  Trump gets credit for Russia manipulating the 2016 election while Obama was president while Bolsonaro gets credit for running the Cubans out of Brazil while he was unemployed and waiting to start his new job.

I like the way that Cuba cancels the licenses of medical doctors when we are experiencing a global pandemic and Trump gets blamed for it.

Because of the lack of doctors and medicine in Cuba right now anyone really sick with Covid is sent to an abandoned building without food or anyone to care for them and left to die of starvation or Covid which ever comes first. So really the monster here is the Cuban govt, making money off the suffering of its own people. Their is no medicine nor hygiene products in Cuba, there are no medical supplies in the hospitals.

I hope I never live through a situation like this again, but it is going to be a very interesting exercise in 10 years to hear the explanations people have about what they were thinking.  

What were they thinking obeying suggestions to not protect themselves from a highly contagious respiratory virus? Why did they think it was a good idea to attend a standing room only political rally AFTER seeing the White House crippled by the virus just a couple weeks ago? What were they thinking voting for Trump when the Republicans have been actively thwarting the stimulus and health care laws protecting them during this time?

It boggles the mind, and I don't think we've seen the end of it. I do believe Trump will lose this election if he doesn't sabotage the voting process. But the stupidity of his core supporters is highly durable. And we really need to fear the smart, morally-compromised Republicans waiting in the wings.

First of all, when Bolsonaro was elected, he promised to apply the mandatory test that every doctor willing to work in Brazil has to do: the ""revalida"" test. At this point Cuba called back the so called doctors, not allowing them to do the test. 
The test is designed to guarantee that the doctors working in the country have a minimal necessary knowledge of medicine and portuguese (language spoken by 100% of Brazilian population).
Second, they were not allowed to work in the hospital, where Covid is fight. They were family doctors and wouldn't help in any case that had to be treated in the hospitals. They were not allowed, even before Bolsonaro, to have a regular Brazilian stamps of M.D. and a oficial CRM number of registry. They had a special classification because it is against the resolution of the Brazilian council of medicine tho have a registry being graduated outside Brazil without the ""revalida"" test.

2020-10-28 00:38:15,"I’m American but lived in Brazil for many years as my wife is Brazilian. From my experience I can state that most Brazilian doctors are a joke. They are usually the son or daughter of somebody who is already a doctor, from the upper echelons of society and usually have the same skin color.. a lighter hue, if you get what I’m trying to say. Their practice is a mixture of nonchalance, superstition and guilt. For example, while I was suffering with a bout of what later turned out to be dysentery, a Brazilian doctor, rather than take my temperature and perform basic tests, shrugged it off stating “gringos can’t stomach our spices, or it’s probably from the sun.”  

When my wife got sick on a boat ride on the Amazon, a Cuban doctor was aboard, examined her entirely and engagingly asked questions with a sense of concern I’d never seen in the states nor Brazil. Needless to say, she felt better after his orders, and the doctor did not ask for anything afterwards. 

Needless to say, Cuban doctors DO make a difference as many pursue their craft for humanity’s sake. It’s depressing that corruption is so ingrained in Latin American society that the most skilled and talented, of all professions, usually end up taking the short end of the stick while the greedy and lazy and “filhos/hijos de algo” always get further ahead."

This medical program was just an excuse to deviate money from Brazil to support the dictatorship in Cuba. Bolsonaro was empowered through the elections to expel these slaves, as well as to extradite Cesare Battisti who was condemned in Italy after having murdered four people. Battisti was also protected by the former government. Second, you have mentioned hostility to the  region's leftist governments. However, I would like to point out that there was a kleptocracy, which prevailed in Brazil for sixteen years not a leftist government. About eigtheen Ministers of the former governments under Lula and Dilma Roussef were under investigation or condemned by the Justice. Third, the World Health Organisation has lost most of its credibility during this pandemic so that it is a good time for them to ask themselves about not only their relevance but also their existence. Closing, it is not relevant to us if the Health Minister is a loyal military officer. In fact, the militaries count on the support of over 70% of our population.

Its legislative purpose has not been fulfilled in the field due to resistance from the industries and erratic demands of unions, in a cahoot of proclamations for safety and health but lax implementation.

In the field workers see OSHA as employer oriented, and despite requirements for OSHA training and certification hazards remain, inspections are diminished in time, thoroughness, fines for violations and follow-up.

Other governmental agencies, federal, state and lmunicipal, which rely on OSHA for safety and health guidance, training and enforcement have to supplement with stiffer regulations and enforcement, producing confusing, contradictory, exculpatory standards. Unions sometimes help, sometimes hinder these supplementary efforts.

The most unfortunate consequence of these conditions, is the rise in danger to workers who must fend for themselves but not go so far as to be fired. Casualties are seen to be bad luck by workers, not due to official and employer negligence.

Fighting back with litigation is the only effective counter to negligence, and it is not uncommon for OSHA to be cited as an exculpatory defense by employers."

A local recession hit and I was laid off. My 6 months of unemployment ran out despite my applying, as required, for jobs every week. For more than a year after I worked Any job I could find, from laborer to longshoreman to painting lines in the parking lots of the apartment complex where I lived. Of course, no night classes (which unemployment rules did not allow (???)). Finally I was rehired by my old company, and worked there for more than 35 years.

During that time OSHA and EPA rules took effect, and I saw first-hand the slow but dramatic improvements in worker safety, accident reduction, and reduction in toxic emissions led by OSHA and EPA. At my company that impacted thousands of workers and their families, cleaned up local environments around our plants, and resulted in my helping develop highly profitable 'greener' products once I became a chemist. I spent my last year before retirement rewriting my research group's safety procedures and pushing through my last two patents.

These are slaughterhouses. It's as if even the reminder that these are places where sentient beings are slaughtered by the thousands daily is the truth that dare not speak its name. Those reading who eat animals, please know that when you buy an animal carcass, in the form of a patty, a hot dog or a steak, you have not only contributed to the death of animals, but possibly to a slaughterhouse worker as well. We cannot count on the government or advertiser based media. Ultimately, this is a consumer issue. Don't buy. They won't die."
2020-10-22 15:30:35,"The health and safety of the American worker on the job is no priority for the Trump administration. Employee well being an issue only evaluated within the context of financial profit and loss for corporate interests and investors. Regulations seen as intruding into  the operation and productivity of a corporate enterprise such as a meat processing plant are to be evaded, circumvented with the cooperation and complicity of government and oversight authorities like OSHA. Financial  profit rules."
2020-10-22 15:46:25,"This is what happens when the people in power care primarily about the rich.  Corporations call the shots.  What little attention is paid to the rest of us results largely in lip service and window dressing.  I wish it were only the Republicans betraying the average American, but beneath the platitudes they offer, many Democrats in Congress also pull their punches to avoid alienating wealthy donors and the self-named ""job creators.""  But of course the Trump administration is has mounted a war on regulation on steroids.  And what, really, is a regulation? It's a rule.  Without rules, it's a free-for-all, with the wealthy and unprincipled exploiting everyone else.  This administration has turned every Department and federal agency on its head.  The Dept. of Ed is laser focused on eliminating public education.  The Dept. of Interior is actively opening public land for private profit.  Dept. of Health and Human Services may as well close up shop.  The Justice Department is now little more than Trump's army of fixers. Democrats have too often played along with such malpractice, if less brazenly.  Time to storm the Bastille."
2020-10-22 16:02:21,"Absolutely right!  In areas I’m familiar with there is no sick pay during COVID for meat plant workers nor are they allowed to take vacation days. Almost no safety changes made since onset. Isn’t it true also that Trump has made it so these companies can’t be sued. These companies believe the term “essential” literally means employees have no rights. A license to kill. It’s horrendous and takes advantage of our most vulnerable . Their children meanwhile have no daycare to go to and most areas school closed. No access to broadband.  This term “essential”  has meant these meat packing employees and some other food related manufacturing employees are actually disposable!! Very sad interpretation of essential. 

Thanks for reporting on this!!"

2020-10-22 19:16:48,"The meat packing industry is largely staffed by those this administration has always deemed disposable, so it's no surprise their labor department has not taken up their charge to uphold it's own safety regulations. In fact they've elected to remove and cut back the very controls, laws and mitigation efforts in place to protect workers.
  By September over 40,000 workers had been infected, and hundreds of USDA inspectors had tested positive or been unable to work due to insufficient protective gear. 
And when Covid closed down plants the USDA shuffled it's inspectors  again and again from one state/district to another-without providing PPEs, in effect sending Covid in their wake.
 
Yet in press releases Sonny Perdue claimed they had enough PPEs to cover everyone, and at the same time it was well known he hadn't had enough inspectors to cover any sector of the US food production industry for years.

President Trump claims to have done the most for American workers than any other president, his actions say otherwise."
2020-10-27 15:07:03,I can find “experts” who say acupuncture and chiropractics are scientifically proven. The vast majority of actual vaccine experts say the FDA’s current guidelines are more than safe enough.
2020-10-27 15:13:11,"I am 83 there’s no way that I would take a vaccine unless it is thoroughly vetted.  I agree with the advisory, there has to be a longer vetting process. I would also add that any vaccine ‘sponsored’ by dr. trump will not meet my standards."
2020-10-27 15:27:00,"This has to be balanced against the reality that not only are more than 700 Americans dying from covid every day that an effective vaccine is not distributed, the immediate and long-term damage to society accumulates as well.  What is the scientific consensus regarding how much more reliable safety information will be from making the evaluation, say, 4 months after the second shot instead of 2 months (the current plan)?  How common is it that serious adverse reactions show up only within that 2-4 month window, and not within 2 months (or much later, which is irrelevant, as we certainly won't wait much more than 4 months)?

Put political considerations aside.  Neither President Trump nor a possible future President Biden is making the vaccine, evaluating its efficacy and safety, or distributing it."
2020-10-27 16:00:02,"The middle of a pandemic is not the time to be over-fussy about vaccine safety.  Any vaccine risk is much less than the risk of not being vaccinated.

Don't let the anti-vaxxers dictate vaccine policy.  Make any vaccine that produces a gppd immune response available as soon as it can be manufactured in quantity.

It's not like making a new polio vaccine that might be a little better than the present polio vaccine.  People are getting and dying of the pandemic today. 

P.S.: I'm in the Moderna study.  I hope I got the real stuff.  I'll get the first approved vaccine as soon as it become available."
2020-10-27 17:00:23,"The problem will be that if Trump is President he will do his best (and probably succeed ) to blow up any scientific process.
I am in that cadre of probable or likely to be infected by C-19.  Still I'd like to see the science move ahead because the real tragedy would be having the vaccine either not work as or worse.
Then when the effective one came along, fewer people would want it."
2020-10-27 17:01:44,"It's not a vaxxer or anti-vaxxer issue, it is simply a safety issue. History has shown that many vaccines in trials do have safety issues and Astra Zeneca has already shown some serious issues. There is also the issue of vaccine induced enhancement of susceptibility, meaning that some vaccine candidates that were dropped, actually made the disease worse. Proceed with caution and safety."
2020-10-27 17:02:52,"The CDC and FDA in whom, as an infectious diseases physician, I used to trust, have both been weakened, politicized and taken down into the swamp of Washington. I no longer have faith in the FDA. They caved to the pressure to approved convalescent plasma with faulty interpretation of the data. 

If the outside vaccine experts say they need more safety data, I am more than inclined to believe them. I help develop new drugs and these people have the safety at the top of their concerns. They are not under threat of losing their jobs at the hands of a juvenile, vindictive so-called president. 

When penicillin was first approved, they had NO idea that people could be allergic to it, to the point of anaphylaxis. That realization only occurred after tens of thousands of doses were given over long periods of time. There must be no skimping on safety data."
2020-10-27 18:09:59,"Let’s be clear. Skepticism goes beyond the normal anti-vaxx sentiments. People are skeptical that vaccines will be approved before they are safe and effective because announcing a vaccine is seen to be of political advantage.

2020-10-27 21:57:36,"“Lack of trust means no success.”

The problem goes beyond just trust - we have the situation where we have many vaccines in trial and the first one out may not be the best one for me. How will we know unless some number of the trials are allowed to run their course and then the best of those is chosen? From my perspective, I am willing to wait a couple of more months to see how the other candidates are doing before deciding which to get.

Since the government prepaid for many of these vaccines, sight unseen, it has bought a pig in a poke and now they want to push that to me, even if it is not the best one? No thanks. I am going to hang back and see what happens."
2020-10-27 22:01:08,Thank God for Advisory Committee Meetings. Imagine if some terrible long term adverse effect occurred in millions of people who received a vaccine that had been tested for only a few months. Lets say that that vaccine was shown to only induce a few months of increased antibody titres (which politically looks good but is medically ineffective) but it did result in some nasty immune-related disease or neurological disease that debilitated an unexpectedly high number of those who received it around the world.  Get real folks.  This is a huge decision in approving this vaccine; its not a superficial issue.
2020-10-27 22:40:59,"I got stuck on the part where the expert panel was asked to weigh in on how FDA should vet the candidates, how FDA will ask the panel for its opinion before approving any vaccine for emergency use-- but not necessarily follow the advice of its outside experts. A Trump administration FDA will obey Trump's orders, so how about if we slow-walk the expert panel's input on vaccine approval till after January 21?"
2020-10-27 20:32:38,"So the people at the most risk would get the vaccine first thus they basically are being used as guinea pigs. I’m not an anti-vaxxer, I’ll be getting my second shingles shot soon, but I’m going to wait and see how things go before I stand in line for this vaccine."
2020-10-27 21:02:27,"But this would “unblind” the trial by revealing who was in each group, jeopardizing the broader results”

2020-10-28 00:07:58,"So, recent studies indicate that for survivors of COVID the antibodies diminish within months.   Isn’t a vaccine intended to create immunity by triggering the body to produce antibodies?   If so, will an effective vaccine only produce very time-limited immunity?"
2020-10-28 00:14:06,"risk exists; it is real; it won't go away.  vaccine delay leads to more deaths. Early use if something has been missed that doesn't show for months.  Risk, risk.

Keep the controls in place but offer the vaccine to any in a high-risk category.  Balances and risk assessments on every issue raised here."
2020-10-28 01:50:17,"I am very much in favor of safe and effective vaccines.  As taxpayers we have paid pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars to develop these vaccines.  Why do they did rapid emergency approval?  Why not force the companies to pay to do large trials of their vaccines involving tens or hundreds of thousands of people?  I support the altruism of those who have already volunteered for trials but why not expand these trials and make the companies pay for them?  If they receive emergency approval then consumers will have to pay for the vaccines---essentially we will be billed twice.  Large trials are needed to ensure that the vaccines are safe over the long run and efficacious for more than just 2-3 months.  Remember the Swine Flu vaccine of 1976, rushed into production and resulting in nearly 500 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome.  Make the companies pay to do large trials and allow those who are willing to volunteer."

Consider, there still isn’t a magic pill to prevent the common cold. Consider, there is a vaccine for HPV (human papilloma virus) — which took decades — but still no real prevention (beside physical barriers and abstinence) or outbreak predictions once infected. Hepatitis C is another example of a slow process developing treatments and vaccinations. Overall, viruses are tricky!

It’s ironic and sad that we have an anti-science POTUS who does not understand science but wants to pretend like he is the subject matter expert on everything science.

It’s ironic and even sadder that people are diminishing the power of the controllable things that they CAN DO right now as we try to patiently wait for scientists to do their jobs.  We can wear a mask and social distance."
2020-10-20 16:42:44,"This is now two large studies showing limited benefits from remdesivir.  In the hands of a skilled physician, who gets the timing right, it may or may not prevent a cytokine storm but a cheap steroid can do the same thing.  So I agree with Fauci it’s not a knockout drug by any means.  It seems to me the FDA EUA approval of this drug was premature, just like hydroxychloroquin and should be withdrawn."

We've known that since last January, so I hope that some decent pharmaceutical company, probably not in the US and tainted by the for profit motive, is able to create a safe vaccine. Until then, it's basic hygiene, hand washing, stay home, avoid crowds, wear a mask. And no amount of wishful thinking can speed up that time, or create a magic cure. Trump and his co-conspirators have threatened the health of our entire nation to manipulate the stock market to get themselves more money to pay off the Russians."
2020-10-20 18:01:40,"If someone asked you ""how's the weather today,"" there is a very good chance that you would give a very different answer than if asked ""how's the weather in Spain.""

One reason why reason medical studies so often appear to be contradictory is that different studies answer different questions. The WHO study sought to answer the question ""would widespread use of Remdesivir among all CoVid-19 patients significantly lower death rates?""  That is a very different question that, for example, ""would the use of Remdesivir among older adults who have moderate to serious symptoms but are not yet on a respirator speed recovery times?

There are two important differences in those questions.  One is blanket -- does it help everyone -- while the other is specific -- does it help moderately ill seniors.  Another, and even more significant, difference between the questions is the definition of success.  One implicitly defines ""success"" as meaning lowering the fatality rate while the other defines ""success"" as reducing the length of the recovery period for those patients who do recover.

The WHO study appears to provide an answer to the first question: does Remdesivir result in a blanket reduction in fatality rates?  Other studies, including those touted by Remdesivir advocates, tend to focus on the second question: ""does Remdesivir shorten hospital stays?""  

There is no contradiction."
2020-10-20 18:15:54,"That WHO would publish in pre-print a non peer-reviewed open study is a problem. Why not wait for reviewers?
Additionally, no blinding, no placebo, lax inclusion criteria and reporting from countries with dubious research track record. Not sure what to make of these results when a study under NIAID showed modest benefit.
And before you harp about ""modest"" being not good enough look up the published (placebo-controlled, double-blinded!) benefits from Tamiflu and try not to call them modest at best."
2020-10-20 19:05:20,"Two people in my family who were hospitalized due to Covid complications, were given Remdesivir, dethamexsone and Halprin to prevent blood clots, and they survived and back home.  It works for some .  I don't know how the study was conducted, but I can vouch both my family members are doing fine now."
2020-10-20 20:46:09,"I find it incredible and misleading that the studies from the USA have not shown the virological results. The protocols, BOTH, indicate that virology was captured. It is essential to know if patients had a reduction in viral load and if results were depending on viral loads prior to treatment. The Chinese remdesivir study (Lancet) showed no effect on viral levels in patients, so it is possible that this so called ""antiviral"" is actually not one.
I find it inappropriate that the New England Journal of Medicine in the final report did not require the presentation of these results.
Why hide the data? These data may also show if there are any particular groups of patients that objectively benefit from the drug.
Because the incidence of mortality is relatively low, most patients will have good outcomes, so people will think that the drug worked when in reality, this is the natural course of the disease.
Did the authors also note the huge mortality in the WHOI study in Latin American centers? Over 20%!"
2020-10-20 21:43:45,"The physicians quoted in this article criticised the lack of a placebo control group in the WHO solidarity trial. This is not necessary when using a mortality endpoint as in this trial- the placebo effect cannot prevent death. Open label is perfectly acceptable for a trial with a mortality end point. 

Over 7000 patients have now been randomised to either remdesivir or standard of care between five randomised trials and no effect on mortality has been observed by pooling (meta-analysis) of these results. 

Sadly, it does not reduce mortality no matter how much Gilead would like you to think that it does."
2020-10-20 21:48:54,"President Trump received remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-inflammatories.   Together, they are  likely to be effective at more stages of the disease.   If the virus is just starting out, then the anti-viral will attack the virus.   If your immune system is suppressed by the virus, then the anti-inflammatories will dampen a violent reaction.   

Doctors have to learn by trial and error how to combine these treatments into an effective regimen.   Clinical experience is probably more useful than tightly controlled experiments, since each patient is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment."
2020-10-20 23:22:43,"The study is good for raising questions about the drug, prompting more research.  But one should form no conclusions from the study since it was conducted by the WHO, a corrupt organization which has already demonstrated that it will sacrifice the health and lives of the people of the world in order to serve the economic and political interests of China.

It was the WHO back in January that refused to declare Covid-19 an international emergency.  The WHO cited its concern for the economy of China as reason for its refusal.  The WHO also in January recommended against banning travelers from China for the same economic and political reasons."
2020-10-20 20:33:05,"The facts mentioned in your article indicate a likelihood of significant and invalidating flaws in the trial.  

In these circumstances, a headline saying 'remdesivir fails to prevent' is misleading, because it goes well beyond the ascertained facts.  

The result may be receiving controversial interpretation by some as a failure to prevent.  That is a whole different thing than failure to prevent, period. And yet we do not know a definitive answer at this point."
2020-10-20 20:47:49,"This is a very confusing and misleading reporting on an already confusing trial (WHO) report.

The headlines suggest this was a huge trial. However only a little over 2000 of the 11000 people tested were even given Remdesiivir.

This is hardly huge compared with the very 'gold standard' testing previously done with remdesivir and involving over a 1000 patients. Gold standard being blind study, recordings of conditions of patients, etc.

There are 4 possible ways of preventing death from covid.
1) Vaccine - body introduced to weakened virus so it builds up auto immunity prior to heavy load exposure.

2) Antibodies (Regeneron and others) - the bodies defenses produces these which adhere to the viruses antigens neutralizing them.  Just think of antigens as being poison gumming up the body. 

3) Remdesivir  (Gilad)- this prevents the virus from reproducing and thus overwhelming the bodies ability to produce enough antibodies at the right time. 

4) Cytokine storm- this is where the human defenses over react and start attacking the body itself.  dexamethasone (a steroid) is helpful here at the late stage.

Trump got all but a vaccine.

Anyone who is 70+ years and shows symptoms  of covid and doesn't  take advantage of an opportunity to get remdesivir is imo being foolish.

They were given to Trump and Christie.

Somehow the coverage of this drug seems to be colored by politics. That is a shame."
2020-10-20 20:48:41,"My hypothesis is that none of the antivirals work because they’re given after the viral phase and during the immune disregulation phase. Is there anything you could give someone right after their positive test comes back? Both remdesivir and antibodies are given via infusion and aren’t yet approved. But you know what’s just a pill, is cheap, and is approved, albeit off-label?

I’d like to see a trial giving that drug to high risk people the second they get their positive result, and look at hospitalizations and deaths. In addition to the current treatment of course, which I understand includes a pat on the back, admonishment to rest and drink plenty of fluids, and a hearty “hope you feel better!”"
2020-10-20 22:36:42,"Oh my, which scientists do I believe!   Anti-Trump scientists or regular ones?"
2020-10-20 23:12:45,I would encourage everyone to read the article in the New England journal of medicine. It is easy to find. Don’t fall for clickbait headlines. The conclusion of the study was that “remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection”.  Let’s not leave science to reporters.
2020-10-21 02:50:48,"Many studies show SARS-COV-2 virus is not viable in anyone after 9 days from start of fever or other symptoms.  There is no need for any antivirals after that, and all symptoms after that are due to substances produced the body, not the virus, interacting with medical interventions.   So antiviral therapies can only make a benefecial difference in first week. 

 After this  virus is no longer are able replicate, new approaches are needed to  turn DOWN the patient's no longer needed  immune response.  What already FDA-approved drug for coronovaris infection does this best ? 

 Zinc, which suppresses the HO-1 response that makes carbon monoxide, ferritin and bilirubin, all of which are higher than normal in ICU patients and highest just before they die from a cytokine storm."
2020-10-21 02:31:38,"I hope Trump was able to sell his stock in Gilead before this study came out. 

He still has time to sell his stock in Regeneron, another company with a drug he has touted like the snake oil salesman he is. 

There is a reason that the Trump campaign has raised over a billion dollars but is almost broke. A forensic accountant should examine where the expenditures went. 

He regularly put Invanka on the payroll as a consultant to skim money off the top. So many campaign events paying top dollars to divert campaign and taxpayer money to his properties. 

Even the RNC was forced to buy Donald Jr.'s drivel of a book and use it for doorstops or kindling. 

The Trump Grifter Clan will be on the next plane out of the country when he is a lame duck before the lawsuits and prosecutions begin.

Trump must be made to be an example to any future treasonous corrupt person running for office of repercussions. Nixon had the decency to resign.

For this Fraudster-in-Thief to run as a ""law and order"" candidate is an example of the substantial risk of lasting cognitive decline from COVID-19.

The fact Bannon defrauded Trump supporters into contributing to build a fake wall that was supposed to be paid by Mexico, will fall over with a draft, and is a stupid peron's example of how to protect a border in 2020, tells you some suckers and rubes just won't learn."
2020-10-22 13:53:41,"The pandemic is showing us how ineffective and expensive our current wealth care system is.  Even before the pandemic there were plenty of Americans who avoided going for needed medical care because of the cost or because the process of finding a doctor, getting the approvals, dealing with the insurance company was too exhausting.  Our wealth care system depends on people not using it.  I say that because it's a for profit system where the bottom line matters more than anyone's health or need for medical care.  

Diabetics shouldn't have to ration their insulin or syringes because they can't afford the deductible or the cost of the medication.  People on blood pressure medication shouldn't have to either.  People in need of chemo shouldn't be forced to switch midstream because their insurance company dropped their provider or vice versa.  All doctors should be compensated fairly for the patients they see or speak with over the phone.  And no patient should feel that s/he has to forgo care to avoid bankruptcy.  

A real health care system would include dental, feet, eyes, and ears and mental illness as part of its mission.  A real health care system wouldn't penalize patients for out of network care because all providers would be in network by default.  The pandemic highlighted these defects.  Again, other countries manage to provide health care for all their people.  Why can't we?"
2020-10-22 14:52:56,"The number of deaths attributed to covid has long been thought to be lower than the number who actually died from the disease. Early in the pandemic, many people were unable to be tested, and their deaths were therefore attributed to other causes even if their symptoms were consistent with covid. Even now, confirmatory tests are hard to come by in some places. It cannot logically be assumed that the extraordinary increase in excess deaths in 2000 is attributable to sudden huge increases in heart disease, for example. In fact, as we are learning, covid can cause death through many causes, not just respiratory failure: it frequently attacks the heart, especially in younger people, exactly where we're seeing an increase in excess deaths. Diabetes, too, is a frequent comorbidity with covid: in those cases, covid is what kills them, not diabetes. The statistic cited in the article attributes fewer of the excess deaths to covid than the official count itself for covid deaths, an obvious contradiction."
2020-10-22 14:59:20,"Why isn't this the top story on the Times' website?

We don't care about how the campaigns are spending their ad money. We don't care about the ""horse race"" that the Times political desk is trying to sell us every day.

We care about the health and well-being of our fellow citizens. 

These 300,000 deaths are directly the result of Trump's callous mishandling of the pandemic response. That is not a partisan statement. That is a fact."
2020-10-22 16:18:54,"Many, though certainly not all,  of the excess deaths seem to be collateral damage due to the lockdowns, including delayed medical care as was often required by the lockdowns imposed in the spring, and the psychological stress resulting from the economic catastrophe secondary to the lockdowns.

It's extremely important we gain a better understanding of the causes of these excess deaths.  Lockdowns do reduce the short term case load, but they may defer cases, not prevent them.  They do have many side effects, especially when one considers what is happening worldwide; outside the US there has been the dramatic development of hunger, starvation, and increased incidence in preventable diseases.

Today, as Covid surges, many are calling for a second lockdown of society. This will likely reduce the short term case load, but there will be major side effects, including excess deaths.  Particularly given the improved treatments and reduced death rate from Covid, balance is necessary, and some of the recommendations of the Barrington proposal are worth considering.

Bottom line, though: only a safe and effective vaccine can end the pandemic.  The anti-vaccination mindset that that arisen in the US is one of the most worrisome developments of all."
2020-10-22 17:09:47,"Does this data include the increased deaths due to substance abuse? Violence (domestic and otherwise)? Suicide?

(I wonder what the Right-to-Lifers might make of that).  Of course, you can argue that that these gruesome stats are sometimes shaky and are basically incomparable.

I am greatly surprised that suicide, drug abuse, and even domestic violence related cases were not mentioned. 

COVID-19 has had many side effects that have been heightened during the pandemic such as mental health and domestic violence cases. The pandemic has placed a huge toll on Americans psychologically. 

What is of even greater concern is that the deaths of those with underlying diseases such as diabetes or heart disease could have been preventable. COVID-19 has placed so much fear in many Americans, but that fear becoming the driving force of one’s decision of choosing care by visiting the hospital or not wanting to contract COVID is disheartening.

2020-10-22 20:31:40,"A slower-speed wave is coming, too: deaths from alcoholism and prescription drug abuse, particularly among seniors.  Alcohol sales are sharply up, and mixing alcohol with prescription drugs---even non-opiods--is a deadly combination.  People are looking for a bit of comfort in these difficult times, and what better than a little nip?  What makes this especially worse is that the recovery community--AA, NA, and others--has gone online.  Zoom does a good job, but it's no substitute for being able to walk into a meeting or a substance abuse clinic.  You can't hug or cry with someone on a computer screen. 

There may be do way to count the incremental deaths from this, but they're real, and growing.  I speak from 32 years clean and sober."

2020-10-22 15:27:17,"Western businesses that work in China probably use Chinese banks, but it should be different for any US official because he might protect his financial privileges instead of our national security if his business in China is threatened.

Trump stayed quiet about the COVID-19 for a long time while the COVID spread supposedly not to ""panic people."" What a lie! Trump's silence probably gave China the opportunity to buy-up masks and other medical supplies before America could buy supplies. 

I suspect that Trump's silence was because the Chinese government could retaliate against his family's businesses in China.

In Russia and China, having a business is a privilege, not a right. The government can shut down a business and take the money if the owner refuses to give pay-offs or political favors. The laws on registering a business basically legalize extortion. The officials who give you legal permission/registration for your business can also deregister you.

Putin got rich because he decided what companies got a license (registration) to export precious metals. They all had to pay him off. He could extort them if he wanted because he could always deregister them.

Trump is extorting FBI Director Wray. Wray has to spread lies about Biden or be fired. 

I suspect tens of thousands of Americans perished or got sick because Trump kept his mouth shut while the COVID-19  spread so that he would not risk his privilege to do business in China.

I think Trump committed genocide."

He ran out of food but unfortunately continued to take his insulin.  He collapsed into a hypoglycemic coma and fell to the floor.  In falling he landed on his car keys and set off his car alarm.  A neighbor found him and called an ambulance.  Unfortunately he never recovered and died about 1 month later.  His death can be indirectly attributed to the epidemic.

What happens at 26 in this country? Children are no longer covered by their parent's health insurance. They are forced into employment based insurance or exchanges. At the same time, young people are generally working low paying service jobs. The same jobs minorities are always working. The same jobs most likely to disappear during the pandemic.

No job. No insurance. No medical treatment. Especially for those with serious preexisting medical conditions. Excess death is the result. These people probably aren't avoiding medical treatment willingly. Our healthcare system is killing them."

 Blaming an inanimate virus for serious medical and social problems is a tragic misdirection of analysis and should be an insult to both victims and those who treat and try to save them.  Skewing the results for political purposes to curry favor with different voter groups is even more reprehensible.
 
We should be finding out WHY fatalities from other causes are increasing, not simply blaming the Pandemic du jour.   Unemployment has increased.  The American Medical System seems under-equipped.  Fear of infection, made worse by media hype, discourages people from seeking care.  These are just a few problems that have been highlighted by the infection.
 
Don't just blame the easy target."

I have a lot of experience with receiving healthcare and always have someone with me in the ER. At the start of the pandemic when the hospitals would allow no one in I did have the thought that it might be better to risk no care than be exposed to the risk and trauma of being alone in our subpar hospitals. Fortunately, I have been able to manage alright at home but some people I knew did decide they would rather take the chance of dying at home than dying alone in a hospital where they are poorly cared for. Especially in the early days of the pandemic where many states had guidelines allowing hospitals to deny care or even steal the lifesaving equipement of disabled people who came to ERs. Many of these guidelines have been ruled discriminatory and changed now which may make people more comfortable with seeking care. Imagine being told that if you go to the ER for a routine but urgent issue related to your managed medical problem your private equipement can be confiscated and you will be left to die. That sort of thing certainly discourages people from seeking care!"

History does repeat itself!"
2020-10-19 10:51:21,"Can I say something:

Most economies are already undergoing a V-shaped rebound. When you open an economy from a lockdown (which induced a contraction), there will inevitably be ""growth"" and thus a rebound. This has played out virtually everywhere as restrictions lessened following the first wave.

Steep rebounds are also common after significant contractions. India which is forecast to contract 10.3% this year, will see 8.8% growth next year.

China is also ahead in the virus cycle. During Jan to March, China was at the peak of its lockdown. Consequently, it registered 6.5% contraction in Q1 even as other economies were growing. China also came out of its lockdown earlier as the situation in other countries began  worsening.

This is why China's performance looked stellar in Q2 as other major economies contracted. It was simply ahead in the virus cycle. That's all. Already most economies are recovering. Even with a second surge in many Western countries, societies are better prepared than in March/April and may take less of a hit this time round.

But remember that China is one quarter ahead of the rest of the world where data is concerned. Statisticians and economists would understand this. It is better to compare China to Japan or another country which controlled the virus well rather. It won't look as exceptional."
2020-10-19 11:11:50,"Let’s dispel the notion that autocracy is inherently inferior to democracy. In the realm of pandemic control, autocracy is clearly able to effectively mobilize nationwide response and quickly crush the virus. 

Let’s also dispel the notion that any stats out of China are immediately labeled as fake news. It’s a vestige of the American exceptionalism ideology. It’s time we retire that idea and realize there’s much to be learned from the rest of the world."

2020-10-19 10:59:40,"The US will lag for at least another year, as Biden (hopefully) mandates masks and contact tracing.  But several other important points:
A.  We’ve lost 12 year years of infrastructure projects (Republicans prevented every Obama program, and Trump/Republicans had no interest in them because they knew they had no money after the tax cuts).  So opening up the country with failing bridges, highways and airports will result in lower numbers than China’s who was ready with a 21st Century infrastructure in place.

B.  Covid will be with us until a vaccine— while China mandates masks and contact tracing, the red states still laugh at it, professing freedom.  Look at Gov Noem in South Dakota, site of the largest gathering of 400,000 motorcyclists from around the country, who then became super spreader vectors in SD as well as in the US, still not changing her ways, and allowing more large events-even putting them on her Twitter page.  I suspect they will really ramp this up “in your face” attitude under Biden - because it has become so politicized.

We will lag many countries around the world, and may never regain any credibility or world leader status ever again.

Sure its easier for an autocratic nation to quarantine and control, but I can't help but feel that with a little presidential leadership, Americans would have done acceptably well and perhaps even come together as a nation a little.

The reality is: China and its people were committed to fighting the virus. They wore masks. They did contact tracing. We did real lockdowns here-there wasn’t Friday night takeout or exercising outside. We didn’t “social distance,” we just stayed inside and avoid other people at all costs. The commitment to keeping the country and the communities safe was evident in everyone’s actions.

And for that undesirable result, American farmers have had to be bailed out at taxpayer expense, and many have gone bankrupt; manufacturers in the US have had to pay more for raw materials and components, passing on the added cost to US consumers; and some of our staunchest allies and most important trade partners like Canada have been insulted and alienated by being likewise targeted with wrongheaded tariffs by a fool who still apparently believes that a tariff is a payment of cash by the exporting country to the importing country imposing the tariff.

But as of now we have no material track record making new vaccines using these new, high tech, engineered gee-whizzy tools. But we're betting the farm on these newbies.
We in the west love our shiny new objects having evolved over the last 75 years to expect ""new and improved"" stuff. 
I would have first cranked out a vaccine using the tried and true approach, build societal immunity and then in parallel experimented using the new tools.

In China, many of the best and brightest go into government. Despite its authoritarianism, the Chinese tend to put accomplished and reasonably thoughtful people in their leadership. 

In the US, the people hate its government. Outside of the military, FBI, CIA and Justice, most of the brightest minds do not participate in government whether its career or elective positions. 

A country cannot be successful over the long term if it puts in office people like Trump. You need to be serious.

Americans love to be entertained like Romans did in the Coliseum. Americans are also on the whole uninformed. A country where a conspiracy theory like “Q” takes hold isn’t going  to be capable of sustaining a democracy which requires informed citizenry to be successful. 

No one should be surprised the virus is burning up the US. Half of the country still think it’s a harmless cold."

In other countries the population does what need to be done and now can live an almost normal life.  They used to say that China would pass the US by 2040 - I think it will be much earlier than that.  And no it has nothing to do with lack of democracy - South Korea is almost as good at it and they are at least as democratic as we are.
2020-10-19 12:25:00,"If you believe that the virus was a Chinese plot to gain economic dominance over the U.S., just remember why it works.  It only works because the  U.S. government, namely President Trump, encourages his supporters to expose themselves to the disease. In contrast, the Chinese government has strict disease control measures. If you go to China, you must wear masks . You must quarantine for three weeks and that quarantine is enforced. That is why the disease is controlled in the China and not in the U.S.

Meanwhile, President Trump and his latest Covid advisor Scott Atlas promote the idea of herd immunity through  letting people get sick and then recover. At current in death rates, getting 70% of Americans sick to achieve herd immunity will lead to between 1 and 5 million American deaths.

 What is worse is that current medical evidence warns us that this immunity will only last about a year. To retain immunity people will have to get sick again and again on a yearly basis, meaning that the U.S. yearly death toll will have be in the millions for the foreseeable future. 

So one must wonder, ""Is President Trump actually an unwitting agent promoting a Chinese plan for world domination.""  I don't think the Chinese have created Covid-19 deliberately, but Trump has promoted that idea. Then why does Trump encourage Americans to  get sick? It is because this helps Trump politically with his base."
2020-10-19 12:39:54,"Republicans try to push the narrative that our economy is doing better than the countries in the world that went in deep lockdown. In her analysis on the ""Ingraham Angle"", Laura Ingraham did a country by country comparison showing just that. But, conspicuous by it's absence, was China.

People who whine about their ""freedom""* being taken away should look at the pictures of ordinary scenes in China - they look like a typical Trump rally, but without the virus.

*I put the word freedom in quotes because the freedom to do what you choose in a pandemic means most of us don't have the freedom to do what we want to do. We want to live. So let's give up our freedom temporarily, clamp down on the virus, and then everyone will be free."
2020-10-19 12:41:17,"Unfortunately, like so many things that rule over, negatively affect and cause so many other problems for too many Americans and America itself...is the the effects of to largea desire and love for money , profits and selfish wealth creation.

So much so, we observed a country determined to get its people back to work and keep the economy making money ...regardless of the consequences in terms of the current Pandemic, which for America in terms of human lives lost , has been exceptionally high. 

Nobody has taken the path and done things the way America has regarding this virus for love or money...whilst America went down the path of early open ups, denial of science and much greater negative consequences FOR the Love of Money over and above the safety of its people."
2020-10-19 12:50:46,"So many commenters here are positing a false choice between totalitarianism and an efficient response to the pandemic.

South Korea isn't a totalitarian state. In 2019, it ranked 23rd on the Democracy Index compiled by the UK's Economist Group, while the US ranked 25th.

South Korea announced their first confirmed case of the virus the day before the CDC announced ours. Since then, South Korea has lost a total of 444 people to the virus, while we've lost 224,732.

And South Korea is far from the only country that's done a better job of protecting its citizens. To the contrary, no country has suffered close to as many total deaths as the US, and only nine countries have suffered a higher rate of deaths per capita, and that includes a tiny microstate like San Marino, which lost 42 people.

The difference between an effective response and a disastrous one has nothing to do with totalitarianism vs. freedom. It has everything to do with a respect for science and responsible leadership, neither of which could be found in the Trump Administration."
2020-10-19 12:39:43,Sorry. I don’t trust any statistics that came out of the Communist Party. Is the pandemic over in China? I doubt it. Just look at the photos that accompany the article. Everyone is still wearing masks.
2020-10-19 12:41:08,"I choose to see this as good news. Biden will win in November and once we have real leadership, we will start to get this virus under control. We can do this. We will bounce back."
2020-10-19 12:35:54,"Remember when Chinese authorities were welding citizens' doors shut to forcibly quarantine them?  Remember when they were forcibly dragging people from their homes to take them to government-run hospitals where they were effectively prisoners?  Oh yeah, and somehow China isn't xenophobic in virtually eliminating all foreigners from entering their country.  

Yeah, good times.  Had Trump ""shown leadership"" and done that, there would have been a bloody, violent revolution on our hands and the Dems would have got their wish of a unanimous Trump impeachment in the Senate. Instead he showed real leadership and banned travel very early in the pandemic, to the calls of ""racism"" and ""xenophobia"" from his critics.

Regardless of what you hear or want to believe, the US has balanced  quite well inherent freedoms the Government is constitutionally prohibited from restricting with economic considerations that it does have the power to regulate during this pandemic.

Time to focus our efforts on protecting the most vulnerable individuals in our society while allowing everyone else to keep working, and spend their own money as they please.  Seems the only people who don't want that are people who are too lazy to work anyway, and wish they could crawl into the false warmth of the Government Bosom to suckle on some sour milk...and the politicians who want a politburo to dictate to Americans how to live their lives."
2020-10-19 12:51:21,"China, it seems, has done everything right with Covid-19 while we have done everything wrong, thanks largely to Trump. And while he keeps bragging about the mythical success of his America First trade policy, the only metric by which it can be measured tells a different story. The U.S. trade deficit, which he promised to lower, has soared on his watch to its highest level in 14 years."
2020-10-19 12:31:06,Will China put a stop to their wet markets?
2020-10-19 12:58:28,"Thoughtful, honest leadership is why China is seeing growth, and other developed countries, too, are beginning to see a return to pre-Covid conditions, if not grow. 

The governments of those countries  did not take the ""herd immunity"" route as President Trump deceitfully did, which has needlessly killing hundreds of thousands of Americans. He took no proactive or effective measures to control the virus.  (Trump proclaimed a ban of travel from China, hours after learning American, Delta and United Airlines had announced they were suspending flights from mainland China.) Trump doesn't ask what Jesus would do, he asks, or simply watches what Putin does.

South Korea, which had its first case the same day we did, has had its economy on track and its death toll (adjusted to approximate our population) is under 4,000.

The devastation to Americans hasn't even fully revealed itself has many are started to get forced out of their homes, and the drive up food bank lines are getting miles longer. We can expect another 100,000 deaths by January 21. Will anything be done by this administration for the people?

In 2007, when asked about the probability of a recession, Trump said loved it. He saw all the foreclosures as a buying opportunity.  I'm sure the rest of his donors feel the same way."
2020-10-19 13:01:18,"""fast economic rebound is possible when the virus is brought firmly under control.""  AND when a country has a strong internal economic base of manufacturing. That's not US.

2020-10-19 12:55:17,"As usual NYT is giving glorious heading to China's growth, while trying to denigrate growth in the USA. Since many world leaders still consider NYT a reputable news organization and get their news from it, they think America is a declining force and China a rising force based on the reports in NYT. This is sad."
2020-10-19 12:31:42,"Yet another totally disgusting hurrah by NYT to China.  The troubles we are experiencing come from there.  That is the only thing we need to know for now.  That their economy is back on track feels me with anger since we did not deserve any of our issues here and really have to consider them at least to an extent responsible.  Yet, the leading 'liberal' propaganda outlet cheers successes there in the midst of the discussion of yet another stimulus which, in America, always makes rich richer and gives some crumbs to the poor.  So, so, so disappointing."
2020-10-19 12:50:10,"I am glad China is doing well but the country owes the world an enormous apology.

This was an avoidable disaster, unlike hurricanes and earthquakes and the like. Simple hygiene at China's wet markets and a ban on the consumption of known virus-carrying animals such as bats and pangolins would have likely allowed the world to avoid this terrible plague.

Look, China is an autocratic society. If you don't do as told, you're in trouble. Western society is much more open, much more complex. And, yes, I know, little New Zealand, a western democracy, has done well. But it's an island nation of 5 million people.

Trump clearly messed this whole thing up. But, now, even Germany and France and Italy and other countries are struggling again.  I've actually heard people say that maybe the west needs more autocratic-like governments to deal with things like Covid.

That is so wrong! The point is: had China acted smartly after SARS, Covid never would have happened. 

China loves to act all modern and advanced. But, remember, parts of the country still have dog-eating festivals for god sakes! Dog-eating!"
2020-10-19 13:02:56,"And what of the human-caused climate, environmental, biodiversity threats we are facing now?   Not a thought spared here,  it’s all about putting  pandemic behind us and getting  back to growth as usual. China is doing it and we can too!  is the theme, heedless of the consequences."
2020-10-19 12:46:32,"This is just Trump’s ninja-like negotiating stratergy with The Covid.  He had been hanging at the back of the pack, waiting out The Covid for a late run, but now sees The Covid “rounding the bend” picking up speed barreling down the homestretch for a big “win” by several lengths.  He has lost to The Covid.  

And he now knows that he is about to lose the election “bigly” and become the “greatest” one term prez. in history.  He will say and do many much more threatening and dangerous things in the future.  He needs to be prosecuted for his many crimes."
2020-10-19 13:03:53,"No doubt, all part of Trump's plan to Make China Great Again."
2020-10-19 13:04:54,"In the last three decades, the global elites are observing closely the decision-making process of the Chinese leadership, particularly the economy.

 A backward rural country in the 60s became an industrial/technological powerhouse. 

The Covit-19 epidemic illustrates the gap between China and the western economies. This NYT piece sheds some light on the subject.    

The crucial question is:  how to explain China's eminence while Western economies, particularly the US,  are struggling to find a way out of decline?"
2020-10-19 13:06:48,"I wonder how much of that economic surge is due to demand by consumers in the US, that is once again helping to fuel economic growth in China. One of the many great fails of this administration continues to be to revive manufacturing stateside.  One example are protective masks, which still come mostly from China.  I wonder if at least MAGA hats and other merch are now ""Made in USA""? Last time around, they were all ""Made in China""."
2020-10-19 13:09:29,I am not willing to sacrifice personal freedoms to the extent required to match China’s absolute control of lives and the total invasion of any privacy. Also very hard to trust any economic data coming from China.
2020-10-19 13:17:01,"There can be  no greater cultural differences on the world spectrum between China and America, German being somewhere in the middle. Ours is indeed anarchical, a system created through happenstance and by a myriad collective of people who disdain the personal habits, religion, education or wealth of their fellow citizens. That is why we haven't come together to build a workable public healthcare system, without which there is no hope in breaking the merciless bounds of the pandemic. I don't think the election will change things one iota. A vaccine, widely, equally and quickly distributed is our only hope.

As to the Chinese economy, you have to look minutely at the numbers, what they translate into; do they accurately reflect the real output? What is the cost to personal freedom and the natural environment and the future stability and peace in the world? If the answer is a greater net loss to Mother Earth than the counterbalancing benefit to the world or country's people, it is time to cancel all trade with China.

America hasn't the will or the incentive to act in its own collective good. Perhaps anarchy is better; nature always balances itself out, but isn't that what natural selection is all about, and if we are indeed God's creatures, shouldn't we embark on a proactive course to determine our own destiny?"
2020-10-19 13:18:19,"Finally, though perhaps a bit late for us. I have, for months, feared that the refusal or inability of the US media to give a frank accounting of China's successful COVID response has played a role in our failure against this pandemic. The press perseverated on ""mishandling of the initial outbreak"" or ""silencing doctors""  and went no further. Articles about countries employing more effective strategies often did not even mention China at all. I understand that anti-China sentiment is high. I understand that everyone has their biases. But there really was an astonishing chasm between what was accomplished in China and what has been reported here in the US. On top of this we have a president, personally informed by China's in early February, who decides to withhold this information from the American public and  to use the pandemic to fuel anti-China propaganda. 

A perfect storm of obfuscation, misinformation, disinformation and ignorance. How could Americans do the right thing if they are largely blind to the most effective response of scale to date? How can we try to do better if we don't even believe that anyone has done it?

Please, fellow Americans, this is not about supporting China or us versus them. It is about taking science based steps to subdue COVID. And we see that it can be done. Perhaps we can do even better. Please, I want my life back."
2020-10-19 13:18:51,"Regardless of the government type -- authoritarian vs. democracy, one lesson can be learned -- only an organized and coordinated response can beat the pandemic. 

Yes, China lacks freedom and many other problems, no doubt about that. But somehow a central-controlled governance plays well in massive and coordinated responses. If we cannot see this here in the West, then we'd be no different than burying our heads in the sand believing nothing good can come out of China's system. 

Maybe we should treat this as an awakening call and a lesson to learn -- there are times that democracy has its shortcomings, and how we address these problems is the key.

Be humble, guys. Because here's the reality -- 

Us: 8 million + infections; people are still fighting over wearing masks. 
China: Almost Zero local transmission; people's lives are going back to normal."
2020-10-19 13:19:41,"For those inclined to compare China and the US there are several considerations not mentioned here:

1. China’s growth rate has long been around 6%. The US growth rate has long been around 2%. The US economy is much larger and more mature than China’s, which explains the different rates. 

2. The US economy experienced a huge surge in the 3rd quarter. I’ve seen estimates between 20% and 35% growth. 

3. US GDP is presently lower than pre-GDP totals, but we may be close. 

4.  It is possible that we could get back to pre-COVID GDP levels in Q4. But projections for Q4 are presently low growth. 

5. If you want to make a meaningful comparison, compare China after Q3 to the US after Q4. After all, China went through its worst crisis a few months earlier than the US. 

6.  Bottom line, it is too early to make a definitive comparison. Wait until January."
2020-10-19 13:22:06,"According to Johns Hopkins, to date China had 90,972 cases and 4739 deaths. Does anyone really believe those numbers with a government that has total control on all information. No one will ever know what happened in China in regards to COVID.

Give the news of massive deaths and cases from indirect information such as shortage of caskets, overwhelmed hospitals and finding dead people on the streets. It could very well be that China has already reached herd immunity with vast  majority of their populations already infected and immune."
2020-10-19 13:22:48,"The 4.9% GDP in the 3rd quarter is nothing to brag about. But the momentum will carry China into next year and beyond while we are still struggling with infectious disease.

The lesson should be obvious.  The hardship of Wuhan lockdowns to stop virus apparently worked in China.  Zero tolerance in Melbourne lockdowns, adopted tactics similar to Wuhan, also showed very promising result in Australia.   Why can't we learn and use similar approach to stop virus?  

If we prefer slow and tedious struggle fighting with the virus that results in painful and tumbling economy recovery, we will suffer a long time.  Or we can use harsh lockdowns to endure short term pain and then enjoy fast recovery.  The choice is ours to make."
2020-10-19 13:27:12,"It just shows what can be accomplished with a disciplined response to the coronavirus although China relies on authoritarian rule to achieve it.  I would not be willing to give up personal freedoms and a democracy for it.  The American people have still not realized the need to have a united front and care for your fellow man to fight the virus as was found during WWII.  Yes, we are in a war where the enemy has invaded our home front but because Americans can't see it many can't appreciate the danger and we have a national leader who just doesn't care except for himself."
2020-10-19 13:27:28,China clearly has the environment to make and spread viruses and the autocratic regime to respond to them effectively.
2020-10-19 13:27:37,"This is devastating for the United States place in the future world leadership arena. Not only had we, over the past four years, mostly withdrawn from world politics, but our abject mismanagement of this pandemic is going to leave us as an afterthought over the next decade. And yes, we live in a global society/economy, what affects one country affects us all to some extent. 

This has significant ramifications on our position to influence and affect global economic policy. Our position as the world's largest economy of consumption may save us somewhat, but our external image as, basically, a laughing stock at best and a cautionary tale of how not to govern at worst, will diminish our perceived capacity to lead. China is and will continue to eclipse us.

While I understand we cannot have the same draconian controls imposed on our lives as we see in some other countries, I believe we can do better, not only with the pandemic, but with how we participate in global affairs. We're one world connected in myriad ways through communication, climate change, energy needs, economy, commerce, investments, and strife. 

We can do better, but I fear the outcomes of how this pandemic were and are being handled will leave our already slipping global image of leadership irretrievably shattered - with confidence in our country something we'll have to earn rather than just bought. Moreso because we may soon not have the populace left with the spending power to consume as we have."
2020-10-19 13:29:03,"Most Americans would not like to live the Chinese way. Following strict rules and social norms. 

The communist party has built its power base on a society that long has been used to severe restrictions on personal freedoms.

Those are sacrifices made both out of necessity and out of deference to a greater cause, of family and society.

That may be changing in the new China, but most people still must adhere to customs and norms that would make many Americans feel not only uncomfortable, but downright hostile."
2020-10-19 13:31:56,"This is precisely where the pandemic—the whole problem in the first place—began. Rather than running an article about China’s success at controlling the virus, a series on how it BEGAN, and how to prevent another one from beginning, would be wiser and more useful. Why has there been no talk (at least none that I have heard) of having an international task force come into China—against their will if necessary—to inspect, regulate and shutdown—exotic animal markets like the one where COVID started. Because we aren’t thinking about the origin of the virus enough—connected as it is specifically with China—there is a good chance another pandemic will arise, once again rooted in China."
2020-10-19 13:10:16,"I'm struck by the photo of Apple and Nike stores in Beijing, where student protestors for democracy were shot down by tanks in Tiananman Square, in a country abusing the human rights of its Uighur population and snuffing out democracy in Taiwan. Back when the Times was doing excellent coverage of the initial Wuhan lockdown effort to beat COVID 19, I realized we were in for some bad times, as that type of lockdown is anathema to democracy.  The irony of China's success in battling COVID 19 is all the more bitter, as the virus continues to explode in the USA, killing our citizens and taking our economy down, while Trump champions personal choice to wear masks and social distance as American freedom."
2020-10-19 13:23:45,China's leader probably just listened to their scientists and took control of a nationwide health problem rather than having a weak president deflectithe problems to their governors.

And these so called ""Freedom Fighters"" are further motivated to not wear masks by the many Republican Governors and/or State legislatures that will not set mandates to wear masks because they also believe it's a matter of individual freedom being exercised and not a matter for Government purview or interference in an individuals rights/freedoms....Despite the threat and risk it imposed on all others?

YET...

Many of those ""exercising their right to freedom"" and their Republican led States and Politicians that agree with them nd their right...have no compulsion writing legislation that takes away a woman's right to choose and criminalizes abortions even if a woman becomes pregnant by rape (even by her father!) or loses her baby by accident .

They have been lying and/or withholding information ever since the the Covid problem started.  They are not about to tell you the truth about their economy.  They have been having crop failures due to massive flooding, several hot spots since the initial release and in general, continued with the abuse of minority populations in their borders.   The Times needs to get reporters or sources back in China to see the truth.  Until then, anything coming out of there should be considered suspect."
2020-10-19 13:28:25,"As I understand and recall covid-19 history,  the initial human infections from which all others stemmed very likely came from a wet market or virology lab under CCP rule.  As I recall, there were safety complaints about the Wuhan virology site.  Regarding the ""Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market"", the Wikipedia entry writes:
Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huanan_Seafood_Wholesale_Market#Items_sold"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huanan_Seafood_Wholesale_Market#Items_sold</a>

""However, Time reported it to have ""unsanitary"" conditions.[13] It had narrow lanes and stalls in close proximity, where livestock were kept alongside dead animals. According to Business Insider, it was common to see animals openly slaughtered and carcasses skinned in the market.[14] The New York Times reported that ""sanitation was dismal with poor ventilation and garbage piled on wet floors.""""

If the source was a wet market with conditions promoting a virus jump to humans, or a virology lab with poor safety and both are under CCP rule  they are responsible for the start of the Pandemic IMO.  If China covered then up the origin including punishing whistle blowers, and curtailed domestic travel from Wuhan as International travel continued, they bear responsibility for hastening the spread IMO.  As a history reminder, here is a clip from a Jan 14th WHO tweet.
""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China

Trump, the federal government and too many state governments essentially tried to wish the Covid19 pandemic away. We elected a multiple-times bankrupt, not too intelligent businessman to be the leader of the country. Instead of showing leadership, he put on a very inferior ""reality"" TV show which totally ignored what those in the epidemiology community knew. And because of Trump's incompetence and bumbling action more than 200 million are now dead and many millions more will die. China followed the ""Science"" and their economy is booming while America's economy is failing. We are in such bad shape today because Trump was more concerned about his self image than anything else. We knew what an incompetent liar he was before 2016. Yet too many voted for him in spite of his lack of anything that would have told them that he would be a competent leader. Everything we know about Trump in 2020 is what we knew in 2016. The real question is how all those who voted for Trump in 2016 will explain that to their children? How can those running for public office today as Republicans explain to their constituencies why they still support such an incompetent self-serving delusional (or lying) narcissist???  America will be hurting for decades because of Trump's 4 years as POTUS."

How come China had only few parts of it affected? When all countries are still struggling to find a foot hold of economy, how could Chinese economy see such a surge? Something is beyond comprehension. Definitely a thorough and detailed investigation has to be madel at the origin of the virus. Something is amiss."

China is uniquely heavy-handed, but their public health measures are effective. However, ALL of the European nations, with the exceptions of Spain (which is having an appalling outbreak) and Belgium (which counts deaths differently from other nations) have fewer deaths per million and cases per million than the USA, because they have implemented and enforced public health measures.

The vast majority of developed nations, from Germany to Canada to Korea to Finland to Australia, have done much better than the USA because they have governments that communicate, effectively and clearly, the best practices to keep the pandemic under control. And their people listen. It's not rocket science, it's just good government.

Wikipedia's page for ""Covid-19 Pandemic in the USA"" shows a Trump supporter in his MAGA hat holding a sign that says ""LOCKDOWN KILLED MY BUSINESS.""

Nope.  To you, Mr. MAGA man, I say this:  Trump's hardcore base, the 40% of Republicans who refuse to wear masks, are what killed your business.  No matter what the rest of us who love and respect our fellow American's right to life do,  no matter how much we wear our masks and practice social distancing, we will never be able to conquer the pandemic in America until those 40% of  your non-mask-wearing Republicans friends who worship your false Trumpian god get onboard with the religion of E Pluribus Unum and don the true colors of America, which is respect to the right of life for your fellow citizens.  

I don't like wearing a mask.  But I do it because it's required.  Mask wearing is not some plot by twinkle toed, Birkenstock-clad snowflakes to take your guns and force your children to consider a genderfluid lifestyle. No, buddy, it's common sense, like brushing your teeth.  If you don't brush your teeth then they start falling out of your mouth in your 40's.  When people don't wear masks, the virus runs rampant and people are afraid to go out into public and do business.

What killed your business was Washington didn't take the virus seriously and call on all Americans to sacrifice by wearing masks and observing distancing protocols.  In a word, what killed your business?   Trump."

2020-10-19 13:47:35,"The time is vast approaching when Americans will have to contend with the decades of Cold War propaganda that have clouded their judgment not only of countries like China but of the U.S. itself. This celebrated ""freedom"" that Americans believe they have is fairly laughable to outsiders. We have the ""freedom"" to die from lack of affordable health care. We have the ""freedom"" to take out thousands of dollars in loans and spend huge chunks of our life in debt just to get an education and health care. We have the ""freedom"" to have our tax money handed over to corporations and billionaires, all of whom happily drain the public coffer, destroying our infrastructure and leaving the country in a state of 3rd World status. We have the ""freedom"" to elect a narcissistic billionaire tv host as our president. We have the ""freedom"" to watch our Supreme Court get packed with pro-corporate stooges hiding behind a thin veil of religiosity as a moral cover. 

And let's also consider the claims that China is an authoritarian police state. Considering that the U.S. has 3 times as many people in prison than China, which has three times our population, I think Americans may want to spend a moment to consider who is really living in a police state. 

The truth is that no one but the rich are free in America. The reason Covid has destroyed so many lives here is because the average person's life in America is of no interest to the powers-that-be, all of whom have access to elite health care."

This reliance fuels also resentment - an issue Beijing can’t ignore, given its handling of the virus at the beginning of the year.

I'd like to offer some reassurance on that point:  China's economy isn't built on any version of communism that Marx, Engels, any of the instigators of the Russian revolution would recognize.  China's economy is a market-based economy, not a planned and micromanaged one of the sort that repeatedly failed Russia.  Additionally, while China has a totalitarian society, it's run by leaders who place as much importance on their nation's status and growth as they do on their own personal power and wealth.  

That priority doesn't exist in Russia.  Instead, Russia has a handful of absurdly wealthy oligarchs and a dictator controlling them like puppets.  Not one of those oligarchs cares about their nation.
    
Why mention Russia?  Because Trump has been blinded by the glare of power and wealth he sees and admires in Russia, and wants to create a new United States based on the Russian model.  It would never occur to Trump to use wealth and power to achieve national greatness."
2020-10-19 14:48:55,"Not that I'm in favor of China's political system but it has proven effective in combating Covid 19. With that said, if the administration had taken a different stance on the seriousness of this disease and the benefits of social distancing and mask wearing, we would also be much better off and much closer to pushing or economy ahead. 

By choosing to ignore basic science and even common sense, the Trump administration has given China a big leg up with regard to their economy and a much stronger bargaining position with respect to future trade negations.

Good work...the Trump administration has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory."

2020-10-19 14:51:17,"Why China is better in dealing with its epidemic

It is an authoritarian government, with 24/7 A.I. assisted face reorganization at every corner,  a Communist Party watch dog per city block, and a history of locking up  dissident citizens  without trial .  And hence more successful than a Democracy in suppressing a virus that originated in its central region than a Democracy like the US

There is no doubt, if the US had a similar 24/7 A.I. surveillance face recognition surveillance  program of every one of its citizens,  and a policy of locking up dissidents the epidemic would better controlled.

But to praise the Chinese approach as a model for the US is to endorse a dictatorship over Democracy"
2020-10-19 14:57:00,"It's not just China. Asian countries where matters of personal hygiene and health are ingrained into the culture have faired better than western counties. Simple things like wearing face masks and removing shoes indoors is a nothing burger. China, South Korea and Japan have flattened the curve, all are infinitely more densely populated than Florida or Texas.

This has nothing to do with ""freedom"" or authoritarianism. In Japan the public wears face masks during cold and flu season without hesitation. I've been in board meetings where people voluntarily wear masks because they didn't want to spread viruses to others. 

There is a sense of do simple things for the public good that exists in these countries that no long exist in the US. Republicans have fed Americans a diet of selfishness, that silo'ed the public. When you only think about yourself it's easier to divide and conquer. We no longer have a sense of shared sacrifice in order to conquer adversary or do great things. 

How far have we fallen from the greatest generation of WWII who went though rationing, blackouts and curfews, when the wealthy paid 90% effective taxes to win a war. Now we're a nation of cry babies who think wearing a piece of cloth is giving up their freedoms. They're willing to kill grandma so they can party it up at a bar. Sad."

After all, China belong to the other, the authoritarian (even totalitarian which people really don't know what it means), and we are a democracy. If America had been made ""great"" again, how come China is doing so well and we are not? Truth hurts. We must wake up and strengthen our institutions that have been so damaged by Trump.

A nation cannot flourish in this era with policies that drastically change from one Administration to another.   National leaders cannot be chosen by voters biased by religious, anti-science, narrow states rights, isolationist attitudes.  China's leadership cares about the health and economic well-being of its people and their education for the modern world.  In America, public health is laissez-faire, determined state by state.  Economic well-being of citizens is less important to leadership than well-being of the very wealthy and of corporations because that's where donations come from.  Public education is a matter of being lucky or unlucky where you live and even then, chances of a good science background for students are very uneven.

With COVID-19 out of control, America's economy will continue to tank. Thanks to Donald J. Trump, who thinks he can revive the economy by killing and incapacitating a large portion of the American population. Two hundred and twenty thousand dead and over eight million Americans infected by the COVID-19 are the least of DONALD J.TRUMP'S concern. He and his newly recruited COVID-19 advisor, Dr. Scott Atlas want to promote HERD IMMUNITY, which according to the real health experts, would mean MASS MURDER. But Trump doesn't care. To him, the death of millions of Americans is a fair price for his reelection. 

And that is precisely what Trump has been trying to accomplish by holding massive rallies every day with no restrictions whatsoever for mask-wearing and social-distancing. While he forges ahead with his rallies with no qualms or compunction about his supporters' well-being, his followers are willing to sacrifice their lives for DONALD J. TRUMP, as their sacred duty.  Is it any wonder that while the American economy continues to falter, the Chinese economy has taken off due, in large part, to the prudent actions taken by the Chinese government to control the spread of this deadly pandemic?

2020-10-19 18:10:40,"The problem here is that, just as with Trump, you can't believe anything China tells us. Look at all the wise and virtuous nations of Europe. They imposed and accepted the lockdowns last spring. That brought the virus under control. Then they opened up. Now the virus is roaring back. I think China is just hiding the numbers of cases and deaths."
2020-10-19 18:32:56,"But meanwhile, Trump says just today that if he had listened to and followed the advice of scientists and public health experts, the US would be in the middle of a major depression. Make no mistake, we are suffering economically in this country because we haven’t taken care of the national infection. China, on the other hand, took severe measures initially, continues to test, trace and quarantine hot spots, and consequently has been able to open schools, shops, the economy."

2020-10-19 18:20:17,"I’m not surprised. Chinese products are strongly, perhaps overly represented on internet sales platforms like Amazon, Walmart and their likes on Europe. China reaps the benefit of changed consumer behavior towards online ordering during the pandemic. 
But we must not forget that their products are manufactured in factories with dormitories for low wage workers, and sometimes with coerced Uyghurs. Import taxes do not sufficiently offset that “advantage” against middle class blue collar wages. I hope Joe Biden tries to level the playfield for American workers, instead of going back to neoliberal business as usual. Ross Perot was half right about that giant sucking sound: it turned out to be China’s terms of entering the WTO that did most of the job damage, with NAFTA a distant second."

2020-10-19 20:24:41,"Americans continue to use the Capitalist-Socialist/communist  or Democratic/Autocratic label to ""explain"" the difference between the US and China, but those labels are in some ways misleading.  A more appropriate label for China and other Asian countries would be a restoration of Confucianism as the driving cultural influence. In China and other Asian countries, it would simply be unacceptable for the government to pursue a policy that resulted in a much  large percentage of seniors dying.   They are also much more likely to judge their own behavior and misbehavior in on its impact not only on themselves, but also on others, including impact on  their families, their cities and even their country.  In other words, many American conservatives may well share many of the same outlook."
2020-10-19 20:29:44,"China has been able to shift from chaos to networks of complexity, supported by massive test and trace with rapid sensing of when Covid-19 outbreaks occur.  The west has lost that option and must hope endemic infection and evolved responses eventually provide the same shift.  The long game is still in play what ever the article implies about China's strategy"
2020-10-19 12:41:54,"While China’s COVID success is impressive, their infrastructure campaign is truly admirable and forward thinking. 

Meanwhile the US has squandered a period of historically low interest rates when our government could cheaply borrow to restore and expand our infrastructure. We have crumbling bridges and roadways, zero high speed rail, deteriorating 19th century water and sewer systems, etc.  Government funded infrastructure projects would create jobs and secure our future competitiveness.  A win-win. 

Instead we lavish unnecessary tax breaks on corporations and the wealthy that create no ‘trickle down’ jobs and no investment in our future."
2020-10-19 21:18:40,"Two weeks ago a Chinese city experienced a virus outbreak of 12, yes 12 positive tests. The government’s reaction was to close the city and test 9 million - yes, 9 million - people.

2020-10-19 22:28:29,"The relative health of the American and Chinese economies is due to forces that pre-date the election of Donald Trump. On July 13, 2001 the International Olympic Committee gave Beijing the 2008 Olympic Games. That spurred massive investments in infrastructure, not only in Beijing, but across China. On September 11, 2001, America was attacked by terrorists. Our response was spend roughly the same amount as China spent on the Olympics, but on counter terrorism and surveillance. 

Arguably, China has more than closed the surveillance gap; its citizens are monitored in myriad, highly sophisticated and often intrusive ways. However, America did not close the physical infrastructure gap. While the physical infrastructure enabled the Coronavirus to spread so quickly -- for example, Wuhan Railway Station (2009), Wuhan Metro line #4, (2013), Wuhan International Airport Terminal 3 (2017) -- it was countered by surveillance infrastructure of lockdowns, temperature checks and mandatory quarantines. 

There's no denying that America is a vastly freer society than China, but China's economy is on the upswing while America struggles with the pandemic. America is safe from terrorism, but we remain unsafe from each other in a country where so much of our physical infrastructure  desperately needs to be rebuilt or replaced."
2020-10-19 23:59:36,"We don't take lessons from Asia and have been too Eurocentric in our world view. Every comparison I've seen is with Europe and a focus on Sweden. And that's where we lose, China has no qualms about learning from us. Name me a single thing we have learnt from China, arguably the most successful economy in the last forty years? To even mention something positive about China will illicit a knee-jerk lecture on authoritarianism and human rights.  Go take a look at the earlier articles on contact tracing, we were so dismissive of it, citing Big Brother concerns. 

Now if we didn't want to use mainland China as a model, we could have at least considered Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and even Singapore. They are Democratic and have successfully controlled the virus."
2020-10-20 02:53:11,"China’s relative success in containing the pandemic is due to the fact that its government is held to be responsible by the Chinese people. There is nothing to derails it’s legitimacy than masses of people die off of the pandemic.

In the early phase, the Chinese government took in tremendous amount of public anger. It was able to do a much better job afterwards and has now completely turned the tide of public opinion."
2020-10-20 04:08:42,"American attitude and handling of the covid-19 pandemic can be compared to the Demolition Derby of bone-crushing self-inflicted damages, or a Horror Movie where the victims always wander into rooms and attics we know are life threatening. The only reason for tuning into Trump's super-spreader rallies on TV is to see how many people in the crowd wear mask. In both cases it is scary, exciting and weirdly entertaining to watch. 

There are those who parrot Pompeo's China-bashing script and disbelieve China's economic recovery data. Do Chinese leaders lose any sleep due to their doubts? Chinese planners probably watched the Sturgis motorcycle rally and estimated how many months it will set back recovery of American economy. Same with observing each Trump super-spreader events. The more Trump fans without mask in the rally crowds, the deeper the economic hole they dig by prolonging the pandemic. Another kind of Rocky Horror Picture Show."
2020-10-20 04:35:45,"As someone who is moderate in my views on China, I was pleasantly surprised to see this article.

The fact is that even with all of its problems, there are many things that China does better than the West (particularly the USA)."
2020-10-20 04:22:58,Yes I jealous. China may be at fault for unleashing this virus but no one can deny that they also took waged a comprehensive defense against it. They enforced mask wearing and social distancing and quickly waged attacks on hotspot flareups.  Our country on the other hand has groups of people who are still locked into the ridiculous belief that this pandemic is a hoax and that mask wearing somehow is an assault against their constitutional rights. For this we all must suffer. We have been our own enemy by not strongly enforcing as well as by not adhering to the protocals that would have greatly limited the spread of this disease in United States.

As a possible game-changer, there should be some mention of the medicine and corresponding studies."

They have found that the brady-kinin sysytem gets disturbed and most of the symptoms throughout the body are from this. They have tested drugs just recently that may be somewhat of a ""cure"". One is icantabant. The results of a small test of this drug was very successful. It stops the brady kinin storm and drastically decreased the need for O2 for the patients in intensive care. Google it, very promising."

Thanks for the story.  Inspiring.  I'm grateful."
2020-10-19 14:37:53,"Every infectious disease requires that an individual be exposed to a minimal number of infectious particles in to cause infection and disease. Infectivity for a specific virus is often assessed by determining the number of virus particles  required to infect 50% of individuals exposed to that virus, i.e., the Infectious Dose -50 or the ID-50; it is characteristic for a given virus. If the ID-50 for the Covid-19 virus is 1,000, individuals must be exposed to at least 1,000 virus particles for 50% to become infected. What happens to those exposed to fewer virus particles? Less than 50% would become infected; the remainder might generate an antibody response sufficient to generate partial immunity. Thus, wearing a face mask, social distancing, avoiding large indoor gatherings, and frequent handwashing accomplishes are effective practices for that very reason. This might explain the fact that, although there has been an appreciable increase in the  number of tests now being done and a larger percentage of individuals test positive, the number of new hospital admissions -- as well as mortalities and the severity if disease due to Covid-19 -- has not increased correspondingly. Thus, wearing a face mask, social distancing, limiting exposure to large gatherings, and frequent handwashing is quite effective as experts have maintained. Until a vaccine is available to augment such natural immunity, it is the best course of action to take to promote the public health."

I was a COVID-19 long-hauler.  Despite having a mild case, I spent months feeling absolutely exhausted and easily winded.  Learning about respiratory therapy from a friend that's a doctor in Australia is what enabled me to rapidly regain a normal life.  All it took was a $40 positive expiratory pressure device and the discipline to use it every day.  My breathing ability and energy levels recovered rapidly, starting within just a few weeks.

I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. I didn’t get hospitalized, but this was the worst I have ever felt. I coughed for five months straight.
Since March I had three z packs, a round of doxy, albuterol, also glutathione capsules used as steam. Took NAC, elecampgne herb, various tincture of mushrooms, cats claw, high dose vitamin D, melatonin, holy basil. 
Did some rounds of mucinex which I felt like I was going to die from - so much fluid expelled from my lungs it was frightening.

I'm surprised they found any celebrity that would indirectly endorse Trump policies. Clearly, after Trump and his swamp dwellers leave office the Biden Administration needs to begin investigations on misspent or lost funds and start prosecution and civil actions to recover. Most of his programs probably don't pass legal muster and could be found to have issues leading to recovery."

Instead we’re left with an array of sycophants whose only apparent skill set is to regularly cite the president’s non existent leadership, insuring his record of zero accountability remained unsullied. Their breathtaking incompetence got us to where we are today - as Trump is fond of describing “No ones ever seen anything like it “.

How insulting therefore, to these suffering Americans, that Trump can choose to allocate $265 million of hard earned taxpayer dollars; (tax which he does not pay incidentally unlike the majority of the population), to a campaign to ""defeat despair"" regarding COVID19 and specifically the obviously and overtly party political stance, namely, that ""helping the President will help the country.""

 I understand that this is all illegal under US election law. 

 Ultimately none of this political campaign at public expense worked out because Trump is obviously too toxic even for the 10 celebrities whittled down from an initial 267 celebrities, but Trump still managed to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to private companies. This sounds all highly suspect and something which will need to be looked at carefully.

Many of these celebrities where rejected when vetted by Michael R Caputo because they were not pro- Trump enough or supported gay and LGBQT rights. Has anyone told Trump therefore, that the music he has been trying to strut his stuff too recently at his rallies such as YMCA and Macho Man does not fit into Trumps prejudiced world view because Village People are an iconic gay band?"

If that was truly Mr. Caputo’s motivation, I wish he had been successful. I want Mr. Trump’s followers to wear masks, and to get vaccinated (against the flu now, and against COVID eventually), both so they can help protect everyone else, and because I don’t want human beings to die, even if they support someone I find repugnant.

But the truly pathetic thing is that Caputo already has a hugely influential celebrity on their side: Trump. If Mr. Trump equated wearing masks and getting vaccines with supporting him, I bet his followers would do it.

I'd love to see the script they had planned. I bet it would go something like, Trump barred Chinese visitors and Biden called him Xenophobic for it.

Trump lucked out and didn't die when he got it, so that means you will be fine too even if you're obese, without health insurance, and in your 70s!  Most of the cases don't count anyway because they had other conditions at the same time.  If we just stopped testing, then all the cases we missed wouldn't exist!

- supporting gay marriage.

- being a Democrat.

- supporting Planned Parenthood.

In other words, if any of these celebrities had any taint of ""liberal"" leanings - they were ""subversives"" who would taint the political purity of this Trumpian culture war crusade.

This reminds me of the right of an invidual in the US to carry gun is considered more important than the right of the group, i.e. majority of Americans, to feel safe when going about their businesses such as going to school or church.

Therein lies the utter STUPIDITY of people promoted by a conman to help him con the American public. And the irony of a people who call themselves UNITED STATES but disregarding the compromises by individuals but necessary for the common good of the WHOLE.

These are public funds, and that  discrimination is a criminal offense. Redfield seems to have been asleep at the wheel; Azar on board.

This expenditures of hundreds of millions wasn't about reducing infection rates or mortality, it was simply about lionizing the 'Great Leader'. Why is none of this surprising?

2020-10-29 22:45:35,"So, someone remind me again how this drains swamps.

Because it sure looks like the opposite of that to me."
2020-10-29 22:55:57,"This is a fantastic publicity campaign.  At least for those celebrities who were rejected.   I would be so proud to be described as a fighter for gay rights or a supporter of Planned Parenthood.   I knew I liked all these folks for a reason.  

“The singer Christina Aguilera “is an Obama-supporting Democrat and a gay-rights supporting liberal.” Adam Levine of the band Maroon 5 “fights for gay rights.” Justin Timberlake “supports gay marriage.”  Dakota Johnson, the actress, once “wore a pin to support Planned Parenthood.” And Sarah Jessica Parker, the actress, was tagged as an “L.G.B.T.Q. supporter including marriage equality.”"
2020-10-29 22:49:24,"One may wish that Caputo and others assisting him or like him will be charged with crimes, such as illegally diverting $300,000,000 in Congressional appropriations to the CDC.  But it seems more likely there will be no consequences to breaking the law and subverting the government, not even if Biden wins.

Meanwhile, protestors in Arizona and elsewhere are charged with the crime of being present while police baselessly arrest them.  (The crime is called ""resisting arrest"" and ""assaulting a police officer"", which in Arizona apparently means not putting the handcuffs on yourself.)"
2020-10-29 22:47:29,"As a young man, I worked at a boutique ad agency that counted Oliver North's PAC among its clients. Basically, we were making political ads for GOP Congress candidates using Iran-Contra money, it turned out. This reminds me so much of North & Co.'s responses and notes toward the creative, with what was important to them. We laughed and made fun of them around the office, but there was also a sense of dread that we were sliding toward the grossly unethical, especially when we were asked to come up with ads promoting Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. 

The big difference, I suppose, it that our clients, with the exception of North himself, were actually gay. As a gay man myself, I'm distressed to read the level of homophobia that has infected the GOP, in this day and age. However, it's not generally a mainstream GOP flaw. This makes me believe Caputo is something of a lunatic outlier."

2020-10-29 23:04:38,"Anyone else but Trump would quickly be arrested for trying to pull a scam like this using public money.

But Trump is correct saying, ""I could stand In the middle Of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters...""

He will not be arrested either as he has already shaped our government into a petty dictatorship. If he wins the upcoming election, the United States will never again be the leader of the free world."

2020-10-29 23:32:15,"The most stunning use of taxpayer dollars IMHO is the way the Trump administration --and whoever is making the complex geo-political decisions he's incapable of -- used a taxpayer funded invention called the internet, filled it with pay-ops devised by the Pentagon with taxpayer dollars to manipulate us into American on American violence the same way ISIS recruited abroad. 

We have literally paid for the strategy they're using to cause our Republic to crumble."

2020-10-30 00:34:23,What a crack research team.  You just need to know these celebrities' names and you would already know who they all support.  Not really much in-depth exploration needed.
2020-10-30 00:40:08,"Well.

Here we are on the last lap of the Trump presidency and it’s still amateur hour.

The first week in the White House, meetings were held under the lights from mobile phones as not one staff could work the light switches.

Four years later, nothing has changed.

Sheer incompetence is the hallmark of this administration."
2020-10-30 00:48:43,"Are you sure this isn’t the treatment for a new Mel Brooks movie lampooning a hapless, bankrupt reality “star” turned president and his team of hacks? Because this buffoonery has me rolling with laughter."

2020-10-30 01:16:33,Kid Rock is not a cause celebre?
2020-10-30 01:20:11,"I’m shocked, SHOCKED that no celebrities want to publicly declare their support; they may be conservative but they also want to keep earning."
2020-10-30 01:21:16,Just give the $265 million to help kids with special needs who are falling behind because of the virus and having to stay home from school with no supports. Or maybe give it to people who are struggling to stay in business. How about to the people with chronic conditions who are at risk and have to isolate? Spending it on a PR campaign to distract from reality is a disgrace when people are really in need of help.

2020-10-30 01:34:53,"Plenty to feel outraged over here, but really I just want to comment on the ""between two ferns"" thing. I mean, all politics aside, I think zack really passed up an opportunity to produce one of the weirdest and cringeworthy moments in TV history. I understand why he passed on it (and I laugh just thinking that some trump publicist thought it might be a good idea), but as a fan of the show, I regret that he did."
2020-10-30 01:48:17,"$250,000,000 for a public relations campaign?

(No, nothing he did made the economy bloom and people at the bottom are still waiting for their share; the tax break to billionaires pushed the public deficit to the roof, to $1 trillion.)   What is it that 1/3 of voters continue to see in him, considering his personal and family history, continuous lies (fact-checked 23,000, 50 lies a day), racism, bigotry, misogyny, violence, verbal incompetence, political and economic ignorance, lack of leadership, mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic (one quarter of Americans dead, thousands hospitalized, 9 million affected).

2020-10-30 03:09:48,"We would have avoided a great deal of despair and numbers of deaths, if Trump had not shelved a plan last Spring.  It would have had the Postal Service deliver a packet of 5 reusable masks with instructions to every household in the country."

As with all those musicians demanding that Trump stop using their music at his rallies.  Does he (and his conservative supporters) know anything about The Village People as he was trying to boogie to the ‘YMCA’ the other night ? or do they do not truly care, except as a way to keep certain people ‘in’ and others out of power?"
2020-10-30 03:28:55,"Maybe if they invested $265 million in legitimate medical research to produce a vaccine or distribute masks or do literally anything more legitimate, instead of blowing it on a... marketing campaign to... lie to the American people like we're a bunch of toddlers and tell us everything is alright.

2020-10-30 03:44:09,"One thing I learned is that leadership simply is getting people to do things because:

1. you tell them to.
2. you pay them to.
3.  you are doing it.

To get people to wear masks, all Trump had to do to is any of the above.  This would have been far more effective than any $285M advertising campaign. This simply would have consisted of a statement that everyone should wear a mask, that the purchase of masks would have been a direct tax credit, and he would be seen wearing a mask in public.  And not contradict himself and mock people who were following his mandate. Somehow this was too complicated.  And how many lives would have been saved?  And he would have been reelected."

Only in Trump world is supporting the law and Constitution a bar to employment!"
2020-10-30 03:54:31,Is anyone surprised at another corruption of our government. Is anyone surprised by another Trump diversion from his malfeasance and false boasting. I am really fed up with listening and reading of Trump’s boasts about “the economy”. By any reasoned metric the only legitimate claim that Trump has credibility with is that he continued the growth of the Obama/Biden years. And I am even more frustrated by the Democrat’s apparent concession to Trump’s claims of personal responsibility for the “success” of an already growing economy prior to COVID19. The Democrat allusions to the economy since COVID19 are hollow and valueless when either their god or China is easily adopted by the public as the true responsible entity. Without an understanding of the facts of the economic strengths handed to Trump by Obama/Biden the public will buy into Trump’s false bravado once again.

We may have a VP who could be capable of crafting indictments for every last one of them and they need to be called to answer for their misuse of our hard earned tax dollars. 

There had better be a reckoning, and justice better be swift because this nonsense has cost us everything, and many have perished, our grandchildren's future is threatened by their actions. 

If the GOP are foolish enough to believe that they can steal elections, pack the courts, and Madoff the American taxpayer, they have not been paying attention. We are mobilized and there are many many more of us than there are of you.

2020-10-30 05:35:10,"First of all, Azar is wholly unsuitable to lead HHS since he is an attorney & lobbyist- with zero expertise or competence regarding health or human services.
Secondly, everyone knows that the cover story that Trump wants to promote- that he seeks to prevent panic & lift spirits requires with reckless ad campaigns & misinformation. The real goal has always been to boost the Market before the election. Pandemic denial became pro-MAGA...donkey to serve Trump’s re-election scheme. Illness, death, decimated hospital care  was compared to the anguish of economic havoc. The true solution was to manage the virus so safe reopening could occur. Panic & despair would best be managed with sound public health policies; shut downs are a fake threat. Masks HEPA filters, ventilation & distancing Could have saved America immense medical & economic pain.
What a grotesque act of cynical self-promotion to spend $250M seeking celebrity pep talkers for Trump’s cover story, con & hype! 
No wonder, Caputo went kaput."
2020-10-30 05:36:21,"Mr. Trump simply must serve time in jail, whether federal or state prison. This wanton waste of taxpayer money must stop, and it appears the only way to do so is by imprisonment of the ringleader and the lackeys."
2020-10-30 05:40:03,"A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away....American presidents didn’t have to line up “celebrities” to “defeat pessimism”. They were able to connect with their fellow citizens through true heartfelt empathy, oratory and an authentic hopeful optimism. They took ownership of this and got it done! The Trump Administration’s belief that they really needed to somehow subcontract this on the taxpayers’ dime is as good an indicator as anything the degree to which they are utter losers in this arena of political motivation."

The taxpayers here had the wonderful chance to pay for a PR campaign crafted to benefit Trump.  I'm glad that the effort apparently failed.  It also shows, yet again, that Trump never drained the swamp; he enlarged it."
2020-10-30 10:19:57,"When you spend four years trying to build a false image of a man who won an election on fake news, no one wants to hang around for the political tsunami that has been steadily building strength since the day he took office, visible now from every angle imaginable, turning his fake news approach into bad news for him next Tuesday. 

The Republicans haven’t accepted that everything has changed since the drunken gory of a stolen election in 2016. Most Americans have learned to tell the truth between fact and fiction, while Republicans think no one is more clever than their failed leader."

I am quite sure that the only reason 45 glided down the golden escalator and threw his hat into the ring was to improve his celebrity brand and line his family's pockets and anyone else's who was willing to sell their soul for a dollar bill.

“Mr. Caputo, a fierce ally of Mr. Trump, had drawn attention to the public relations campaign last month during an extended rant on Facebook, claiming that the president had personally put him in charge of the project and that career government scientists were engaging in “sedition” to undermine the president. He is on medical leave battling cancer.”"
2020-10-30 08:41:58,"No wonder the $265 million pro-Trump campaign failed. They've got so much money to spend but no brains - it should be ""helping the country will help the president"" not ""helping the president will help the country"". They got it all wrong.

I have a suggestion, however, for how to preserve live, in-theater viewing. Perhaps states and local jurisdictions, wherever possible, can preserve the buildings themselves from sale or destruction, through rent moratoriums, tax incentives, etc., and mothball the structures until it is safe for audiences to attend. This would include saving theaters owned by companies that go out of business: no matter what happens financially, try to save the buildings and their screens.

After the virus is curbed, have local public libraries take over derelict theaters owned by failing companies, and have the libraries take up some of the slack or the movie industry. In addition to screening new releases in evenings and weekends, they could hold ongoing educational events throughout the week, screening movies aimed at school children of various ages, including both documentaries and film history classes. Possibly these programs could be curated by film preservation societies and educational groups. Libraries could raise money locally while also helping the film industry out, and the experience of seeing movies in large audiences would be preserved as well.

Socialized film viewing? Well, it might be the only way to keep the movie business alive."

An essential worker is one who must continue to work despite clear risks to the worker, but covid-exposed essential workers are expected to stay separate from other essential workers (let alone the public itself) so as not to expose new people.  Pence is irresponsible to continue to go on campaign events that expose others, especially as his Sunday rally did not have require masks (and half didn't wear any), and Pence himself did not wear one. Testing clear is no protection - people are infectious before they test as infected.  We all know this, as does Pence.  He's willing to accept additional covid infections and deaths as a price he's willing to have his followers pay so that Trump and he can win the election.  No surprise there."

Statement on October 25, 2020 by Mark Meadows, Chief of Staff to the President of the United States. 


What did he mean? 


Let’s break down Meadows’ sentence straightforwardly, and with context, as you would do in, say, third grade.

 

“We” = the Trump administration, Republican Party, and its media outlet Fox News.

 “are not going” = have no policies, plans, or interest

 “to control” = to limit the number of cases and fatalities

 “the pandemic” = this illness which is caused by a coronavirus—but can be mitigated by safety precautions; it is not a hoax. 


What does our contextualized version of Meadows’ statement make explicit?  

“The Trump administration, Republican Party, and Fox News have no policies, plans, or interest in limiting the number of cases and deaths caused by preventable transmission of a deadly virus.”
 
Bluntly, Mr. Meadows and those he speaks for don’t necessarily want you to get sick or die; they just don’t care if you do.  For once they have told us the truth about this national emergency."

Seniors, minorities, and people with pre-morbidity conditions take note that a vote for Trump is a vote for a President who does not have the country's best interests at heart.  His re-election is is all that matters to him."
2020-10-26 03:47:51,"I really don't get people like Mark Meadows and Trumpettes who run around yelling that we aren't a police state and making people wear masks for their own safety and for that of others is a violation of their rights. Well excuse me, don't we have a law that all occupants of a moving vehicle on our roads MUST wear a seat belt at all times? And don't we have a law that mandates that every child in a moving vehicle that is under a certain height MUST be in a legal car seat? What? that doesn't upset their sense of rights to do as they please with their own and with children's lives? I never heard any big uproar over those laws. Why not? And those laws only protect you, in your car. You wearing a seat belt doesn't lower my risk in my car. But wearing a mask not only keeps you safe but you wearing a mask DOES keep me safe as well. So it would seem that wearing a mask has even more value to you and everyone around you whereas seat belts only help you if we hit each other. Your seat belt will do nothing to help me. But your mask WILL help me - it WILL keep you from breathing or sneezing your CoVid germs into my airspace! People sound ignorant and ridiculous when they try to use excuses about police state and their rights as reason for not using masks. It's bull. We have laws and rules we have to follow everyday that are more restrictive. It's an excuse these people use just to create drama and to cause disruption. Grow up. If this were antrax they'd wear more than a mask!"

Herd immunity was what they had in the Black Death and in every other plague until vaccination was discovered. Now we use vaccination as a short cut to herd immunity. Does that work? Well, it has worked completely for polio and smallpox. 

Trouble is, we have no vaccine yet, and even Trump's miracle treatment, Remdisivir, is expected to hit the market at a retail price around $3000/dose. Imagine what they may charge for the vaccine the poor must have to really make herd immunity work.

2020-10-26 03:56:00,"Consider this for one moment.

When Trump had the very first indication about the coronavirus and its possible and probable genesis in Wuhan, China he actually had a choice.  The choice was to engage with President Xi and find a universal path to stopping, controlling or doing everything possible to protect the public where ever they resided.  A universal humane gesture.  Instead Trump chose to alienate President Xi and kick sand in the face of the Chinese.

China's coronavirus  cases have currently flatlined.  Their cures whether TCM and/or vaccinations will now likely remain known to  China and/or may be shared with whom they choose.

Mr. Trump, you may be the last to realize you could have been a partner in the world's greatest humanitarian effort.  Prior to that many believed  the 21st century  to be  The Century of China."

2020-10-26 05:05:05,"It is not the infection of staff that raises the most serious questions.  It is Pence's decision to go right on campaigning in person before large and largely unmasked crowds even after he knows for certain that he has been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for CoVid-19.  The absolute disregard for the health and lives of Americans is mind boggling.  

Remember, the PCR CoVid-19 test is the most accurate available but it is unable to detect the virus for at least 2 - 4 days after exposure because the virus is in its incubation stage.  An exposed person can test negative multiple times and then suddenly turn positive when the virus moves from its incubation phase to the its early active stage in just a matter of hours.  Pence could test negative in the morning and then spread the virus to dozens or hundreds of people in the afternoon.  Those people, in turn, can then head out to create a community spread event.  Trump rallies in multiple states have been followed by sudden surges in case a few days later."

2020-10-26 08:25:34,"Yes, this is a huge challenge that neither the US nor Europe have faced since the Spanish flu. Restrictions are worse than even WWII for the people. 

It is also a balancing act because it is an all encompassing crisis, not only a health one that can only be faced by taking precautions while not destroying the economy ... not shutting down the whole country. If everything is shut down, people will starve (as is beginning to happen in NYC and others). Even bread lines could be impossible because of distancing restrictions. 

Time for people to take their responsibilities rather than want government to do everything for them. We can get through this but it will not be unscathed ... We are not a small Island like New Zealand. 

It is true that no-one can control the virus until we have a vaccine or it disappears as the Spanish flu, SARS, MeRS and others have. Is it wrong to speak truth to the people?"
2020-10-26 04:28:37,"This entire COVID response has been nothing like a reality TV show for Trump and his administration. Enough is enough. Seriously. 

The questions raised -about Trump’s virus response- 
are only for those who have the ability to be aware, and ask -critical- questions, and those who care for the answers.

For the rest, aka Trump supporters -and at this point including undecided voters-, there are no questions to be raised about Trump's virus response or mismanagement or lack of management. No question is necessary. Any answer is irrelevant. 

When a 5 year old is about to cross the street on a red light and the parents encourage the child to cross the street assuming there is nothing to panic, the child will attempt to cross and will not listen a stranger across the street trying to stop the child. At the end of the day, the child will listen the parents with whom there is a bond as opposed to a stranger.

Just like that, Trump base & supporters will not listen Biden, Fauci, CDC, FDA, etc. They have an emotional and/or financial bond with Trump, and they will only listen his words. His response to virus or lack there of doesn't matter. They only care about his words: ""The virus is going to go away, and we are around the corner""."
2020-10-26 09:13:43,"It is fitting that COVID-19 is now spreading inside Trump's home turf. Some might think of it as cosmic justice or God's revenge for Trump's handling of this health crisis in the US. If only Trump had reacted quickly by stopping foreign travelers from entering the US, or ordered local lock downs, or urged caution, this would not have been so bad. Instead Trump encouraged his followers to congregate without masks, and down talked any CDC measured. He hoped for a magic solution, but medicine is not magic. So now, at least, he can experience COVID-19, or the Trump-virus, close up."
2020-10-26 09:21:53,"Based on Pence's previous response to a health care emergency when he was a state governor, we have to presume he will pray for an answer.

2020-10-26 08:51:22,"After hearing Mr. Meadows tell Jake Taper on ""State of the Union"" that Trump and his administration were not going to do anything to control the virus while waiting for the vaccine all I could think of is how our government has put all the people in America in danger of dying from this virus.   

According to the CDC Director, Dr. Redfield, the soonest most people will get the vaccine will be in the winter or spring of 2021 so in the mean time the federal government has given up on trying to control the virus which leaves the public doing whatever they want to do or not do while the positive cases of the virus and the amount of people being hospitalized from the virus is increasing.  

 Trump's responsibility as president is to protect the safety of the people.  He is not doing this and should be held accountable for all the people who die from COVID-19, those who contract the virus and all the Americans who are being exposed to the virus because of the lack of guidance from the administration that ignores the advice of Dr. Fauci and the CDC."

It should be criminal if no mandate is issued, and those derelict in their duty to our nation so  charged.

These are words the experts feared were true but they hoped against hope that trump would see the folly of herd immunity in the numbers. After all 80 thousand sick in one day, hospitalizations up, healthcare systems in red states in chaos...those are hard to deny.

They did not bank on the sickness of this man and his signature capability to bend his sycophants to his will. He makes them, or allows them, or enables them to deny reality.

 A couple of months ago, they placed a wager for all of us. They went all in on ""herd immunity"" and a quick vaccine hoping we wouldn't notice, or wouldn't care. It was a bad bet, we lost and the bill has come due.

The next few weeks will feature 90 thousand or maybe 125 thousand new cases a day. Or more. Individual state health systems will become choked with patients, triage will become a joke, record-keeping an afterthought. People will die in the streets, in their homes, in nursing homes. They will die alone, uncounted, uncared for...

Only one last chance. Fauci still has hope. We can still bail this boat out.
Nationwide we must wear masks, isolate, test and trace.

A child can be taught. A billion or more children all around the world have been taught: to wash hands frequently, maintain a safe social distance, refrain from close interactions, and even to wear masks. 

It's an affront to decency, especially in America, to refuse to recognize the science: something microscopic, invisible to the naked eye, can make you very sick, can cause protracted illness in a love one, can kill someone you love. 

America is officially the country where the most people have died. (Personally, I suspect more have died in Russia, but the Putin régime will never reveal actual data -- if they have it.)

Germany, with ¼ the population of the USA, is in its highest Covid-alert yet, with 10 000 deaths. Less than one-twentieth of the US death toll. And you know the numbers being revealed by Angela Merkel, a scientist herself, are accurate. 

There's just no excuse for this tragedy. As the most prosperous nation on earth, with the biggest stockpiles, logistical assets & organizational knowhow, the USA could have been out of the woods long ago. Simply by having Cuomo-like leadership.

The oath of office binds these people to fight _all_ enemies, foreign and domestic. It does not say how big or small these enemies may be...

But the statement - IMHO - has a different source. I believe this comes, trough Trump, from Dr. Scott Atlas. It's an attempt to get his theories about herd immunity tested through the backdoor. Given the Trump administrations legacy we now need to ask ourselves this: what are _his_ connections to Vladimir Putin?

Looking back over the last four years America has been hit and hurt so badly and so often that an annihilation through a virus, perpetrated by it's own government and ordered by it's archenemy, could only be called a crescendo. The gift that keeps on giving. The thing that will not just bring America down, but keep it down for decades. And it's just a few words whispered into the ear of Donald ""Mr. Chance"" Trump. That's classical Vlad, that is!

If Trump loses the election (and I sure hope he does, for the soul of the nation!) Meadows is gone, as are Bill Barr and Chris Ray. He'll put Eric in charge of these positions, it's okay during the lame duck, even he can't mess it up more badly than it already is.

The role of government is to do for us citizens, that which we cannot do for ourselves, thus the FAA, FDA, for food and drug safety, the CDC, to track and understand infectious diseases, the military, etc. Multiple times Pence deflected any responsibility for his task force to be a guiding expert to help local institutions navigate this pandemic with best practices, and  considered and careful summations of what medical experts are learning week by week about the virus.   
Hmmmm... sure wish he and his band of conservatives would take such a “hands-off” approach to a woman’s right to control her body and right to choose. 
And for the no-maskers- I propose we “set-up” so-called medical facilities comprised of medical personnel who share their no-mask philosophy.

Unfortunately, those of us who live in rural America cannot afford NOT to read FoxNews.  From our police and hospitals to our schools and land-use policies, conservative media dictates our public life.   

For example, last week our county supervisors stopped our county health department's outreach program aimed at our most vulnerable residents.  Their reason?    One of the interpreters working for the outreach program had used the words ""defund the police"" on their own, personal Facebook page.    As a result, the supervisors found it necessary to ""protect"" the police - by stopping the Covid outreach program.    

Rather than liberal, I've come to think of big cities as ""liberated"".        Liberated, as in, liberated from FoxNews and TalkRadio.     

This is your problem too.   Or do I need to remind you, that FoxNews and TalkRadio voters are the reason Donald Trump got into office?   Trust me, there are thousands of Donald Trumps out here.   Think not?   Look at the Senate.

If it wasn’t mainly dead Asians and Africans but dead Americans, it would had been made a big deal if my Americans.

The virus has killed more than 225,000 people in America, and has sickened more than 8 million, and we don’t know the long term implications of the sicknesses.

The October Surprise is that Trump has continued his ""political Covid death march"" by still refusing to wear a mask, downplaying every aspect of the virus, contracting Covid, lying about the virus's obvious effects on him and those around him, running a superspreader event at the WH, and, most recently, having his chief of staff engage in a cover-up effort regarding multiple Covid infections among Pence's own staff, even though Pence is the head of the ""Coronavirus Task Force.""

Besides scientists we also need adults in control and with each passing day it is more evident  that there are NONE @ 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
If it turns out that the WH is a hot spot, in the best interest of the District of Columbia. 
Furthermore, the Governors of each state should refuse to hold any rallies without limited capacity requirements as well  mandatory mask wearing, social distancing strictly enforced. 
Meadows, said the quite part out loud there are no adults in the White House.  So now that the Governors know that, it falls on them to protect their citizens.  If arsonists threatened their constituents they would take the appropriate action, they should take the same steps to combat the wanton spread of a virus if they want to protect their citizens and their states economies.

Mark Meadows is a real piece of work -- sarcastic and indifferent to Americans infected with Covid. 

The entire Republican attitude of ""carry on while people drop dead about you"" is bizarre.  Typically,  White House administrations try to protect Americans,  or at least seem like it. 

Only Trump loyalists, or pockets of the country with low infection rates, defy masking.  There is not much to fight this virus --yet -- so masking and social distancing are Americans' best options.

For those not familiar with his tenure as governor, he is incapable of managing large projects and he lies. He personally designed the ""public-private"" system for building I-69. When it was two years behind schedule and all work had ceased he kept telling us that everything was on schedule. And he did not hesitate to break laws. 
Pence, together with Secretary Azar, Director Redfield, radiologist from the Hoover Institute Atlas, and Pence's Chief of Staff Short, all followers of right wing scientifically deficient religion, are precisely the people Trump chose to run the Coronavirus response. As long as they are in office this is the same answer you will get, over and over."
2020-10-26 13:09:26,"As predicted, there is a new and very intense surge of Coronavirus infections both abroad and in the United States. And, as predicted, the death toll from Coronavirus infections is also rising. Well over 200,000 Americans are dead, so far, and counting. At this point, looking for leadership in controlling the virus from our White House is both frustrating and futile. Everyone around the president espouses his approach to the infection with utter disregard to the truth as well as to the needs of their fellow Americans. Trump was lucky with his case of Covid, having been given every treatment known to man, all at our expense and most of which we, individually, can’t afford. His dismissal of mask use and social distancing have influenced enough of his followers to allow the virus to persist and flourish in our nation. Unfortunately, though, the virus is infecting more and more of those who make up his “base,” and this makes him look to them like the fool that he is. His politicization of the pandemic has done nothing but make a bad situation worse, and more people will die as a result of it. He can’t bully the virus or shout it down. But we can bully him and shout him down at the polls. And we need to do that to save our lives."

2020-10-26 13:07:10,"It seems to me that Trump wants to weed out the sick in our society by doing nothing to curtail the spread of the covid.  If they don't die of covid, maybe denying them health care will do it.  Think of all the money being saved in social security and healthcare with them gone and it will also open up some job opportunities."

It’s not the first time the wartime analogy has been made. Trump at one point likened himself to a wartime president. But then again, he says people who go to war are losers and suckers. So, go figure.

They knew that people who might have survived would die. They believed that abatement - what we have accomplished, successfully, in NYS- would be too expensive, both economically and politically.  

There was a policy - it was just so evil, so unthinkable, that we denied what was staring us in the face. Trump and his accomplices decided that “the cure was worse than the disease,” then lied to the American people and continue to lie. They are killing us."

This all unraveled in front of us and was resurrected with the removal of the best the world has to offer immunologist and replaced with a radiologist that was a want to be star that the state tv found.

So in the end, we have no PPE strategy, no vaccine strategy, no mitigation strategy, all we have is a herd immunity strategy which is the same as what we would have if they did nothing.

I am appalled at how they are not concerned about spreading this deadly disease and rather go out without masks and continue to campaign for what looks to be an end to their deadly mismanagement of this pandemic and the country.  The rest of the country does not have access to the best medical facilities, not to mention the ability to be transported there by helicopter.  They are leading their followers to a deadly path and they are not even aware of it."
2020-10-26 13:43:56,"Initially, Trump downplayed the need for masks because he did not want the nation to blame him for the lack of masks in the government's disaster stockpile. Similarly, he now downplays the need for masks since they are still not fully available because of his incompetence."
2020-10-26 13:48:40,"The Trump administration has done an outstanding job of responding to this virus under tough and partisan circumstances.   The progressive left acts as if he invented the virus and spread it intentionally to Americans.   It is a worldwide pandemic, originating in China, and the US is at the forefront in supporting the vaccines that hopefully will control the virus.

That the Trump team is brave enough to leave their basement to campaign shows the difference with the Democrats who promote only fear and contribute nothing to mitigating the damage.  Pelosi has been the obstacle to getting more aid to the people and it was evident with her CNN interview with Wolf Blizzer.   She lives in a bubble of indifference to the suffering  of those affected and only uses the pandemic for political points.

Hatred of Trump does not entitle the Democrats to continue to be obstacles to aid for the citizenry.

2020-10-26 14:02:59,"It is extraordinarily shocking that Mike Pence's aides have come down with COVID19 infections and he has chosen to continue campaigning, rather than quarantining himself and thereby, his actions are likely to spread this killer virus to other people if he is infected.

This says everything about the current US Government who are so totally out of control that they think no rules or legislation applies to them regarding the virus. Do they have no shame?

Obviously, Pence believes he will get state of the art COVID19 treatment, from an army of taxpayer funded Doctors, if he succumbs to the virus, just like Donald Trump did. This is unlike the rest of the US public, who even if they are insured often have to pay enormous additional costs for their treatment which are likely to bankrupt large numbers of people.

What an insult to all the 225,000 US citizens who have died cruel, painful and unnecessary deaths and the family and friends who continue to mourn their loved one's passing every day."
2020-10-26 14:05:51,"It is quite obvious that this administration does not take the Coronavirus threat seriously.  Over the weekend, the White House hosted a Halloween event.

They are building a field hospital in Czechoslovakia because they fear that hospitals will be overrun soon. Italy and Spain have both added back restrictions.  Did this administration not learn anything from what happened earlier this year? 

Arizona’s cases have increased by over 50 percent in the last two weeks. Mr. Trump is supposed to be holding two rallies in the state later this week. Mr. Pence, who has staff members who just tested positive for the virus, will also be coming here to hold rallies this week.

We need a real president, not a mean-spirited, spiteful Reality TV Apprentice president. If Americans want to save their lives and those of their loved ones from ""Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,Covid, Covid, Covid,"" then they must vote ""You're fired!"" on November 3.

A crisis of this magnitude was avoidable, as many advanced nations have done. Please vote for Biden. A second term Trump and his enablers will be content to continue letting Covid burn through our nation, destroying lives and the economy, whereas Joe Biden actually has a plan to help contain the pandemic better, which will allow us to return to some semblance of normalcy."

We created, in fact, an entire agency dedicated to  preventing hijackings and suicide missions conducted by terrorists and the deranged - I had a role in managing the no-fly list  for several years at  the airport where I worked and it was very time consuming.

One campaign that is concerned about it's own workers and the workers of America, the other only concerned about optics and cheering crowds, and the tender ego of the commander in chief."
2020-10-26 15:47:14,"This is a public health emergency.

International law forbids governments from using biohazards and chemical weapons against their own people.  Several years ago, the U.S. punished Bashar al-Assad after he used chemical weapons against his own people.

The fact that, according to reports, Trump and Jared Kushner discussed the fact that COVID was initially killing people in 'blue states' so they didn't bother with a strategy to help stop the spread is an alarming indication they were willing to ignore or undermine public health protocols when those dying were perceived by Trump and Kushner to be political opponents.

The government may very well have violated international law in their refusal to protect certain Americans - their political opponents - from the spreading infection.  Allowing biological infection to spread among certain parts of the population who the government regards as 'undesirable' or political opponents (""blue states"") likely violates international law regarding crimes against humanity.

We should all be very afraid.

If it were so easy and so clear, cases would not be surging in Italy and Spain again. Both countries were lauded for the fast and dramatic lockdowns, rapid response testing and swift action. How should we (as a country) have handled it any better? People can say Trump did this but I don't see it that way. It is a virus, not a mechanical failure of an aircraft and you can't build a wall around it."

The part that should REALLY scare all of us is that the worst thing they can do, the absolutely most frightening possibility is also the most likely and expected action...

They will Do Nothing. 

That's it. Nothing more complicated than 10 weeks of inaction while the Pandemic is Raging is the Worst Case Nightmare. The Real Life Imminent Threat.

Overwhelmed Hospitals, Death, Evictions, Ancillary Financial Collapse in Markets, States facing Bankruptcy.. Serious Civil Disorder including Riots and fatal clashes with Police...

All of this is coming our way if Trump and Republicans simply wash their hands of it all and go off to plot The Opposition Movement while leaving behind as many legislative landmines and Conservative Judges as possible.

If they just Do Nothing.

We could all observe Trump's obsessive narcissism. We could all predict that Trump would run  for reelection on the one thing he likes to brag most often of; the economy.

When COVID became a reality we should have known, based on what we had observed, that Trump would never take the focus off himself or off of the economy. Every statement he made; was about ""his beliefs"", not science. Every policy initiative regarding COVID was about the economy; not about the devastation of human life.

If we can learn anything from this horrid lack of response is that maybe we should never again give our leaders the benefit of doubt;  when we clearly know based upon their previous behaviors, such benefit is not warranted.

As the President constantly evokes the name of (and tries to imitate the face of his determined leadership, which comes off more like a 5 year old in a temper tantrum) Winston Churchill, I ponder what Mr Churchill would be thinking about a strategy to simply give up in the face of a severe national threat to the country.

The false messaging of Republicans, Trump, and the few other heads of state who, despite having contracted the disease themselves, mimic Trump’s wrong-headed politics of denial and of austerity above the value of life are contributing to that, even though science is saying loud and clear that there is presently no “rounding the corner” and no assurance that a safe-and-effective vaccine will come anytime soon, only hopeful optimism of an earlier rather than later arrival, and that, in the wait-time—at least until autumn 2021, masks, distancing, tests and tracing are the only measures that will limit the peaks of the inevitably climbing death toll.

2020-10-28 19:55:58,"Wow, how nice to read about a company that is working hard to be part of the solution, as opposed to our federal government which is determined to be part of the problem.

Way to go, UnitedHealthcare!"
2020-10-28 22:26:03,"After I read this article, I immediately called my UnitedHealth rep and, after 35 minutes on hold, was told my policy doesn't include this option. So UnitedHealth is making this lovely offer only to SOME of its enrollees."
2020-10-28 23:05:25,Which would be the first good thing United health has done.
2020-10-29 01:51:20,"It’s be a great idea if more people had this option.  For that matter, how about all Medicare enrollees, regardless of their insurance provider ?"
2020-10-23 13:46:54,"I have read and re-read all the studies I can find about schools opening. It appears that by and large, schools do not cause cases to spike. 
I think that the only thing to do at this point is for parents to boycott ALL LOCAL BUSINESSES until the schools open with at least a hybrid model. 
This country does not care about children because there is no way to tie them directly to the economy. No amount of lost academic years or individual children suffering will change the hearts and minds of Americans. They just don't care. So, let's make it economically painful. Maybe then they will notice."
2020-10-23 13:55:36,"This article acknowledges what has seemed clear for some time, which is that schools aren't death camps for teachers or anyone else and very little kids aren't transmission vectors.  The research supporting this view, especially for little kids, has been around for a while since daycare centers never closed in the US and many schools in Europe re-opened quite a while ago or never closed.  Now that Trump is nearly out of office, I suppose the Times has deemed it safe to begin more balanced reporting on coronavirus risks.  I for one am quite happy."
2020-10-23 13:57:38,"Anti-covid regulations are political; scientists don't make policy, politicians do. If we're not careful the same sclerosis that has our whole political system tied up in knots, dead in the water, will prevent our ""leaders"" from modifying the restrictions that we're all living with, as new information arises. More people will die and we'll be stuck in this purgatory forever."
2020-10-23 14:01:47,Yes that’s true but Politicians and the Teachers won’t open the schools. In the meantime our children aren’t learning. The whole Remote Plan is a fiasco..
2020-10-23 14:03:42,"Reopening bowling alleys, bars, restaurants, gyms while schools remain largely closed is criminal.  And the fact that the efforts to keep schools closed has been spearheaded by teachers, the very people entrusted with their education, has been one of the most disappointing lessons of this pandemic.

The science is clear that elementary schools can safely reopen, especially given that even the youngest children can wear masks all day.  And it's the youngest children who are losing the most by being denied in-person teaching.

Please Mayor DeBlasio, Gov. Cuomo, someone. open school schools 5 days a week for at least PreK-5 schools. This Monday.  Our children can't afford to lose another day of education."
2020-10-23 14:04:53,"The tendency to report a conclusion gloss over requirements is passing along with misinformation so common during the epidemic.  Good when schools deploy contact tracing on diagnosis, social distancing, masked students snd staff, and other sanitation precautions the rates of transmission are reduced. In simple terms, no different than adults. A far different conclusion is ""school-age children can return to school."" Just last week the NYTimes reported Utah's Canyons school district was a counter case when few if any of the standard precautions were poorly done."
2020-10-23 14:09:01,"Reading articles like this over and over, and yet watching my kids school year go down the drain 100% at home in California is the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced.  Prioritize schools!  Our district has the funds and has put the precautions in place - small class sizes, plexiglass between all desks, masks, etc.  We can open safely and yet Gov. Newsom will have kids home until the virus is gone."
2020-10-23 14:14:51,"It is time the powerful teachers unions starting turning their energy and financial resources into a force for reopening schools.  There is plenty of evidence that it can be done safely. Lead the way instead of always obstructing progress. Actions speak louder than words.  If they really care about educating children then find a way forward.  To paraphrase Dr. Rubin, risk can  only be mitigated.  There can never be zero risk.  This is true in all aspects of life, not just COVID-19.  Get our children back into the classroom where they learn best!"
2020-10-23 14:18:13,"At the beginning of the summer there was an increase in cases, but there were studies to say that it wasn’t linked to the protests.  Now a second increase and more studies to say that it’s not linked to schools.  Apparently the reason that the US has the most cases in the world is due to small family gatherings?"
2020-10-23 14:18:47,"Unfortunately, Covid alarmists are not interested in data that runs counter to their narrative. In fact, if you tell them that children are not at great risk from Covid-19 and are not efficiencly spreading the virus they will accuse you of ""disinformation""."
2020-10-23 13:44:32,"Why?

What makes the virus, shed by a child, any less transmittable than than when it’s shed by an adult?"
2020-10-23 14:31:46,"As a UFT member and a parent, I am frustrated that governor Cuomo, who states that he always wants to follow the science, hasn’t adjusted to the accumulating evidence. In his orange and red zones, all schools are mandated to close. As a society, we need to prioritize our children’s educational and psychological growth. Mr. Cuomo should be able to adjust to the emerging scientific evidence of little increased risk of virus transmission in schools to the smallest members of our city."
2020-10-23 14:42:17,"During the 1918 pandemic, New York City faced the choice of closing its schools or allowing children to attend.

New York City Health Commissioner Royal S. Copeland and New York City Health Department Division Head Josephine Baker argued for children to return to classes. They did.

They discovered what Ms Mandavilli wrote about. And experts like Mr Nichols concluded.

The parallels between the 1918-20 pandemic and our covid19 2020-? are startling. Precautions to take like wearing masks and distancing etc, the division between heavily populated states v less populated, and even increased violence, to name just a few, would give history enthusiasts a sense of deja vu.

History may not repeat itself, but it does provide guidance and insight as to what to expect."
2020-10-23 14:42:26,"I find it most remarkable that articles such as this one describe the results as ""surprising.""  That would be true only if you were not paying any attention at all to the results from studies and other forms of evidence coming out as early as June, and increasing in depth and quality over the subsequent five months, from European countries that had significant numbers of children returning to their classrooms.  

Instead, most media outlets, such as this one, have highlighted isolated events, such as the crowded hallway in a Georgia school.  These represent nothing more than anecdotes that carry no weight of scientific studies based on statistics, and they were (deliberately) portrayed in a scary way that would encourage the public and school administrators to fear reopening schools in the US.  As a scientist, with children who have so far not seen the inside of a classroom, despite sars-cov2 infection rates being relatively low in my area, I find this more than dismaying.  The NYT itself must acknowledge its own contribution to the sad state of affairs in schools in the US this Fall.  Look up ""availability heuristics"" to understand how influential such stories can be in creating decisions that are not backed by actual evidence."
2020-10-23 15:19:31,"One of the biggest spreaders of Covid disinformation has been Rachel Maddow, who has insisted that children are highly vulnerable to Covid and that they are spreading the virus everywhere."
2020-10-23 14:27:20,"Covid alarmists refuse to accept any data or information that runs counter to their narrative. If you explain to them that children hardly get sick from Covid and that they are not efficiently spreading the virus, they will accuse you of ""disinformation."""
2020-10-23 15:29:56,"It isn't surprising because schools are following as best they can the guidelines for distancing, mask wearing, and disinfecting.  It's too bad that some  adults in other sectors refuse to follow the guidelines.  Educators have taken up ""we are all in this together"" mantra while the so called ""rugged individualists"" (who are truly the snowflakes who refuse to get new skills with the changing times) continue to refuse to accept the science."
2020-10-23 15:39:57,"It should be acknowledged and considered that most school districts are still offering families an online option and many families are taking advantage of that option, thereby significantly reducing the actual number of students on campus. This isn't discussed at all in the article. In our region, data suggest anywhere from 20-40% of students remained on line. That is a huge reduction in the brick and mortar student body. Should all those students return to in-person class, this story could be vastly different."

2020-10-23 15:39:05,"I'd like to applaud the NYT for bravely publishing this piece, which runs so counter to their overall messaging about COVID since the start of the pandemic.  Well done, NYT, for bravely taking up a position in the school reopening debate that is based on actual data."
2020-10-23 16:08:57,"This needs to be front and center on the NYT page now. The learning needs of our children seem to have been overlooked by politicians. Teachers have a union, and there is no union for our children. Children literally are our future, and throughout this pandemic they have been given the shortest end of the stick."
2020-10-23 16:12:36,"I for one am very much looking forward to the time when we can discuss acceptable risk, vs elimination of risk, in the context of the human costs of social distancing without being labeled a right wing COVID denier. This article is a start. But maybe the NYT could also back off a little on reporting every rare anecdotal case of a bad COVID outcome in an unexpected scenario."
2020-10-23 16:05:48,"But fear of ""cases"" keeps them closed and continues to harm children, complicates matters for parents who work, and reduces the natural benefits of immunity."
2020-10-23 16:47:26,"Schools themselves are, to the best of their abilities, following reasonable guidelines regarding masks and social distancing while in session. However, many students are participating in multiple activities outside of school, specifically athletics. There are very few, if any, interscholastic athletic events happening this fall, but the town and travel leagues are still operating normally, hosting everything from practices to tournaments. All of the cases at our school (unfortunately there have been several this year) have been traced back to these events and outside activities. Unless parents and families are willing to compromise and sacrifice these extracurriculars, we are always going to have issues with COVID making its way on the campus. Parents and families have to understand the risks that they are taking outside of the classroom are having immediate impacts on the broader school community.  As a teacher, it is incredibly frustrating when the decisions of one family or student compromise the learning experience for everyone in a class. One confirmed case could mean up to 6 teachers having to leave school immediately to get tested and numerous classmates having to swtich to remote learning for up to two weeks unless they too get tested. I have nothing against people playing sports or enjoying themselves in whatever safe way they can outside of school, but families and students have to be thinking about the repercussions of their choices."
2020-10-23 16:49:48,"I certainly hope that schools are not stoking community transmission. However, in the Netherlands the vast majority of children under the age of 12 cannot be tested (it is a specific policy) and contact tracing has broken down so the reality is that no one really knows where transmission is taking place."
2020-10-23 16:50:44,"Trouble we're having in our district is that they're looking at greatly shorter days to accommodate an A/B schedule. My kid is too young to handle getting to school herself, so it's actually going to make life even harder if they reopen in this model.

I'd personally much rather they spread kids out into the middle and high schools and go full day, but that would require money and they're staring down massive funding shortages as it is."
2020-10-23 17:02:37,"My cousin, a 37-year-old kindergarten teacher, was diagnosed with COVID a week ago. But because the state of Texas doesn't do contact tracing, she has no way of knowing whether she caught it from a student, another faculty member, or one of her own children, all of whom play after-school sports. 

Two other friends who recently tested positive have young children who had the sniffles in the past couple of weeks. They assumed their kids had seasonal allergies (not unreasonable here) and sent them on to school without getting them tested. 

I know children are less likely to get seriously ill, and my cousin and friends are healthy and had only mild cases of COVID. But I'm not sure how we can confidently say children aren't driving the recent surge here in Texas when we're making very little effort to collect data beyond the positivity rate and number of deaths."
2020-10-23 17:03:50,"At first, our school district was going to open, but not require masks, but then cases rose in our area, so for 1st quarter, it was virtual only as an option.  My middle schooler suffered the most with low grades in some classes.  With middle school, you have more immaturity (than high school), but still are expected to keep up with various teaching styles of multiple teachers.   The school district offered catching up on late assignments with “no penalty” ‘til the end of the quarter, but not all the assignments were received virtually.  My child shouldn’t be penalized for her 1st quarter work.   
For 2nd quarter, we were allowed to return in-person with mandatory masks.   I am so grateful to have my middle school child in face to face learning now.  My elementary children are in-person too.  Not only are they thriving more academically, but they are getting the social component as well."
2020-10-23 17:07:07,A better headline would have noted the scope of the study.  Earlier this week we read about pacts of Utah mom's agreeing not to disclose positive cases lest their schools get shut down (& they did anyway).  Which of those factors has painted Utah as one of the most infected states on the map?  We must continue to learn and integrate all new information.
2020-10-23 17:19:07,"School attendance is very important for children to learn and develop, however I do think that COVI19 has not been studied adequately in children before sweeping statements are made by  medical experts and epidemiologists.

I note that in the UK  we are subject to almost daily propaganda about COVID19 from the Johnson Government, that young  school age children are not being affected by the virus in any significant way. Unfortunately, the effect of this is that you see young school age children wandering around in very large groups, and being completely oblivious to the dangers of virus transmission and not even wearing masks. It is only logical to assume that some of these school children will develop the virus and spread it.

Social distancing and mask wearing is something which will only benefit school children."
2020-10-23 17:21:18,"My daughter’s parochial pre-school to grade 8 has some kids from home and others in person so class sizes are small. Temps/masks/hand sanitizer and kids stay in one room. It’s worked because they are sticking to the rules. No one but the kids and school staff can go in. 
She went to camp there too. As a healthcare worker it’s been a relief. A bonus has been no stomach bugs or colds! 
The people I see without masks and in groups are mostly older kids and young adults. Younger kids actually follow rules better and since they have to be supervised. Masks are no problem since I got ones that fit and have dinosaurs/pizza/ducks etc. it’s like Halloween every day."
2020-10-23 17:18:50,"I don't know why not all schools adopt a twice weekly test of everyone in the school - students, teachers, janitors, bus drivers etc.  They have done this for a 50,000 student school at Illinois and keeping it safe for everyone.

2020-10-23 17:22:26,"What I have observed in my circles is that school reopening seems to lead to a drop in compliance with sound public health measures. Less mask wearing, distancing and gathering with friends inside like it’s normal again. We need to clearly message that those things can’t happen. All children, including high schoolers, need to be able to go to school. We need to push for a plan to pay restaurants and bars to stay closed that includes all staff. Kids need to grow up, push away from parents, deal with the social life of the school day. Noones happy hour is worth sacrificing a generation’s growth."
2020-10-23 17:23:03,"I'm confused how epidemiologists expect to analyze the spread in schools if widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals isn't happening. We know most children and teens don't show symptoms, so it can't be assumed that when a student tests positive that they weren't in fact infected by an asymptomatic classmate who hasn't been tested. In Massachusetts the cases in schools are being described as ""one offs"" - but there is no regular testing of asymptomatic students and staff, so how can that be known?"
2020-10-23 17:47:25,"Why is this even surprise that kids don't contribute to the pandemic?

Right from get go - the stats have always shown kids were hardly even infected with Wuhan.

Kids are a lot more resilient with everything and more importantly, with some exceptions - they get better fast.

The poster child is of course the son of POTUS who supposedly recovered in of matter days if POTUS doctors are to be believed.

In that regard, it is curious that POTUS is not quoted here urging reopening of schools withiut a delay.

The photo in the story is instructive.

This child appears more afraid of that temperature gun than being back in school.

Its indeed time to open schools and colleges with appropriate precautions and safety practices.

Nothing beats education in person.

I dare say in a couple of decades - if this shut down continues for ever - the psychologists are going to define Wuhan syndrome in grown ups which they acquired in these times.

And that picture is not going to be pretty."
2020-10-23 17:26:41,Something tells me that on Nov 5th most of the fear-mongering around COVID will disappear...
2020-10-23 18:09:21,"Could this be related to fact that their sneezes and coughs are expelled much lower to the ground because they are so much shorter than adults?? (Even though children are believed to have same viral load? 
Teachers, who often bend or kneel down to communicate at their face level, would be more susceptible?"
2020-10-23 17:46:52,"If the virus is spread through mouth droplets mainly, and elementary school children are only as tall as an adult’s knee, well there you have it. Adults are not often face to face with a child. We mostly talk down to them, literally and figuratively. 
I have two kids in full time in person school and also work for a network of schools around the East Coast that are also full time in person. No cases at all anywhere."
2020-10-23 18:39:55,"I'd be more inclined to believe the Open-the-Schools advocates if they argued that adults should be making sacrifices -- bars, restaurants, masks, etc. -- so that the kids can learn.  I can't recall anyone making that argument."
2020-10-23 19:23:13,"For all of those who are clamoring to open every school, did you not read these sentences?

""The risk among older children in middle and high schools is less clear""
""The trends for older children are much harder to discern. But over all, they suggest a greater chance for infections to spread without careful measures in place.""
""teachers in schools with older children had double the rate of infections compared with those who taught remotely.""

I agree that low-transmission communities can likely get away with fully reopening elementary schools. The others? Not so much."
2020-10-23 19:30:32,"The low incidence of community transmission from schools was already evident from the experiences of European schools in the spring. But of course the issue had to be politicized in the U.S. because it’s 2020.

It’s funny how skeptical people are of experts and empirical data when it doesn’t match their own intuitions or tribal narratives."
2020-10-23 19:45:05,"I have a feeling this is going to age as well as the surgeon general telling us not to buy masks, the WHO denying aerosol transmission, and saying it all will go away magically. 

Schools are a conduit in a community for disease transmission between networks that may not otherwise interact. Ever notice how a colleague gets a slight cold that becomes worse and then infects everyone in an office? They will say they didn’t think it was going to be that bad because their kid got just a little sick. Schools are a disease vector and it is the best place to spend money to protect public health or use online options. Look at the front page to see the current college outbreaks.

Think of how many flu deaths would be avoided with open air classrooms during the summer months. Luckily we know that during the 1918 pandemic communities that closed schools earlier had fewer deaths. Those kids went on to become America’s greatest generation. We do not need a P-hacked public health study to convince us to reopen schools. We need science based strategies to drive the number of cases to zero. 

Just imagine if this virus mutates to severely infect children after a study recommended they can crowd together safely and therefore making them the only susceptible pool left."
2020-10-23 20:24:44,"Personally I think it's the bars and restaurants and other social venues that should have very strict rules and the schools should be open at least on a hybrid model with masks and as much distancing as is possible.

I think it's interesting that the NFL has found that outbreaks were due to social situations (mainly eating/drinking together unmasked) and not due to on the field transmission.  It may be the case that essential activities can proceed when done within guidelines.  If everyone was doing that and not socializing perhaps things would start to turn around."
2020-10-23 20:42:27,"I live in a small town in Northern Kentucky. At my grandchildren's middle school they had one case at the beginning of this week. Now they have seven. They have not informed parents nor are they considering closing, even to clean. I am living in constant fear for both of my grandkids who attend this school. I am living in fear for ALL the children at that school. I can't pray enough..."
2020-10-23 21:16:29,"If they're not testing (other than random), the data is flawed.  Kids can carry the disease without having symptoms.  How about tracing their parents and grandparents....."
2020-10-23 21:39:26,"Question for the author: if infections are detected with PCR tests which often take 3-5 days to return results, and researchers are trying to conduct contact tracing, isn't that nearly impossible? How would they know whether the infection came from school?

In any case, I'm incredibly happy that my twins are attending kindergarten in person. Remote learning is a joke, even after having six months to prepare."
2020-10-23 21:33:31,"What about the study of 85,000 from India? Children appeared to be significant vectors in that study."
2020-10-23 18:51:33,"Science driven decision making would change our nation. Masks, distancing and frequent hand washing should be a national mandate. Close all bars, gyms casino’s and movie theater’s. OPEN SCHOOL’S. Our priority as a nation should be our future not fulfilling our immediate entertainment needs."
2020-10-23 20:37:23,"We should only follow the science!

It was smart to close schools when we knew little and it will be smart to reopen them as more data is analysed to support safe opening (while keeping bars and gyms closed).

Constant recriminations are counterproductive."
2020-10-23 20:30:49,"So this flies directly in the face of this week's revised CDC guidelines stating 17 minutes of contact with the same person over eight hours is considered 'close contact'.  This came after a prison outbreak of covid-19 that stemmed from one asymptomatic staffer who spoke with one prisoner 22 times during an 8 hr shift, for a total of 18 minutes accumulated time.    

We hear daily in the media about the dangers of people not trusting the scientists, while getting junk articles such as this:  Bold headlines suggesting one thing, article summation not supporting it very well.  Those bold headlines will be repeated on the five, nine and ten-o-clock news tonight, and they will be what most people pay attention to."
2020-10-23 19:17:45,Then why aren’t schools open?
2020-10-23 20:43:16,"A very bad idea to push school reopening. 

 In Europe their second spike started after schools reoopened.  Many schools became vectors of transmission. 
Academic papers say one over 11 or 12 Children get and spread teh virus in the same way as adults. 

And find me a teenager who cannot operate a computer? and learn online. 

And Biden made a major blunder when he said ""not many teachers will die"".   Major blunder.  How many teachers dying is acceptable?  None."

2020-10-23 21:21:26,"I assume you realize you contradicted yourself here.  So, what drives your conclusions?  The needs of working mothers to get back to the office, which is much too hard when the kids are home?"
2020-10-23 21:44:09,If this is true then Joe Biden can act on it pronto and still handle the virus wisely. Thank goodness for some positive news.
2020-10-23 22:45:33,I guess it’s just coincidental that we are seeing the worst uptick in cases since last spring.    Schools are open and this is spreading like wildfire.     Of course we want our kids in school.    In engaging in that act we are contributing to the problem
2020-10-23 23:28:00,"Are schools even testing for the virus? The private one I teach in is not. No testing = no cases, right?"
2020-10-24 00:20:16,"I am a teacher, and we have been in school for 12 weeks.  Our district has followed many safety guidelines to keep us safe. There are very few cases in our district.  Our students are thrilled to be back in school full time, and so am I.  We are safe and happy to learn together each day. PS I am a democrat and I am voting for Joe Biden.  As a good American citizen, I want to  help children learn, and help parents get back to work."
2020-10-24 00:25:38,"38% of Covid exposures in my county this week were connected to K-12 schools (which placed schools ahead of mass gatherings and healthcare settings!); however, there's little evidence of linked transmission in schools? Give me a break. The kids are for the most part asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and the teachers are the canaries in the coal mine. Not looking forward to how this experiment plays out in the next few weeks/months."
2020-10-24 00:51:13,I sincerely hope this is true. But I have to say that it does seem like the articles that sometimes say coffee is good for you and sometimes say it isn’t.

Using the term unlikely is ridiculous. 
We don't know. unlikely is what helped get us into this mess today."
2020-10-24 01:03:46,"You can practically taste the disappointment in the comments by US teachers and their unions on articles like this. It's almost like they're hoping that virus cases will keep increasing, so they can keep schools closed forever. The gaslighting, cherry-picking of information, and moving the goalposts shows us that their sole priority is to keep schools closed no matter what. They are going to gaslight themselves all out of jobs."
2020-10-24 01:46:50,"Anyone working in a school knows that the common cold spreads like wildfire; the flu, the stomach flu spreads like wildfire but for some reason COVID-19 does not? I want to see a study on whether or not MDs, epidemiologists, leading scientists, COVID researchers are sending their kids to school. If so, are they public or private? What safety precautions are they taking? When these experts are sending their own children then we should feel safe to send ours.."
2020-10-24 01:48:45,In my area one school has just closed and gone back to remote because some school bus drivers tested positive for Covld- another closed because one student tested positive!!
2020-10-24 00:30:29,"I agree that getting young children back to school should be a priority.  I don’t understand why we don’t have better data about this yet.  Why not test children and staff weekly at a few of the schools being opened in cities with high community spread?  Teachers and students participating in online only options in that city would be the controls.  We could then have some real data on which to base our policies.  If rapid testing was prioritized for these groups, effective contact tracing should enable us to see if school attendance is increasing community spread.

Schools and districts are keeping outbreaks a secret.

Kids surely don't need to spend as many hours inside a room, staring at a whiteboard when the weather outside is great. Teaching in an outdoor setting? How about kid friendly workplaces, where possible? Can school districts provide a dedicated on-demand video streams for kids to review school materials? Online assignments and testing? 
It's better not to conflate imparting education with a place where you can drop off kids in the morning and pick up in the evening."

1) Your disease is serious or immediately life-threatening.
2) No treatment is available or you haven't been helped by approved treatments for your disease.
3) You aren't eligible for clinical trials of the experimental drug.
4) Your doctor agrees that you have no other options and the experimental treatment may help you.
5) Your doctor feels the benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment.
6) The company that makes the drug agrees to provide it to you.

Certainly Mr. Christie could have enrolled in the clinical trial for this monoclonal antibody, and risk getting placebo like the rest of us non-presidents.  That is what he was not willing to do, I’m betting."

They would have served us better if they had followed the science and let the chips fall where they may.  If they had been fired, they would have been respected by anyone who values the truth (including, I'm sure, their families and associates).

The current issues with politicization of the FDA illustrate the importance￼￼ of a need for more autonomy, something that was pointed out during the Obama administration regarding the previous administration. There are a sweeping number of governmental changes that will be necessary under a new administration to protect our democracy from a wannabe dictator in the future.

2020-10-21 16:01:43,"All federal agencies have always been buffeted by the ideologies of those in Congress and The White House. There has also been a more or less healthy tension between organizations like FDA  and EPA and industry. But when you shatter the science-based norms, ignore or remove the universally respected experts, you erode and quickly destroy the things that truly make America great. That's what has been happening under Trump."
2020-10-21 16:35:29,"""How the F.D.A. Stood Up to the President""

how the FDA stood by the president, or how the president and vice president stood by the FDA.

part of the problem might arise by having press conferences--where supposedly authoritative statements are made for the record--with multiple people speaking, some with more political authority than others, some with more scientific authority than others.  (press conferences with multiple people on stage are supposed to show solidarity?)  it is impossible to please all people, but in the moment of the press conference, each person has an incentive to take the path of least resistance and say stuff to please the audience and people present, especially if there are (political) consequences later of saying the ""wrong"" thing.

in other words, if you change the audience, you change the statements (and can even change thinking).  replace white house employees with FDA or CDC employees (and maybe even replace the press corps), and the press conference--supposedly authoritative statements for the record--would use completely different language.  (however, such a change would invite its own scientific form of ""groupthink"" too.)"
2020-10-21 16:24:05,"Let's not fool ourselves here--the FDA has been corrupt for years in order to serve the interests of big pharma/medical, industrial food & the personal care/beauty industry (e.g., why are we the only developed country that hasn't banned phthalates? EU banned it in 2005   9 other countries since), but the Trump admin & their complicit criminal toadies have completely destroyed what little integrity or trust remained."
2020-10-21 15:40:02,"Trump has put himself in something of a political and health pickle. He has since the start played leader of the anti-science brigade, and many are loyal supporters. Many of his most devoted are vaccine-deniers, the kind of thinking the president loves to stir.

Nonetheless, he simultaneously thinks that his gateway out of Cove at 19 is to promote vaccines. That means he's got to preach the miracles of medical science to a group that is vehemently anti-vaccine, largely under his tutelage.

If President Trump wins Nov. 3, he will have a lot of explaining to do, such as why people should rush out and get a mystery shot in the arm, a shot that could give their kids autism, render the men impotent and make the women miscarry. And here's the biggie of ponderables: will he himself be the first? He's sure to call back on his ""cure"" and ""immunity"" from his own bout with Covid.

On the other hand, Donald Trump is a master manipulator of facts, and hypocrisy is a major part of his game. Denial, denial, denialism. And when have his fans ever checked him on minor stuff like truth and consistency?"
2020-10-21 16:04:49,"Getting some intestinal fortitude this late in the game does not entitle them to a ""Profiles in Courage"" award.  Bowing to political pressure over something this serious for fear of losing your job is unconscionable, especially since a medical degree does not usually condemn the bearer to life on the street."
2020-10-21 15:59:09,"When a single human life is at stake let alone an entire nation because of a rapidly spreading deadly virus, professional people of science especially in a leadership position have an ethical obligation to speak truthfully and candidly based upon the best scientific evidence available at hand. If pressured to do otherwise by elected officials that choose to abuse the public trust for political gain, resignation is the only morally correct response. The lives and safety of the public is paramount.  Doctors Hahn, Birx and Redfield should have voluntarily resigned."
2020-10-21 17:01:04,"I spent 40 yrs in academic medicine and interacted with the FDA on numerous occasions in regards to investigational drugs.  At all times, I found them to be reasonable and to have the best interests of the public in mind.  When the current administration pushes for specific drugs, suppresses or changes long-standing recommendations, it serves to undermine public trust in the FDA and any involved drug/treatment.  Inappropriate of premature approval of a drug also impairs patient enrollment on ongoing clinical trials needed to develop solid evidence of efficacy and safety placing the public at risk.  While I have expected the FDA professionals to stand up to administration pressure from the start, a new-found fealty to its mission by the politically appointed Director is none the less gratefying."

Hahn should have resigned in disgrace three times: over the FDA's handling of coronavirus testing, of their hydroxychloroquine authorization, and his insane and reckless comments about convalescent plasma.  Opening up a restaurant with Redfield IS a joke: it wouldn't be safe to eat there!  Opening a lemon-aide stand appears beyond his ability.  

And THIS is news?  That he's SEEMING to do his job, which is to protect public health by ensuring the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.  That he's saying he's protecting his staff against political pressure? 

Yes, he's displaying basic competence, but for those who know, this is the bare minimum.  Too little, too late."

Here we have Donald Trump, a notable advocate of 'anti-vaxx' and of the anti-MMR disgraced (and former) doctor Andrew Wakefield, suddenly converted to being the world's leading booster of vaccination. One might even call it shameless, if shame is a world that could ever be attached to Trump.

What is definitely shameful is FDA and CDC officials bending over in the service of the White House. That they have bent back up straight has earnt them a bit of credit. But not much.

He is under world class pressure from Trump and his hacks.  Hahn initially caved to this pressure with his emergency approval of first chloroquine and then plasma.  Those were bad missteps that undermined his credibility with the biomedical community.  But having listened to him talk in various settings to a biomedical audience, I believe that he has drawn a line in the sand on vaccine approval.  He has assured both FDA scientists and the external medical community that he will not allow FDA to be pressured by Trump et al. into issuing emergency approval of any vaccine before volunteers have been followed for at least two months since the start of Phase 3 trials to detect adverse effects.  The major vaccine providers have voluntarily agreed to comply with this standard.  The WH tried to over-rule Hahn this past week, but he stood his ground and the WH backed down, an important step for FDA's credibility.  Hahn has apparently assured his staff that he will quit in a public way before compromising on vaccine safety.  At this point I trust Hahn to follow best practices in the upcoming critical evaluation of Phase 3 results, and I will have my family get a vaccine that is approved by FDA.  Now if only Redfield at CDC would show this type of integrity and fortitude."

Thank goodness for food banks and pantries for they truly are the lifeline to so many.

I appreciate the link to the various ways people can help.

While I understand and appreciate why this article is showcasing New Yorkers, there are still millions and millions of Americans who are hungry and who were hungry before this pandemic hit.

The two most crucial issues I constantly struggle with is the continual harm and destruction to the environment and the fact that so many people in this country go hungry every day.

I remember when LBJ first introduced his ""War On Poverty"" during his State of the Union address on January 8, 1964. He stated, ""Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it"".

That was over 56 years ago and yet that problem has only gotten worse, not better."

The party line is compassion fits neatly in a shutdown economy, to save those at risk but this article shows this approach has been decidedly uncompassionate. 

For ever headline grabbing anecdote about a young person dying from covid, there should be an article like this, showing the true cost of the pandemic- many more people are starving then are at risk of dying from covid. This side of the equation has been largely ignored by the media and I don't understand why. 

Even this article paints a picture where the food is photographed like in a high end restaurant, well lit and well plated. It does not depict an accurate representation of the trauma of having no food."

BUT if we don’t get this virus under control, I fear that more and more Americans will have to depend on others to help them to feed themselves and their families as the full economic effects of the pandemic permeate. I worry that homelessness nationwide will skyrocket. There is something unseemly and surreal about it all as Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, the investment banks continue to spin money and others worry about their dinner. The current status quo is fragile indeed."
2020-10-20 16:25:42,"The way to solve this is to freeze the assets and pay of Mitch McConnell and Republican Senators, to basically give them a real world experience of what a huge swath of Americans are going through. 

This is a different sort of “stimulus”, but it could be a very good one. 

Mitch McConnell is not suffering, and he simply doesn’t care about anyone else."
2020-10-20 16:26:30,"Thank you so much for this story and the beautiful photographs that went with it, and for showing all the people you covered as people instead of numbers. I could feel the joy and love in their homes. There but for the grace of God..."
2020-10-20 16:36:13,I found this article moving. Food isn't just fuel and the people who  line up at pantries aren't just poor. There is joy and dignity and hope and companionship in their lives. Thank you for showing it to your readers.
2020-10-20 16:38:36,Thank you NYTimes for this beautiful article. I've just signed up to donate monthly to City Harvest and to volunteer. I hope reading this piece inspires others to do the same.

2020-10-20 16:45:15,"Wow. Thank you for this.  It's painful how many are struggling.  But it's also wonderful to see how people are responding to this time of hardship by learning new skills in the kitchen, getting creative, finding new sources of joy.  The human spirit is amazing."
2020-10-20 17:18:01,"Thank you for raising our awareness through individual stories. I found it ironic that Versace ads were interspersed among the stories, and the contrast with the article on the gated community in Queens was striking."

2020-10-20 17:26:34,"One should never make assumptions about anyone going to a food pantry because it can come up and bite you in the bum.

Back in the day before marriage and children, I lived on the mainland of British Columbia and volunteered at a food pantry in a church basement in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, where life was grim for many of its residents.

One day we had a new volunteer and it soon became apparent that she thought she was doing the world a favour by helping those of the lower classes in the neighbourhood. Hearing her speak before we opened, I kept my tongue in and said nothing. More's the pity for her, I thought to myself.

Later in the day a woman walked in and stood in the queue for her food hamper which included tinned mutton, beef, turnips, onions and peas. As she got closer in the queue I could already see the new volunteer rolling her eyes at the woman's fancy hair and fancy nails, holding on to her mobile phone. Well, wouldn't you know it that the woman in the queue got the new volunteer. The volunteer made comment as to the fancy ring the woman was wearing. The woman said in was her granny's and it was the only valuable thing she owned and she was happy to have it.

I didn't get a chance to see it, but others did and said it looked quite old and very grand. After the woman left the volunteer later made the comment ""Did you see that ring? She should have to sell that before coming here.""

Our team leader heard this and took the volunteer aside and she was soon gone."

2020-10-20 14:56:20,I am salivating looking at those photos of food.  The other day I read that your country gives 48 billion a year in subsidies to american farmers. This is obscene and corrupt. That money should go to food pantry customers for rent and food relief instead.

2020-10-20 13:03:37,Times have changed - it's not 1870 or 1950.  The USA can't absorb all these immigrants anymore. Shut the door.

2020-10-20 17:34:42,"Then that's 1.5 million people who shouldn't be living in New York. There's zero shortage of places in the US that are much cheaper to live in, that have work. And even though the money isn't great your cost of living is massively cheaper. As in you can always afford a roof and 3 squares a day. The sense of entitlement espoused by the hard left here is infuriating."
2020-10-20 17:41:33,"To explain this phenomenon, we need to understand the difference In goals between the two political parties.

Democrats want to prevent an oligarchy and worker exploitation.
Republicans want to make rich people richer.

Democrats want the rich to pay their fair share.
Republicans want to make the rich richer.

2020-10-20 18:17:52,"To the person commenting these people shouldn’t live in NY they should move to a more affordable part of the country. They have jobs in NY. Do you know how expensive it is to move? And out of state. I live on the west coast. Do you think there are jobs to be had here? I lost my food service job. Over 30 years working in hotels in a few different cities. I could always find another job. Who’s going to hire me now, when there are people half my age applying for same few jobs? 
My husband & I have spent the last 20 years putting ourselves in a position that we could afford to retire. We had money saved, we don’t have children to support. We were lucky to  be able do what we did.  So for now we’re ok.
For the person who said we shouldn’t let immigrants in. ( eye roll) I’ve worked with many immigrants in food service. People who worked very hard, many times 2 jobs. I learned a lot about perseverance from them. Compared to many countries ours is sparsely populated. I’m here because my great grandparents emigrated.
And in my job I waited on  wealthy, privileged, and sometimes powerful people.  Many who  achieved that status through accident of birth and family connections or luck. The people highlighted in this story aren’t crying on your doorstep they’re making do and often times finding a way to be generous to their neighbors also experiencing hard times. 
I hope we get a new president and Congress, and get back to what our  values should be."
2020-10-20 18:35:06,"It's not just NYC. It's everywhere. 

A third of our workforce doesn't make a living wage, half can't come up with $500 cash in an emergency.

The pandemic is just exposing a systemic problem that has been there for decades. 

It's not that Socialism is a solution to this problem but some regulatory measures on the Capitalist System that often get fear mongered as Socialism or a ""Slippery Slope"" are required.

A Living Wage Law is just Basic Economics. It's inherently unstable (and expensive) to have a third of your workforce on some form of assistance and almost half of taxpayers getting back more in ""credits"" than they pay in taxes. 

If the bottom of the ladder = a Living Wage everyone does better, tax burden goes down and tax revenues go up.  You convert that bottom half from net tax takers to net tax payers through raising their incomes to reflect the true value of their contribution and see vastly increased spending activity from the new found income. 

Wealth Inequality is the Natural State of a Healthy Economy.

Extreme Wealth Imbalance on the other hand is dangerous and left untended long enough ends in Bloody Revolution followed by one of a variety of terrible options in the way of new governments.

Put it this way... If the CEO owns six homes, a jet and a stable of fine cars the janitor should at least be able to afford a modest home in the suburbs, a riding mower and a 2nd hand Chevy."

2020-10-20 19:50:55,Thank you for the dignity you gave to these families and their home-cooked meals. This is a beautiful story born of the hardship our leaders have created and perpetuated.
2020-10-20 20:37:26,"In the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world! This is shameful! We can, and should, distribute our riches more justly; the wealthiest 1% should not get to keep most. There is no moral justification in economics or politics."
2020-10-20 20:04:09,"I want to thank the people and families in this story for letting the NY Times into their lives for a while. They illustrate that all types of people - including working people - can need help obtaining food and there is no shame in asking for help until you can get back on your own feet. 

Every once in a while, when the situation is appropriate, I tell friends and acquaintances about my background. Most people today superficially see a well-educated, successful middle-aged Asian-American woman living in a prosperous neighborhood and make certain conclusions about my past. They are often surprised when I tell them I grew up poor, with a single parent, cooking from food supplied by donations and signing us up as children for the free breakfast and lunch program. I tell people my past because I want them to know that people who need help aren't some amorphous ""other"" group but their colleagues, friends, peers, etc. 

We've donated to our local food banks and encourage others to do the same. Donate $$$ if you can as that can be more helpful than cans/ boxes of food. That allows food banks to buy fresh meat/ fruit/ veggies in bulk prices. Share your story with your colleagues and friends when the topic of food insecurity comes up.  That child in the food line today can be your doctor tomorrow."
2020-10-20 16:56:23,"It really pains me to see photos of junk food on the tables and shelves of food banks.  Aren't we supposed to be FEEDING people for their survival?  Where are the fresh potatoes/dried mashed potatoes vs potato chips?  The pasta boxes vs pies?  The real juices vs juice cocktails? Cheese vs  Cheez-wiz?  Produce vs pound cake?

Are we actually feeding people and helping the make wise choices in their expected self-sufficiency, later?

Photographers need to stop causing angst among liberals who would prefer to see the needy gifted with real, nourishing, and appropriate food."
2020-10-20 18:33:23,"New York is expensive but so is everywhere else. No where in the country can someone afford a studio apartment on minimum wage or two minimum wage earners afford a two bedroom apartment. Min wage is 7.25 an hour in much of the country with most other wages being pretty low as well. 

Being poor sucks anywhere, there’s no golden ticket by living somewhere cheaper. Rent will be whatever the market will bear and that will be a lot of your paycheck almost anywhere except for high earners. We know from years of statistics that the poor in NY live longer, healthier lives than those “cheap” states in the south and Midwest. 

If you think cheap, rural living is the way out of poverty you have never seen a trailer park before."
2020-10-20 15:25:19,"Excellent photographic work and so scarily reminiscent of the Depression-era images captured by folks like Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans.

Nearly ninety-years on from that time as a society we still cannot simply ensure that everyone has enough to eat.  In a land of such bounty this is a shame we all share."
2020-10-20 14:07:37,"Thank you for your reporting. My special education students are currently connecting issues that were addressed by American choreographers between World War I and the Cold War to issues that Americans continue to face today. Several of the students chose hunger as one issue. As a class today, we read this story. They were impressed, especially by the photography included in your reporting, and shocked by the number of people who are facing hunger today just in New York."
2020-10-20 22:37:00,"Thank you for this.  This is happening all over the U.S.

Please, please, please, if you can, donate to your local food bank, be it food, money, or (safely) your time and energy."
2020-10-20 22:05:12,I need to donate to our local bank.
2020-10-21 03:38:12,"I volunteer at a food pantry in upstate NY near Kingston. We get a lot of our food & produce from Feeding America, specifically the Food Bank of Northeastern NY. We have healthy food choices for our clients as well as the occasional treat. Our director is phenomenal in getting great food for next to nothing. We follow all Covid precautions as mandated by NYS & the CDC. We operate out of a church, and I know we are doing the Lord's work. There for the grace of God could be any one of us that needs a helping hand."
2020-10-21 04:50:43,"I have several neighbors who utilize these food pantries. They own homes, own luxury cars, have regular income, some even collect food stamps and other benefits. They don't need help, but abuse the food pantries because they can. They have no shame. They say why pay for something you can get for free.

So while there are people in real need, photos of long lines of people don't tell the whole story."
2020-10-21 13:51:52,"More stories like this please! So often, narratives around food or housing assistance show only stories of multi generational dependency and play right into the narratives around the ""undeserving"" poor. That narrative is tired in a country where wages have stagnated for a generation while cost of living, especially in cities like New York, has skyrocketed. Who can read about Mr. Patel, who works 7 days per week delivering food and can only afford a tiny apartment for his whole family, without feeling the injustice of his lot in life? He works hard than I, and most, for much less. We need to see more of these kinds of stories to change the perception of working poverty in this country, and I hope, to generate a will for structural change."

2020-10-20 11:25:56,"This herd immunity ""proposal"" may just be a ploy to give something to the public while the real deal is waiting for a vaccine which, let's face it, no one knows when and if that will be.   Certainly not before the election.  The pharma companies have talked for years about the length of time it take to develop a drug and how expensive it is.  The intense competition between pharma companies makes the whole outlook very worrisome. Trump abrogated simple solutions in place of unknown solutions of his imagination."
2020-10-20 11:29:22,"Achieving herd immunity the ""natural way"" exacts a terrible toll on a majority of the herd's individuals over several generations.  Herd immunity is a monstrously inefficient process.  Just think how many people died from small pox and poliomyelitis, German measles, diphtheria, mumps and three kinds of hepatitis through all human history without us ever reaching herd immunity from them.

Herd immunity is in fact an improbable stalemate point of a long process that does not in fact protect the herd's newborns from disease; it only reduces their individual chances of encountering it to the point that enough of them, sufficient to sustain the herd, reach breeding maturity  before they eventually catch it and die.

The very term ""herd immunity"" was coined to describe the protective effect of vaccinating something less than 100% of a population, the effective percentage varying according to the contagiousness of the disease and the fecundity of the species."
2020-10-20 11:51:10,"Exactly who is supposed to pay for grocery deliveries, etc. for those of us over 65? 
Yet another example of how this idea has not been thought out."
2020-10-20 11:58:11,"All pandemics end with herd immunity or death of the entire population.  
   The only question is will a an effective & trusted vaccine facilitate the path or will nature take its course (as it always did through the millennia of human existence until very recently)."
2020-10-20 12:01:00,"The Great Barrington Declaration has no supportive scientific documents to back up their manifesto.

Most importantly, no data driven models showing the impact of the policy  they propose and a comparative model showing the effects of using masks social distancing and sheltering

Data driven models have as their strength the ability to assess the impact of ""what if"" scenarios.  

Modelling would allow  the comparison and review of the two policies, and reviewers could examine and discuss the validity of the assumptions made in the model.  There is no peer review of the document's  claims.  

In addition, the Declaration has no documents outlining how the policies would work---school, workplace, bars, etc. No documents to support such methods either. 

There is no disclosure statement of financial conflicts of interest,  Such statements are made with every scientific paper.   Who funded the website,  who compensated the scientists for their time? 

Lastly there is no website with a link to examine all of the documents I've listed here.  

This is not science.  

That the signatories include infectious disease physicians and epidemic modelers and other infectious disease scientists from credible institutions staggers me.  

Not because of the content but because of the absence of scientific method in the declaration.  Their signatures gives it the gloss but not the substance of scientific validity. 

Was it rushed without content to the Internet in time for the election?"
2020-10-20 12:04:20,"Hospitals are already overburdened, such that important surgeries are put on hold indefinitely.

At this point we have to do what we can to enable the hospitals to handle the load, and that is masking, practicing social distance, and engaging lock-downs that prevent errors by those who already forgot what is going on, eg. every person with a drink in their hand at a bar."
2020-10-20 12:04:58,"Quite refreshing. An argument among experts for a plan! Unfortunately, with Trump administration no plan would've worked."
2020-10-20 12:05:41,"You don't have to be an epidemiologist to understand why ""population herd immunity"" won't work. Any one with a scientific or an engineering background would be skeptical because it just doesn't make logical scientific sense.
First it will not work because the theory that it requires that only 20 % of the total population acquire immunity from the virus by having gotten it. While anyone can see that there may be some impact on the driving force for contagion, the notion that a 20% reduction would eliminate transmission is absurd on the face of it. Those experts who will hazard a guess say that even 70% contagion level would reduce contagion rates but not end the disease.
The theory also requires that imparted immunity must be permanent, we have no indication that it extends behind a few weeks if at all.
The most grievous error of all is a practical one: How are we to treat all the people who get sick at one time? If herd immunity is to work, lets say 70% of Americans will have to get sick. That is about 210 million people. About 6% of those who get ill will require hospitalization, that's 12 million, give or take a million! 20% of those people will die, that is about 2.4 million people dead. All of this assumes that overloaded hospitals, EMT's, doctors and nurses can continue to perform under such horrid conditions. Many more will die due to lack of treatment.
I am not willing to see that many people die for something that will not work. Wear masks, test  and social distance."
2020-10-20 12:07:07,"Dr. Atlas and other politicians sometimes lace their prescription with comments about ""shielding the most vulnerable"". That would be a massive, expensive and draconian operation indeed. Most Covid19 deaths have been associated with nursing homes because they are death traps for this sort of disease. Are Atlas and Trump constructing safer facilities, the cost for which would be enormous? Nope. They have no plans to even partly protect the most vulnerable at all. 
There are many things that we do not know about this virus, but we do have a standard epidemiological model that works well. And according to this model the Trump-Atlas plan results in a million EXTRA deaths."
2020-10-20 12:10:01,"I am an infectious diseases physician, I fully support Infectious Diseases Society of America when it emailed its members last week that relying on herd immunity to end the COVID-19 pandemic is inappropriate, irresponsible and ill-informed.
The only way to get ahead of the epidemic is to rely on real science and scientists."
2020-10-20 12:16:04,"Well, that strategy certainly worked with Yersinia Pestis. Half the world population, or something, died, but whatever. Of course we should embrace the advice from a symposium of economists funded by Koch, on medical matters. How could it possibly be wrong?"
2020-10-20 12:20:46,"The term ""herd immunity"" is an lie and a deception!  

There is absolutely no immunity conferred by ""herd immunity"". All ""herd immunity"" accomplishes is to reduce the likelihood of encountering an infected person. But if an infected person is encountered, then ""herd immunity"" offers not the slightest protection from infection.  

If ""herd immunity"" occurs as a result of vaccines, then it is a bonus benefit to the vaccines.  But it is morally reprehensible to pursue ""herd immunity"" by encouraging activity that fosters infection, especially of a deadly disease."
2020-10-20 12:24:52,"In the midst of a pandemic, the public is better served by medical doctors and epidemiologists than libertarian economists. To be clear, Sweden is not a success story."
2020-10-20 12:25:45,"of those who proposed the Barrington Declaration only one has a background in infectious diseases, Dr. Gupta. To achieve herd immunity with a virus with this level of contagion the population would need to achieve 90% protection. Another key component that is faulty with their proposal is that these young people don't  live in social isolation. Many live with vulnerable individuals or have frequent contact and some young people would classify as vulnerable themselves. 
All you need to do to see how the Barrington theory would fail is look at states where little to no parameters have been put in place and see how their rate of infection, hospitalization, death and economic impact compares to states that have been more inline with CDC guidance. In the long run the science will become clear but thousands if not millions could be dead. Given that this proposal was supported by the Charles Koch Institute speaks volumes as their objective has never been public health."
2020-10-20 12:28:35,"I don't understand this.  43 thousand people under the age of 65 have died of this disease in this country (with 8 million cases).  If we have 20 times that many cases, we should probably expect 20 times the number of deaths.  That's more than 800 thousand dead people, cut short decades before they would normally die.  We have the example of many other countries that have controlled this disease.  Why not follow their example?"
2020-10-20 12:29:53,"What is the plan for shielding teachers and professors when students return to face-to-face classrooms? Or school and university staff that run campuses? It didn't come up in this article, so I guess there is no plan."
2020-10-20 12:31:24,"The Great Barrington Declaration sounds great on a superficial level.
  These scientists call their approach ""Focused Protection,"" which promotes isolating and increasing protection of groups who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 while avoiding lockdowns, letting the rest of the world go back to work, school, sports, and daily life activities while natural infection builds herd immunity.
 They say: ""We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young,"" 
  But here is the problem:  Most elderly people do not live in nursing homes, but live with their families or alone. ""How do you pull these older people to safety? What's the plan?""
  They do not have a plan."
2020-10-20 12:31:45,"The last half of the piece is the most telling -- the supporters of the Great Barrington Declaration have no idea how their own idea could be made to work in the real world.  In the real world, there are many people in elementary schools and colleges/universities (they're called teachers, professors and staff) who have a range of vulnerabilities.  

The same is true for many workplaces. How many could function without the presence of people over 60 or with chronic conditions that affect vulnerability?

But it's the message Donald Trump wants to hear."
2020-10-20 12:32:08,"While most of our immediate focus is on dealing with the Pandemic, another important activity is understanding how the jump to humans occurred so it can be prevented.   When an airline disaster occurs we take tremendous effort to understand the root cause and address it so it can never happen from a preventable cause again.  This can mean reassembling the debris as with TWA flight 800.

If covid-19 was due to wet market hygiene or flawed virology handling procedures, we may be able to identify changes that can prevent a future pandemic.

John"
2020-10-20 12:35:46,"The real issue with lockdowns is that they are not a sustainable long-term solution. If SARS-CoV-2 is say, somewhere between 300-500% more deadly than a typical seasonal flu, and we decide ""this is worth locking down for 8+ months, until we have a widespread vaccine"", what then of the next pandemic with a 150% mortality-as-compared-to-the-flu? Or perhaps a 200% flu?

It is folly to assume Covid is truly a once in a century event. So what then, is the forward looking strategy? Even places that were initially very successful with extremely draconian measures are now still fighting resurgence after resurgence. And yet, the overall mortality rate amongst the general population remains extremely low. As a 32 year old, I'm still more likely to die in a car accident than die of Covid, statistically speaking.

I think, perhaps, Covid stirs such a strong response because it disrupts our latent immortality delusion and the belief that we, as humans, have someone escaped or mammalian shackles. We have not. But rather than accept that SAS-CoV-2 always meant the death of hundreds of thousands of those most at risk, we have instead distributed the pain across all, particularly those already most disenfranchised and at risk. And after all this? The most at risk continue to die.

So fine, at this point, we can make it another several months until vaccines become available, but the question remains, what of the next pandemic?"
2020-10-20 12:37:55,"I'm grateful the NYT is covering this sham declaration.  
It appears likely that any natural immunity we acquire from having been infected with and survived the coronavirus will be temporary, much like influenza.  It's hard to get to herd immunity that way, and how many more people will have to die prematurely in our pursuit of a faulty theory?  
What age, exactly would be considered young enough to throw themselves at the virus?  With the average age of RNs at 50 nationwide, is that young enough?  We can't afford a mass exodus of RNs from health care right now, whether from death, disability or illness.  
I'm very sorry the restaurant/entertainment fields are suffering right now, especially as the cold weather has arrived and folks don't want to eat outdoors,  but nothing could entice me inside an eating establishment or concert venue or airplane for the next year at least.   
NYT, please do more coverage on what we know so far of the longer term effects of this virus on those who survive.  That isn't being talked about enough.  We mostly only hear about the polarities of died and recovered, whatever that means."
2020-10-20 12:40:59,"Every Republican over 60 should pay close attention to Trump’s view of this.  It seems older folks are viewed as expendable.

Governors will beg for federal assistance and Kushner, Pense and Trump will demand public praise for what a great job they are doing or forfeit aid.

Moreover, he is listed as a professor in that field “by courtesy.”  What does that mean?  He is an M.D. with a Ph.D. in economics, but how does that make him an epidemiologist?  It seems like he is well credentialed to make economic-based arguments, but that is far different than claimed expertise on how to deal scientifically with a virus especially since the idea of herd immunity for this virus seems to be driven strongly by economic considerations masking as science.

As a person who had shingles I know how long a virus can hide and do damage. The long term effects of covid  have already been documented and those infected may have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. That is where we should also be focused but I don't see that happening even with Biden in office. 

Get ready for the fourth wave. Americans sickened for years by lingering effects and unable to work. Waiting years for disability payments  and help just as congress is stalled on a second stimulus.

Berlin nearly had the virus licked. We were down to a few hundred known infections. two more weeks, along with a continued restriction on travel, would have done it. But we, like so many other populations, gave up to early. China did not. Look at China. 

Herd immunity propositions ignore a number of things: the oppression to those at risk when others are allowed to run free and the depression that would cause them... The inevitable contact they will have with the 'free'population, either directly or through lingering aerosols... and the serious, long term complications that can afflict even the less vulnerable. We have seen that age and condition provide no guarantee against these things. That is also empirical, not hypothetical.

That should be front and foremost in any proposed viable plan.

A secondary problem with going for herd immunity is what does the herd look like afterwards?  How many young people suffer from continuing “brain fog” and other conditions after contracting the disease?  “Let ‘R Rip” is completely inhuman and cruel to many in service of economic gain for the few. 

This article mentions neither of these issues with the Barrington Declaration nor does it assess the financial burdens placed on Americans who need testing and treatment for Covid19 during the extremely high demand (high price?) period of letting it rip.

Many major financial institutions in New York City had a member on that committee. Many large developers in New York City had a member on that committee. The hedge funds were on the committee. A member of Jared Kushner’s task force was on the committee.

Someday, when this is over there will be an investigation into what happened. What happened was that in mid spring, when it became obvious that the shutdown was grievously damaging the economy, the Trump strategy became to re-open and hope the virus would burn through quickly, while making a Hail Mary dash for treatments and vaccines.

I don’t know if anyone reads these comments. But the truth is that this has been the Trump policy since May. Trump and his administration are killing people. They know it. The insiders on that committee were not just making stuff up. They were big donors, repeating what they had heard from people at high levels within the WH.

Thanks to Trump’s incompetence and wanton disregard for human life, this country is already trying out variations of the Barrington herd immunity theory.  Trump is holding superspreader events, where masks and social distancing are a badge of weakness.  

We have college kids returning to schools, catching Covid-19 in time for the holidays and returning to their homes to spread glad tidings and Covid-19 to siblings, parents, and grandparents.  And, we already have started segregating the older people into nursing homes, where unfortunately, health care workers bring Covid-19 with them. 

Even if the Barrington Project were workable and effective, the segment of the population that would have to quarantine is between 75 -100 million in this country alone.  This means the economy, especially the travel and restaurant sector, would still limp along.

Instead, the funders (who can isolate and can buy the best medical care possible) are willing to let the at risk die if need be, while putting the health of corporate profits first.

Don't forget, there isn't even medical evidence yet that herd immunity is attainable with this specific virus. Herd immunity without vaccination means durable immunity in infected people, and we don't have clarity on that little detail.

So please don't emphasize their Stanford University credentials - more specifically, emphasize the anti-regulation Hoover Institute connection.

Dr. Atlas is a member of the Hoover Institute. That institute also mentions that Dr. Bhattacharya had also been a member.  Dr. Bhattacharya is also an economist, and that's the side I think is doing the taking in this push.

Don't dignify it with the fancy-town name ""Great Barrington Declaration"" either.  Call it the American Institute for Economic Research Declaration, because, again, it's backed and publicized by another of the anti-regulation groups funded so avidly by extremist libertarian billionaires who pretty much don't want a government that can effectively tax or regulate.

I remember those suing the Obama administration for their isolation during the Ebola crisis.  While we now have a vaccine for Ebola, few of us need it.  This, and we expect our first responders and healthcare workers to risk themselves and their families

2020-10-20 14:21:17,"Somebody keep me honest here, but isn't herd immunity supposed to be achieved through mass vaccination, not mass infection?

Like, it doesn't generally arise through transmission except potentially in a literal herd with minimal contact with the other herds. Only in a group smaller than the denominator of the odds would it seem reasonable. So say 1 in 100 infected die, you could see a group of 50 taking their chances even though there's still a 50 percent chance one of them could die. Still not good odds.

Compare to the almost non-existent risk of death from the vaccine for the same disease, so there your herd can actually be 7 billion people and you can achieve herd immunity on a mass scale, such as we have done for measles or polio outside of religious cults.

I clearly remember this from my years arguing with anti-vaxxers on mommy boards. I did so much reading to explain word by word, syllable by syllable, equation after equation, why letting your kid get measles was a very bad idea.

This is like high school level math, if that. We did convince a few people with the algebra and probabilities."

The callousness and immorality of this strategy should be obvious to anyone with a sense of decency.

However, putting to the side the moral issue of the lives that will be unnecessarily lost in pursuit of this misguided strategy and consider this: If you lock away the over-60's, you also remove a big chunk of restaurant patrons and consumers of tourism, travel and other leisure activities. You're talking about starving these industries (and their mostly young workers), while waiting for a ""herd immunity"" that may take years or may never come at all, if immunity is short-lived.

That is a scientific prediction, possibly wrong and possibly right.  It should be evaluated as a statement about science, not politics.

The proponents of this 'declaration' do have one thing right - since the US has failed miserably at containing and controlling SARS-CoV-2, without intervention by vaccine immunity, our future is bleak.

2020-10-20 13:20:58,"So for the herd immunity crowd, let me ask this...  What is the upper limit on the fatality rate of a communicable disease where you all would decide this is not the good route to go down?

I would argue that philosophically proponents of herd immunity need to be able to answer this question before spouting these theories."
2020-10-20 13:24:37,"A colleague of Dr. Atlas at the libertarian right wing funded Hoover Institution at Stanford, Senior Fellow Richard A Epstein, published a paper on March 16 that forecast only 500 Americans would die of COVID, it was titled Coronavirus Perspective. These are people with a prime directive, and it's not our health."
2020-10-20 14:19:47,"It should be noted that one of the authors of the Declaration is Stanford's Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya was the senior author of the preprint, ""COVID-19 Antibody Seroprevalence in Santa Clara County, California,"" which claimed that there were about 50 times as many positive antibody tests in Santa Clara county as symptomatic infections. This study implied that the vast majority of coronavirus cases are asymptomatic, and that the case fatality rate was about fifty times lower than believed, which would make it about as deadly as the flu.

This unrefereed study has now been thoroughly debunked. It had serious statistical and methodological errors that invalidated its conclusions. In fact, the paper was such a fiasco that it prompted over a hundred prominent scientists to come together to propose a rapid refereeing process, so that faulty claims could be vetted before they could influence public policy. See ""How to Identify Flawed Research Before It Becomes Dangerous,"" July 20, 2020, in the nytimes.

I had hoped that Bhattacharya would have been chastened by his research failure, and would reevaluate his conviction that coronavirus was not much worse than the flu. Instead, he is now making policy Declarations based on that same conviction. It certainly appears that the policy declarations are being driven by preexisting biases rather than by science. At any rate, in view of his scientific failures, I don't know why anyone should take his policy declarations seriously."
2020-10-20 14:33:01,"Choosing between lives and the economy is a false choice. Poverty also kills. I am not advocating for a herd immunity approach. At the same time, we need to consider the devastating economic effects of lockdowns. The UN predicts global famine."
2020-10-20 13:50:23,"It seems that the portion of young people who are willing to expose themselves to the virus are already doing so. A larger portion (Remember, younger voters back Biden by a large margin) don't want to get infected, and won't resume normal life because an administration they don't trust tells them to. It's still a free country after all. This alone would prevent herd immunity from happening, as there will always be a portion of the younger population that is able to work remotely and avoid contact, and is introverted enough to not really care about going out to bars and going to class in person.  So this plan is a joke, because the people who are already economically forced to continue work, the essential workers, are already out there. 

Unless they want to start dragging people out of their houses, herd immunity won't happen."
2020-10-20 14:07:14,"""Herd Immunity"" == Let it burn
No thanks. That is not part of my value system and it is not part of ours. If that were the case we'd leave people who didn't wear seatbelts or motorcycle helmets to die by the side of the road because they'd simply made a bad decision. But in this case it's even worse. People who have done everything they can to remain safe and not to infect others are being victimized by the narcissistic pretensions of those who think they know better because their definition of ""freedom"" is more powerful than the clarity afforded by the scientific method."
2020-10-20 14:40:58,"I am disappointed by the virulent reactions to the Great Barrington Declaration .

The Declaration was advocating for a targeted approach to managing the virus that attempts to (a) minimize overall mortality by taking advantage of the huge discrepancy between the health risks for younger /middle aged adults vs. older adults and (b) balance Covid health risks with other public policy objectives.  Why are so many of you wed to the idea that this is impossible?

The article briefly references age differences in Covid risks, but neglects to state how large these are.  The CDC estimates mortality risks at 0.003% < 20 years old, 0.02% for 20-49 years old, 0.5% for  50-69 years old, and 5.4% for > over 70.  This includes people with underlying health conditions.  For the 2/3 of the population younger than 50, the risk of dying from Covid this year is less than the risk of dying in an accident. 

Given current population spread of 1-2% per month, the elderly already need to be hyper-vigilant and multi-generational households already need to decide whether to enforce strong protective measures for the entire household or restrict close contact between the young and elderly.
Allowing those at very minimal risk from Covid to live their lives and build immunity is rationale for them, will minimize collateral economic and social damage from Covid, and actually shrink the time period the elderly need to self-quarantine.  You can argue about the details, but why is this cruel or crazy?"
2020-10-20 14:41:12,"There is no credible evidence that ""herd immunity"" would work and how much pain, suffering and death it would cause that could be avoided with the sensible measures Dr. Nabarro mentions here. It's high time for the government to set the charlatans aside and get serious about properly informed policy designed to contain the spread while sustaining economic activity as well as can be safely managed."
2020-10-20 12:54:36,The Great Barrington nonsense had fake signatures and endorsements by massage therapists instead of medical doctors. Not sure why you neglected to report this in the article. People are expendable Trumps world and real science is scorned.
2020-10-20 13:04:44,"Shocking that the Times would give such ""one side says this the other says that"" reporting to another Koch-funded pseudo-scientific manifesto (like Koch's climate denial efforts). This, when the world's established scientific institutions and particularly those that are most knowledgeable about infectious diseases have spoken clearly and forcefully.
There are at least 7 million scientists in the world. If 1000 who claim to be scientists (but many are economists or engineers) sign, that is still only 1.4 hundredths of 1% of the world's scientists (0.014%). Scientists (and economists) are human beings. What percent of them have personality disorders? What percent are just mistaken?
The Times needs to be more careful about promoting pseudo-science and ignoring the bona fide scientific institutions that can authoritatively explain the scientific consensus."

In the study that was reported at least 20% of recovered Covid-19 patients had NO immunity to the virus.  This is consistent with reports of re-infections.

This has implications for the development and deployment of vaccines.

It also has implications for the long-term shape of society and the economy.  Can selfish, self-centred America adapt?  Or will 60.000,000+ Americans die?

We have evidence of what works - look at Taiwan, S Korea, even China.  Masks, social distancing, testing and contract tracing with methodical discipline has demonstrated success.  S Krea has 500 deaths in a population of 60 million; we have 220,000 deaths and counting in a population of 330 million.
The most basic rule is to look at successful countries and learn from their processes.  These doctors and professors are selling out the public health and our lives to curry favor with Trump.  They know if Trump loses, Biden and the democrats are too soft to exact a measure of punishment.

They are carrying protest signs. Did they really hop off their surfboards, (partially) remove their wetsuits, and grab their signs in time for a protest? Or was somebody grabbing everyone they could find to get in a photo?"
2020-10-20 14:29:33,"Three fundamental questions that the advocates of “herd immunity” have avoided:

1) How long does complete immunity last after an infected person recovers?

2) To what extent do people who are declared “recovered” nonetheless have “lingering “ though serious medical problems?  Should a declaration of “recovered” not await full recovery from all symptoms? The signers of the Declaration should have paused to consider this question. 

3) What is the percentage of “young, strong” persons who contract Covid who require serious medical treatment, hospitalization, and what percentage of these die?

Might doctors who play politicians be just as dangerous as politicians who play doctor?

Is it fair to wonder at the deeply right-wing political associations of these herd advocates—Hoover Institute, Koch think tanks, etc.—and whether there is political bias in the nominally medical opinions they express?"
2020-10-20 13:57:34,"I've been a biomedical scientist for 40 years and know quack science when I see it.  A common feature of these ""proposals"" is that they gloss over the hard problems because they have no solutions.

The so-called Great Barrington Declaration ignores the fact that it is impossible to ""isolate"" the vulnerable population.  Residents of nursing homes, for example, are cared for by nurses, orderlies, janitors and food service workers (among others) who live in the general community, where they are exposed to the virus like everyone else.  They will contract the virus and bring it into the nursing homes, where it will spread to the residents.  Similar phenomena will occur in prisons and colleges, where members of the general community provide essential services.  As COVID-19 runs rampant through these ""isolated"" populations, many will die and other staff members will get infected.

They also ignore people with underlying conditions who live and work in the general community and have no option for isolation.

Having Ph.D.s and MDs doesn't mean that you automatically have special insights.  It just means that you went to school for a long time.  This ""proposal"" would have allot more credibility if it was supported by established public health experts like Dr. Fauci, but he thinks that it's nuts."

Besides, you are looking at the wrong data.  Some people are always getting sick and dying.  Disease and death are a natural course of life. Why interfere with Mother Nature?

2020-10-20 14:11:14,"COVID won't fade away with mythical herd immunity anymore than Trump's other magical solution:  summer.   After 70% of the population has been infected, COVID will be in the background, spread from newly infected to newly infected and when a vulnerable person is infected the possibility of a fatal outcome.   Influenza is not COVID's proper disease model.  COVID is much more lethal and much more infectious.   This administration has employed a mental model of influenza or the common cold since the beginning--how many times did trump refer to its infection as a ""bad cold"".   A more appropriate pathogenic model is polio.  Most cases minor, non-life threatening, but decidedly lethal or life scaring for some.   Prior to the availability of the Salk vaccine no politician, scientist, doctor or some ""think tank""  with its biased self interests would have characterized or worked on the bases of another disease as ""just a bad case of polio"".  Just for reference, polio fatalities in 1952 were only 3145 people in the USA (1.3% of US COVID fatalities in 3/4s of a year) and nobody, nobody in their right mind, dared belittle its effect on the populous. To this very day polio vaccination is the standard.

This administration and their sycophantic minions will sacrifice thousands for political ends.   Frankly, I suspect Trump knows the holiday season shopping and travel (as well as tax revenues) will be very poor and he will effectively murder people in an effort to improve sales."

Those in the USA who refuse to wear masks or social distance are turning the USA into a giant virus incubator. We keep creating more. We are now welll into the third wave of growing cases, because too many people ignore science and believe whatever they want to believe.

The same people that demanded a decade of investigations into the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi shrug off 220,000 deaths as if it is nothing. They ignore the fact that many who survive, even many who don't know they have it, are having long lasting or permanent damage. About half of the people spreading it experience no symptoms so they don't know they are spreading it.

If the USA was following science instead of wishful thinking we could have minimized the reproductive abilities of this virus. Instead we are feeding it new hosts daily.

There has been plenty of balanced coverage of the barrington declaration and many, including thousands of other scientists, have seen it as the starting point towards a new way  that is not a hard or soft lockdown, is not a herd immunity strategy as understood in march of this year and is firmly based in asking a central question: how much death from lockdowns are we willing to ignore in order to justify whatever Covid position I have previously taken?"

For example, what is the current plan actually?  It appears to be reduce transmission to various levels (with no real basis) until there's a vaccine.  But what is there isn't a vaccine?  Or what if it takes 2 years? Or what if people refuse to take it?    And if people take, are they then released from Covid restrictions?  How will we track that? 
 What if some family members take it and others don't? 
 What about religious exemptions?   What if the virus mutates and vaccine stops working?   What is the harms from lockdown (suicide, poverty, abuse, mental health, etc) start to clearly outweigh benefits by orders of magnitude?

Look at Sweden, with affected and death numbers much higher than their neighbors is proof of ""herd immunity"" not working.  Have heard from family and friends from Sweden they worry about yet another wave due to laxed policies.  On the other hand, perhaps they want to reduce the immigrant population which for many Swedes is uncomfortably burdensome and of course, doesn't fit well in a class system."

2020-10-20 11:55:33,"My back of the envelope math shows this. According to the Mayo Clinic, it is estimated that for herd immunity for Covid as much as 70% of a population would need to infected (more highly contagious measles is 94%). 70% of the US population (328 million) is 229,600,000. 

Dividing the number of recorded deaths from Covid by the number of reported infections (as of 10/19/20 in NYT) gives a rate of death from Covid as 2.7%. [219,775/8,200,000]

So for herd immunity to be effective in US, 229.6 million people would need to be infected and we could expect 2.7% of them to die. 2.7% of 229.6 million is 6,199,200 deaths. 

They will say many more are infected so the rate of death is lower. However to suggest herd immunity as a strategy is unethical and cruel."

And just who are the vulnerable? A majority may be older people living in assisted living communities. But, too many health care professionals and too many young people with no known per-existing morbidities have already died. The last thing we need is a a willfully ignorant president being led by a willfully  ignorant adviser who is fantasizing theories rejected by almost every knowledgeable epidemiologist. 

While there is a cult-like population of ignorant self-deluded Americans who believe anything Trump tells them in spite of evidence clearly showing Trump is lying, the majority of Americans no longer believe anything coming from the Trump administration. Vaccines will produce herd immunity      once they are proven by REAL science to be effective and safe. Until then Trump and his lap dog, Atlas,,are just snake oil salesmen.

I, like 97% of Americans over 65, do not live in a nursing home or other institution. The administration’s vague promises to provide testing and PPE to nursing homes, even if they are honored, will do nothing to protect me and the tens of millions of Americans like me. In fact, the case mortality rate for Covid-19 begins to go up steeply not at age 65, but around age 50, and at least half of Americans over 50 have risk factors for severe disease. 

The idea of relying on herd immunity and discouraging efforts to limit the spread of Covid-19, which the Trump Administration is following, is a fraud, and any legitimate physician-scientist knows it. It is convenient for Trump’s re-election campaign, but, if pursued, would result in over a million unnecessary deaths. It would represent a return to the epidemiology of the mid 1800’s, when death due to infection was the norm and life was short."

The pandemic is is not some benign inconvenience to the economy, it has the potential to utterly break apart civil society by making it dysfunctional and incapable of taking care of anyone. No country on earth can provide all the needed medical care with patients from a pandemic spreading at the natural rates known to be possible. Any scientist or medical professional should know this from their formal educations in mathematics and biology. The societies  will find that the capacities are exhausted and will forced to triage all care, not just for this novel coronavirus. People will be left untreated by trained medical professionals because the resources just are not their.

The majority view does not always turn out to the correct view.  Science is often plagued by a pack mentality, just as journalism is. The Barrington proposal should be given consideration by policy makers.

The majority view supports Draconian lockdowns, as strict and long-lasting as necessary to contain the pandemic, essentially regardless of the collateral damage they cause. The problem is the side effects are extraordinarily harmful.  The collapse of the global economy is reducing many in the US to catastrophic poverty. Worldwide, there is widespread hunger and starvation, and preventable diseases are increasing dramatically.

Further, the lockdowns defer but do not prevent Covid. As they are mitigated, the pandemic returns in full force; as now evident throughout the US and Europe.

Thus, a balanced approach containing elements of the Barrington strategy may indeed be best. Masks should be mandatory; large gatherings including protests should be largely prohibited, and we should protect the vulnerable, including seniors.

Things have become politicized in the US; liberals support lockdowns (except for protests); the right supports lifting restrictions.

2020-10-20 15:45:28,"Herd immunity has rarely been achieved by humans for coronaviruses.  Evidence shows that we are routinely re-infected by these viruses over the course of our lives.  Evidence also shows that we typically have a limited period of immune protection following infection, thus immunity is often transient.  To make matters more concerning, there are also several coronaviruses which are capable of the phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement.  We simply do not know at the moment if SARS-CoV-2 is capable of ADE.

Considering this, perhaps before embarking on a strategy for herd immunity, it would be wise to a) identify if it is in fact possible to achieve herd immunity and b) clarify whether or not the antibodies produced in response to the virus are in fact priming patients for a far more severe disease on the second, third and/or fourth subsequent reinfections."

- Sweden has ""one of the highest death rates in the world"" is a subjective and misleading statement.  Not scientific.  Since their method is currently, with minimal restrictions, yielding an extremely low death rate and case rate it should be taken seriously.  Deaths in Sweden for the Last 7 Days - 24 for a rate of 0.2 per 100,000.  

- The article completely fails to mention that every European country that has locked down has seen very high case increases upon even limited re opening.   In France they are seeing the highest case numbers on record!  Deaths in France for the Last 7 Days - 788 for a rate of 1.2 per 100,000.

The  quality of their  ""research"" is so poor and methodologically dubious and incomplete  that they can't hope to  attract funding support that mainstream  researchers  draw  upon.

difficult to contain, so the best thing to do is deny the danger

Of course, when they

Second, the popularity of their proposal has nothing to do with it's validity. The declaration was necessitated by the fact that so many people have been advocating for misguided, detrimental, and draconian responses to the coronavirus pandemic -- measures that have resulted in far more deaths and far greater economic damage than were necessary.

As stated in the declaration,  “The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk."" 

If we had responded to Covid-19 the way we had for the past three pandemics (H2N2,  H3N2, and H1N1) and the seasonal flu, there would have been fewer deaths, insignificant damage to the economy, and we would have already achieved herd immunity, essentially ending the pandemic.

Consider that Dr. Trump had also called upon ""Dr."" Stella Immanuel, whose medical degree from the prestigious University of Calabar in Nigeria sets her ahead of Drs. Fauci and Birx in his mind. Her epidemiological experience includes statements that scientists are developing vaccines to keep people from being religious, and that space alien DNA is used in medical treatments.

For instance, the term 'herd immunity' is now being used synonymously for 'letting the virus rip through society and getting it over with'.  

But before this pandemic, the term was used correctly as referring to a state in which immunity was present at such a high prevalence in the population that an infection could not get a foothold and spread.  That can be achieved by having lived through the infection OR by immunization.

At present, that distinction has been lost, the camps are entrenched and all sides refuse to even consider that the other side may have some value to add to an overall strategy that minimizes death, suffering and economic destruction.  

What I am most discouraged by is that even among academics and physicians, who SHOULD be able to understand the relative importance of the different parameters, the shutters have come down and rational discourse is no longer possible.

The result is that more people are dying and suffering, medically and economically, than necessary.

The only qualification necessary for Trump was that he appeared on Fox ""News"" spewing the garbage the far right wanted its followers to hear. There simply is no herd immunity possible without a vaccine. Time for all this deadly nonsense to come to a complete halt."

The band of lemmings who want to lead us into pestilence  forgot or never learned Santayana's injunction, ""Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it"".

Modern authors, John Burns and Laurie Garrett, tell the story well but the greatest read comes from the great 20th century historian, Barbara Tuchman.  Her ""A Distant Mirror"" chronicled a long ago time of troubles, the 13th Century. Humanity survived those pandemics but an awful lot of people didn't.

The media's attention has been focused on the bad science but the more important considerations are moral.  If COVID 19 is left unchecked until a vaccine appears, people of all ages who would have survived under a regimen of social distancing, mask wearing and an efficient testing regime will die. The majority of them will be the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.  

""Herd immunity"", as these chaps propose, is tantamount to forced euthanasia, ""culling the herd"".  I would have expected religious leaders to speak out but haven't heard much, perhaps because some have rented out their consciences to the Trump campaign, which believes a  ""herd immunity"" strategy will benefit his re=election.

Mask deniers should revise the Great Barrington declaration to extoll the fiscal virtues of ""herd immunity"", among them a Swiftian reduction in Social Security beneficiaries and Medicare recipients, long a Republican goal."

As far as covid-19 statistic around the world can tell us, USA, India, Brazil etc allowed the Sars-CoV-2 to attack the population without much resistance. It is not too far from formally adopting a policy of herd immunity.

Essential workers, medical workers, people of all ages with chronic health conditions, those who are obese, lower income workers who have no choice but to work in crowded environments, people in multi-generation households, and anyone over 65 are all disposable under the Barrington declaration. Anyone who might need a hospital bed or surgery could be out of luck or vulnerable since Covid-19 would exhaust many hospitals” medical resources and bed space.

2020-10-20 16:33:37,"What's missing from this argument is that infection may not confer immunity. There are a number of documented and proven cases of reinfection that meet a very stringent set of scientific criteria nearly impossible to obtain in the US due to lack of testing, and that certainly excludes anyone who was 'presumed positive' as many of us were due to test inaccessibility.

I was presumed positive in March. I'm 40, 'low risk', so was denied a test. It took months nonetheless for me to recover and I still have some lingering effects. Believe me, I'm not partying maskless anywhere. There's no evidence I'm immune and I never want to go through that again. A friend of mine who is an attending physician said her sickest patients currently are those who had COVID-19 in the spring, or who were presumed positive.  The most important question in this debate is whether infection confers immunity, and it's being steadfastly ignored by all, from the scientific leadership to the politicians."

The old, infirm, disabled, chronically ill and therefore more costly to keep alive may as well update their obituaries while the young and healthy  survive with the afterbirth of COVID: foggy brain, memory loss, and other side effects. I wrote before that the US is stumbling toward herd immunity. Well here it is. It's going to happen given 100,000,000 of us won't take the vaccine due to trust, religion, anti-vax or other reason. And since 7.8 million of those infected have survived what do we have to lose. Beats what happened 100 years ago."
2020-10-20 16:43:45,"""The manifesto’s central tenet is that young people should be free to resume normal life — to re-enter the work force, attend college, dine in restaurants. They would become infected, hopefully without much illness, and gain immunity.""

Now I feel foolish. I'd forgotten that the US is divided geographically into zones occupied by age group, so there's no interaction between the college-aged and anyone over 28 years old.

The employees at my supermarket? Very youthful looking septuagenarians, I'm sure.

Staff at senior citizens homes? Why, the residents run everything themselves!

And ever since society stopped things like family gatherings at Thanksgiving, or all that inter-generational stuff, what prevents young people from living carefree lives during a pandemic?

So this “declaration” is being passed off by his PR people as a group effort, but the voice behind it is Charles Koch’s entirely.

The biggest lie offered by its public shills is that scientists and academics are signing it… but in fact, how its signatories identify themselves is entirely on the “honor system” — anyone reading this today can sign the fraudulent document online identifying themselves as a public health expert, physician, or scientist, even if they really are a 19-year-old unemployed telemarketer. Anyone could sign this fraudulent document 20 times as 20 different scientists — in fact, this likely is the outcome the document’s contrivers hope for!

Asked by an investigative reporter about the ease with which Charles Koch’s “declaration” can be gamed, a spokesperson behind it claimed to be actively verifying signatures, but when the reporter pointed out his own had never been verified, the spokesperson went silent and exchanged no further communication with the reporter. To date, the phony signature remains unverified.

In his long history of nefarious, un-American breaches of the public trust, this may be Charles Koch’s most malignant scheme yet. It’s no concern to him how many vulnerable people die, so long as he can continue accruing money and power uninterrupted."

It is an evidence-free, detail-light web post designed to avoid efforts which have proved effective in balancing public health and economic health in many places around the world.

They advise letting ""the immune"" live completely normal lives during the pandemic. Sounds great, but we don't yet know how long immunity from this virus lasts. Current evidence is that those with the most severe infections might be protected longer than those with mild or asymptomatic cases. But, of course, those with the severe infections are also often dealing with a wide variety of side effects, heart damage being a big one.

They recommend changes in nursing home staffing that anti-regulation groups and big investors have and will fight against to protect their more lax, and profitable, staffing approach.  We are also harmed as another article recently pointed out by the fact that Trump's immigration policies have reduced the number of low-wage immigrant workers so much of nursing care depend on.

This declaration also mentions doing things that are already the approach taken in careful parts of the country - but they fail, of course, to mention masks.

And while Covid has spiked in Sweden the deaths remain low even given the lag time. They should have protected the elderly better in the spring, but at least they acknowledge this fact, unlike the governor of NY who denies any culpability in the thousands of NY nursing home deaths.  Instead he has decided to write a book touting his 'success' in a state where over 30,000 people have died so far."

They could gather in large venues, get infected quickly and efficiently in large batches. They could then remain isolated from the vulnerable population until they are no longer contagious.  

If we dawdle around waiting for infection to occur on its own, herd immunity could take a very long time to be achieved. During this time, the economy would clearly continue to suffer.

In all of these surrounding states hospitals are being pushed to the limit on Covid beds with associated mortality and morbidity levels.

Once the South Korean data was available last Spring it should have been obvious that drastic measures targeting and supporting the elderly were called for. The measures taken in the US at the behest of Fauci et al are a joke. Elderly people work in stores and go about their business as if wearing a mask fixes everything. Over one hundred thousand elderly people have died from COVID because they continued to see other people. Putting young people out of work and devastating the economy and state budgets has not protected the elderly. This is not due to Trump. It is the fault of people who feel morally superior when they say that ""we're all in this together"". Mass restrictions did little to protect the 70, 80, and 90-somethings who are the primary victims of COVID-19. True social isolation for these people is the only effective response. The NYT relentlessly pushes stories about sick or dead younger people leaving credulous readers thinking that COVID is a deadly killer for everyone. This is only true in the sense that cars or tornadoes are deadly killers for everyone. COVID kills the elderly! The CDC data is readily available. For the rest of us it is a risk on par with many other things we just ignore. Obesity is 10 times more deadly and cause vastly more chronic illness."

If we think about 8 million people currently in the US having tested positive for Covid-19, and 220,000 have died so far, which is approx. 0.03% of the 8 million infected. So by my calculation, if 60% of all Americans are infected, and 0.03% DIE, that's about 9.8 million DEAD Americans. 
I'm no math expert, so please correct me if I'm off, but how herd immunity can even be considered as a strategy is beyond my comprehension. Let's say even a smaller % of people die, because maybe more compromised people died earlier in the pandemic, let's say 0.01% that is STILL 3.2 million dead Americans. If we think temporary shut downs and wearing masks is bad, how about mass death across the nation? Not sure how that's good for anything other than fighting climate change..."

The projection of massive deaths is just not proving to be true."
2020-10-20 19:03:54,I am actually surprised by those Stanford professors! They should have done some basic study such as a modeling or simulation and come up with numbers and statistics such as 1) how much percent of infection we need to get herd immunity (20% is pure nonsense); 3) how long would it take to get this level of infection? 4) How many people would be hospitalized and can our hospital system handle such a flux of patients? 5) Other necessary preparations we have to do as a society!

2. Lockdown with no vaccination will last for many years with millions of deaths from Covid; and economic burden and mental problems like anxiety and depression.

It's would be a very progressive solution as the situation would be more difficult for the rich. Wealthy parents would want their young adult children to use the wealth to sequester and remain safe like themselves, but the headstrong kids would refuse, some working and others just continuing to party, both exposing themselves to COVID-19.

It seems our ideologies can be so much a part of us that scientist presented with the same methods and facts can draw very different conclusions if there is any gray area.  Gray tends to get pushed toward black or white depending on ones bias.

It seems that as soon an issue involves government enforced behavior changes or  taxes it becomes political.  I see parallel between the Pandemic  and CO2 based climate change.  

Both have distinctly different camps.  Both have different opinions from different scientist.  Both have statements signed by many experts.

It really doesn't matter that we have one reality (set of facts) and one body of scientific knowledge for the purpose of having fierce debates as soon government mandates are imposed on people.

Having flouted all CDC guidelines developed to keep American's safe, and gone even further to infect his family and staff with the corona virus, he refuses to take any responsibility for his buffoonery.
 
As election day approaches and he continues to slip in the national polls, we fully expect his madness to bloom and corrupt the media.
 
Dr Fauci is not only a responsible public servant with impeccable credentials that speak for itself, he is also a living legend, hence the insanity coming out of Trumpville."

So if Fauci were an idiot whose message was unwelcome to so many of us, why would Trump include Fauci?
Trump is sore that Fauci was right about the preventive measures we need to take, about the inevitability of Trump getting infected, about being misquoted.

Is there anyone with some intelligence, morals, honesty 
left in this administration?

I am in constant disbelief and dismay that such a group of ignorant people (includes atlas who should know better than
to pretend to be a specialist in field for which he has no training) rules our country -- and I say rules deliberately.

Republicans in Congress, you know that trump and his advisors are dangerous. When do you speak out? Or are you rats too scared to act intelligently, jump off the sinking ship and save American Democracy ?

2020-10-20 01:01:42,"It is astounding to me-a person who relishes the messages of history-to see that the White House has now enabled their very own Lysenko to advise this president on topics for which he is not qualified. The history is that Stalin appointed Trofim Lysenko, a lowly ""agronomist"" as head of agriculture and championed his crackpot theories of genetics to enable this charlatan to dominate Soviet genetics and biology for close to 40 years. When the rest of the world in 1930s-1960s were championing Mendelian genetics, this crackpot was pushing his own theories which caused food shortages and the deaths of opposition Soviet scientists. 

While the comparison with the present situation in Washington seems interesting, we know that Trump is a person who seeks any help from any quarter-with no need for truth or science. I suspect his new advisor will not be around that much longer and certainly will be ousted with the changing of the guard. America will not permit these kinds of false medical theories to become the norm in spite of Trump or any other officials."

As usual too, his audience will take his demeaning of Fauci as reason to ignore Fauci's warnings.  It is incredible but no longer a surprise that Trump values the loyalty of his base voters more than he values their health and their lives."

What worked running against H Clinton is unlikely to work the same result in 2020 as Dr. Fauci is not the candidate and does not rise to the snickering bait the DJT faithful shovel out by the bucketload. Meanwhile, VP Biden continues to expose the silliness and utter futility of DJT as President. All that remains to witness is if the Electoral College can snuff out a pathetic loser or provide yet another unimaginable shock to the American Experiment."

The same Dr. Fauci whom Trump calls ""a disaster"" presently appears (out of context and against his wishes) as an authoritative presence in a Trump campaign ad.

They get their news from Fox News, Facebook and/or Trump. They scorn masks, question proved scientific data and generally disregard the experts. Heaven help us when a safe and effective vaccine arrives. In all likelihood, they won’t accept it. Any the funniest (saddest?) thing that I’ve heard from a few die-hard Trump supporters about why they won’t accept a vaccine? “My body, my choice”. And they don’t even comprehend the hypocrisy when challenged."

Critical decisions are made and often reversed in the same day. Turnover of key personnel is terrible. Backbiting is the norm. Family members answer to no one. Today's truth may have no relationship to that of tomorrow. Trump wants all of the authority but accepts no responsibility. 

If ever he had reported to a true Board of Directors, at best he would playing golf on a public course today. Everyone should just walk out....including the man holding the ""football"" brief case."

Thank god my kids are grown. I can't imagine having young,  impressionable kids to raise and what a full time job it must be to counter balance the horrific behavior they are witnessing on a daily basis. The name calling, bullying, and whining are behaviors that belong to a toddler, not an adult. I am so tired of his narcissism and immature behavior.

Mislabels and inaccurate postage labels are being printed and circulated by the Postmaster General. Fast and slow processes are being designed to speed or delay vaccine delivery to favorable and unfavorable populations. Why isn't any responsible newspaper publishing the names of the politically motivated and sworn-into-office investors and profiteers from the vaccine, distribution and essential peripherals? How much of this will come to pass? We won't know until it's far too late to stop."

They simply don't care -- about 220,000 deaths, about the millions who have suffered through the infection and its after effects, about the 10s of millions who have lost jobs, businesses and livelihoods. They seem to think with enough time (but minimal effort) the virus will just tire out (I'm quite convinced many believe the virus will end with the end of the year, as if its on a temp contract or something). They refuse to understand that unchecked spread will kill more people and close more businesses. 

They say what Trump says doesn't matter. Whatever."

COVID is a terrible disease.  It must be respected and feared for its ability to kill across the age spectrum and pray upon those with other medical maladies and those in marginalized communities.  Not all citizens will have access to the $50,000 cocktail of medications that our clueless president received at Walter Reed Hospital. Shame on you Mr. President!

I know the USSR even under Gorbachev was a country full of liars and Communist Party apparatchiks who wanted to safeguard their privileges like luxurious Black Sea dachas. But even they at a basic level respected scientists.  

I'm thinking of the Chernobyl disaster because the USSR ceased to exist 5 years later in December 1991. Don't rule that out as an outcome for the United States. The damage Donald Trump & Co. have done in 2020 is incalculable."

2. The narcissist is criticized in some way, even when the critique is made diplomatically, reasonably, and constructively.

3. The narcissist isn’t treated as the center of attention, even when there are other priorities.

4. The narcissist is caught breaking rules, violating social norms, or disregarding boundaries.
 
5. The narcissist is asked to be accountable for his or her actions.

6. The narcissist suffers a blow to his or her idealized, egotistical self-image (such as when being told he will not be given “exception to the rule”, or be granted “special treatment”).

7. The narcissist is reminded of his or her charade, manipulation, exploitation, inadequacy, shame, or self-loathing.

2020-10-20 01:14:08,"Trump continues to display ""dyslexia"" of the intellect. He has it exactly backwards once again: HE is the disaster. In fact, he is a series of disasters beginning with his soliciting and accepting the help of the Russians to interfere in our elections, and then alienating our allies, while currying favor with our enemies, even going so far as to tacitly condone the paying of bounties for dead American soldiers! But the ""crowning achievement"" of his reign of error, was mishandling the response to Covid-19, which has led to thousands of needless deaths and sickened Americans. 

Of course that was not an ""error"", it was intentional. He held back the information and response needed in order to give a private early warning to his investor friends so that they could avoid the stock meltdown he knew was coming, and so they could also engage in shorting stocks to make a killing - literally as it turns out due all the deaths that followed.

And for all the promises he handed out like candy, how many did he deliver on? Are there more and better paying jobs? No! Did manufacturing return to the U.S.? No! Did he get a better NAFTA deal? Hardly! Did he rescue the coal industry? No! Did he bring our troops home? No! 

No, what he DID do was enrich himself, his family, and his cronies, enlarging the ""swamp"" he promised to drain. And set the stage for his own version of a Reich as he threatens to ignore the will of the People.

Disaster? More like a cataclysm."
2020-10-20 02:48:00,"For once, I agree with Trump: from Trump’s self-interested perspective, Dr Fauci is a disaster. He commands the respect of the American people that Trump only wishes he had. Every time Dr Fauci speaks on television, he reminds people of the things they ought to be doing to mitigate the pandemic, the very things that Trump urges people not to do. Dr Fauci is smart and accomplished, works hard, speaks clearly and cogently— none of which describes Donald Trump. So sure, Dr Fauci’s competence is disastrous for an incompetent president."

We were already having a shortage and he didn’t want to create bigger problems for healthcare providers who needed them so desperately. However, he has been far too passive in my opinion. He should make his positions & former statements and the reasonings clear to the public and stop seeming afraid to speak up against Trump. I think, as a person, it will become his biggest regret when he looks back, if he lets it continue. Trump is stomping all over him and he doesn’t deserve it."

Also, part of what people are tired of is all this ridiculous denial and/or arguing over facts. How many more times do we need to hear the same argument over masks? 

There is a lot we don’t know. But we do know a few things: Infection rates are rising. People are often infectious before showing symptoms (if they show them at all). The primary way COVID spreads is through breathing in droplets containing the virus. Masks help reduce the spread b/c they keep us from sharing as many of our droplets with others. Transmission is more likely inside where everyone is breathing the same air. And/or in crowded areas where people stand near each other for prolonged periods of time. 

And yes, masks are not the most fun thing to wear. I have an anxiety disorder and the difficulty of breathing with one on can definitely raise my anxiety. Nor are they made for deliberately taking deep breaths to slow your breathing and calm yourself. 

But they’re also not as bad as they’ve been made out to be. The way you hear some people talk, it’s as if they were being asked to wear a hazmat suit."

But, of course, that can't be the case.  For two reasons.

First, if we can blame Covid deaths on Trumplethinskin, then ""they"" lose and ""we"" win.  And  though I take a back seat to no one in my disdain for the current occupant of the Oval Office, ""winning"" by fear-mongering will only, in the end, result in our own defeat.  Just like I hope Trumplethinskin's past and current fear-mongering will result in his defeat.

Second ... well, that's much more complicated as it asks each and every one of us to explore just how much we are willing to sacrifice to assure that each and every one of us NEVER DIES?"
2020-10-20 02:10:09,"Trump’s argument that if we listened to Fauci we’d have 500,000 deaths sounds even more macabre then he intended it to be, since we are going to reach that horrific number regardless. 
And if we continue dealing with the pandemic the Trump way, with or without him, it will happen much earlier then if we listen to science, which he advices us to ignore."
2020-10-20 02:05:46,"People aren't tired of hearing about the Coronavirus....

Thank-you, Dr. Fauci, for saving us."

Vote for change, please."
2020-10-20 02:29:51,"I’m concerned that Trump’s pandemic advisor is a neuro radiologist? The only training he would have received on infectious diseases would have  been a bit during medical school (and none during his neuro radiology residency training) which was before he even received his medical doctor degree. There’s nothing in his training to give me confidence he will advise the President and this country wisely during this pandemic. Nobody should be encouraging herd immunity, which failed in Sweden, due to the cost in human suffering there."
2020-10-20 02:23:50,"Dr. Fauci is a national treasure, his work lauded starting with the AIDS epidemic of the 80's.  If this were any other decent, compassionate, and moral human being other than Trump, he or she would be humbled after being infected by this deadly virus.  One would be forever grateful that he was SAVED because of a dedicated team of health care professionals.  But Trump?  He proclaims he is not only cured but also immune; he tells his mesmerized followers that masks in many cases CAUSE the spread of Covid-19.  Hug, kiss, embrace each other...anything goes.  If he is invincible, so are they.  The fact is he knows darn well that neither he nor anyone else is invincible.  But his egomania and delusions of omniscience can not admit a mistake or an error of judgement.  He destroys.  If he goes down, so must all others."

I know this has been discussed ad nauseum; but how can his supporters not see that he has never accomplished anything without his daddy’s money and help? And even with that he’s failed at pretty much everything he’s ever had his tiny hands in."
2020-10-20 02:25:06,"Trump probably doesn’t like Fauci because he complained about the political ad and gets too much press attention. However, I think Fauci is a disaster and Trump, like a broken clock, is right. He, along with the cdc and who, keep changing their recommendations.  First, they said masks are not effective. Then it’s the key to life on earth. They keep changing the ways that the virus can spread. Do you remember 6 months ago when you couldn’t touch anything?  There is still no easily obtainable info about the ease of spread. No good info on the effectiveness of masks or how temperature or humidity effect the spread.  Fauci has also made contradictory statements on reopening and shutting down."
2020-10-20 01:58:23,"Personally, I am glad for Dr. Fauci's expertise and  recommendations, even as they evolve. I sincerely hope that no Americans have actually died because they took this president seriously. That would just be too awful to think about..."

What made this despicable act even more so was when Trump's supporters reacted to prez's comment by booing Dr. Fauci.

Trump and his diehard followers -- keyword ""followers"" (far from leaders) -- are made for each other: devoid of decency, reason, and saving grace.

It's one thing to support Trump's political viewpoints (that's fine), but wholly unacceptable to cast mean-spirited aspersions at those with differing viewpoints -- especially a medical doctor, whose expert viewpoints about Covid are Incontestable. These Trumpians are a curse.

As soon as November 3rd's Blue Tsunami has knocked Trump off his fantasy perch, he and all his lemming loyalists should pack up and head for the farthest little island in the sea. Good riddance.

Meanwhile, it's well past the time for Dr. Fauci to directly inform Trump what the good doctor and all of the rest of us decent, rational American adults have known for a long, long time: It's Trump who's a Disaster."

I am so sick and disgusted by Trump's insulting statements to Dr. Faucci, and by Trump's idiotic contrary advice to do the opposite of what makes common sense to decrease the virus spread as quickly as possible.

I taught at an academic medical university in New York for more than 30 years, and many of my friends and colleagues are still there doing their jobs conscientiously and as best they can under the worst circumstances--made all the more worse by a unprepared, lazy, self-centered, delusional, deranged president, who holds spreader events in his honor and spews nonsense, insults, and chaos instead of doing his job as the leader of our beleaguered nation.

My heart actually aches for all the thousands of doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, and other health professionals who put their lives and the lives of their family members on the line to try to treat millions of very sick and dying patients in hospitals and nursing homes.  Trump won't even say ""Thank you!"" And then wakes up the next day to do more damage so he can get himself elected again.

More worrisome is that about 30-40% of our population belligerently follows Trump into the Valley of Death. How does that make all these hard working, courageous health professionals feel?

In a way the bad-mouthing Dr Fauci is entertaining because it’s so nothing and transparent. And yet with all of deaths we have from COVID and what Dr Fauci has worked so patiently and devoutly towards, it’s not entertaining at all ... not when one considers what death is, including extended effects. Trump thinks he can “win” by being contrary ... he can’t. Consumed with self, he takes us nowhere."

2020-10-20 04:07:00,"Thank you Dr. Fauci. Unlike Drs. Birx and Redfield you have been steadfast in your attempts to maximize your efficacy while always being straight with the American public.

Each utterance by DJT increases the likelihood that the tiny group of truly undecided voters (vs. those who've made up their minds but are unwilling to admit it to the pollsters) breaks to Biden. 

Unfortunately what we need now is for that huge group of folks unwilling or unable to mask, social distance, bundle up and accept open windows and fans during the cold season to minimize indoor aerosols, and practice hand/mask/facial hygiene to start doing something that they have refused to do since the above-mentioned prophylactic behavior was politicized by DJT, his enablers, and of late, Scott Atlas. 

What we are going to need post election is for DJT to humbly and abjectly plead with his base to change their ways. But there is no likelihood that is going to happen. 

Many more people will get infected than might have been had DJT only listened to the scientists. We can only hope that out of fear, embarrassment, and/or shame, as the case count rises, the enablers change their tune en masse. Otherwise it is going to be a very difficult 2-3 months."

Fauci  has been around for what five hundred years.

No one under 70 years old has a high chance of mortality.

Trump said in the debate that no one except elderly people with pre-existing conditions have a negative outcome from this virus.

Even if the mortality rate for those under 70 is .5%, that is a lot of people to be writing off. America has a lot of elderly people and even with the young we are looking at .5% of hundreds of millions of people. We do not know the long term effects of the coronavirus as well.

The United States is not alone in this world fighting the virus, other countries have gone under lockdowns and their economies have not collapsed. A matter of fact some countries appear to have emerged from this virus far better positioned health wise and economically than the United States.

'Fauci has served American public health in various capacities for more than 50 years, and has been an advisor to every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan. He was one of the leading researchers during the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s.  Fauci has been a visiting professor at many medical centers, and has received 30 honorary doctorates from universities in the U.S. and abroad.' Wikipedia"

2020-10-20 07:39:33,"The Trump Administration is not only spreading disinformation about Covid-19, it's responding to systemic problems in American healthcare networks. On good authority, the President knows its weak points, which is the lack of integration between and within the private and public sectors, between the NIH and the local hospitals, between the governors and the public health infrastructure, between the insurance providers and policy holders, and lastly but most critically, the relationship between doctor and patient, which is primarily financial. 

Without an effective healthcare system, America is vulnerable to all manner of quacks, grifters, charlatans, opportunists and hackers, and chief among them is the President. Vaccine developers have the only clear path to achieving results in this chaotic environment.

Three trillion dollars buys a lot of junk, and that is what America is annually spending on healthcare. Perhaps Trump is correct in that the only way to deal with it is to let the whole house of cards fall down. Face it, he has sown so much confusion, all the King's horses and all the King's men cannot put it back together again."

Being called a disaster by Donald Trump is actually among the greatest accomplishments one can achieve. It means you are not only doing your job, but that you are doing it so well that even Donald Trump has given you what he knows is the highest honor he can bestow on anyone - a 5 year old’s playground insult. Because once he resorts to that, it means you’re a superstar and are taking away the limelight from him. 

I am so proud of Dr. Faucci. And thank you Donald Trump for elevating the good doctor’s profile. Knowing that Dr. Fuacci has made it so high on your list of targets, validates him as the greatest infectious disease specialist of all time."

All this wealth came from being the first in inventing new stuff and make it available to a broad public. From the Ford T to the iPhone. This is the real america.

2020-10-20 11:04:01,"I agree completely with Dr. Fauci’s recommendations of wearing face masks and social distancing. However I think he would better connect with the public if he and all the other infectious disease experts who regularly appear on television used common words instead of medical terminology when talking about Covid complications.
Instead of ‘cardiovascular’ and ‘cardiorespiratory’ words commonly used by health care providers in referring to the heart and lungs, infectious disease experts would be more effective in convincing people to wear masks and practice social distancing if they used simple words understood  by the general public.  
Talk about the lungs and the heart and how they work together and how  corona can affect them in simple words. Stop using ‘mitigate’ in referring to controlling the spread of Covid and use the simple word ‘control’ ; it is more readily understood by most. 
The language of medicine is clear to health care providers but most people only have a vague understanding of what they mean."

Effectively dealing with it is already completely beyond Trump/McConnell’s capacity.  If both are returned to power, it means the effective end if the American republic and polity as we know it.  

That’s Putin’s intent and interest in our national imbroglio.  He prefers to conquer us from within, neutralizing us in Europe, than conquering us from without; at least initially.  So, he found a modern day Alcibiades to do his dirty work for him.  History does repeat itself, but not as farce.  Ancient Athens and Sparta.  Rome and Carthage."

Maybe a Presidential cable-TV viewing room would be more appropriate... perhaps have screens set-up with his campaign rally rants on loop, so future generations can fully appreciate the ""stable genius"" in full.

Yet, the Trump cult has chosen to take a stand for ""liberty"" over regulations that require wearing a mask during the worst pandemic in over 100 years.

Why? Because Trump continues to downplay the effects of Covid-19 for purely political purposes.

If a builder knowingly creates a dangerous structure, if a food producer negligently threatens public health, if a physician dispenses illegal drugs, they would all face a fine and even jail time.

Meanwhile, the president of the United States is using the same reckless and irresponsible behavior as a ploy for reelection."
2020-10-20 09:39:58,"As a leader , if we can't listen to our subordinates, the system fails, irrespective of personalities. I think this simple management, am sure POTUS knows about. Our ego makes us to not to see reality and takes us the down hill. This also POTUS must be aware.

Dignity in everything we do is the key to good outcome."
2020-10-20 10:18:13,"Didn’t Trump say that we were going to have a vaccine before the end of the year.?

 Trump doesn’t think we can maintain our strategy and focus for just a few more months."
2020-10-20 11:11:52,"So much for Trump's little speech about kindness, decency, and good character. He is at is again.  It is obvious that his speech was an attempt to convince voters that he is a decent human being. He is willing to stand up and say anything to get the voters to like him; except renounce hate and conspiracy groups that is."
2020-10-20 09:52:45,This is an international crisis. It isn’t a crisis exclusive to the United States.we can benchmark our response to the responses of other countries. What country has ended up in a depression due to the coronavirus? Have other countries kept their infection rates so low that they have been able to emerge from this pandemic relatively unscathed compared to the United States. My understanding is that our response has been the worse. We don’t even provide the universal healthcare to survive this virus as other advanced nations do for their citizens.
2020-10-20 10:04:26,"Dr. Fauci has gained wisdom and experience from his years of experience. It takes a lot of expertise and skill to remain in place for 500 years over many different administrations. 

I am amazed that Trump has lasted four years."
2020-10-20 04:03:58,"Dr. Fauci is a well respected globally well known infectious disease expert. But he needs to talk more about how America killed public health and promoted hospital-based emergency-room-centered pharma-dominated medicine. Dr.Fauci needs to get off the dangerous American media that'll push you sky high for ratings and then crush you. Dr.Fauci needs to get back to health, public health and responsible medical practice...not a media darling. America is now a divided deranged place where professionals and objective experts are swallowed up by partisan politics and for-profit media. Sad indeed!"
2020-10-20 02:53:25,"Trump/GOP insisted Coronavirus was a hoax to the public, all the while selling their assets to an unsuspecting public. Then Trump/GOP promised hydroxychloroquin was the magic cure to the public, but then Trump/GOP never took it when their own lives were at risk. Trump/GOP are the real catastrophe that we the public must suffer. Approx quarter million dead with untold millions of people permanently disabled. Trump/GOP have massive blood on their hands!"
2020-10-20 06:37:30,"Fauci is an honorable, admirable, trusted man of consequence and accomplishment.
trump...couldn't come close to imagining possessing any of those attributes."
2020-10-20 10:18:57,"Dr. Fauci, a public servant for decades, is proof that anything Trump touches, dies. Fauci has two options, lie and not be vilified by Trump or tell the truth and receive death threats from Trump supporters. Our country owe's Dr. Fauci a debt of gratitude we will never be able to repay."
2020-10-20 03:18:36,"Mr. Trump is wrong, panicked and dangerous.  The only thing that I find scarier is his base, and the widespread blind ignorance out there.  I'm embarrassed for us as a country, a society and a culture."
2020-10-20 04:33:50,"In my mind, Trump as a president is a threat to  democracy, to public health, to law & order and to the world stability. 

Surprisingly, millions of Americans and the whole Republican party keep his back, which splits society and destroyes trust in the government. 

Frightening and disappointing!"
2020-10-20 08:43:37,40 percent trusting Trump is still too much! How can anyone trust his views on this virus is beyond me.
2020-10-20 02:20:55,"I am continually astonished at Republican idiocy.  The herd immunity is immunity to the truth and science.  The herd immunity will kill 2 million Americans at a minimum.

One has to ask why does Trump want to kill his base?  Or is that Putin’s plan that he lets the spreader-in-chief and GOP implement?

Is anyone confirming the integrity of our voting system and the polls?  The fact that Trump insists on this method only makes me very suspicious he’s aware of Russian, Chinese, North Korean and Iranian hacking to his advantage.

Be very scared, America.  Be very scared."
2020-10-20 08:16:06,"As a non-American I've tried to keep my comments about the US president polite but cannot do it any more. Trump is the most unfit, selfish, ignorant, divisive and utterly disgusting individual the country could have chosen as its leader. The pandemic is resurging, and he decides to attack a highly respected eminent epidemiologist who has served five other presidents of both parties, instead of doing his job to lead the American people in containing the virus? He's throwing in the towel and saying the country is tired of the virus, and that's all he's got?

Dr Fauci has done and continues to do so much to help protect the American people where its president has failed in his constitutional duty to do so, in the face of continued attacks and threats from the president and his supporters. History will be on Dr Fauci's side but who knows how many will sadly die in the meantime. 

I hope that for the sake of the people of the US and the world that Joe Biden wins in a landslide on 3 November. Trump's toxicity has spread far beyond the US borders and we need a strong and respected leader to help restore the world order. Stay safe everyone, wherever you are."
2020-10-20 03:41:33,"The only ""disaster"" in this nightmare is Mr. Trump. Like the irony of him calling for his opponents to be ""locked up"" - given he may well be incarcerated in relatively short-order resulting from his being a possible subject in an ongoing criminal investigation by New York County District Attorney,  Cy Vance - Mr. Trump projects on others his own catastrophic fate and gross deficiencies.The contrast between Doctor Fauci's calm, experienced, expert, reasoned demeanor and that of Mr. Trump's immature, ignorant, bombastic  - well, the list goes on and on - tantrums, are stark to say the very least. My only hope is Doctor Fauci doesn't relinquish his Civil Service protection and resign from his esteemed position - but hey, who could blame him if he did? He is a true ""American"" hero. Mr. Trump in contrast, has tragically proven to be it's nemesis."
2020-10-20 07:02:32,"Trump is using one of his old tactics against Dr. Fauci, which Trump often uses when he wants to create an excuse for getting rid of someone, or to reduce the effectiveness of someone's criticism of him when that person is someone he's not in a position to dismiss (note also the similarity to WWE ""wrestling"" trash-talk tactics): escalating the war of words by issuing personal attacks in an attempt to get the subject of his ire to respond emotionally. Trump will then say he's justified in ""fighting back"" against someone who shows some fight against him. He's also trying to get the person to devolve into the failed approach that Marco Rubio used during the 2016 campaign, of using Trump's own verbal tactics against him, which doesn't work since Trump is ""better"" at it, and because it makes the subject of his ire look foolish."
2020-10-20 08:15:50,It seems that whoever has anything to do with this President  however good and talented will end up becoming tainted and discredited by him. The best thing would be to stay away from this dysfunctional administration if you want to keep your reputation intact. It is appalling that this ignorant figure of fun we call the President has managed to impugn so many brilliant and decent people to try to make himself look good. I would say to those wonderful scientists no matter how good your intentions just steer clear.
2020-10-20 04:24:11,"2021 while trump’s pounding rocks, decent Doctor Fauci, Science respecting Biden Administration coordinating effectively, bringing pandemic under control, ending current dystopian nightmare."
2020-10-20 02:56:18,"Trump never says anything about a national problem that a leader would say.  He never talks about anything plausible that is going to happen in his second term. On the biggest issues of 2020 - right wing terrorism, Covid, the economy, and BLM - he is silent.  No leadership.  No direction.  Just petulant spitballs like Hannity or Carlson or Limbaugh would eject.  That's really his calling - talk show host.  No responsibility, no facts to get in the way.  Why does he even want to be president anymore?  He's clearly not interested in issues facing the country.  He clearly doesn't care about Americans.  He clearly doesn't care about the planet.  

Resign already."
2020-10-20 05:59:25,"The question has been answered: indeed, Trump has no shame. No wisdom either,  nor do any of his supporters. They do, however,  have a tight grasp on delusion, denial and indifference to any other Americans who don't glug down their koolaid. I hope and pray that enough of us will use our wisdom to decisively vote this poseur and his cabal out in two weeks, and rescue our nation from this charlatan."
2020-10-20 07:16:12,"I think it's time for Fauci to resign, then he can attack Trump on an ""equal"" footing.
My respects to Dr Fauci"
2020-10-20 10:55:53,"Trump turned over a large rock. It’s amazing how many have crawled out from under.

They were always there. Trump gave them light and a voice. 

These Urchins no longer slither away, rather they have been legitimized and given a platform and voice."
2020-10-20 03:07:44,"Brilliant move, that. The most mendacious, and justifiably the least trusted public figure in the country — alas, our current “President” — goes after one of the most honest, experienced, competent, trusted public health figures in the United States.  That should ramp up his poll numbers. Not.

It makes one wonder whether The Tangerine Toddler isn’t just making small talk and fishing for laughs when he tells the faithful gathered at his ‘rallies,’ to take in his goofy improv comedy act, that he may leave the country after the election. 

Like someplace without an extradition treaty with the U.S., perhaps?"
2020-10-20 07:44:48,"I keep saying this, usually to myself: the failing Florida president does not want 4 more years. Just like other kindergarteners, he is bored and wants to move on to the next shiny thing. Hence, the self sabotage."
2020-10-20 09:50:06,"Arrogance and ignorance have always been with us, but never have these qualities been so applauded and embraced by a US president. It's sad, appalling, and frightening to see this country being destroyed from within."
2020-10-20 03:50:45,"I hope Dr. Fauci knows that people all over the country are looking right past Trump to him for leadership on this and feel his pain for putting up with the orange combover.  

Keep up the good fight Dr. Fauci!"
2020-10-20 08:21:58,It is impossible for anyone who has had serious contact with this president to come away from the experience whole.
2020-10-20 11:09:09,"If I had not already decided to vote for Joe Biden, this childish and inexcusable attack on Dr Fauci would have been the final straw.   Trump has deteriorated into a very sick individual and must be removed from office by the voters."
2020-10-20 03:11:31,"America, keep holding on for your darkest hour ( the past four years) is almost over.
By now enough Americans have hopefully realized that enough is enough. 
Sure you can fool some of the people all of the time, and many people much of the time, but you cannot fool enough of the people for a long enough time.
The character assassination of Dr Fauci is disgraceful. It may play to the dedicated Trump base, but not to the greater population. 
Trust Dr Fauci- he is a doctor. President Trump- he needs a doctor."
2020-10-20 10:21:07,"“Dr.Tony Fauci says we don’t allow him to do television, and yet I saw him last night on @60Minutes, and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope,” the president said on Twitter.

Bob Hope? Can we just imagine what Bob Hope would have said to trump's (bare) face?

With all his sly, ironic wit, Mr. Hope, a comedian, would have with one zinger after another, unmasked this evil joker ."
2020-10-20 03:49:58,Someone should tell Trump that he doesn’t get paid for making DNC commercials.
2020-10-20 04:52:47,"From TNYT March 31 2020:    
A study, released on March 17 by the epidemic modeling group at Imperial College London and written by 30 scientists on its coronavirus response team, predicted that if the United States had done nothing to prevent the spread of the virus, 2.2 million people could have died. If, however, the government tried to isolate people suspected of having the virus and people they were in contact with, the number of deaths could be cut in half, the researchers said. 
Well, looks like the 'do nothing' number was about right."
2020-10-20 08:12:35,"You bet we’re tired of COVID.  And if Donald Trump had led this country instead of calling COVID a hoax perhaps we would not have 220,000 people dead, millions more infected, out of work, losing their businesses, unable to feed their kids, schools closed.  
Perhaps people who have been alone in nursing homes could have their loved ones visit, healthcare workers could be safe, neighbors could speak to each other without a mask.  

But what does Donald Trump do?  Blames Dr. Fauci.  Fauci has been the only one Americans could believe!  The only credible source of information! 

People use Trump.  They want to be maskless, they want to be free, they want COVID gone.  Trump tells them not to be afraid, what they love to hear.  But lo and behold, just as they do that, allow themselves to believe Trump, they or someone they know tests positive and guess what?  They come to terms - Donald Trump lied.  Again.  And Dr. Fauci has told the truth.  Again."
2020-10-20 03:01:09,"Think that Trump and his family faked having The Virus. It's amazing how all three of them, Trump, Melania and Barron came out of it so quickly and fully intact. I know a few people who contracted the virus and none of them came out of it is such great shape and so quickly."
2020-10-20 04:56:29,"I don't disagree with Trump, I am tired of Covid but my weariness will only be prolonged by the fact that Trump, Pence, the GOP continue to lack a plan, disregard science, and scientific experts.  Unfortunately, science doesn't really care what Trump and the GOP thinks: and the 210,000 deaths we've experienced prove that.

What I am most tired of is the GOP for enabling this idiocy to continue not only unabated, but even allowing it to amplify.  So, as a remedy, two of my grown kids and I filled out our mail in ballots today.  Anywhere there was a republican running, we chose someone else.  Anyone else.  I'd even take the chair that Clint Eastwood was talking to at the RNC convention in 2012.  How nostalgic that all seems."
2020-10-20 03:53:22,Why is this not dereliction of duty?
2020-10-20 06:15:41,"What is so concerting to me now is the loss of so many well educated, knowledgeable men and women who worked in government positions who in these past years have either retired early, got fired or went to work in the private sector because of Trump. Those who knew what they were doing and served our country well. Through threats, and antagonism good people are no longer advising ,researching, forming bonds with other countries. Dr. Fauci,and his family do not deserve the horrific treatment from a bunch of know nothings bent on defaming him. He has done more in his lifetime than the whole pathetic Republican Party including their lying, non medical, under educated gang leader. He deserves no other title, not now, not ever!"
2020-10-20 07:08:11,"Trump has never met an expert in any field that he has been able to work with.  He is too insecure and too ignorant to be able to understand the advice they give him. He feels like a loser if he has to talk to someone who knows a lot more than he does.

This is true for casino managemnent, economics, international relations, military activities, health insurance, and the pandemic, and everything else.

Imagine being so fragile you can never admit there is anything you need to learn..."
2020-10-20 03:56:21,"Careful what you wish for! The old adage “sometimes you don’t know what you have until it’s gone”, certainly holds true here. As President Trump continues to play the blame game, losing Dr. Fauci would be catastrophic. Talk about 2 people being polar opposites. Keep up the good fight, Dr. Fauci. You certainly are my hero and I’m sure many many many others feel the same way. God help us all."
2020-10-20 07:28:49,"Really if this man loses, he should not be allowed to walk happily into the sunset. He has committed countless crimes for which he must pay. Justice must be blind or else no one will respect it. Prosecute Trump to the fullest. Show him the same degree of mercy that he showed the American people during his tenure."
2020-10-20 09:47:13,"Trump only attacks people when he knows he's wrong and his attacks are unwarranted.  Dr. Fauci, thankfully, doesn't appear to pay attention to Trump's tirades and tantrums.
    
Dr. Fauci isn't just our country's leading expert on contagious diseases and pandemics, and a main bulwark against the rampant disinformation spewed out by the Trump administration, it appears that he's also Trump's pediatrician.  And Trump certainly needs one."
2020-10-20 03:40:18,"The president is very immature, angry and impulsive. He needs a prolonged time out. It might be a good idea to give him easy but rewarding crafts projects so he can build a sense of self-esteem while focusing his conscious thoughts outside of himself. Smartphone time should be strictly limited."
2020-10-20 09:50:21,"Look, nobody is forcing you to wear a mask.  So don't.  It doesn't protect you anyway.  All it does is reduce the chance of you infecting someone else.  So why should you care?  If you've got it why not improve your ability to share it with others by not wearing a mask.  Sweet.  The rest of us are envious of your freedom, bold individualism. and scientific wherewithal.  

If ever there was an issue in the last 20 years to unite all Americans in a common cause it sould be fighting Covid.   So much for that."
2020-10-20 05:57:53,Can you imagine Eisenhower hacking into Jonas Salk for discovering the anti-Polio vaccine or Nixon condemning Armstrong and Aldrin for walking on the Moon? Exactly. This nonsense is on that scale.
2020-10-20 05:11:26,"The only disaster I see is the U.S. response to a once-in-a-century pandemic that, we know from recorded audio, Trump understood full well and simply decided not to address.

We're not rounding the bend, the virus isn't magically disappearing, and cases aren't declining.  Most states are increasing in case numbers, hospitalizations, and soon, deaths.

The President isn't working to get monetary relief to ordinary citizens, because he only cares about the markets and the wealthy who are most personally affected by those markets.

Trump and those who work for him are corrupt and the only quality matching their ignorance is their arrogance.  The idea of another four years under this malevolent, lying president is unthinkable.  If he's re-elected, we really will see what a disaster looks like."
2020-10-20 03:11:54,He’s all about projections.  The negative things he says about others are about himself.  To see his comments as anything else would be foolish.
2020-10-20 04:15:48,"It occurred to me that Trump's latest outrageous statements on masks and degrading of agency scientists could be designed to stage conditions to sabotage future containment of Covid by the (likely) new administration.  It would be his ultimate revenge.  He is vengeful, has no scruples and is incapable of empathy.  We know from our scientists the more out of control the virus spreads the longer it will take to bring it under control.  We also know that increases in death rates trail weeks after infection rate spikes.  If infection rates grow dramatically by the beginning of January, we can expect a huge wave of deaths in the following weeks - after inauguration.  This could give Trump's failed Covid response cover and reasons to blame Democrats."
2020-10-20 04:20:11,"Dr Fauci is the consummate professional, unlike those he is advising in the US government."
2020-10-20 11:50:29,"There are so many books to be written after this administration goes. What stories thinking and professional adults will have to tell.  So many people are just holding on for dear life until the election is over - the constant stress of the election, the pandemic, and the uncertain (or downright bad) economic situation is not good for people."
2020-10-20 09:03:28,"The world has known from long before he was elected by a minority of the voters that Trump cares only for himself.  Since mask-wearing is primarily, if not solely, for the benefit of the others around you, it is absolutely consistent with his narcisstic personality that he chooses not to wear one.  If Fauci were as depraved as Trump, he would lie to convince Trump that wearing a mask will 100%, guaranteed, take it to the bank, help Trump regardless of the others. Trump would have one on in a heart-beat."
2020-10-20 10:16:09,"Trump is just sour because Dr. Fauci inspires more trust in the American people than he does. And, because he does not loke the polls. I hope the Biden campaign uses Trump's recording calling Dr. Fauci a disaster for TV commercials. 

Dr. Fauci can be to Trump what James Comey was to Clinton. So much more devastating because of Fauci's popularity."
2020-10-20 06:51:41,"A mortality rate for those under 70 of .5 percent. That means that 1 out of every 200 of you kids is going to die.

And thank you, Dr. Fauci. In this era of no class whatsoever in Washington, you are a shining exception."
2020-10-20 09:35:40,Covid is giving Trump a run for his money. I am tired of both. I am patient and prudent enough with protocols to know how to manage each as best I can. I wear a mask most often and I VOTED early for Biden in Texas. Were I to die of Covid before Nov 3 it might not be in vain.
2020-10-20 11:26:01,"This is the nation that the US has become, one where a scientist is harassed and threatened for trying to tell people the truth and helping to save their lives. Trump has taken us from a position of world leadership to being a sad joke on the international stage, where people openly laugh when the US is mentioned."
2020-10-20 04:32:15,"Eager for the day Fauci is put in charge of battling Covid 19 without interference from politicians. Put a scientist and man of character in v charge. Likely why Trump dislikes him: he's a popular full of credibility. 

First Biden must be president, of course."
2020-10-20 08:44:29,"I'm not a Trump supporter, but, WHY are so many people -- average citizens and in the media -- giving Dr. Fauci a pass for HIS failures? He failed to clearly and immediately speak out against Trump, every time Trump told a lie or say something dumb during a press conference (it was always done with a lot of hemming and hawing). He failed to alert the country -- about what was known, ahead of time -- the same way Trump did.  And, now, he is saying, publicly, that things will have to ""really bad"" before a countrywide lockdown took place again.  Things ARE really bad, already, in the USA!! It is the example everyone else uses when looking to a country that is NOT doing what needs to be done!!"
2020-10-20 05:22:32,Fauci violated White House policy by becoming more popular than the Orange One. Fauci had higher approval ratings than then the Feckless Wonder Boy - a no no in an era where thousands have died and millions are barely hanging on.  What counts is whether or not Trump is popular.
2020-10-20 06:00:32,"I am waiting for when they stop giving Trump remdesivir and antibodies.  We will see if he, himself, has enough immunity to withstand the virus.  It should not take long to find out, a week or two should cause symptoms again.  Easy for him to 'shrug off' virus when fully medicated."
2020-10-20 04:05:10,"Scotty, beam me up!
Surreal and flat out weird to the point of terrifying.
The lame duck interregnum hovers laden with authoritarian theft and defilement within every agency. We the People gave him all these powers with no restraints or overrides in use to stop the carnage. January 20, 2021 @12 Noon the sorting of the institutional rubble may begin. 
The coming 8 weeks could be treacherous for our individual health and collective cohesion. Eyes on the goal with humility always and respect as appropriate.
Thank you, Dr Fauci, for your incredible stoicism and perseverance throughout this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Please accept my heartfelt apology for the multiple abuses of your scientific expertise, position, and decades of service you’ve given the American public with no regard or distinction for anything other than medical fact, protocol, disease management, and all topics clearly within your authority. Our President has no honor nor the ability to identify it in others. You, Dr., live with honor tested and proven strong. My gratitude, Sir, to you, each and all of your family for the gift of your devotion to us."
2020-10-20 07:24:53,"To witness the news on Trump is like reading a report about a psychiatric patient totally detached from reality. The president of the USA exists in his hostile, paranoid, fantasy world. 

And his being able to go out campaigning after a bout with the Covid virus that has killed over 200,000 people has just increased his arrogance. 

Interviews with his voters show astounding denial and rationalizations. Trump voters refuse to wear a mask against Covid, but they wear a blindfold against reality. 

They're blinded by  'hero' worship' of an authoritarian leader, so that they're willing to risk their health for him. For them, he'll never go too far.

It's a dismaying demonstration that a percentage of Americans in a modern democracy are as susceptible to manipulation by a dictator as any people in any country has ever been."
2020-10-20 09:57:15,"I sense that there are so many who don’t care scientific advises. They tend to enjoy what Trump and Republicans offer: farces, lies and Reality Shows."

2020-10-20 09:08:57,"For Trump to attack Dr. Fauci shows nothing more than Trump’s complete ignorance of science coupled with a determination not to be educated by scientific  inquiries and testing. Trump exhibits Cromagnon   behavior though that  group of early humans probably had more intelligence than Trump.  Trump even exhibits ape like facial expressions which have been more pronounced since he contemplates a major election loss.  Trump doesn’t read books, eschews education and never wants to admit there are many things he does not know or understand.

So he adopts the tactics of his idol, Roy Cohn, in attacking anyone he knows is smarter and more educated than him.  But Trump forgets that Cohn died having been disbarred, ridiculed and abandoned by his friends, including Donald Trump."
2020-10-20 06:45:50,"My God! Even as the virus is digging in, spiraling up with an unholy vengeance - he still does this!

2020-10-20 09:52:17,"Fauci has been wrong SO many times I’ve lost count.

2020-10-20 12:08:27,"A simple question for Dr.Atlas: If indeed masks serve no purpose in reducing chances of viral or any other infection,  would he be ready to go in for major surgery in an Operation Theatre where none of the staff wear surgical masks? If masks in the OT serve to reduce chances of infection for the patient, why would they not serve the same purpose outdoors too? To a lay person it makes sense that they would."
2020-10-20 12:19:11,"Fauci and Birx may be smart doctors, but they have caved to Dear Leader far too long and it has cost many lives and a trashed economy.

The idea of mass rallies is in part to cheer Trump up and in part to project that we have turned the corner on the virus, but the virus takes about a week to manifest in the infected, so over the last two weeks of the campaign, many of Trump's biggest fans will come down with the virus thanks to him.  It's not as if the news media won't notice: how can this possibly help him, or does no one on his campaign think a week ahead?

Fauci’s claim to fame is the war on AIDS yet the actual history shows his abject failures in that realm. As recently as 2018 Larry Kramer said of Fauci, he talks out of both sides of his mouth, he lacks creativity, he is no friend to gay people and many of my friends are dead because of Fauci. 
Imagine if we had a brilliant, energetic truthful NIH leader who from day 1 made the correct calls, spoke truth to power against Trump and protected the American people. We didn’t.

While it's important to stay safe, and keep the vulnerable safe, it's also important to slowly open schools and businesses, with reduced numbers of people.  Europe is doing this and finding that their numbers are increasing as well.  But, the numbers will increase once things open up; even with restrictions.  The virus isn't going anywhere.  If we all locked down for a month or more, it would still be there when we opened up.  We've seen this across the globe.

On average, another American dies of COVID-19 approximately every 2 minutes. The case count, hospitalization count, and death toll continue to rise. Colder weather will only further exacerbate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If our per-capita death rate had been the same as Germany’s, we would have 150,000  fewer American COVID-19 deaths. If our per-capita death rate had been the same as Taiwan, South Korea, or even Finland or Norway, even more American lives would have been saved.
The combination of Trump’s actions and inaction have severely undermined America’s collective resolve to respond appropriately to this global pandemic. He has relentlessly urged his supporters to ignore common-sense public health initiatives. Trump has made false claims regarding the adequacy of testing, the impending disappearance of the virus, and the danger of infection even for the young and healthy. He has repeatedly hyped ineffective treatments as miracle cures (hydroxychloroquine), falsely claimed that there is a cure (there is no cure for COVID-19), seriously suggested that CDC look into administering disinfectants systemically or via the lungs. Trump has sidelined experts like Fauci in favor of quacks like Atlas. Trump has even managed to instill fear in Americans regarding the safety of a vaccine. 
In short, a PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER of unprecedented magnitude."

Thank you for representing science and good judgement under a thankless government.

What have we done right? In one word: masks. Every winter for decades, we've seen many of our east-asian people mask up for flu season, so it doesn't seem quite as weird as it does to the rest of the US. Less like an outside intervention, more like ""maybe these guys had the right idea"".
I'm only guessing--I could be totally wrong. Maybe the distancing is a bigger factor (though you wouldn't know it from the crowds in the supermarkets). Maybe we're just lucky: good and bad luck have been prominent in our history. But it's hard to look at our reality and then argue against masking. Maybe if the USPS had been allowed to mail hundreds of millions of masks to every address in April, like they planned to, our American 2020 would have been very different."

2. Trump has committed treason by divulging to our adversaries the presence of a new secret weapon that we have in our arsenal

CDC reports 300,000 more deaths than expected this year, likely due to COVID-19 [NYTimes]

Nearly 300,000 more people have died so far this year than would be expected in a normal year, likely due to COVID-19 or the pandemic's indirect impacts, according to the CDC.

Deaths of people in the 25-44 age group was 25.6 percent higher than expected when compared to similar time periods in previous years, the highest increase for any age group, according to a report published Tuesday. Along racial and ethnic lines, Hispanic or Latino people saw the highest percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years at 54 percent...

Only two-thirds of these deaths were directly attributed to COVID-19, potentially because people who died were not tested, or death information was incomplete or inaccurate on death certificates, the report states. Other people might have died because they avoided seeking care for other illnesses during the pandemic.  

For example, deaths from Alzheimers, dementia and respiratory diseases have increased in 2020 compared to past years, but it's not yet clear where these are misclassified COVID-19 deaths or deaths indirectly related to the pandemic from disruptions in health care access, the report states.  

The analysis found that excess deaths among the 75-84 age group was 95,000 more when compared to similar time periods in previous years."

The idea that masks impinge on freedom is bizarre. As is the idea that it is everyman for himself and that an organized cohesive respectful and cooperative society is no longer viable.  No amount of trillions of government borrowing can long put off the inevitable decline in prosperity from an everyman for himself country."
2020-10-19 16:06:09,The entire point of having a state government is to protect the population from local governments making bad decisions. There is no “personal right to choose” when it comes to public health. How many analogies do these people have to hear before it sinks in?
2020-10-19 16:07:41,"I live in an area where almost everyone wears a mask, even outdoors (when on a busy sidewalk). At first those who did not wear masks really upset me. Now I let it pass, realizing that the majority of our community is on board with the program and infection rates are low. We need to be a little more open to those on the other side of the mask issue. I personally hate to wear a mask, so I have empathy for those who do not wear them.

I am not writing this sarcastically, but restaurants in areas of the country where the wearing of masks is contentious should, if they have the space, create an area for those who choose to wear masks, and a second space for those who do not wish to wear them. Preferably, the two spaces should be sealed from each other in terms of air exchange."
2020-10-19 16:08:16,"Reading this article just makes me feel incredibly sad.  Whether people are willing to admit it or not, Trump is the one who chose to turn masks into a political/personal freedom issue.  Other countries just wear them when required and understand that they do this to prevent the spread of disease.  Instead we have a president that does not want Covid to exist so decided to make wearing a mask a declaration that it IS a real thing that can kill you. If you aren't wearing the mask then you are saying that you don't believe in the science that a whole world's worth of scientists have explained that this virus WILL kill people, can permanently disable people of any age and is not going away.  So if you refuse to wear one it's not real and your right not to be inconvenienced is higher than other people's health or lives. 
Don't get me wrong; do I enjoy the mask?  Not at all.  I think my skin is breaking out, sometimes I feel like I can't breathe well.  However it beats getting Covid which is unpredictable.  No vaccine will save us.  Just like the flu we will still have to be doing other preventive measures.  Testing should be a cornerstone.  I think it is so sad that many people seem to think that preventing as many people from dying as possible is a BAD THING.  (Or is just too much work)."

I looked on the NYT map and data base regarding COVID-19 cases and information and not a single COVID case has been reported in Hamilton, Montana (thank goodness).

While I am a solid and huge believer in the wearing of face masks, I think Nicki Ransier found a middle ground in which her employees are to wear them but it's up to the customer in their decision.

Someone this notion of ""bending the knee to tyranny"" doesn't play out for me.  I would think, hope, assume that a public health crisis would trump individual's rights.

I keep thinking about what Ms. Ransier stated, ‘What if I were to get Bob — the man who sits out front every day — or someone sick?’ I would just feel horrible.""  How can anyone NOT think or feel terrible as well?

I think that slogan that we are all in this together is not necessarily the case when people tend to think of themselves first rather than the overall health of fellow citizens, friends and co-workers.  I would have hoped that even a small town like Hamilton would think what's best for the overall good of the town rather than being selfish."

The quote from Mr. Nelson at the end says a lot: “At one level, I feel like I should push more for masks... But on the other side, I feel like, at what cost?

2020-10-19 16:56:43,"Freedom has many aspects. What struck me when reading this article is that the small business’s best chance of survival is to have and enforce a mask policy for both employees and customers. If not wearing masks as a customer forces your neighbor to have to quarantine their business for two weeks every time there is a case are you not endangering their ability/freedom to hold onto their business?  Freedom to do business, stay in business, stay solvent requires mask wearing. It is respectful of other people’s freedom to earn a livelihood to JUST WEAR A MASK as a customer. As we can see in East Asia - the mask wearing actually enables opening up of the economy.  Mask wearing supports people’s ability to work. No freedom is absolute.  My right to run my business or to work needs to be balanced against your rights as a customer. Those who support the economy and small business should actually support mask wearing."
2020-10-19 16:01:40,"Hong Kong, which has many travelers from China, immediately went into the Asian mode of wearing masks when news of the pandemic arrived.  Consequently, it has had a limited number of Covid-19 infections.

2020-10-19 16:08:58,"The messaging from the federal government and the White House should be this:

The mask is NOT to protect you, it is to protect others FROM you.  If you happen to be sick and contagious and not be aware that you are (and this apparently happens often), if you don’t wear a mask you could be responsible for infecting and killing others.  

Those who think the decision to wear a mask is about personal freedom misunderstand this point.

And when you open your mouth to order that coffee, viruses will travel.  How far will they go?  Who will they encounter?  That all depends on you, and the people around you.   When you sit down to sip that coffee, what else will go in your mouth and nose?  That all depends on you, and the people around you too.  

Do you like to gamble?  Do you breathe in and calculate the likelihood of deadly viruses being the in air based on the most recent percent positive test rate in your county? Can you even find that information?  

What about the tourist from who-knows-where who is on line for coffee in front of you, or behind you?  Are they from North Dakota or Wisconsin?  Did they have a friend who went to the Sturgis motorcycle rally?  Or the Rose Garden super-spreader event?  Can you even find out that information? 

I don't like to gamble.  The first positive case in my city was an Uber driver.  The second person to die in my city was also an Uber driver (different person).  The virus moves with people, and the air they exhale.  It's simple!  Let's not complicate it.  Wear a mask if you're indoors and not at home.  Every time you're indoors and not at home!"

I took shelter in a country where bus drivers were told that if a passenger refuses to wear a mask the bus driver should pull over.  Turn the ignition off.  Remove the key.  Exit the bus and call in a report to the terminal.  End of subject.  Protecting workers has the side effect of protecting all.  Funny that.

But, so far a quick ""your mask needs to come up"" or "" sorry, but that child needs to wear a mask or wait outside"" usually works.  It helps that we are in a more Democratic leaning part of town.  But when people refuse it can get nasty.   But requiring mask has kept us and our customers covid free, from at least coming here anyway, which has allowed us to stay open."

If I shut down due to Covid infection, up to 30 families could be out of work....I cannot allow that to happen.  And I keep that thought front and center when I have to chastise a customer.  

I really empathize with the merchant in this article who explains how they stay politically neutral, because it never helps my businesses to express my beliefs.  I would love to speak up, but it won’t help me gain customers.  Staying afloat, and helping my employees stay solvent is not political.

At best, those with face coverings may be exposed to small amounts of virus, diminishing the chance of severe illness should they come into contact with a contagious person... but this risk analysis belies the absurdity of this antipathy towards wearing masks.

I turned and left and I haven't been back since. My brother had the virus, my cousin had it twice, her son had it, my next-door neighbor had it bad, and two people I know have died, one only 40 years old.

No maskie, no customer, it's pretty simple."
2020-10-19 17:50:50,"As a devout Christian, nothing causes me more distress than so many self-proclaimed Evangelicals refusing to practice social distancing and to wear masks when in public. Jesus could not be clearer when He listed as the second greatest commandment to live our neighbors as ourselves. Wearing a mask likely protects the wearer, but the evidence is overwhelming that it protects our neighbors.

But then, many of these Evangelicals insist on interpreting Scripture in such a manner that they reject solid science on such issues as the age of the universe, the age of the earth, the evolution of life, and now climate change. So I guess it should be no surprise that they reject the science on social distancing and mask wearing to control the spread of the coronavirus. No one is doing more harm to our country and our planet than those who refuse to accept reality."

Unfortunately many of these businesses won’t survive the until the pandemic results. If we had a national policy of mask wearing I think the pandemic would have lower morbidity, lower mortality and shorter duration.￼￼￼"

noun, plural tyr·an·nies.

a state ruled by a tyrant or absolute ruler. oppressive or unjustly severe government on the part of any ruler. undue severity or harshness. a cruel or harsh act or proceeding; an arbitrary, oppressive, or tyrannical action.

I don't know how or why this got idea got started, but it's patently false. Masks protect everyone. I worked for years with infectious patients in hospitals. For patients requiring droplet precautions, i.e. COVID-19, caregivers wear masks, along with other PPE, to keep from getting sick themselves; the patient is already sick and contagious. Granted, COVID-19 falls somewhere between droplet and respiratory precautions (measles, TB etc, requiring an N95 mask), but universal mask wearing is shown to definitely help in getting COVID-19 under control. Just look at where NYC was last spring and where it is now."

But it has broken my heart that people are fleeing here from high density populated areas and not quarantining when they arrive; bringing this ‘thing’ with them, as well as their unwillingness to embrace the very lifestyle we love here.  We’ve become a little Missoula and our infrastructure can’t handle it and there is no easy fix.  We don’t need a Walmart, or a longer airstrip that will, at best, service 50 wealthy jet owners who can’t be bothered to drive an hour from Missoula.  We live here because we want simple.  We want to know our neighbors, be there if they need us. We want to wave at people as we drive down the road.  We love our ranches, especially in the spring, with beautiful little calves sprinkled across the pastures.  We love that we can live in a subdivision and have our horses in our backyard. Hikers, bikers, riders, fishermen, skiers, hunters, boaters....all seasons of people; we all get along...but this influx is changing that much to fast.  And articles that put us in the focus doesn’t help.

He nearly died.  It was the most miserable 10 days of his life, he says, and now is an immediate borne-again convert.

Never, says he, would he wish this on anyone.  He would never want to get it again.  While he only wears the mask when needed, he has one with  him all the time.

Now, weeks later, he still has troubles walking far or up an incline.

This is real.  Why do people have to be so bull headed?  Their tune seems to change quickly once having had it, and by then it is too late, at least for a quarter million US citizens, it is.

Church goers gathered in row seats outside the church for prayer even they were not allowed to gather, they all wore masks.  At that time, they must knew public health measures with masks and avoid crowds contained the spread of the contagion. It was not until 1933 for the scientist to uncover the cause of the Pandemic 1918 was a virus. It takes another 72 years in 2005 to sequence the virus to be H1N1.

In the current crisis, the scientist is able to publish the whole viral genome SARS-COV-2 (WHO) in 3 weeks Jan 10 after the mysterious fatal illness surfaced in Wuhan late December 2019.

This article is important because it is composed largely of people's stories, not (usually abstract) statistics. One of the Republicans' strengths and the Democrats' weaknesses is that the former is much better at weaving a narrative. Perhaps had the Dems hired Aaron Sorkin a year ago, they would be in a much stronger position. That's not because of his politics but because of his outstanding ability to create a narrative that works in the age of ""reality"" from screens.

Tip O'Neill (most notably), one of the more effective Democratic Speakers of the House, famously said, ""All politics is local."" The Democrats still do not understand that this is the case, especially in flyover America. Yes, some very, very big problems are not local, but the reality is that most folks live day to day. Having the time and energy to read, let alone triage and analyze, fifty-page plans is a luxury many folks simply cannot afford.

Also, people have different values, and if you want them to change their minds about a policy rather than you simply feeling superior and self-righteous, you need to acknowledge that. In politics as in all life you play the hand you're dealt. Confusing what you wish were the case with what is the case is self-defeating, especially when dealing with people."

No different about masks. 

The anti-maksers have some other problem. Not my job to figure it out. But I have friends and family I don't want to infect and I don't want to get sick myself. So when I'm in a store or public place and someone is there or comes in without a mask: I leave. No purchase and no business.

However, as a recent op-ed in this very newspaper demonstrated, it is much more effective to convince people by example than to shame them, dictate to them, or call them “murderers” if they choose not to mask. In fact, many European and Asian countries don’t have a mask mandate but appeal to people’s instinct for self-preservation, which is a much better strategy. Telling people that wearing a mask is for the sake of others is the worst public-health strategy ever. I would not put on an uncomfortable face cover to protect you, sorry. Your health is your problem. I am doing it to protect myself. Tell people that they need to mask as a sensible precaution to safeguard their own health and they will be on board with it."

2020-10-19 20:11:13,"There are two ways to interrupt contagion. One is physical distancing which means minimizing time in conversation and maximizing distance with others. The second is masking up which is most useful when talking in close proximity with others. The chances of a person more than six feet away who is simply momentarily breathing the same air emitting a virus particle that infects others is low. Likely very low. And that probability drops further with distance. Risk of anything is never zero, nor should that deter anyone. Too much time is spent emphasizing masks in the media and not enough attention is paid to physical distancing as a method for interrupting contagion, probably because you can easily spot someone wearing a mask whereas it's harder to spot someone engaging in physical distancing. All of this resulting in the deification of the mask to the point of hysteria."

They are all stunning and a bit less crowded would have been welcome, though perhaps not to the extent mentioned here. There is an energy involved in sharing art with other patrons.

Of course, as an American, I will have no chance to return until a vaccine is widely available. The insistence of some that we have no responsibility to protect our fellow citizens through distancing and mask wearing has ruined our country's chance to reduce the infection rate to one where testing and contact tracing could work. I am angry, yes, but sadness is starting to take over.

By the way, the absolutely best museum experience I had in Amsterdam was in the University's archeological museum. Two elderly researchers had the doors to their lab wide open and they invited me in as I passed. They were going through the detritus of a wealthy family's kitchen skip. There were identifiable fish bones, egg shells (goose, I was told, not chicken), hazel nut shells and all sorts of other bits and pieces. The gentlemen entertained me for 20 minutes easily. I sent an American family with children up to meet them on the way out. I hope they enjoyed their visit as much as I did."

We were originally optimistic about reopening: no competition from still-shuttered NYC museums, live professional sports, or school activities. Summer vacationers were staying close to home, and we offered a great cultural activity for the Staycation. Yet, audiences seem extremely tentative about coming back inside. Only our outdoor concerts (reported on kindly by the Times) have generated strong interest from the public.

One thing is clear: this irrationally pathological fear of infection and spread by low-risk individuals has real implications for cultural institutions whose employees and treasures rely on visitor traffic and ticket/gift shop sales. Massive museums are laying off 1/3 of their workforce, for a level of public fear which ham-fisted governments perpetuate in order to prop up their failing governance.
You can, in fact, go to a museum with (more than) adequate social distancing and reasonable precautions and not spread the virus. To deny this is simply intellectual sloppiness. You can, in fact, live life in the face of an airborne virus with ~1% global IFR.
