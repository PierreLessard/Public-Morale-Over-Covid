2020-05-21 11:23,Nursing homes operate under a ton of regulations and clearly they aren’t the right ones to protect our most fragile citizens during a pandemic.  It is clear that no one anywhere had a plan nor did they provide any support for these privately run businesses.  I am not sure they even asked for help or that there was a process for them to request help.  We can do so much better.
2020-05-21 10:17,"Sadly most of the homes housing black and or Latinos, depend on Medicaid funding or other low reimbursements. The quality of hires is usually not the pick of the litter, thus the quality of care does suffer. A common average Assisted Living & long term care facility facility here in Florida averages between 4500 to 6 thousand dollars monthly others are up to 10k,out of reach for many of the aforementioned families.The group activities, and meals in groupings  can be viewed as contributors to the crisis..no easy solution for the loved ones, unless you have the funds and even then here in Florida , cost did not guarantee you safety from the virus"
2020-05-21 11:44,"There is a lower death rate among Anglo-saxons in the UK.

Nothing to do with poverty and being unable to call on the Health service. As all people are allowed to access the Health service for free. 

I believe it relates to the immigrants DNA and being away from Europe at the time when Anglo-Saxon ancestors were weird out by the various  plagues which rampaged through Europe."
2020-05-21 11:21,There are hundreds if not thousands of additional deaths that were not calculated correctly. Many who tested negatuve for Corona virus were later to be found to be infected. So their death certificates may coding a heart death actually it was from Corona Nursing homes hire many assistant nurses at minimum wage levels and many have to be constantly watched or they take the lazy way out. By not allowing visitors to these homes many patients died unnecessarily as these nurse assistants skirted their responsibility to the elderly who ended up dying isolated and alone. Look at total deaths over the last five and ten years and then calculate the deaths this year . The mean average and the current death rate will show approximately the real number of deaths associated with Corona .
2020-05-21 11:58,another article I read about the impact of the virus stated that pre-existing conditions such as obesity and diabetes makes recovery more difficult for those infected. Statistics show a higher level of both in African American populations which could also have some impact on nursing home infections and deaths. All of the comments so far bring up excellent points that contribute to this disaster. One can only hope a serious review of nursing home laws and operations is conducted to help mitigate disaster the next time a pandemic arrives.
2020-05-21 12:02,"I don't know about this, from what I can see here it's equal an opportunity nursing home disaster in Texas, rich, poor, race, it doesn't matter. It's not hard to see the problems... underpaid staff that go home and into the community every night, bring back germs into the nursing home, in which some facilities are better than others at infection control. I would have liked to see the nursing home lock downs include locking the workers in with them at triple or quadruple the pay to do so, with strict infection control and weekly inspections. I think when this is all over, the nursing home deaths will be in the history books as a travesty."
2020-05-21 11:02,"One of the things that's hardest to measure but which is undeniably a major factor, is the pre-existing condition of living in a racist society. It has to take an enormous physical and mental toll on one's body, no matter how one has dealt with it. Perhaps it should be added to the list of pre-morbid conditions that make one more susceptible to the virus."
2020-05-21 12:08,"It seems to me that these hot spots happen when people are crammed into close quarters and don't have the ability to protect themselves. Sometimes, it appears that, because these aren't ""regular folks,"" to quote that judge in Wisconsin, there may not be the urgency to address problems. 
The reasons for the statistics that show much higher mortality rates for minorities are probably a perfect storm of workers who are poorly paid, trained and administered, lower socioeconomic levels, and lack of robust regulations. That creates an illusion among some ""folks"" that they and their loved ones aren't at great risk. 
Have we gotten to the point in this country where certain cohorts of people are disposable. It makes me sad and angry t conclude the answer is Yes."
2020-05-21 12:06,"While I am sure the stats are true you have to be careful here.

Using race base stats can be misleading and divisive. 

Poor white and Asian people also have worse medical rates than rich people of any race.

Also our de facto criminal health care system generally helps the rich over the poor. 

Also, nursing homes excluded except for the workers, poorer people of any race generally work more in front line needed jobs contributing to their higher covid 19 rate.

Also, a subject that nobody wants to touch including the NY Times, although the poor have many things going against them not of their choosing they also tend to do the bad things more than rich, ie abuse drugs, smoking, booze etc."
2020-05-21 9:58,"Interesting that the NYT analysis didn't find socioeconomic factors or unequal access to health care as explanations for C-19 racial disparities at nursing homes.

A recent Mt. Sinai analysis on black C-19 mortality rates came to the same conclusion.

""Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. ... Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency.""

Did the authors of the NYT article look into this at all?

2020-05-21 12:10,"I wished this article explained WHY the disparities between Black and Latino vs. White nursing homes was so prevalent. Or was it solely attributable to insufficient protective gear? 

I would hate for this article to reinforce more seeds of racism and discrimination against Black and Latino residents seeking future residency in white facilities.

My Mom (Black) most likely contracted COVID-19 from a Pulmonologist (White) while in the hospital for something unrelated.

During that initial visit, my Mom tested negative and shortly after interacting with the Pulmonologist, (who had just interacted with three COVID-19 patients prior to examining my Mom) was readmitted 10 days later and   for the virus.

Had my Mom been in New York City, where I live, she would have surely died. Thankfully, she was at a facility in Western NY that was exclusively treating COVID patients. 

She was given a prognosis of 48 hours to live but the nurses were all over it; checking her 02 every few minutes and constantly adjusting it when it dipped too low. 

Prayer
Rejecting the Respirator
Palliative Care

played a role in my Mom’s survival.

After she defied the doctors death prognosis, she was transferred to a mostly white, $12,000 a month, 5 star nursing facility.

Atrocious behavior, poor living conditions, limited staffing, practices, slow response times to residents, patients sitting in urine, occurred there too.

Bottom Line: ALL nursing homes should be revamped   randomly inspected!"
2020-05-21 11:49,"In New York we have Cuomo to blame for this, for forcing nursing homes to take sick people who infected residents who were not sick. I guess The Comfort and the Javits Center were getting to full, right Andrew? 

<a href=""https://nypost.com/2020/05/20/gov-cuomo-is-a-hypocrite-on-life-death-and-nursing-homes-devine"" target=""_blank"">https://nypost.com/2020/05/20/gov-cuomo-is-a-hypocrite-on-life-death-and-nursing-homes-devine</a>/"
2020-05-21 11:55,"For that reason  (among many others) Trump's delaying and delaying, and then obstructing and obstructing, gets very close to that line where genocide/ethnic cleansing begins."
2020-05-21 12:13,"The sensational headline which claims that nursing homes with minority populations are twice as likely ""to be hit"" does not square up with the actual text of the article. It is actually a pretty shameless piece of click bait. The relevant text reads:

""More than 60 percent of nursing homes where at least a quarter of the residents are black or Latino have reported at least one coronavirus case, a New York Times analysis shows. That is double the rate of homes where black and Latino people make up less than 5 percent of the population.""

So if a nursing home with 500 residents and a heavy minority population, has 1 case and a nursing home with 500 residents, most of whom are white, has zero cases, based on this article's reasoning, the minority home has been ""hit"" and the predominantly white nursing home hasn't. This is terribly disingenuous."
2020-05-21 12:17,"I would like to see the racial make-up of infections and deaths compared inside each facility.  That way you are comparing people who have been living in the same conditions being carried for in presumably similar ways.  That way you take the quality of care element out of it.  If the infection and death rates are relatively the same in each institution, you have one thing.  If there is STILL a large disparity, you've got a possible couple of other things.

And let me just add, a nursing home of any SES is by nature going to be problematic under pandemic conditions, particularly when stupid mistakes are made in the response in general.  I feel for anyone trying to run a home full of high risk people under these conditions."
2020-05-21 10:21,"My Mom's nursing home is all white, with mixed race nurse aides. They shut down quickly, the day before my birthday in fact.

So far, not a single case. My Mom is sad not to see other people at home except my nurse sister. They do activities, like quiz games, where the residents are in the hall with masks.

She calls me to see what I am cooking, so she can imagine it vicariously, haha."
2020-05-21 12:18,Why all the spooky nighttime photos of dimly-lit nursing homes?
2020-05-21 11:16,"As a research psychologist I am abhor selective bias, choosing and presenting only those data that bolster one’s point of view or conclusions.

For example, without offering critical and in-depth analysis recent NYT articles—and this one—have tried to make it seem as if there is a grand racist conspiracy to expose POC to coronavirus. 

Out of curiosity I looked at various online coronavirus databases and within a few minutes found numerous US counties where minorities have coronavirus cases and death rates LOWER than those for whites. Why haven’t I seen any NYT stories and headlines about that? 

The current article is based on research so flawed that it would never be published in a scholarly journal that requires vetting by academic peers. The sample is very limited, as is sample size, which makes generalizing to a wider population impossible. 

The article says its findings might change as more data become available, a sure sign that the authors know about the article’s  the shaky research foundations. 

Then, of course, the article does not take into account underlying conditions, which for a variety of reasons are found in all poor nursing home patients, not just those of color. 

Based on my own research experience I think that, for the population of all minorities in nursing homes, a thorough and academically sound analysis would show some differences in urban vs suburban vs rural groups, but even more so that poverty level is more of a factor than race. ﻿"
2020-05-21 12:23,"My Dad is 91, and in an Assisted Living home in Arizona. Yes, everyone is pretty much white. No one is his place - staff or residents - have gotten the virus. 

But I don't think it's about color, I think it is about management. His place is run by a large corporation that operates in several states. 

First thing they did? They completely ignored politicians. Early on they simply went into total lock down. No visitors. Period. A piece of me hates it because my Dad is dying (not of the virus, just of old age) and I can't go see him, but I also understand. They have kept the place virus free. 

Any employee that even comes into contact with someone that is infected stays home (with pay) for two weeks. I talk to the people there almost every day. There is this sort of team spirit ... this attitude that says ""we ARE going to keep our people safe - we are not going to let the virus in, even if we have to impose draconian rules"". They have succeeded. 

I don't know about white or black or latino - I do know that keeping people in nursing homes safe is 100% about policies. That's the blunt truth."
2020-05-21 12:10,"The title of the article is misleading. It suggests that there is a racial basis on how the virus attacks the body. This gives fodder to racists who don’t read the article and just think that because they are white, they are superior and protected - on a biological basis. This is false. It would be more clear if the headline indicated that reason behind the way the virus hits communities of color more prominently. And, of course, it is just sad that we still have to comment on race at all. Barely any progress on that front and these headlines don’t help."
2020-05-21 10:09,"This nation’s nursing homes, like many of its schools, churches, businesses and neighborhoods, are largely segregated.....and have been for since 1619 Jamestown Virginia...and even further back to St. Augustine and Fort Caroline Florida in 1565 in Spain-controlled Florida.

Whites to the front of the bus; non-whites to the back of the bus.

American Socioeconomics 101 for over 400 years.

The same old shameful, inhumane American history that never ever ends."
2020-05-21 12:34,"While we've been trained to attack any one putting forward a  possible conspiracy  ""tin foil hat"" ""conspiracy theorists"" ""nut jobs"" just because they point out that facts that appear as possibly conspiratorial;  it incumbent on those who possess both morality and ethics and maintain a facility of critical thinking to point things out.

Recently the CDC Data found African Americans, who comprise approximately 13% of the  U.S. Population were accounting for 33% of COVID-19 hospitalizations.   

Additionally,  a scientific report was recently released and referenced on May 5th in the Verge indicating that ""Half of all COVID-19 cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths due to the disease in the US occurred in counties that are disproportionately black.

On the other hand some of the richest families on Earth are making record profits and the companies they're associated with like Amazon, Walmart, Microsoft and Target have seen massive earnings growth while millions of Mom and Pop businesses are nearing bankruptcy or having to close down and the backbone of the American economy and rural America is being destroyed and people seeking independence may end up working at Walmart or Amazon.  When I was a boy there was no Walmart or Amazon and every small town had thriving independent businesses and news papers and radio stations. 

Now a handful of families controls the vast majority of commerce.  Anti-trust?  Facts point to a long range plan to reverse democracy and freedom.  Never."
2020-05-21 12:36,"So called racial differences are mainly due to economic factors.

Meanwhile by far the greatest disparity has to do with much higher rates among men versus women.

While focusing on racial differences may get more attention, it is not what is actually determining most of the difference.  

Men are dying at a rate between 50% and 100% higher than women depending on the country and locality.  They are getting tested much less.  While genetic factors are important the death of men could be reduced by some attention to lowering their risk.  

Poor people are getting sick more often and with worse outcomes"
2020-05-21 12:26,"People and governments need to enlighten themselves of a simple evolutionary tool humans have had for millenia.  Vitamin D.  Do a little Googling yourself and you will come around.  Why do you think people in Northern latitudes (NY) and people of color are the most affected?  Vitamin D deficiency.  D is an immunomodulator.  It lessens the damage from upper respiratory infections by increasing ACE2 receptors which lessens damage to lungs.  Why do you think the cold and flu season is in Winter?  Come on, I know big Pharma won't make $$, which is why this is kept from us. Enlighten yourselves and get some D."
2020-05-21 12:44,"Seriously there is nothing  '...Striking...' about black and brown suffering in America.

Since before the birth of the American nation until today in contrast with and comparison to white European American Judeo Christian men, women and children every phase of civil secular life has been separate and unequal for black African and brown Indigenous men, women and children from birth to death.

What would be striking is if something negative about living meaningful lives in America fell more heavily on black lives mattering than white lives"
2020-05-21 12:50,It shouldn’t be surprising that minority populations in nursing homes are dying at a higher rate since that is also true in the general population. No doubt the employees and visitors to the nursing homes are largely minorities as well and therefore more likely to have the virus and spread it inside the home. The minority nursing home death rate is a reflection of the poor heath care generally available to minorities that has been magnified in this crisis.
2020-05-21 12:48,"You gotta dig deeper. What percentage of these folks have underlying medical conditions, specifically obesity and diabetes?
We need more information."
2020-05-21 12:57,"Those are populations of much stronger family values than middle class whites.  Those living with up to 4 generations under one roof, and the cousins.  Lots and lots of cousins milling about."
2020-05-21 12:52,"The socioeconomic status of the Nursing home employees is likely the overriding cause of this disparity. Blacks, Hispanics  and whites are more likely to be low wage earners in these facilities with limited job options and willing to take the risk of not having adequate PPE and still working. Additionally, geography of where Blacks and Hispanics workers live will increase their risk of infection and many people will be asymptomatic carriers. Without PPE to prevent them from giving or contracting covid in these facilities, this was inevitable. The pandemic response plan should have included special attention to long term care facilities with the plan to institute social isolation and universal mask use in these facilities from the outset. Race would not have been a factor if there was competent leadership in this country."
2020-05-21 12:58,"Your headline suggesting the medical supply chain discriminated against predominately black and hispanic nursing homes is pure sensationalism. The NYTimes is better than that. Your own reporters identified the lack of PPE as ""the wild west"" early in the pandemic. As a supply chain professional, I ensure you that black, brown, white, rich, poor, liberal, conservative, north, south, east and west were all wearing rain ponchos and swim goggles before supply caught up with demand."
2020-05-21 13:28,"I don't trust the quality of the statistical analyses run on the data.  It appears that factors were examined individually instead of controlling for other factors, which makes conclusions pretty useless.  Were any statisticians involved in this write-up?

Staffing overlaps between facilities, number and age of visitors, patients per room, and patient profiles are all going to interact with the factors listed here, and are also associated with culture, urban vs rural, etc.

The conclusions in the article appear to have been justified before looking at the data, rather than any kind of even half-way informed statistical analysis.  Of course there are racial disparities, but these are no doubt distilled from our society at large.

Density matters in state, city, and classroom size.  I don't believe any further conclusions are possible at this time."
2020-05-21 15:03,"This analysis did not look at the one variable that would likely explain the difference: The proportion of beds in a nursing home that are funded by Medicaid versus those that are private pay. People of color are predominantly in nursing homes that have a large proportion of Medicaid-funded beds because they are Medicaid eligible, i.e., they have low incomes and minimal assets.  Nursing homes that rely predominately on Medicaid have much lower rates of reimbursement and much lower staff to resident ratios than those that have predominantly private pay residents—mostly white. The care is poor in part because of the very low reimbursement rates. The rates are so poor that many nursing homes will not except Medicaid residents.  I am stunned that anybody researching any topic  in a nursing home does not understand the major role that reimbursement plays in outcomes. The authors need to consult with experts in the field before wasting their time on such an analysis and our time to read it."
2020-05-21 14:20,"Interesting, and sad.  But also many correlates besides racial make-up.  Not mentioned in this in-depth article is the make-up of staff. 

Bottom-line, Cuomo, CDC, health industry, etc failed to address nursing homes.  As a doctor said in a TV interview the other day, “Any third year medical student could have called that one.”"
2020-05-21 15:46,"Our black and Latino citizens are the ones who do a large percentage of those lower paid, service worker jobs.  You know, the only people who have still remained working during this crises, the ""essential workers"".  

These folks have been the ones constantly being re-exposed to the virus as they continue to work in kitchens to provide those carry-out meals we've all still enjoyed, made with food mostly picked by Latinos or African Americans, or mopping the floors in hospitals crowded with COVID patients.  Etc., Etc., Etc.,  

No wonder they have a higher rate of infection, especially given the abysmal pay of the employees in those nursing homes who change the bedding, empty the bed pans, plant and pick the crops, and all the other ""essential services"" that we still refuse to raise the minumum wage for.  Many have two or three low paying jobs."
2020-05-21 14:59,"Blacks and Latinos really do die of COVID-19 infections at higher rates than whites.  The greater rates of severity are statistically significant, exceeding any variance owing to chance.  This is definitely not a case of numbers being gathered by political zealots.

But forced integration and financial ""leveling"" of all nursing homes would probably have zero effect on COVID-19 mortality differentials.  Most have employees of all ethnicities anyway.

If elderly black and Latino residents have higher COVID-19 mortality, the exact causes could probably be deduced by blood samples and medical histories of all the afflicted.  Very likely, there are specific physiological factors that explain the gaps.  Different rates of diabetes might be hard to cancel.  But other factors might be quite treatable and diminish the mortality rates.   For instance, the US national average rate of vitamin D deficiency is 42%, but rises to 82% among blacks and 69% among Latinos, ostensibly due to lower absorption of sun UV rays.  Insufficient vitamin D greatly weakens resistance to respiratory disease.  Dietary vitamin D is seldom enough.  Daily vitamin D supplements might do a lot to cut rates of virus infection, severity, and mortality."
2020-05-21 14:43,"There is a clear racial disparity, but it appears to actually be socioeconomic disparity at its root. It happens that, in the US, elderly Black and Latinx persons are more likely to be poor and to rely on Medicaid. Thus, they're more likely to be in lower quality facilities, with higher patient-to-staff ratios and lower pay for staffer. That low paid staff is more likely to work at multiple facilities or longer shifts, to earn enough to survive, spreading the virus more easily not only between facilities but also among patients in each facility."
2020-05-21 15:11,"my mother, a white woman, died of the coronavirus. She was in a memory care place in Tucson. The facility had its first case in early April. Now, I have lost track of the number of people who have tested positive since then. More than 20 certainly. My mother was the fifth to die. There were certainly a few black and more than a few Hispanic residents there. But the real problem was the lack of testing and lack of protective equipment! The facility was unable to obtain protective equipment for staff, or enough tests for residents and staff early enough to stop the spread. I am so very angry, not so much at the facility, but at the poor response by the federal government to this crisis. And yes, I regret every day that I did not remove my mother in March."
2020-05-21 14:59,"When my Mom turned 93 we had to put her in a nursing home or assisted living, so my wife and I went to check out facilities. 

We were horrified by some of the ones we visited. There was the smell of urine, and patients were hanging out in hallways. But these places were cheap.

I totally get how sub-standard nursing homes would be virus super-spreaders. In Kern County just north of L.A. the Kingston Healthcare Center is where most of the deaths have occurred, and they are in hot water. There seriously needs to be more scrutiny and regulation of these facilities."
2020-05-21 15:56,Look at the employees.  They are probably the ones who brought the virus into the facility.  The other problem is that the facility did not have the proper protective equipment  for the staff.
2020-05-21 16:20,"Protective gear, and testing, was limited to all facilities, but a better staffed home was/is able to move people around quicker to isolate those who were sick. And, yes, socioeconomics plays a huge role in which homes are better run. Even the best homes, largely private pay, do have a segment that is on Medicaid, but if everyone is on Medicaid, you can assume the rooms are double occupancy, the staff paid less and dependent on public transportation to get there, and the exposure to staff and patients far greater. 
Bottom line, ratings of 1 or 2 should put a home on probation,  warrant a better look at the profits (they still make good money on these Medicaid only funded facilities), and a more honest approach to either limiting profits while increasing staffing, or increasing the Medicaid reimbursement rates, or likely both. And, re-designing the industry so that it's more transparent, with owners/investors not behind layers of corporate anonymity. All those players need to be part of the fix, not just drawing profits."
2020-05-21 16:24,"The Times and its collaborators missed an important metric, which is population density within the nursing homes.  In Baltimore, patients are kept 4 to a room in some of the nursing homes that have a largely black patient population.  The mostly-white nursing homes have 2 beds to a room at most.   This makes a huge difference in the spread of a contagious respiratory disease."
2020-05-21 17:00,"If the NYT does more of these studies, it should provide more detail of the process.  Identifying several correlated variables, but not naming them, detracts from the impact of the study.  Share of Medicaid, number per room, what type of care predominates (nursing home covers wide area), share part time workers (likely work at other homes) are just a few of possibles.  The story had a section on the study’s mechanics, but did not have much detail.  It looked like the study got very little, if any, data from the homes themselves.  The sources looked to be a combination of death certificates and Google Maps.  If that is all you have, then conclusions by readers need to be much more limited."
2020-05-21 13:45,"The racial divide in COVID-19 may be due to Vitamin D deficiency, which is far more prevalent in people with dark skins in northern latitudes.

Recent scientific evidence suggests that COVID-19 deaths may be linked to Vitamin D deficiency:
<a href=""https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200518/more-vitamin-d-lower-risk-of-severe-covid-19"" target=""_blank"">https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200518/more-vitamin-d-lower-risk-of-severe-covid-19</a>

Note that people in nursing homes and prisons (hotbeds of COVID) are unable to go out in the sun, so supplements are necessary.  Supplements are also helpful for people with dark skins, for whom UV exposure is less effective for Vitamin D production.

Vitamin D tablets of 1000 or 2000 IU cost pennies a day and are universally available.  Everyone should be taking them!"
2020-05-21 13:54,"Allow me to predict an alt-Right meme that will likely be coming to social media and thence to cable news, coming at you. (So far I have not heard of this meme.)

Probable New alt-Meme: ""The prevalence of Covid-19 illnesses and deaths among Black and Hispanic Americans is not caused by the economics or institutional racism as the cry-baby fake newsers are telling you. It is rather proof of the racial superiority of the genes of the White Race in fighting off this Chinese weaponized virus. So there.""

I thought of this possible new racist trope as I recalled a captured Nazi propaganda photomagazine my father brought back in 1946, 'Die Untermenchen' (The Subhumans). It was filled with deliberately ugly pictures of Poles, Gypsies, other European minorities, and of course ghetto Jews. It's purpose was plainly to make the viewer despise the people the Nazis were 'Finally Solving'."
2020-05-21 13:54,"I am not sure if the NYT is being purposely intellectually dishonest, or if they are incapable of doing research and thinking critically. 

The factors such as socioeconomic status, urban vs rural life, etc no doubt play a role in the racial disparity, but you yourself proclaim that the racial divide persists even when accounting for these factors. 

It has been reported now that the vast majority of those that suffer the worst symptoms from COVID-19 have deficiencies in their Vitamin D levels. It is also an established fact that African Americans on average have lower Vitamin D levels due to the differing levels of melanin in skin. Why is this not mentioned here?  This information could possibly help so many people."
2020-05-21 14:12,"I am surprised by the number of commenters who are questioning whether this can be true. Even if you want to dismiss the data as anecdotal, you cannot deny broader data sets that show Black and Latino people are being harder hit in general. It is not shocking, then, that this is playing out in nursing homes. I am shocked that there is no outrage over this. Black bodies are being felled by this virus at a disproportionately higher rate. Epidemiologists have suggested that quicker action from the government could have prevented tens of thousands of deaths. But the answer to all these black bodies is to reopen the economy and get back to business as usual—and to blame Black people for getting sick in the first place, even though structural racism has contributed to them being more vulnerable. This country is callous and racist and doesn’t care about Black people."
2020-05-21 14:58,"Maybe I missed something, but I saw no mention of the higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity among Blacks which could be an important part of the explanation.  Obviously, mentioning those factors and systematically factoring them into the analysis could undercut the theme of prejudice and abuse.  This is very flawed journalism, even if the intent of highlighting the gross racial inequities of our society is surely good.  I am disappointed in the NY Times for letting this kind of article pass.  We cannot solve problems unless we analyse them thoroughly and dispassionately."
2020-05-21 15:23,This is America folks. Money talks and the poor suffer. We never learn and we never care.
2020-05-21 19:59,"This is fake news, blacks and Latinos and Asians don’t go to nursing homes. Their families take care of them."
2020-05-21 13:40,What about asian-americans in nursing facilities?
2020-05-21 14:14,"""The Striking Racial Divide in How Covid 19 Has Hit Nursing Homes"" shouldn't surprise NYT readers.  Racial, Gender, Ethic, and Sexual Orientation, are a constant NYT theme.  What is missing from the story is an explanation, the implied assumption of discrimination by describing the homes as ""segregate"" isn't enough.  One of the most difficult part of analyzing soft data is recognizing the results you expect and keeping them in check.

Epidemiologists' mantra:  ""Correlation in not causation."""
2020-05-21 14:48,"Does this study control for other contributing, underlying health factors such as hypertension, obesity, smoking, etc? It would probably be a much more fruitful discussion to talk about the underlying health factors that put people at risk rather than shaking your fists at the sky. I mean we don’t see the same sensationalism describing why men are targeted more than women. The takeaway should be it pays to maintain a healthy weight, keep your blood pressure in check, and not to smoke, and if you have one or more of those health factors, be more cautious about isolating yourself, wearing a mask, not touching your face, etc. To tie it all to race and then just leave it open ended at that seems irresponsible. Follow it through to its logical conclusion, either the article is suggesting there are apriori health considerations that haven’t been accounted for (likely), that healthcare workers are intentionally treating black and Latino patients worse relative to white patients (this inflammatory line of thinking would need far more evidence), or that the absurd suggestion that virus itself is targeting based on melanin (deeply unprobable). Instead the takeaway the NYT wants readers to have (as usual) is that your skin color determines your fate and all hope is lost"

The gender gap is universal, persisting across borders, cultures, and “races,” however defined. But instead of addressing the very real genetic differences between men and women that likely leave men especially vulnerable to a plague like Covid-19, “progressive” Anglo-American journalists (and, more worryingly, scientific communities) have racialized the narrative, as if “race” itself explains the disproportionate death toll among blacks and Hispanics (as opposed to, for example, the fact that blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately concentrated in urban areas, where higher population densities make social distancing significantly more difficult than areas disproportionately white rural/suburban America, where population densities are much lower)."

The darker your skin, the more sun you need to be able to make vitamin D. Most Americans are woefully low on vitamin D. It's why darker skinned people have more instances of and more virulent cancers the farther north you go. Low levels of vitamin D track perfectly on covid  severity.

This is a conspiracy, but against all Americans. Vitamin D is a cheap and accessible solution to a wide range of health problems, from covid  to the flu to prostate and breast cancer and diabetes. Those are all lucrative diseases in a for profit health system. I wish I weren't this cynical, but there is no reason for Vitamin D to be so under utilized."

About 1/3 of the Caucasians wear a mask and some of the younger people still congregate in groups of six or more. I've not seen one Hispanic in a mask, and typically the entire family is out together. A few days ago I passed an extended family volley ball game, easily thirty people, no masks. And while the African Americans don't seem to be out in big groups, none wear masks.

I read this AM that dark skinned doctors in the UK have also had higher rates of covid-19 compared to their light-skinned colleagues.   Dark skin results  in lower endogenous production  of vitamin D, especially in northern climes.  Nursing home residents are known to often have very low levels of vitamin D, and there is a weak all-cause correlation to all-cause mortality and vitamin D levels.  Vitamin D levels are seasonal, increasing with longer days spent in the sunshine, correlating to the seasonality of influenza and possibly covid-19 .   In a placebo controlled double blind prospective study, provision of vitamin d to school-aged children significantly decreased the frequency of influenza infection and associated asthma attacks.  

Worth looking into."

Now we're seeing it in all of its malign neglect of public health. What cost manpower and materiel in ""classic"" genocide (think  Wannsee and the former Yugoslavia), some short-signed politico figured a ""free"" pandemic could do the job."

“Typically, what occurs in the general population is mirrored in long-term care facilities,” said Dr. David Gifford, chief medical officer for the American Health Care Association, which represents the industry. Nursing homes within communities that have been hot spots for the virus are more likely to see outbreaks, he said, especially in large facilities with lots of employees coming in and out."

When she went to an assisted living facility, no one asked her race.  When I get medical care, I’ve been classified “white” by providers without ever being asked.  Specifically which database maintains classifications by race?"
2020-05-21 21:56,"Pennsylvania, New York and other states ordered nursing homes to admit medically stable residents infected with the coronavirus.  They were warned by the American Health Care Association this would cause more hospitalizations and deaths.

2020-05-21 21:43,"Did the egg come first or the chicken? The virus hits everyone, but poorer people living in crowded urban conditions are obviously vulnerable. This does not make it a race issue, it makes it an income / class issue. So why does everything have to be about race?? This is getting tiresome, because it distracts from the real issue and real questions of income and educational disparities."
2020-05-21 22:31,"An important factor in many nursing homes is that the people providing hands on care are poorly paid, and sometimes poorly trained for the jobs they perform. Ultimately the blame lies with the owners/management in their decisions to keep their expenses low, despite the negative effect on the residents. It goes beyond a racial divide as many workers in nursing homes are minorities themselves."
2020-05-21 21:44,"Relatives visit nursing home patients, so if relatives are less likely to be infected, the people who they are less likely to become infected. Same for staff. So the vulnerability of minority group patients should reflect the infection rates in those communities, which they do."
2020-05-21 20:45,"Perhaps two problems account for part of the problem:
1.  6 feet is not a good choice in all cases for social distancing.  Outdoors where air circulates much shorter distances work.  Indoors where air moves little fifteen feet is recommended.  Boston (for example) reduced busses and trains when they should have seated people fifteen feet apart and increased busses and trains to move the ""essential""  workers safely.
2.  Since Covid-19 is a respiratory disease it infects mucous  membranes it is transmitted by touching the face.  The attempt to reduce infections by sterilizing surfaces is futile unless people refrain from touching their faces.
If public transportation had been increased and people warned not to touch their faces then the low paid ""essential"" workers in nursing homes might have avoided infection and infecting their patients."

Nothing new to see here.

2020-05-21 23:01,"How much is being paid for care in these homes?  Lower income Black and Hispanic residents are more likely to be found in highly segregated homes and have payment sources providing less income for operators.  That translates into low quality care for them.

2020-05-21 22:53,"There is a lot of data. Unfortunately, there isn't much of a critical thinking besides dueling on race itself.

I do not see resident to staff ratio.
I do not see the average wage of workers at each facility.
I do not see how healthy the residents at each facility to begin with.

My guess is these three are FAR better at explaining the disparity than any of the variables in this article."
2020-05-21 23:38,"There are four potential explanations. One is that the preponderantly black and Latino staffs at these institutions give worse care to black and Latino patients. That's unlikely. Another is that black and Latino folks have genetic predisposition to Covid. That's unlikely. A third is that nursing homes with majority black and Latino patients are older and have worse air exchange HVAC systems. That's possible. Most likely is that elderly black and Latino patients are more obese and hypertensive and Type 2 diabetic than white folks. Fat diabetic white elderly people with high BP are dying at high rates, too."
2020-05-22 0:05,Another completely useless article by the NYT. Did you even bother to check whether the patients at the nursing homes you compared have the same health conditions?

But then we did not have everyone working, and (not being cold here just honest), the majority did not live as long. So with the longer life spans, we have nursing homes. Even with higher pay, I doubt many here would chose to work in one as an aide. They are angels!"

2020-05-22 1:09,"I am surprised to see how many commentators think race is irrelevant. You have to take into account the history of racial segregation in housing in this country. It is not a fiction. There are cities and banks that refused to give loans or invest in Black neighborhoods 70 years ago that got us where we are today. The suburbanization of America was fueled by white flight. The fact is that Blacks did not choose to live in neighborhoods that were plundered of wealth and stripped of services including decent schools, housing, and health care. They moved into neighborhoods and whites moved out of them, followed by municipal neglect. Layer over that racial disparities in the delivery of health care, you have the yawning difference between nursing homes with white and non-white populations in COVID illness and death. It completely matches housing segregation indices."
2020-05-22 1:17,"I would expect that there are myriad of reasons for this discrepancy between the morbidity and mortality rates based on different nursing home racial/ethnic demographics.

Recent testing results in NY show much higher infection rates generally in minority neighborhoods.  Presumably, this higher rate, whatever its own causality, would also result in higher rates in nursing homes either located in those areas or with populations that include pre-lockdown visitation from family members who live in those ""hot spot"" areas.

It would also be valuable to analyze both the level of care and general conditions of these homes.  To the extent they are serving lower-income residents with lower economic resources they are likely not as well-managed as higher-priced facilities that have primarily white populations.  I would presume that many of these ""minority nursing homes"" have primarily Medicaid-assisted residents rather than those who are self-pay.

While it's natural to immediately assume a racist explanation, and that may indeed be partially correct, any analysis should include the aforementioned factors of familial contact, general nursing home conditions and lower-levels of care due to lower incomes and consequent dependence on Medicaid assistance.

The spectrum of care at senior residential facilities in the US is very broad.  It is likely that this finding signals a need to address inequities at the lower financial end of that spectrum."
2020-05-22 1:13,My hypothesis is that the cause of the disparity conforms to the acute-on-chronic dynamic; people from communities that tend to have poorer health in general will be more likely to suffer from a new condition.
2020-05-22 1:19,"""But the Times analysis found that a racial disparity remained even after accounting for a variety of factors, including the size of a nursing home, the infection rate in the surrounding county, the population density of the neighborhood and how many residents had Medicaid or Medicare.""

Did they account for Black retirement home residents getting more visits from Black family, or maybe just more and longer visits (maybe Black families are less dispersed and like to visit  more than White families), did they compare the underlying health of the different populations, did they investigate if different races are more susceptible to the virus (there are reports that they are), etc. There are many factors which should be considered and they should all be listed and how and if they were factored into the study.

I don't think the NYT should try do science - they are just too bad at it. The article does not follow scientific protocol, does not provide references, is not peer reviewed, and barely provides the underlying statistical analyses. 

The strange thing is the NYT is always accusing Trump of saying unscientific things, which may be true - but this article is a case of the pot calling the kettle black."
2020-05-22 1:32,"Perhaps there are cultural behavior differences and /or health habits/choices that exacerbate covid infection.  The premise that morbidity and severe illness are racially based, rather than the result of myriad factors, that premise is seeding paranoid conspiracy thinking.  
  Do people who are members of racial minorities all have these results?  Or is there a chance that some people who are racial minority members who aren’t already diabetic or hypertensive or morbidly obese, that perhaps the health habits of those people led to better outcomes while enduring covid infection?

2020-05-22 2:15,"So, being 80+ with comorbidities is risky? People are more likely to die in nursing homes? Lower socioeconomic populations are in worse shape than others? Eureka."
2020-05-22 2:21,"In a simple binary way of thinking: more exposure means more infections. Hence, the first place to assess an increase in infections would be to do case finding, determining how many exposures the patient had. It is easy to look a weddings and funerals, yet, visits from people who may be ill; or, staff members who came to work ill; or, delivery people who brought the coronavirus from elsewhere requires investigation. 

To invoke racism as the primary reason for any untoward event means that such conjecture alone is insufficient and one has to ""prove"" your hypothesis. Probably much harder to do than what it looks like at first glance. Then of course, the assertion becoming the ""truth"" just by someone saying it, is, well, fallacious and not to be regarded as anything other than bigotry of its own."
2020-05-22 2:31,"i thank the NYT for fitting together the various data sources mentioned in the endnote. but i don't think identity politics, and identity politics as race, gets us very much insight. 

the endnote mentions that some variables ""increased the likelihood of a [elder care] home reporting a problem,"" but it doesn't say what those variables were. the analysts concluded that ""the racial disparities persisted even after accounting for these variables,"" but we aren't told how the partialling was handled (regression? normalization? curve fitting?).

instead we get anecdotal tales about goggles and ponchos, as if an opaque analysis plus cherrypicked stories equals insight.

certainly, race appears to be an ""indicator variable"" of something. but the difference between an indicator variable and a causal variable is the difference between a fever and a virus.

possibly pre-existing conditions, exacerbated by poverty and lack of health insurance played a part. families who cannot afford long travel for visits may prefer urban facilities, despite the fact that the quality of resident services is crimped by the higher costs and taxes that go with urban infrastructure. there may be cultural rather than racial factors, too: in my mind, black culture in the US is far more powerful than the clades of ""racial genetics""."

And, yes, there have been staff and residents infected at this facility, with a relatively small number of deaths among residents compared to the horror shows reported on in the Times and elsewhere.

2020-05-22 3:56,"I was afraid to read another sentence in this incredible, horrifying and life altering but and disturbing investigative  reporting by The NY Times on Race and Nursing homes in America during this pandemic.

The surrender , tolerance and acceptance that Black life as a resident/patient in a nursing home during the pandemic was worthless and forgettable to the nursing home operators/owners and ultimately the government was surreal and shocking .

Every nursing home in America that has majority demographics of both Black residents and staff should be shuttered ASAP by state governments .

There should be immediate testing and removal of all patients in nursing home where the virus has left a body count.

Civil and Criminal lawsuits should be filed not just against the nursing homes but also any government agency that licensed nursing homes and had oversight.

I have never read such a ‘real time’ state of reporting that disclosed such inhumane conditions in any facility and setting providing healthcare services in America.

I hope every attorney general in every state of America reads this reporting and without any hesitation intervene in this killing field we call nursing homes in America 

Every family that has a family member, relative friend , and employee associated with a nursing facility in America should rush to that nursing home ASAP to check on the person before the Virus strikes!!

I spent over a decade from mid nineties in that wonderful country.

And traveled breadth of the country - though not to Malukus - the real spice islands that Magellan was dreaming of.

Traveling over Eid is a big tradition of going back to their villages (Pulong Kampung) to pray at graves of ancestors and ask elderlies, families to forgive for past sins and mistakes and flights.

Indeed - Bali - a Hindu island in the largest Muslim country - where I have been more than 30 times - hugging and kissing is indeed not common.

I also suspect that as rather less populated compared to Java and Jakarta - probably helped.  Also, prostitution in Bali is not so prevalent.

But I know flights from China continued till late as some of my Chinese Indonesian friends arrived from their holidays back home.

I suspect the Wuhan came more from China than via Europe as ethnic Chinese probably mixed with visiting Chinese.

But I was living there at the height or depth of H1N1 and SARS - and even was widely traveling to Sumatra and Kalimantan - Indonesia survived those epidemics.

And God willing - Indonesia will survive Wuhan."
2020-05-28 17:13,"Having lived in Indonesia for over a third of my life, and with extended family based on far flung islands, I am terrified for the Indonesian people.

Although everyone can afford soap, hand sanitizer would be considered a luxury good. Fewer than 10% of the households in the communities where my family live have access to running water or electricity.

The only reliable hospitals (many with tiny ICUs) lie 1-2 hours’ drive away - yet less than 1% of the population possesses a car.

Local government-run clinics, known as “puskesmas” or “posyandu” are staffed by woefully under-trained technicians, and typically run out of basic pharmaceuticals, including aspirin, in the early weeks of each month. 

This dire lack of adequate healthcare is true for all of rural Indonesia, and the majority of suburban and urban Indonesia.

Although Indonesia’s population density, poverty levels, and lack of adequate sanitation and healthcare are similar to India’s, the contrast in the response to the pandemic by national leaders is striking. 

Through their lackadaisical response, Indonesian leaders have essentially given vast swaths of their population a death sentence. In this way, sadly, they resemble the USA."
2020-05-28 16:33,"The part about checking the crematoriums in Bali for an uptick in deaths is not really an accurate statement. Most Balinese when they die are not cremated immediately unless they are very important or rich, but are buried immediately (by sunset) in their village cemetery to be exhumed and cremated at a later date (often up to 5 years) during a mass communal cremation ceremony. Deaths are not reported to the provincial  government, but to the immediate village organization called a lurah or village office. So even if there were an unusual uptick in deaths I am sure the Government in Jakarta would not really have records of this. 
I was in Bali up until a few weeks ago, I actually have a home and live there a good part of the year and have for over 30 years. I returned to the states because of the world situation and because my kids were worried about me. I was very sick in February and March and am still having issues with coughing and shortness of breath. I am pretty certain I had covid-19 and will be having antibody test soon. Many of my Balinese neighbors & family both young and old were also very sick during that time. I live in a village of about 500 people, during that time we did experience deaths of a few older individuals who were also sick. I think Bali already experienced the first wave, but fear there will be a second wave if travel is allowed freely again between neighboring islands and international flights resume to quickly."
2020-05-28 20:54,"sorry in Bali they have this under control and it has been for sometime, other parts its running rampant"
2020-05-28 18:33,"My immediate family lives in Batam, Indonesia, the nearest Indonesian island just south of Singapore and of similiar size. I have not been able to visit them due to cumbersome Covid19 border restrictions. From what  I've heard, residential communities  there are practising reasonably good social distancing behaviour, with frequent use of hand sanitizers and temperature checks. Affected clusters are being fenced off by para-police. It is true that people can still travel around freely if they look healthy, especially during this Ramadan holidays. However, many heeded advice and are discipline enough to stay put at home. At least none of the relatives I know in Indonesia have made any travel plans during this holiday season."
2020-05-29 0:15,"So far from what I see On the ground, is pretty good social distancing actions; the malls have been 100% closed for maybe 6 weeks, Masks are socially acceptable and common. 

The economic damage is immediate and intense, many in the informal sector depending on tourism, international tourism, transport, restaurants, etc are hurt.  

Just a call out to business in the USA; Indonesia has changed, the government is more responsive and regulations reduced, and corruption is WAY down.  Seriously way down, since 1998.  

Take a look at Indonesia. 

I’m sure, very sure Indonesia will handle this crisis better than NYC.

2020-05-29 0:44,"As a long term resident of Bali and married to a Balinese I can support the data that says only a few (2 locals and 2 foreigners) have died. In Bali there are clans groups that communicate with social media. There are school friends. Tgere is a lot of communication and gossip. Tgere is absolutely no reports of mass deaths being quietly buried waiting for mass cremations. In fact that practice is limited to only a few areas of Bali.
In Sanur, where I live  and where I am a member of a large community, there have only been normal deaths not related to Covid 19.
People are taking care and the Denpasar city has just increased the intensity of preventative measures by people to avoid an escalation of cases.
The transmigration during the current religious holiday is being restricted and many people who have gone home to Java now cannot return.
Hopefully this will help to keep new infections to a manageable level.

unprepared to the changing conditions of daily life, whole industries  depending on the tourist trade are  likely to shut down ( who wants to go upriver in Kalimantan in rickety boats to observe wild life or stay in congested quarters or hotels in Jakarta, visit shrines and museums or even stay to play golf in the two major recreation and resort areas In Java and Bali, which incidentally are in the process of being sponsored, built and partially owned by enterprises beholden to the President of the United States and his family?).
The government in the country appears paralyzed in both making the public aware of the medical dimensions of the corona virus spread and in coping with any foreseen after effects in dealing with the economic and social aftermaths of its developing catastrophes.It does not even publicize to its citizens if it has any plans at any level to meet its multiple national crises."

Now we as Indonesian people has to survived by ourself not relying to government. These all because denial habit in government. Now, since economis downed after 2 months unclear local quarantines policies, of course people felt enough on this situation. Then govenrment use this reasons to apply the new normal which is herd immunities policies. Al are messed up.

We are sinking......"
2020-05-29 3:04,"What is the source for the Surabaya test result? I could not find Indonesian news reporting on this, only that Surabaya was planning to do the tests 2 weeks ago. If it is true that 10% of Surabaya population is infected then this is huge. The latest news is that the main covid-19 referral hospital in Surabaya, Airlangga University Hospital, has stopped admitting new patients as it is at full capacity.

I think the central government has given up on containment, what with this past week push for ""new normal"" protocols and one of the top ministers downplaying the dangers of covid-19 by saying its deaths are only a ninth of traffic accidents deaths. Although, it is understandable that the economy is their priority as maybe the main goal is to prevent another 98 crisis and riots."
2020-05-29 3:16,"This article completely misses the point, and so do most commenters, except the one who said “If no one noticed, you have to question just how bad Covid-19 really is"". I would have expected some better critical thinking from the NYT. 10% showing antibodies in Surabaya is GOOD NEWS! The question is still out whether this test result is accurate, or whether it is in reality far above, or far below the real percentage because most antibody tests are still unreliable, as pointed out by another commenter. Moreover, it appears that many infected people do not even seem to make antibodies, in which case the virus would have already reached a much higher proportion than the 10% which then would be EXTREMELY GOOD NEWS. How can anyone think this is bad news, and how can a supposed quality newspaper fall for a scare mongering title: “it’s too late”? It all simply means the disease is far wider spread than was thought and at least Surabaya is making a step towards herd immunity. Whether you like it or not, there is no other way as this virus will not go away, containment has failed all over the world except for a few countries. So we will have to learn to live with it. Hence, infection is good, as long as it is through young and healthy people, because that’s the only thing that can protect the vulnerable in the end."
2020-05-29 4:13,"Why does so few articles pick up on the latest scientific data regarding the temperature, humidity and sunlights affect in the virus. Transmission speed has been very slow in the tropics compared to winter countries. Indoors the virus can stay airborne for up to 3 hours but virologists think transmission in an outdoor, humid, sunlit environment, is much much rarer. The only run away outbreak in SE Asia was Singapore from inside worker dorms. Unless there is an exponential take off in deaths and cases then closing the country is unnecessary and hurting the poor. So far around 1,500 declared Covid-19 deaths since Jan (of course the true figure is higher but likely not tens of thousands higher) , and yet death rate from traffic accidents is 2,500 per month = 12,500 already would be this year, and the economy doesn’t shut down for that.

I think there are a lot of factors at play for Indonesia’s low death rate:

Very outdoors life, high humidity, strong sunlight

Poor health care means much less older/sick people kept artificially alive, which have been the main victims in the West.

More reserved greeting practices, not common to hug and kiss.

I think if the outbreaks in winter countries hand not been so bad then the tropical SE Asia countries, based on their own transmission and death rate, would not have closed their economies."
2020-05-29 5:55,"The article is somewhat misinformed. Actually the media will always try to slant the facts to fit their narrative. However Indonesia has achieved something with a lockdown in respective provinces and counties without decimating the economy. 

The vast majority of people who contract Coronavirus may have never shown any symptoms. After tests have been done, the health authorities will inform people who have been in close contact to be quarantined. At least in Jakarta, that’s how it’s been done. This covers also those citizens, returning residents and some foreign travelers entering the country who have shown some symptoms. 

The government in Jakarta recently has issued a decree that no one may enter or leave the capital without a permit as long as the restriction of people movement is still in place in Java. The local police and the military have been assigned at several checkpoints near the outskirts of the capital. Cars have been turned around without permits. Some Selfish citizens have disobeyed the government and took the road for making the homecoming visits after the end of Ramadan. The diverse consequences can affect the fragile health care system. 

Indonesia is a sprawling archipelago made up of 17, 000 islands and more. The spread of the disease is preventable despite the hurdle and daily changes that lie ahead."

Fast forward 12 years, and the federal government is exploiting a pandemic to seize privately owned land, in order to construct a border wall that people on the border don’t even want. The only people who want this border wall are rural conservatives who live in flyover states over a thousand miles away from the Rio Grande."

Yet, we are spending billions for this absolute folly.

And why? Other than Trump's narcissism, it is predominantly a matter of governing on the basis of fear and anxiety, not on intelligence, progress, or advancement. Prior governments built intercontinental railways and canals, delivered electricity everywhere, built magnificent dams and interstate highway systems, visited the moon, and created and preserved national parks.

2020-05-29 16:30,"If we build a wall that is more difficult to cross, coyotes will hire Mexican fishermen to take migrants in their boats from Mexico to the California coast.  With their shallow drafts, these small boats can land along any shoreline.  If a California official happens to see migrants disembarking, he or she is forbidden, by state law, to question their immigration status. See the 8/27/17 Daily Beast article titled ""What Will Billions for The Wall Get Us? ‘Boat People’ on America’s Coasts” which reports that migrants have already begun to come by boat.

Instead of a bigger wall, we could hire more immigration judges so asylum cases could be heard more quickly.  And, we could make it clear that we will not be giving another amnesty to undocumented migrants. 

We could also require all employers to use an enhanced version of “e-verify” to ascertain that every one of their employees is entitled to work in the U.S.  California currently forbids its municipalities from requiring that employers within their jurisdictions use “e-verify”, but, on the matter of immigration, state law would be pre-empted by federal law.) 

Once people realized that asylum cases would be decided much more quickly, that another amnesty would not be forthcoming, and that no one would be able to work here illegally, then people would start to leave on their own accord and the numbers of migrants trying to come wouldl dwindle."

Have they really thought this through? what will they do when migrants start crossing the border into the no man's land and squat in no man's land? what will they do when it rains and the wall collapses?  I think they really have not thought it through and don't really plan on building a wall, they just want to talk about building a wall; that's why they have only about 20 miles in 4 years, just for show."

Most young people have been respectful of social distancing and protection, wearing masks, etc, and this article is not representative of national behaviour. Experts were critical in the beginning of the crisis, particularly to drive home a concept which has been difficult for young people to understand in a free democratic country.

The youngers, as the runners during the lockdown, are the new scapegoat of this period."

And I am proud of the way Italians behaved during our long lockdown, especially the real young (not like me). We all have been disciplined, calm, and respectful beyond any expectation. It is normal, after two months of seclusion, that young people celebrate a little bit, but they did nothing wrong. I live in Milan and I see very few fellow citizens careless of others. We all are scared and know big problems are ahead.

During the lockdown nobody worried about us but they were all concerned on the elders ant the kids and I get why, don get me wrong.
But in our time of life we need to socialize as we are becoming adults and starting to be independent.  They praised us during the lockdown, they never did anything for us though, but as soon as we did something wrong we've become the public enemy, while no one worries of the 80 year old saying out all day just because he wants to or of the ten kids playing soccer and touching themselves.

truth is that this virus affects different demographics very, very differently. The Italian equivalent of the NIH did a fantastic study that shows this definitively. We need the state to clarify these risk profiles and address policy accordingly. It is a difficult political Position however because the conclusion on all population based mortality and morbidity studies is that everyone over 65 needs to SIP indefinitely while the rest of us return to a more regular schedule, adjusted with appropriate Rnaught reducing measures of course.

Italy has several big risks-- lots of elderly people, a culture that includes lots of hugging and kissing, and often 3 generations living in the same household, so the behavior of the younger people will impact their elders.  In Asia you have the benefit of everyone being willing to wear masks and to have true community solidarity, and less physical displays of affection.  But you have the risk of governments that lack transparency.  In the USA we have the advantage of lower density (except in big cities), but we have several huge risks:  1) lack of good information and guidance coming from trusted sources like CDC in a timely manner (due to their being muzzled by the WH); 2)  politicization of the pandemic response such that wearing a mask is a referendum on your politics rather than just a prudent safety measure; 3) lack of economic support for the economically affected; 4) lack of widely available healthcare; 5) a divided community lacking solidarity with individualism dominating over communitarianism;  and 6) abysmal leadership at the federal level."

If some activity is allowed, some people will inevitably indulge in it.   Merely “encouraging” a behavior will only result in partial compliance.   I know that it is frustrating when people don’t use their good judgement;  but it’s even more frustrating when governments (I’m thinking of certain US states especially here), refuse to make or enforce the necessary health regulations and then are surprised when people engage in risky (but allowed) activities.   Today in IL, we moved to “Phase 3”, and some people seem to think that the pandemic is cancelled because gatherings of up to 10 people are now allowed.   I didn’t see any gathering of over 10 people, so people in my area are following the rules.  The essential problem is that these new rules themselves are too lenient."
2020-05-30 2:58,"“Young people are not today’s plague spreaders,” Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of the governing Democratic Party, wrote on Facebook.""
At this point I should consider Zingaretti an enthusiast by nature. Do not get me wrong, he is a nice likable man.
Yet, after what happened to him, is astonishing that someone value his sense of judgement on the matter of people behavior during this pandemic.
At the early stage of the pandemic in Italy, he was downplaying the gravity of it and on national TV he was encouraging everyone, to carry on with life as usual, go out and enjoy the aperitivo at the happy hours. Fair to be said, he lived by his own words and went on camera while enjoying his share of drinks with friends. Needless to say, 10 days later he was positive for Covid-19.
Good for him, that despite being around 60, he is a healthy man and recovered quickly without hospitalization. 
He is still in denial despite the fact that there are images all over the medias and social media, of young people not respecting social distances or taking precautions."
2020-05-30 5:30,"Now, when your older relatives tell you ""you'll be the death of me"", it could literally be true. But seriously, please think of the risk posed to others by pre- or asymptomatic carriers as you organize your life. The ""external, invisible enemy"" is a virus that loves parties."
2020-05-30 6:56,"A major problem from the outset has been the perception that disease is a senior citizens disease. Strip out the care, nursing home and retirement home figures from the statistics and the young and middle aged are well represented.  As a senior citizen, I have had the experience of young persons cross the street or step off a relatively wide pavement to avoid even two or more metre passing contact."
2020-05-30 8:44,"Popular epidemiology works differently than professional epidemiology. In popular epidemiology, low risk means, ""Yeah for me, I'm young and invulnerable."" And that is all it means. 

In professional epidemiology, low risk among young people means they are more interactive, with more chance to spread contagion. And every small-probability case is not just one case, but also all the exponentially increasing generations of  potential cases which could strike young and old alike—in short, small probability is nearly meaningless, because the potential result is massive anyway. 

Counter-intuitive truths of professional epidemiology go unheeded by the young. Those truths are being actively shunned by political leaders. They always think it is politically safer to be wrong with the others, than to try to lead individually. 

That dangerous combination bodes ill for the future."
2020-05-30 11:10,"This is a tough one. We live in Germany, on a public square in the center of the city that is a hugely popular drinking spot with young people. I am technically a senior citizen and I have a heart condition.  I also have a son entering his senior year of Gymnasium (High School).
One night shortly after the first easing of restrictions here, the square filled with hundreds of people, so many that the surrounding streets were blocked with crowds and the police had to be called to restore order.  The next day the city imposed a curfew on the square and one other location in town that had a similar experience.
Not every young person here is behaving irresponsibly, but enough are to make it a genuine concern.
It’s not about blaming – one can frame it that way, but that is a disingenuous way of avoiding the truth of the matter.  This virus is highly contagious, there is no vaccine, and it tends to kill older people at a higher rate than it does other age groups. Shutting down all life and commerce isn’t the solution but is it too much to ask that people of ages observe the only guidelines we know are at least somewhat effective?"
2020-05-29 18:42,"I am 65 and share the same view of young people in NYC as my Italian counterparts.  In west Manhattan I see predominantly young people not wearing masks and  some not socially distancing from at risk populations such as myself.  I have had 3 twenty something jerks run directly next to me, not wearing masks.  One of them even laughed when I yelled at him.  

The young runners and bikers are primarily the ones not wearing masks and exhibiting little concern for social distancing.  I see it as a massive failure of parenting with this generation.   They don't even vote.  

Meanwhile, our useless New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has prohibited the police from enforcing social distancing or mask wearing, all because the police in minority neighborhoods got too rough breaking up a crowd of minorities.  Instead of firing the officers, the mayor threw up his hands and stopped enforcement.  As a result, the mayor then gave a free pass to white, privileged kids in my affluent neighborhood to terrorize seniors like me by not wearing a mask and not staying away.  The police refuse to do anything about it.  I reported 3 CVS employees in their 20's for going maskless at the cash register area and NYPD did nothing.  

Thanks to these brats, I can't get any exercise because going outdoors is so unnerving that I come home furious.   They truly are the worst generation, so I get what my Italian counterparts are saying.   I now hate living in NYC because of the young brats."

Cavorting and carefree, they seem oblivious to the retirees surrounding them, the 100,000 dead so far and counting in this country. 
The older folks in Italy as here deserve the right to shop or walk outside, and shouldn’t have to be in fear.  As the Youngblood’s sang:

Americans rose to the occasion briefly, but it is proving just too hard, too oppressive, too annoying, too inconvenient to wear a mask and maintain physical distance. From “don’t tread on me” disaffected middle America to Upper West Side entitled (and unmasked) runners and bikers in Riverside Park we are showing our true nature. I fear that, like Trump himself, a critical mass of Americans are so self-obsessed and selfish that another 100,000 lives will be lost in the inevitable second wave of coronavirus."

Having experienced a severe Lockdown, there’s many living year-round in tourist areas in Spain with conflicting opinions about resumption of mass tourism. Clearly many people are anxious to be out and about, seeing friends, going to the beaches, and meeting in bars for drinks and tapas, and they are not all just younger people. But some of us are sensitive to the threat of ‘silent’ carriers from countries that haven’t yet ‘flattened the curve’ introducing a Second Wave of virus infection. I live in a beautiful town that more than doubles in population in the Summer. There’s over 300 bars and restaurants and many here earn their living directly or indirectly from tourism. Opinion about the return of mass tourism and the casual mingling of people in close quarters is mixed, many will be happy to cast off restrictions, booster the dominant tourism industry and to enjoy our traditional Andalusian casual, friendly lifestyle. But many are worried that summer fun will conflict with social distancing, the current mandatory face masks and other safe practices that kept the number of confirmed Coronavirus cases here to less than a dozen. They fear that temperature taking at airports and printed warning handouts will not be sufficient in preventing a new round of virus spread. I guess only time will tell, but many, like me, will hunker down while we see what happens."

In previous years, I've always taken it as a given that returning students would bring infections to school each semester. Like clockwork I'd exhibit nasty symptoms 4-5 days after classes began. But I never before worried in the slightest that they might give me something that could kill me. Until now."

2020-05-29 18:31,"I would definitely like to see these athletes post videos or be guests on news programs telling their stories.  I recovered from Covid19 about 2 months ago. Although not an athlete but very active, hiking or walking 6 miles/day, I became being short of breath just walking to the kitchen.  I tried to push through the incessant coughing and fatigue. Pneumonia set in. I finally recovered with medication after 4 weeks.  People will see me and say 'but you look healthy' and it's hard to convey the depths the virus took me and how much effort I've put into just to get halfway to normal with a still lingering mild respiratory issue that I never had before contracting this virus."

2020-05-29 19:03,"Back in the 90s I caught some sort of ""flu"" that flared 3 times within 3 months. I was at peak fitness at the time - winning a marathon the year before and consistently winning or placing in local citizen races. But I was never able to return to that level of fitness after that bug. And going to doctors was a total waste - several of them just wanted to put me on Prozac (I'm a woman so it must have been ""all in my head""). To this day I have a reoccurring case of Epstein Barr that flares at random times (along with other complications).

My grandmother and her sister had the 1918 flu when they were young and both ended up with Lewy Body dementia - a link that has been suggested in several studies. One of many studies showing long-term after effects of various diseases.

So I truly hope the medical community pays attention to these athletes and recognizes the lasting effects of viruses. We need to acknowledge how little we truly know about these ancient Earth residents. I'm fairly certain they'll be around long after our species has disappeared."
2020-05-29 19:39,"This article shows that our metrics of the toll COVID-19 has taken must include more than just deaths. Of those who become symptomatic but don't die, how long does it take for full recovery? How many, if any, ever recover fully? What is the cost to society of that? How many seem to recover fully but then have recurrences? And do those who recover acquire immunity? Full or partial? For how long? Will a vaccine work fully? If not, by how much? And again, for how long?

Also, we were caught flat-footed in terms of reserves of medical gear and equipment needed to ensure that no one dies because hospital facilities were overwhelmed where they lived. We were slow to respond as a nation due to the pandemic response team having been dismantled and the CDC having been gutted and subjected to oversight by political commissars. And since this disease came from abroad, instead of trying to kill off the WHO, do we need to support it enough so that it isn't beholden to the support of other nations that then can intimidate the WHO from protecting America properly? 

And do we need to re-examine the downside of the Republican governance model of a low taxes and a weak central government that leaves it up to the states to deal with an international pandemic...apart from ""thoughts and prayers""?

What should be reasonably expected to be done to ""de-flatfoot-ify the nation? And what will that cost?

Only when we can answer all of this will we know the toll COVID-19 has taken fully."
2020-05-29 19:52,"The fact that COVID-19 may cause long term and more permanent health complications even if it does not kill you is something that is currently missing from the political debate. 

There is the assumption that if you get it and recover, your life goes back to normal, so as long as death rates decrease, it doesn't make a different how many people get infected."

Just shows that this bug can have a long-lasting effect on the body.

One thing I would note about this is that ""recovery"" can take a fair amount of time, even without obvious symptoms, to gauge one's final status.

I remember once going through an illness that involved a lot of inflammation (where the liver, amongst other things, gets involved in helping the immune system beat back an illness by producing certain substances, and not producing others.)  On a lab test you might see the number for ""total protein"" go down noticeably.

A doctor during that period told me that it would take my system six months to fully replace the protein blood levels.  So three months in the case of these athletes is probably not really enough time to gauge their final condition."

2020-05-29 20:43,"Thank you for this article, it directly reflects what 1 member of my family, and 5 of my friends, all medical professionals at the forefront of this fight against this horrific plague have been saying. All have been fighting Covid-19 for 12-14 hours a day, 6-7 days per week, for months. All have said the same thing: Many who are listed as ""recovered"" from Covid-19 are not truly recovered, and many will never fully recover. 

This must be made clear to the public. 1% of those infected by Covid-19 dying horrible deaths is bad enough, and if Covid-19 spreads across the whole country it means over 3 million Americans would die. However, things are even worse as preliminary studies already show that least 20%, and as many as 40%, of those who become infected suffer some form of organ impairment or permanent organ damage. 

Strokes are increasingly being found to have occurred in healthy individuals in there 20's and 30's who contract Covid-19, and blood clots from the disease are causing young healthy people to lose limbs. Add to this all the healthy children and teenagers suffering from Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome due to Covid-19. They are in great peril of dying, and if they survive they often have permanent damage to their organs, particularly their hearts from numerous heart attacks. 

None of this destruction Covid-19 is causing, and will cause for decades to come, is being related to the public as all that is being tallied is who lives and who dies."
2020-05-29 20:57,"A little-known fact about people who train intensely 6 days per week is that they too suffer from systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This is becoming a more consistent pattern in elite athletics, where very fit athletes are testing as pre-diabetic despite low body-fat and high fitness levels. The combination of punishing workouts with very few rest days and excessive carbohydrate consumption may be contributing to the same underlying co-morbidities found in obese people who are also getting slammed by this virus. We have mistakenly believed that more workouts are better, more intensity is better, and ""ripped"" physiques are synonymous with health. We may need to adjust our beliefs about fitness from now on. Remember that the majority of people getting this virus do not end up in the hospital and recover quickly without lingering effects. They also usually fall within the spectrum between the  fitness junkies and the obese. I have slowed down and cut my mileage to hedge my bets."

Given the inflamed racial tensions in this country - in addition to attacks faced by people that appear to be Chinese (even if in most cases they are not) because of the virus -  one might call for more sensitivity and awareness about the pitfalls of this kind of implicit racial messaging, even if it is innocent in terms of intent."

The statistics in the US are consistent with those in China and Europe: 99.3% of people who die are either over 75 or have an underlying illness. Of those who are tested (a small subset of those who likely are carrying the virus), 80% are asymptomatic; 16% have mild to flu-like symptoms treated at home; 4% need hospitalization (heavily skewed towards people over 75) and <1% die. Of those with LT lung complications, pulminologists now say that its the positive pressure of ventilators that cause the damage, not the disease itself.

While the exceptions are sad, as some of the people in this article can attest --the overall message is clear: if you are over 75 or have one of the known underlying illnesses that makes you vulnerable to Covid-19, then self-quarantine (live in a separate bedroom, wear masks, social distance, etc.). For everyone else, the statistics speak for themselves. Carry on."

At the age of 50, my goals have changed: be strong enough to pick my husband off a toilet should he become gravely ill; and never break a hip or fall when I'm elderly. Since the onset of the Coronavirus, I have done video streaming of strength classes and worked out with my strength coach in the middle of the park, his coaching me through a mask and 12' away. While striving to maintain muscle mass and my mental health have been front of mind, there has been this nagging thought: Will I be able to do this movement if I contract and survive COVID-19? *I will.* After bilateral Achilles reconstructions, a left knee meniscectomy and now a torn labrum in my hip, I have learned one thing from strength training: there's always a part of my body that's working. I will always be working. The mindset of being an athlete is what will get us through this. Setbacks always happen. It's how you let them get ya'. Chop wood, carry water. 

Kudos to these athletes who inspire: from the slow walk with a walker to the slowest five miles. You're out there. You're doing it. You got this."

2020-05-29 14:30,"To lockdown or not to lockdown is not the question.
The real question is: what strategies do we need to implement to protect and support people and to reduce the spread of the virus.
Every situation is different and requires a different approach.
What I need most from our government is reliable information and effective and consistent leadership to develop effective strategies that allow us all to participate in avoiding debilitating illness, death, and economic hardship.
The government can’t do it without our help. We can’t do it without the government’s help.
As a shopper, I limit my shopping trips, wear a mask, and respect the distance from others.
As a business manager, I invest in strategies that help our workers maintain their distance, wear masks, and regularly sanitize common areas.
Everyone plays a role. We discuss our responsibilities and options regularly. We share our resources, help each other maintain the well-being of ourselves and our families.
It’s not about each of us. It’s about all of us. It’s not about protecting myself from infection, it’s about me not infecting others.
We encourage all of us to avoid gathering in crowds and to take prudent precautions when we must.
We maintain relationships with family and friends as best we can without endangering our loved ones.
Cooperation is the key, not screaming for special handouts and privileges."

We had an opportunity to shut it down at the beginning of the year.  That did not happen. The nation has beed seeded and the restrictions are being lifted.  If we had shut down hard and immediately, as happened in Taiwan and other Asian nations, this thing would have been over with by now with little loss of life.  

Now it's too late. The people can't stand any more restrictions.  We are going to have to live with the virus and deal with the sickness and death it produces.  

So far, it looks like the kill rate is about 1% which is 10 times higher than flu.  We don't know for sure because of inadequate testing.  The vast majority of deaths are people over 65.  Seniors need to keep that in mind in Nov."

And we have a social safety net and health care system that only work for people with money.

Months into the pandemic, the WHO refuses to publicly acknowledge the likely role of the Wuhan Virology Lab starting this plague even though WHO warned often in 2003-2004 that a virus lab would likely cause the next pandemic!

Almost certainly the Wuhan lab started this pandemic accidentally or with malign indifference to biosafety, or on purpose.  You may verify the following facts.  

On Dec. 18, 2003 the WHO wrote “These (virus) laboratories represent the greatest threat for renewed SARS-CoV transmission through accidental exposure associated with breaches in laboratory biosafety”.  That was before Tedros-Xi’s WHO, when it was led by a renowned South Korean.

On April 22, 2004, SARS escaped a Beijing lab four times infecting many others, including a 26-year-old female laboratory researcher from the Chinese National Institute of Virology in Beijing, which is part of China’s CDC.

In June, 2004 the WHO published in its bulletin “The (SARS) outbreak, which began in April at a laboratory in Beijing, has raised questions about storing and handling the killer virus in laboratories.”

In May 2019 (before the outbreak) Dr. Yuan Zhiming, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and ranking CCP member, wrote that “most laboratories lack specialized biosafety managers and engineers... it is difficult to identify and mitigate potential safety hazards..early enough” (in time to prevent a virus escaping a lab).

At this point I hope that any other country except for the USA develops a COVID-19 vaccine first because Trump and his pharmaceutical buddies will charge an exorbitant amount of money for it, which will lead to tens of millions of more unnecessary deaths worldwide."

I am as pleased as I can be by Trump's decision to cut off US funding of the corrupt and incompetent WHO.

US companies should be prohibited from investing in China to build factories there.  We should immediately require our medicines and medical products to be produced in the US or in nations who are our proven and reliable allies.  Companies like 3M betrayed Americans by building mask production facilities in China instead of in the US or ally countries.

The WHO is on the front line battling disease in the poorest, remote areas of the globe. To gain entry they must be politically adept in gaining the trust of autocrats, dictators and thugs who steal from their own populace.

Early in January and throughout the month intelligence and health officials were sounding the alarm in our country about the potential of a worldwide pandemic. By the end of January Trump (who ignored his daily intelligence briefings) was told by close advisors that the situation was dangerous. Like President Xi, Trump saw the pandemic as a threat to his hold on power and instituted a PR campaign. There was nothing more depressing than his task force meetings where Drs.

These actions also caused Italy, Spain, the US and others to get a delayed start on strong responses.  This has lead to over 100,000 deaths in the US and enormous human suffering collateral damage (i.e., over seven million children are now suffering from malnutrition with likely resulting lifelong learning damage due exclusively to our C19 response according to the Hamilton study cited by the NYT, a dramatic increase in domestic violence measured in the millions according to the US, etc.).

2020-05-29 21:10,"As the Times and WaPo have documented, Trump officials worked alongside W.H.O. scientists from the start and knew everything they knew. We have their names, what they knew, and when they knew it:

The Post reported on April 17, 2020 that fifteen Trump administration officials ""were embedded with the WHO in Geneva, working full time, hand-in-glove with the organization on the virus from the very first day China disclosed the outbreak to the world, Dec. 31. At least six other U.S. officials at WHO headquarters dedicated most of their time to the virus, and two others worked remotely with the WHO on covid-19 full time. In the weeks that followed, they and other U.S. government scientists engaged in all major deliberations and decisions at the WHO on the novel coronavirus, had access to all information, and contributed significantly to the world body’s conclusions and recommendations.

""Everything that the WHO knew, the Trump administration knew — in real time. As congressional investigators who requested WHO documents and communications are now learning, senior Trump administration officials — Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Robert R. Redfield Jr., Anne Schuchat, Ray R. Arthur and Jeffrey McFarland; the National Institutes of Health’s Anthony S. Fauci and H. Clifford Lane, and many others — consulted with the WHO throughout the crisis."""

2020-05-29 21:36,It's about time we stopped funding propaganda.
2020-05-29 21:47,"Just a short while ago, the world always looked at the US scientists and health institutions for their leading expertise in dealing with global health emergencies. It is unbelievable that the US now seem to allow one person to destroy the country and brings the world into chaos."

2020-05-29 20:37,"To demonize and try to undermine the WHO is tantamount to destroying the earth's only surveillance tool to prevent the next pandemic.  This gentleman, President Trump, is beyond thoughtless, as even his MAGA crowd are awaking to COVID 19 screwups.  Next week, Trump might be canceling his subscription to Golf Digest for similar reasons to the WHO cancelation.  Frankly, events are spiraling out-of-control and, today, circumstance more difficult to control or predict."
2020-05-29 21:18,"It is most unfortunate that Trump is terminating the relationship with WHO.  The work the organization does is vital to health all over the world and the loss of US membership will severely impact its ability to fulfill its mission. 

Once again Trump is taking a step that is detrimental to our interests out of his supreme narcissism."
2020-05-29 22:10,more than one thing can be true at once - is trump unfit to lead us through this crisis? yes (is he also deflecting blame - yes) Are China and WHO also to blame - yes. They are massively at fault here as well. Let's report on all of it.

2020-05-29 21:01,Please stop this criminal now. Enough.
2020-05-29 22:10,"While Trump marinates in the bitterness of his trademark blame game against China, he will not, of course, aim any of his petty vindictiveness toward himself.  The indisputable fact is, after all, that he is substantially responsible, through his ignorance, denial, inaction, and administrative ineptitude, for what is destined to become known as the Trump CV Epidemic 2020, during which the novel corona virus continues so unnecessarily to ravage the US."

2020-05-29 21:36,"The ONLY reason the rest of the world is dealing with the United States right now is because we still have economic clout. That is rapidly changing. In the meantime, we have alienated all our international friends, embraced authoritarian rule, and now, in the middle of a pandemic, we pull funding from the one international organization dedicated to dealing with pandemics.

If we reelect President Trump in November, the United States will increasingly be treated as a hostile, pariah, failing nation state - as we should. If we're the victim of a terrorist attack or another pandemic, who will help us? If we want to apply economic pressure against China, who will be our partners? 

Our country is desperately sick, and I don't mean the virus."
2020-05-29 21:54,"Trump's successor's first priority will necessarily be the denazification (oops, sorry, ""detrumpification"") of the federal government. Everything will have to be reversed as quickly as possible."
2020-05-29 21:24,"He seems determined to make the USA stand alone. America First is quickly becoming America alone and he uses arguments that everybody outside his base, all world leaders,  know are false, just excuses made up in haste. In most cases, his own words, his own tweets, can be used to prove that the official reasons for what USA is doing do not match reality. If his tweets or ""chopper talk"" is not enough, there are plenty of other documentation. 

Simply put: Nobody can trust The United States. It is not just the President that spread false statements and haphazardly assembled policies, it is the whole government. Nobody can be trusted.

The danger is, of course, that since diplomacy and normal negotiations are basically worthless, the only thing Trump still has as negotiation power is force. Brute force. Someone should hide the launch codes."
2020-05-29 21:44,"So let's cut out information about infectious diseases in the rest of the world - what could go wrong with that?

Unfortunately the damage to the US will be a lot more than the damage to WHO.  US abortion politics has hampered WHO public health efforts for some time.  With China having replaced the money we used to who - they will come out both stronger and better than before."
2020-05-29 21:42,"Once again whether on the national stage or international stage. Trump continues to fan the flames . We need a leader to unite us and divide. A leader to lead in times of crisis and not divide . It's not about him ,it's about being a uniter and not cause division."
2020-05-29 21:21,"I hope Joe Biden's team is keeping a long list so that on his first day in office, he can sign executive orders to overturn each and every one of Trump's misbegotten edicts and also reaffirm our support for WHO, the Paris Climate Agreement, Environmental protection, NATO, our allies and every other institution he has worked to undermine. In the universe of disasters, Trump is the worst."
2020-05-29 21:35,"The WHO was appropriately fired for insubordination. The US has recently funded it to the tune of 10x China’s contribution, but when we needed it to condemn China, thereby excusing what happened in the US, not a peep. Good riddance! Sue them to get cash back for failure to deliver!

America is so great, I can’t stand it."

2020-05-29 21:38,"I don't see how the Trump administration thought that it would be a good idea to leave the WHO, I understand the sentiment 
and the feeling that the WHO is under Chinas control, but it has always been a fundamental ídea with international organisations that to control the narrative you install your own ""agents"" so to speak to strategic posts, which is what China does to seemingly great effect.
And therefore by pulling the US from the WHO they are, in my opinion, effectively falling into Chinas trap by leaving a power vacuum behind, that will be hard for other nations to close.
Because few countries carry the same weight in the international community as the US does and that can stand up against China politically and financially."
2020-05-29 21:34,"It seems that Trump does not understand soft power. He threw billions at the Pentagon and basked behind the military shield he thought he'd created. We have a very expensive Homeland Security establishment, and within it, a very fragmented and expensive intelligence service. Since we had 9/11, we've had a crippling mortgage crisis. Now we have a pandemic.  

Bombs and missiles are not our only threat. We need the WHO and a good working relationship with it. We need a security service that tracks not only spies and troop movement, but also the movement of infected people. We need all the international good-will and cooperation we can get. At home, we need Inspectors General who do their jobs, and heads of agencies like the CDC and FDA who are not picked to be bobble heads. But Trump can't run that kind of Administration: he saw nothing like it in NYC."
2020-05-29 21:49,"Expect Trump action to pull us out of UN too as election grows near, he slips further in polls, and gets desperate for more distraction."
2020-05-29 22:07,"This is unbelievable. We will be completely sidelined on the world stage (again). This creates a leadership void that other countries/leaders will exploit.

It's a number that will likely decrease as the coronavirus' ravaging of nursing homes winds down. Nursing home deaths are a large % of the total but it is a finite population and, as sad as it is, the virus simply runs out of people who will succumb to its deadly rampage."

If you want to unite or institute or envision...not so much."

2020-05-29 21:48,"There is something very wrong with this decision. Pulling away from the rest of the world cannot and will not be beneficial to us. If The WHO has made mistakes, then we should be part of the solution and help them back in track. Running away will not isolate us from world problems, rather it will deny us the international assistance that a global economy and outlook requires. Trump, if given a choice, will always go in the wrong direction. I could care less about him, but the rest of us (those still alive after Covid) are citizens of a world in turmoil and need stability in our lives. The stable genius is taking us down the wrong path again.There are no words ....."

2020-05-29 21:49,"The CDC recommendation to not ride mass transit seems misguided on some levels. Mass transit Is simply less polluting than cars driven by individuals. The working poor simply have no choice but to ride mass transit. And at least in Omaha, there are significant safety advantages to riding a bus driven by a safe, professional driver. I think it would have been more helpful if the CDC would have issued guidelines to improve social distancing safety on mass transit."

2020-05-29 22:50,"I believe this virus has exposed how we are all interconnected in the world today and we are all potentially at risk during a pandemic.  There needs to be an international health organization to oversee all aspects of the issues and work to benefit all. We are only around 5% of the world’s population and the international health organization must consider everyone.

2020-05-29 22:03,"By giving himself a ten for his Covid-19 performance and blaming a conspiracy by the WHO and China for the large number of US casualties, president Trump ignored the fundamental fact that outside China most of the western world faced the same starting pistol back in late January of this year. Yet unlike many countries he was very slow out of the starting blocks; he dismissed the threat initially, a fatal error, as the national stockpile was stocked inadequately with PPE and ventilators and we belatedly entered the world-wide competition for supplies, only finding scraps. The result was that now we are near the top of the list of fatalities/per million people among leading western economies. Countries like South Korea, Japan and Germany have a small to tiny fraction of the US casualties/M people, as do smaller economies like Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, Denmark, Finland etc. Even Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherland, which have higher deaths/million numbers than the US, managed to keep the duration of their peak infection rates to 3-4-weeks before they dropped to a fraction of their peak rates. We have not even dropped to half of our peak infection rates after 70 days between 20-30,000 daily new infections.

Because he is driven by one strategy only: cruelty."

They claimed not until 2025.  5 years.  5 years in a state with a robust, diverse economy.  What does that say for the country as a whole?  This country is in serious trouble and Trump really is hell bent on burning it all down. Bannon warned us in 2016, well...here we are.  I think we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg for how bad things could get

I fear more for this country than ever before and it feels we turned a really dark corner in the past 48 hours.  I don't know if we survive it anymore.  Let us hope we make it until November and that America wakes up and removes this terrible president.  He needs to go."
2020-05-29 21:39,"I sincerely hope that a resounding majority of Americans will vote to terminate your country’s relationship with Mr. Trump and that Democrats will succeed in taking both the House and the Senate to enable a sustained healing and rebuilding process. It is incredibly upsetting to see, even from a distance, the havoc he has wrought over his 3  years in office and his shocking ignorance of what constitutes true American greatness. I am no longer surprised but still repeatedly shocked at the depths of his egregious behaviour, not just as President but as a human being."
2020-05-29 21:42,"Let's see. What country in the world has the most cases and deaths at this point in time? That would be the good old U.S. of A.

The President has what he has always dreamed of, a wall nobody wants to breach, a pandemic wall."
2020-05-30 1:12,"Trump-the-reactionary wants to take apart the United Nations. It appears he might be moving in the direction of trying to evict the United Nations from New York. That is unthinkable. The raw attack on the World Health Organization is part of his larger game plan. In the future he may try to terminate United States participation in the Security Council, too. Americans are slowly learning the dangers of electing a plutocrat to the office of President."
2020-05-29 22:35,"Regarding withdrawing from the WHO, does Trump understand the negotiation adage “if you are not at the table, you are on the menu”?  He doesn’t want a say on things?"
2020-05-29 22:40,"Trump screwed up by failing to deal with the pandemic in a rational manner. He cannot address problems thoughtfully because he never learned to think soundly, relying upon his intuitive inclinations and ability to manipulate others never allowed him to learn how to work through problems reasonably.  He has no sand, no character which makes him knuckle down and to give it a second effort. Instead he just tries to evade responsibility to escape blame.

The WHO made mistakes and China was not forthcoming when it mattered but it was two months of ineffective efforts to deal with the pandemic which lead to so many deaths and economic losses in the U.S. We still need the WHO to deal with pandemics so denying it funds is a poor response.

The special status of Hong Kong is the only power that Hong Kong can present to retain it's limited independence from the regime in Beijing. Removing it will enable the Communist Party to integrate Hong Kong and to terminate it's special status. This seems like a gift to Xi intended to gain his favor by Trump."

It's consistent with firing inspectors general: no oversight, no crimes.  China violates Hong Kong treaties and human rights?  Abandon Hong Kong.  Problem solved.  

(This last solution strikes me as characteristically weak and cowardly.  Made me nostalgic for Reagan's illegal deal with the Iranians in 1979.  Imagine if Reagan had just given up the hostages to make the problem go away?)"

Inspectors Generals inspecting again. The un packing of the right wing Trump Court by increasing the number of actually qualified judges to outnumber those placed on the bench by McConnell. So much to do. Amazing how much damage one child can do. The demographics of the Republican Party are terrible. The only way they have managed to hold power is by gerrymandering and limiting voting rights and in one case in NC actual voter fraud. The single real example of voter fraud in the USA was by a Republican operative.

2. Hide: avoid questions about racist tweets & run (with no trace of bone spurs) from the podium and media questions.
3. Misinform: get the data all wrong -- e.g.,  on covid-19 deaths: claim 1.0 million global deaths to make the 100,000 on HIS watch look less incriminating.

His wholly preoccupied with covering his own butt and never at doing the best job by learning from mistakes- especially as America flounders so terribly.
Severing ties to the WHO means he rather pretend they caused his gross incompetence than strengthen this valuable global organizer. If nothing was learned, he should have discovered that pandemic plagues require a coherent international response.

The article ""Inside an Extraordinary G.O.P. Event: ‘Pressing Flesh and Kissing Babies’ Again"" we find that Republicans are ending social distancing & the use of masks.

So it seems Trump sees his role as...the ender of all things. There's no building up. He likes to tear down things others have built. 

Yet we still wait for ""Infrastructure week."" What about the wall he was going to build, & in 3 1/2 years still hasn't? He ended the Iran deal. He ended functioning federal departments by leaving scores of federal positions unfilled. He has effectively ended the mission of the EPA & the department of the interior. 

He wants to end the Affordable Care Act, still. He wants to end the Post Office. He wants to end ""looters"" via ""shooters,"" thereby ending even more lives than his inept mishandling of every public health crisis, from gun violence to COVID-19, has already ended. There are already 40,000 largely preventable deaths a year from guns, & now 100K from COVID.

Trump, the Ender of All Things. It has a ring to it. It seems that Republicans are ready to employ their useful idiot to end democracy through expanded voter suppression & god knows what other means in order to retain power.  An ending too far? Judging from the track record, I don't think Trump knows how to do anything else."

I hate to say this, but at the rate he is going - if re-elected in November - look for a prolonged depression in the US and world economy. This will be the result of a complete lack of any international cooperation and coordination in face of perhaps the most severe economic crisis in 100 years. 

Leaving the WHO will cut the USA off from the only global early warning system for infectious disease. And from the only organization that assists developing nations effectively defeat these. As happened in Kerala, India with 40m people - which has under 500 Covid 19 cases and under 50 deaths - with WHO assistance! Wouldn't we like to have had that?

Weakening the WHO will make opening up the global economy far more difficult. And world trade has already slumped by 20-25% and could take years to recover. Will countries trade as before if they fear Covid infections come through trade and travel? 

The major lesson from the Great Depression of the 1930s was that mounting trade barriers causing trade slump across the world's major trading blocks caused savage and lasting havoc in all major economies. We may now be set to repeat these mistakes to our great cost?

The problem is not with Hong Kong - which needs supporting not weakening. It is with China. So removing special trade status is a bad move now!

Trump frequently cites Putin and Xi as friends.

Trump gets elected with Russian help and then removes from the Government agencies everyone who investigated those connections.

Trump loses trade war with China.

Trump loses 100,000 Americans (and counting. 300,000 dead by November?) to corona virus.

America should remove itself from Trump, and cease any monetary support for him while collecting the evidence to charge him with 3rd degree murder. Further he should be sued for all he is worth as even if as rich as he claims, it will only be a token of the money’s required to fix the damage and havoc he has caused.

He treats others disgracefully, worse than any other person. This should never have been allowed. 

He was going to fix American healthcare, but almost immediately claimed after being elected that no one knew it could be so difficult (or along those lines) indicating that like him we must have all been morons. Now he blames China for COVID 19 while his simpleton mind could not, word not accept the threat to America until someone died, and even then, it was no big deal. Who knew that COVID was invisible, that it was so contagious. Trump had a deaf ear to those shouting warnings.

He is the so called President, the buck stops with him but no, he takes no responsibility for the consequences of his actions or his lack of foresight, instead he deflects any scrutiny of his own incompetence by casting blame on others and using his position of power to punish. This is not leadership, it is not praiseworthy. 

Trump is his own greatest fan, he is the originator of “fake news” as a political weapon. His use of fake news is a crime against America and the world.

The even lower rates drives money to seek risk, getting nothing for savings and almost nothing for treasury binds means stock market is artificially high even more artificially high than before. Corporate bonds snapped up in middle of pandemic is crazy. JC Penny in bankruptcy offer 1.2 billion in bonds to pay creditors!!! Distortion is tge name of the game and everything gets risky and riskier. If lose confidence in Fed, it will be Germany after WWI."
2020-05-31 8:01,"When there is more money in peoples' hands the prices of all goods go up. This is true to stocks and stock indices also. That is the reason the Feds marathon activities have pushed up the Stock prices. Indeed, most of the monetary stimuli go to the Rich and the Super Rich directly or indirectly. They buy more stocks and their prices go up! Fiscal stimuli like roads and schools, bridges and dams create wealth both for the Rich and the Middle and Lower income people --- people buy homes and household goods and stocks.

FDRs fiscal policies (including WW-2 spending) produced a recovery which lasted for over 30+ yrs. 2008 Great Recession fought with almost excusively monetary policy produced more billionares but the recovery lasted barely 8 yrs! 
President talking to China assures no new tarriffs and bussinesses, small and big, cause a 'relief' rally! Money supply to the Super Rich is the fundamental cause!
P.S. The Pandemic was preceded by a year by the ""interest rate inversion"" --- something associated almost 100% with a recession in two years! The Pandemic precipitated and magnified the deflation into a ""Greater Depression""! If the Wealth-Income inequality widens, recovery would be delayed for long periods!"

He was wrong even about the Delaware date, it was June 15th.

The sheer stupidity of playing the local in favor of federal control over testing is beyond negligent, it is criminally negligent.

A third concerns whether caring about people means putting public health or the desire to move freely first. A fourth is that Trump is strong because he doesn’t care while Biden is weak because he does I wish Biden was getting better coverage so people could see that he has strong leadership skills."

Local forces call upon the state as needed and charities such as The Salvation Army go into high gear  helping displaced people. But if , by contrast, something happened to Lake Tahoe, located in California and Nevada, which demonstrated a chance of effects beyond our borders, of course the federal government would/should step in and lead.

2020-05-28 16:22,"Coronavirus does not respect state borders.  The testing policies should be partnerships between the Federal and state governments.  

Anything that all 50 states need, should be done by the Federal government.  It's insane to have all 50 states on their own, competing with each other and foreign countries for scarce resources, only to have FEMA confiscate them before they arrive at the state that found them.  

This is why Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan flew 500,000 test kits that he bought from South Korea directly to his state.  The flight met by the MD National Guard and MD State Police, who still guard them against theft by the Federal Government.  Hogan had learned his lesson after seeing FEMA confiscate 400 ventilators that had been acquired by Governor Jared Polis of Colorado.

Addressing COVID-19 testing was beyond Trump's ability, as was listening to his public health and intelligence experts. Talk of pandemic didn't fit into his re-election campaign... so he simply ignored it at the cost of lives and treasure.

2020-05-28 14:19,"Thank you, Vice President Biden, for a thoughtful, coordinated plan for responding to this pandemic.
And excuse me, Senator Alexander. 
Your ""states' rights"" approach is horrifyingly like the arguments in the 1960s against a national policy on racial discrimination. When a threat crosses state borders, it's national.
And you make your argument from the comfort of your home in a state where the Republican governor has chosen to use state money to pay for extensive, inclusive CoViD-19 testing. You might be making a different argument if you were a black citizen living in Detroit or Minneapolis. I sometimes feel gobsmacked by the tone-deafness of those whose standard response is anti-federal government."
2020-05-28 15:59,"Joe Biden is scrambling desperately to have some relevance.

2020-05-28 15:46,Trump declared war on COVID-19 and then informed the states that they were on their own.  Definitely strange...
2020-05-28 18:24,"Trump's response to the COVID-19 epidemic may be a deliberate strategy, not just incompetence and stupidity. Trump's ""strategy"" may be to let the corona virus run wild until everyone is infected, and the population develops ""herd immunity,"" i.e., the Norwegian strategy. Since 100,000 Americans have already died from the virus, additional losses are relatively immaterial. 

This would be consistent with his declarations in favor of opening public venues, use of quack medications, and his lack of interest in social distancing, universal testing or contact tracing. He wants the Republican convention to be held without precautions against the spread of infection. He seems to have convinced Republican authorities in many states to implement his policies.

He will thus demonstrate to his supporters that only Democrats and liberals are afraid of corona virus.

It is therefore essential that all local authorities forget about obtaining any support from the Federal government and implement rational policies on their own, and regard the Federal government as an implacable enemy."
2020-05-28 17:06,It is comparing apples and oranges (no pun intended) when comparing Biden and Trump.  Trump has no real strategy. No empathy for the sick and dead. He is only concerned with his reelection and how much it is tied to the economy.
2020-05-28 17:45,"The Democrat bosses in their zeal to destroy Sanders and the so-called 'left' of their party settled upon the golden mean of mediocrity, Biden. The liberals proclaimed 'better Trump than Sanders,' and they will get their way, as they did with Hillary Clinton, a candidate so despised, she elected Trump. Despicable Trump, the criminally negligent Nero of declining America, actually seems to have a pulse compared to Biden and despite his murderous incompetence looks poised to win a second term as the more popular with the ruling rich. The overwhelming majority of working people will undoubtedly continue to abstain from the electoral farce, seeing no significant difference between the two parties of the ruling rich. Most workers view professions of 'care and concern' for them by Democrats as akin to declarations of 'friendship' by the ""soft cop"" in the interrogation room. Fundamentally Biden and the Democrats have no different proposals from Trump, hence the uncanny silence. Both parties gave trillions to the rich and have nothing to offer working people but pain."
2020-05-28 17:22,"The Trump policy is to dodge responsibility.   If the feds take on testing, then they take on the implicit failure.   

A scammer thinks in terms of what they can get away with.   A leader thinks in terms of what impact they can have with whatever limited resources they have.   

This situation demands an expedition mentality as the globe hurtles toward destruction.    That implies expertise about what we need and precision about where we are.    Instead, we have summer camp mentality, looking to blame the weather, the camp across the lake, and last year's team for not having saved enough canned food."

2020-05-29 0:05,"Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself.  The only strategy he has is how to get reelected in November.  At least Biden isn't self-centered and acts like a mature individual compared to the spoiled brat that Trump is.  Trump is the worst president since the founding of this country. I continue to have a hard time understanding how so many can be blind to his stupidity and self-centered approach to everything he does.  Even the token things he's done to acknowledge the vast number of Americans who have died because of Covid-19 don't show any sympathy from him.  I suspect that those minor things were suggested by someone working on his reelection as a feeble attempt to show Trump has an ounce of compassion--a total failure attempt!  Hopefully this country won't have to endure ""four more years"" of this idiot!"
2020-05-29 1:20,"Thank you New York Times for finally doing a story on Joe Biden's COVID-19 response.  He was doing daily video chats on the virus. He may still be. But The Times wasn't covering him at all. I'm glad you're giving some attention to his proposals related to the pandemic. In a democracy, both candidates running for president deserve equal coverage from the press."
2020-05-29 9:43,Safe to say that Trump isnt exactly a buck stops hear kind of guy. In the centuries old dispute regarding states rights and federal regulations no one ever doubted the federal governments responsibility to ensure national security while giving states latitude on how they fulfill federal mandates. By passing the buck on to the states Trump has more time to watch fox news.
2020-05-29 10:30,"In our Federalist system, States do indeed have certain rights and responsibilities reserved for them by the Constitution and others reserved to the Federal Gov't.  Federal responsibilities include those that involved commerce, activities, and threats that involve many states.  This pandemic, to me, would seem to be a responsibility of the Federal gov't and not one assigned to each state individually.  In contrast to many Republicans in Congress who oppose gov't directed/controlled actions based on strongly held political views, trump does not accept responsibility for anything involving this pandemic because he does not want any blame for our gov't's poor response.   Consequently, he does not want Washington to play any centralized role. This is placing the health of Americans and ultimately that of our economy at risk; so sad! While Dems can be accused of trowing money at problems rather than trying to fix an underlying cause, in this case Biden's plan for Washington to play a central role in Covid testing is right on the mark. His approach is the correct one and speaks to not only his management ability, but his concern for Americans.  All voters should contrast this to the incompetence and lack of concern for anyone other than himself exhibited by trump."
2020-05-29 10:12,"One problem to leaving it up to the states is that the states can simply ignore the guidance (or whatever else Trump et al wish to call it). Gov. Pritzker said yesterday that he had just learned that Illinois is the only state actually meeting the federal guidelines the administration put out before moving to the next phase of reopening. 

People travel across stateliness, work across state lines, and travel to schools the same way. Testing is/should be a huge undertaking because we are not talking about testing someone once, but over and over and over for the foreseeable future. Contract tracing must be used country wide and done quickly and efficiently.  That takes enormous resources, lots of money, and personnel. 

Trump's largest failure in all of this by far is his utter inability to understand the coordination and oversight role of the president in a time of national crisis (compassion, nurture, and a bit of mourner-in-chief would be nice too, but the poor man is incapable of playing those roles.)."
2020-05-29 5:26,"Sen. Lamar Alexander: “Every time you have a national problem, whether it’s education or health, the instinct of Democrats is to say, ‘Let’s solve it from Washington,’ and my instinct and that of Republicans is that this is a country that works state by state, community by community.”

But what the senator fails to include in his lament is the fact that some states have leaders who are so anti-science, they’re not taking this pandemic seriously. Cases continue to rise in states where governors have only given loose guidelines for social distancing, masks, size of gatherings, etc.

So okay, one time, I had to go to this wedding where the bride let her attendants choose their own outfits. And not from a predetermined list of options either — not the mix-and-match styles you’re thinking about. Nope. It was literally a “wear what you want” thing. Well, she may as well have had the wedding inside Walmart because that’s what it looked like. One girl showed up looking like Honey Boo Boo in full pageant regalia, hair jacked up to Jesus, and another one looked like she’d just rolled out of bed. The pictures were a hot mess, and the bride later said that she should’ve put a little more effort into planning it. She didn’t even post pictures of the wedding party online, bless her heart.

That’s what Trump’s pandemic response is like. Come on, states at least need a list of dresses to pick from! Biden’s plan is so much smarter. The chore is getting people like Lamar Alexander to see it."
2020-05-29 9:31,This administrations response is like another Hurricane Katrina for the entire country. Joe Biden at least knows how government should work for all our citizens. Leaving responses up to the States just encourages the same blatant inequities to affect the poor & people of color. We need sanity restored to the Whitehouse please...
2020-05-29 7:21,"In the early days of Donald s Trump’s 
presidency, the nation, indeed the world was often shocked by his “style” effectively giving him the “OK” to launch his childish lashing out at anyone and anything that didn’t  support him.  He was even praised for being the first US president to use social media as a major part of his platform for public appeal. Today, as is typical of Mr. Trump’s “style” we find him condemning the very same entity as biased and stifling the voices of conservatives. 
Which is it Mr. President? You can’t support both arguments. 

As time went on his shock value became more widely accepted. Today, name calling, lying, making unsubstantiated claims and shirking responsibility are no longer shocking, but they should be. The American people have been and continue to be brainwashed by a president who consistently makes decisions and choices that lead to potential (and actual) disaster. 
In all fairness aside from his propensity to wreak havoc rather than display true leadership, he did sign the economic stimulus bill, which was largely orchestrated by what he calls “nasty, vicious Democrats.” 
It’s all part of:

2020-05-29 13:43,"The lip service almost every employer pays to use of sick leave is probably the most unhelpful.  Regardless of what the new measures are, who is going to believe them?  A few years ago, we had a woman come to work with pneumonia, tell everyone she had pneumonia, but had to be at a meeting that some managers up the change wouldn't cancel because their calendars were clogged with other meetings.  Nobody did anything: Apparently this was an unsolvable problem for the people paid to lead our staff.  I announced I was working from home and left."
2020-05-29 13:49,"The ReopenNC protesters here have a relevant saying - you can’t have unelected health department staff dictating to the entire state. Same with these ideas. Impossible to implement in the real world.  So why promulgate them? Half of the people in the office on opposite weeks, sure. Staggering stop and stop times to reduce crowding (and not coincidentally traffic jams and public transit jams), sure. Arrows to and from bathrooms, open windows when there has not been an office built in the last 50 years  with operable windows, nonuse of public transportation in a large city like NY or DC, etc. Utterly ridiculous. A much better plan was published in Forbes, based on the 80-20 rule. It would also de facto create herd immunity among the huge numbers of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers. Honestly the public health types need to get back to medical research and contact tracing instead of trying to re-engineer society. Also whether or not they are paid should depend on the ability for their ideas to be implemented in a reasonable time period and at reasonable cost. Just like in all other aspects of society. That one policy change would end the silly season in its tracks."
2020-05-29 13:51,"Some of the guidelines are really not practical. I work in NYC, there is NO possibility that I can drive to work, I must take public transportation. And since the rent is so high in the city, your office space is also cramped. Good luck with the 6-feet apart recommendations. Not even mentioning the shared elevators, crowded sidewalks. It is literally impossible to social distance in some cities. And as we all know, it only takes several infections to make it spread like wildfire. I really don't see the light at the end of the tunnel."
2020-05-29 13:55,"If we are supposed to keep socially distanced at all times, how is it possible to evacuate a multi story building in a reasonable amount of time in case of a fire?

During fire drills we don't use the elevators, but the stairwells are full with people leaving the building and, since my office is in DC, we don't even have that many floors.

This recommendation makes any office building other than a sprawling suburban campus with no more than two or perhaps three floors  and lots of stairwells impossible."
2020-05-29 13:56,"We need to pare back public transit. Cities should consider redesigned buses with lower seating capacity, separators, vastly improved ventilation and the ability to heat-sanitize the interiors.

While many of the trips will be replaced by walking, viking, telecommuting or shopipping for home delivery, it is also important to make it much easier for people to own and drive a car. Punitive license suspensions and excessive insurance rates should be reconsidered.

Auto makers are appealing for another round of ""cash for clunkers"". The original was not at all efficient, and today's ""clunkers"" are not nearly as clunky as those from years ago.

There is a glut of used cars on the market. The best way to make use of these assets without cratering demand for new cars is to get more people - especially those vulnerable on planes, trains and buses - driving."
2020-05-29 13:56,"They are kidding. Who's writing this stuff for the CDC? 8 million people use the subways, trains and buses in NY, most to get to their job. Without even considering that many of them can't afford a car, the infrastructure could not bear the load, roads, during a normal commute (remember 8 million are out of the loop) are clogged. And parking? That's laughable in a city where people will spend hours waiting for a spot on a normal day. Totally not workable. They may as well just say we should give up on our cities."
2020-05-29 13:56,"The recommendation for driving, alone, is a recipe for disaster. America's roads aren't ready for this, cities can't accommodate the traffic or the parking, our communities shouldn't have to take on more pollution, and most importantly, driving as the preferred mode of transit disfranchises the poorest among us. 

If you don't own a car, if you can't afford tolls and parking, must you stay at home? Lose your job? Risk your well-being? 

These recommendations are at odds with the procedures being implemented across the world, procedures that recognize that not all people can afford to drive, that our cities shouldn't become car hellscapes, and that our planet just can't afford more and more carbon emissions."
2020-05-29 13:58,"I wish the CDC had any evidence that supported so many of these recommendations.  They have no basis on which to decide that ventilation systems play a role in virus transmission.  One would think an open window or strong HVAC would blow droplets longer distances arguing AGAINST ventilation.  The one study in a restaurant in China, like the ""choir"" spread in Washington state was so flawed in it's underlying premises that we can't use either of those cases to establish public policy.

They sound so much like ""out of an abundance of caution"" rather than a considered program of risk vs. cost.

If our standard is to be ""out of an abundance of caution"" we will never return to normal life."

Even in Atlanta where CDC is located, the daily traffic is a battle that many people have to fight daily. Even driving alone is possible, there is not enough parking space for all the cars. The management at CDC is broken. CDC is busy constructing a building after a building but there is not enough parking spaces. If and when there is a major disaster at CDC, CDC and Emory University employees will die in their bulidings or in the parking lots because they cannot get of the area fast enough. CDC should instead recommend a major overhaul to mass transit so that people can use the public transportation without worrying about thier health and lives."
2020-05-29 14:08,"“Inside the office, desks should be six feet apart. If that isn’t possible, employers should consider erecting plastic shields around desks.”

It’s almost as if we need an invention that could seat employees in their own small office space with partial height walls and their own desk to provide a bit of privacy. Maybe something in the shape of a square, or a cube, to maximize efficiency. 

The death of the open office may be only one of a few positive things to come out of this."

2020-05-29 14:09,There are definite changes in American offices. Working at home. People become more efficient. They don’t have to go to meetings. And what they do is effective. Yet there must be vacation time. You need a time to settle down. You need to take weekends  off. You need to rehab yourself. If people stay at home do they have to make lunches for their children? At school?   And perhaps a reduction By the federal government to pay for food at schools? Because people can make their own lunches. To keep in mind even people for those on disabilities and yet they get SSI benefits which range from six to over $800 or more tax-free a month. So the family should cook for their children. During summer. Kids need to get out. And perhaps people can make their own lunches. Where the kids  can sit down and 6 feet apart socialize.  Then everyone who has a food allergy or whatever will be cleared up by the parent. Instead of the school?

I love my freedom to work at any hour and my open windowed view on my tranquil lake.  After reading this article, I'm thinking it may be a long long time before we are required in the office.  I do have a private office, but the idea of working with my door closed all the time or having a mask on all day is crushing.   Reading between the lines, seems like too much liability for my company to assume.

Not to mention that I must maintain two homes in two states because my work insisted on my relocation to the home office last year.  I do love my little lake apartment, but if this continues through the end of the year, I will ask to return to my residence and end my current apartment lease.  Wow -- what a turn of events."

Today, the Times attributes the NYC problems with CV to its density, even if other large cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo did not experience them.

A few months ago, NYC and undoubtably other cities wanted to force commuters to use and subsidize public transit. Ban cars, invest in public transit, etc. Today, avoid public transit.

And then there is this. We were told that companies And young people were flocking to cities because large concentrations of people in an industry (technology) do better when in close proximity. Today, work from home. Don’t ever come in."

People will be able to work their historically city-based jobs, but be able to afford a large house on land in Kentucky. Outside of the obvious negative impacts of people having to drive by themselves, it will be an ecological disaster when we return to paving over forests, prairies, and fields for large homes and land. Just think of the increased flooding because of the loss of permeability, the water usage for the lawns, and the services that will have to be established for so few people in a less-than-dense environment. Once high-speed internet is common in rural communities, there will be very little holding people to cities."

Installing plastic shields is a cosmetic approach that will not be of much benefit as the air currents from simple pedestrian foot traffic generates 50 feet/minute air velocity. How will the “magic 6-foot” social distance be maintained in aisles/walkways/corridors/stairwells/restrooms, and any other confined spaces with a building/structure/bus/train/aircraft.

Not enough parking spaces exist in Chicago's LOOP to even consider that a reasonable option. Not to mention, what about those of us who don't have cars and live in apartments in neighborhoods that don't have available parking on the street. How is this a recommendation that is reasonable for urban areas?"
2020-05-29 15:36,"Here are a few practical issues associated with HVAC issues:

HVAC maintenance routines are one of the first items that get sacrificed whenever corporate push for expense reduction comes along.  Periodic filter changes on the systems being one of them.  

If the business is in large metropolitan area, good chances that most businesses are in leased spaces where they have no control on how the landlord manages the HVAC systems and Indoor Air Quality issues.  

Air flow within work spaces behaves in strange ways.  While putting up plexiglas barriers may create a perception of safety, it may require significant upfront expense commitment to adjust HVAC distribution.

South Korea and Taiwan have also been successful without lockdowns. Masks seem to play an important part as well as extensive testing and contact tracing. The CDC first bungled in creating a test, then told us masks were not required before saying that masks might be a good idea.

2020-05-29 16:21,"The CDC has lost almost all credibility.  First it was a botched test that put the country two months behind, then it was advice that masks were a problem, then they conflated virus and antibody test numbers.  It probably won't happen until the next administration takes office but the CDC badly needs reform--different leadership, better management, more money, increased focus on science and TRUTH and lastly--a focus on practical solutions, and not telling us to avoid public transport or to keep social distance within elevators."
2020-05-29 16:24,"Buses and trains could be redesigned or retrofitted to maximize air flow and minimize air exchange. Surely there's a lot that can be accomplished here, if there's a commitment to do the research and pay the expenses. We'll never be able to pack people into them as we did in the past, but moving to a totally car-centered society carries economic, environmental, & social justice consequences of its own, not to mention wars for oil. Public transit will have be part of the picture."
2020-05-29 16:51,"Well there you go. I don’t claim to have the answers, but three things about commuting come to mind. The first is that the CDC, playing toady to Trump yet again, goes after mass transportation. There are ways to manage this with mass transportation in the mix, but that is not part of Trump’s agenda. The second is that no one at CDC seems to have thought about the public health implications of putting a half million more cars on the road in already congested, smog prone urban centers. The third thing is... parking. Having tried on several occasions in the last few years to find someplace to park in Oakland and San Francisco, I can attest that it is both difficult, and prohibitively expensive. How many janitors, maids, receptionists, security guards, dishwashers and the like will be able to just, you know, get in their cars and drive to SF to work every day? I guess they can always eat cake."
2020-05-29 17:24,"As many others have mentioned, public transit is necessary in cities and adjacent suburbs. Could it be improved? Of course. 
Using Washington, DC as an example, WMATA and my county's Ride On service could:
- run buses more often and based on demand, rather than removing entire routes as they did starting in March
- schedule buses and trains based upon ridership, rather than at fixed intervals. Often, I'll be on a bus or train with one or two other passengers. More often, 75% of the seats on a bus are taken, or the Metro car is sro.
- provide masks and sanitizers at the entrance to the station & at bus stops
- look into trains that can be more automated
- post ridership data so that those of us who aren't comfortable taking the train or bus have an idea as to when it might be ""safer"" to do so

In addition, each jurisdiction could provide transit for students, at predictable hours before and after school. We could call these ""school buses"". :)"

2020-05-29 18:59,"I notice that all of these CDC recommendations put the onus on the employers and employees to solve a problem on a monumental scale. Just reconfigure your entire formerly open-concept office space ($$$), only 1 to an elevator, no microwaves and water coolers, drive alone (!!!) to work... 

Where are the CDC-backed federal mandates requiring flexible schedules so fewer people can be in the office at any given time? Paid sick leave of *at least* 2 weeks per year (extra if you're diagnosed with COVID, flu or something else highly contagious)? MORE buses and trains in metro areas so people can continue to be environmentally and financially prudent by using public transit but without the crowding, which was already absurd before COVID?

We need sound regulatory and relief structures in place so businesses and individuals can engage in thoughtful, sustainable, phased reopening. These recommendations, while perhaps scientifically sound, are at best largely unfeasible and at worst a recipe for businesses to significantly if they don't just close up shop entirely."
2020-05-29 16:05,"I see two problems with implementing the CDC workplace recommendations:  First, the office workspace essentially means semi-private ""offices.""   Those are historically the province of ""bosses.""  Second,  we are coming off a decade or so of ""innovative"" open office design, which ironically recreates an early 19th century office with zero private employee space, few chairs, shared equipment, and in the example someone was selling to my last employer, not even freaking coat rack (unless, of course, you were a ""boss."")."

They are saying that a plexy glass shield is sufficient and that the voter can hold up their driver's license to be scanned - BUT that is the back side of the card.    How is an election staff member supposed to do the visual ID check of the very small picture on the front of the DL?    Courts in TX say that fear of Covid is not a reason to vote by mail, but they sure seem more than content to allow voter's to not have their ID checked...which is a bigger risk of voter fraud.    Are they trying to have fewer Election Judges to decrease voter turnout?

If we masked at the beginning like most of Asia has done since SARS we’d be in a far better place right now. These restrictions with a death rate well below 1percent will completely crush companies and is highly illogical. There has to be a better way. This is ridiculous. The statistics do not merit this. What it does merit is a complete overhaul of the nursing homes across America and diet changes to correct our obesity and diabetes epidemic we’d not have to be so extreme and crush businesses.

Humans are social and herd beings and if the desire of the CDC is to create feelings of alienation and despair they are on the right track. Bubble boys everywhere can rejoice that the tribe is growing. In all seriousness this lacks any forethought to the future. The next generation will get no training, see social and communication skills further erode and we will see the US fall behind in productivity and then ingenuity even more. New entrants to the workforce need guidance, training, and assimilation into the cultures of the company. That doesn’t happen via Slack and Zoom. Part of our challenge as country is the diminishing of our cultural bonds and it seems the govt bureaucracy is hopeful there is nothing left for us to come together to support.

Working for the oil company 5 decades back - even a fresh engineer like me had his own office in downtown LA.  Along with it came a secretary who would get coffee, take dictation etc.

Then, to cut costs, out went individual offices, encouraging commuting with ride share - and of course, those open concept desks.

Now, CDC says - go back to the past.

Encouraging people to drive individually will raise air pollution that is so welcomed absent now, and bring us back to the health risks of traffic and unnecessary long commutes – high blood pressure, stress, diminished quality of life. Where will individual drivers park, what are the risks there.  A re-ordering of the social order is what is needed.  First is child care, paid family leave, reasonable away days.  Americans  work schedule is on average two weeks off a year, yet being at the office does not lead us to any more, and yet, reduced productivity than other ‘developed’ countries.

What might happen is a temporary reversal from the open office plan whereby more senior- and mid-level employees get glassed in offices or somewhat bigger offices if employers find that the benefits of retaining these workers exceed the real estate costs.

As for public transportation - its never been viable. It makes you conform to a schedule, often a bad one. It can require connections and waits between.  It offers no storage for your stuff. Its not always safe, waiting or riding. It does not give you a shelter while connecting - you might wait for a bus or a Uber ride in a blizzard, and it might never come.  Its not a safe home away from home - vehicles are so capable that some live in them.

Now we see how public transit exposes you to illness, but it always did.

As for cubicles at work - the photo shows it well, they can be made safe. Elevators? In a 3 story building they are slower than walking.

Its the connecting areas and public space that cause the problems.  Here we need some brainstorming - I bet some ideas will emerge."

In fact, some employees and employers recognized this was a more attractive benefit than even comp. I don't see any reason whatsoever companies should mandate employees return to the office when the only thing it would be doing is putting them at risk for infection. Yes, the camaraderie will be missed, but remote work cuts back on the old-world notion of ""hours"" and enhances new-world notion of ""productivity:"" you work until the work is done, then you go be with your family - and in the future, hopefully, friends.

Imagine how many lives would have been saved if the CDC and the WHO had put a little thought into their advice to the public, before the pandemic got out of control. In Thailand during early February, a shortage of masks lasted about two weeks. By mid-February the country did not depend on imports from China, as companies and individuals stepped in to fill demand. By the end of February masks were abundant and cheap, and universally worn on the advice of health authorities. Had the USA achieved population mortality rates similar to Thailand or Taiwan, at least 100,000 American lives would have been saved.

The employees gave feedback to managers and directors that we felt it wasn’t going to create a healthy environment, but did they listen? No. If they wanted to retain a healthy environment for their employees, and still have an open floor design, why didn’t they opt for these walls? Would it have been too much “cleaning?” Or cost more money? Whatever their reason for removing the walls, we noticed an uptick of flu, colds, and sore throat cases.

You and I are datanauts, customer service reps, consultants, and writers. We too farm and harvest, produce and coordinate. Our crops are data, thoughts, words. We do not go to the office only to work but to keep at bay craven and unimaginative supervisors who need to always see us.

Of course not, because a balanced view of the labor market requires looking at employment as well as layoffs. Unfortunately the weekly data doesn't explicityly show people finding jobs.

But this can be inferred. Continuing claims, which shows the number of people receiving benefits reflects both people filing for new claims and those dropping off because they have found jobs (or whose benefits have expired which isn't relevant now for most people) is a more balanced figure. In the most recent week this number declined by 436,000, implying that considerably more people returned to their jobs, or found new ones, than filed for new claims.

2020-05-28 15:04,"The federal government decided to outsource disaster relief benefits to state unemployment agencies. Disaster naturally ensued. The conversation I had with an unemployed worker this week demonstrates the point.

The unemployment office regularly experiences two hour call wait times IF they even pick up the phone. Apparently, the UDI has been leaving the phone off the hook. You dial-in, enter your information, and the an automated system drops your call due to excessive wait times.

Presumably, this means the office has more calls waiting than they have hours in the day. But wait, things get more bizarre.

In addition to the double counting on regular insurance and pandemic insurance, unemployment is also double counting pandemic extensions. At least in this state, the unemployment office requires claimants to submit new claims in order to extend exhausted benefits. All of which is arbitrary in the first place because not everyone receives the same benefit schedule. Talk about a mess.

The US should have followed Canada. Grant a universal basic income. You can administer the program through the IRS. Once the crisis is over, you can claw-back undeserved transfer payments through the tax code. That would have been a much easier approach.

It's easy to say, ""A Democrat would have done much better,"" but we don't know what could have happened if someone else were president. That's just speculation. Since we have to rely on our flawed unemployment system, we ended the lockdown prematurely because people couldn't pay their bills on their tiny unemployment checks, none of which Trump caused. As for Trump's lies, those are totally his fault, but even his supporters are aware of that behavior, so listening to experts is the wisest course of action no matter what. 

Our deadlocked two party system renders us unable to vote for anyone but Republicans: hardcore Republicans and the diet moderate Republicans we call Democrats who are always infighting and not getting anything done.

2020-05-28 15:38,"Of course everyone wants the economy to restart. Trump's plan to open business regardless of the loosing battle against COVID is not the answer. Even if the doors of business open there are two other massive problems standing in the way. People will be scared to go back because of COVID fears that have only been exacerbated by the reckless behavior seen on Memorial Day weekend. 

Second, consumers are necessary to start the economy just as much as open business doors. With 1/4 of the workforce out of a job, the meager savings of most underpaid Americans that may have taken years to accumulate will have evaporated. Consumers are necessary to start the economy just as much as open business. Without a serious plan in place, it is more likely that mortgage foreclosures, homelessness, starvation and crime are likely to spike. 

The rebound of stock prices and blind optimism are unlikely to make a difference. Without a real and effective plan, Americans may be the proverbial lemmings racing off a cliff."

All wrong and iffy."

2020-05-28 17:08,"We need massive public protests by workers. The rich and their governments have declared war on working people. Undoubtedly there are well over 50 million unemployed in the US, and hundreds of millions around the world. Federal and state governments play every dirty trick in the book to hide the actual numbers and to deny assistance. Millions, if not tens of millions are being denied assistance based on immigration status and Kafkaesque rules intentionally designed by the bosses' government to deny eligibility. As tens of millions lack work, those with jobs are being forced to work harder and in unsafe conditions. Inevitably, bosses will seek to drive down wages, using the unemployment threat as leverage. The rich are making workers pay for their catastrophe, while Wall Street dances on massive profits provided them by Washington. The only thing they understand is fear. Working people must begin to protest, and strike to demand safety, jobs and assistance regardless of status as well as public works projects to provide employment at union wages building socially necessary housing, hospitals, day care and schools, not skyscrapers for billionaires. Employment and Assistance for All!"
2020-05-28 17:12,"Jobless numbers do tell the full story - if you look at the right jobless numbers. Unemployment claims do not predict the number of jobless, as this story points out. However, the monthly unemployment rate, as reported from Current Population Survey data, does count all the jobless, since a random sample of Americans are asked directly ""are you out of work and looking for work"" regardless of whether they have filed for or received unemployment benefits.

Shame on your reporter for not pointing this out."

I think this is misleadingly optimistic. Trump has made clear he has no interest in policy, or responding to the crisis, or anything but throwing mud on Twitter. So even if policy response was clear, we wouldn’t get it.

2020-05-28 19:16,"I graduated with my BA in 2008. In hopes that the job market would improve, I entered an MA program in elementary education at Columbia University. I graduated in 2010 to teacher hiring freezes across the nation. I accepted the only job I was offered, in a toxic work environment where I was harassed by the principal. The union could do nothing to protect me as a new teacher. After that I left elementary education to earn my PhD, which had been a dream of mine since college. My ultimate career goal is to teach full time at a community college. I finished my PhD last June. I was told to expect it to take at least 3 years to land the right fill time position. In the meantime the plan was to adjunct. I thought it would be easy to find adjunct positions. I got only one interview in my 2019 round of applications. My plan was to tutor here and there until I can reapply for next fall. Then COVID hit. Most of my tutoring students stopped studying with me months ago, and now with summer approaching I am down to teaching for 4 hours per week. It's looking likely that colleges will have to continue online in the fall, and that budget cuts to education are impending. Adjuncts will be laid off. I'm 34 and I delayed having a family for my career. I was planning to have my first child this year. It feels like for people my age, the world has conspired against us. Our elders hoarded the wealth they could and slammed the door behind them. We're the first downwardly mobile generation."
2020-05-28 19:22,"Let's say we never had a coronavirus pandemic... but suddenly, 40 million Americans lost their jobs due to a collapse on Wall Street, or a major financial crash somewhere in the world, or a downturn or recession that's made worse by global economic contagion fueled by high-speed financial trading algorithms and bots, like we witnessed in 2008-2010.

How long would it take the U.S. economy to re-create 40 MILLION new jobs?... Note that, even in good times, the U.S. has averaged about 190,000 new jobs per month since the 2008 crisis... that means it's going to take 210 months to return people to work.  That's a lot of unemployment benefits!!

What industries can we depend on to rapidly create new jobs at this kind of scale?... The WPA and its alphabet soup of related agencies hired 1 million people in a single month back in 1936.

Have we learned any lessons since the last time this happened, in 2008, which is not much more than a decade ago?

For jobs geeks like me, and especially those who believe millions of us are going back to work in the next 6 months, I highly recommend the visually impressive ""Chart Book:  The Legacy of the Great Recession,"" by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities -- <a href=""https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/chart-book-the-legacy-of-the-great-recession"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/chart-book-the-legacy-of-the-great-recession</a>"

2020-05-29 3:38,"We've now got over 40 million Americans laid off in 10 weeks and the stock market was up most of the day, so it's unhinged from economic reality.  I got $1200 for a bailout and airlines got $50 billion....which we'll all have to pay back with interest because it's borrowed.  Stocks were up today because of zero interest rates which falsify the value of anything bought with borrowed money...and plenty of stock is bought with borrowed money by hedge funds, investment banks and other big players.  Zero interest rates don't exist in the real world and are a destructive invention of central banks.  The price of borrowing money cannot be zero for capitalism to work properly because there must be a cost of capital.  Money is valuable so it has to have a price.  These are professional economists at the FED and know there should be price discovery to set the price of borrowed money, yet they manipulate the price and claim they're adding ""liquidity"".  When they artificially drive rates down to zero, they do it because government can then borrow more and make our debt Ponzi even bigger than it is at a low cost.  If zero interest rates really stimulated economies, Japan would have the fastest growing economy in the world because they've had zero rates for most of the last 20 years.  Instead Japan growth rate over that period is under 1% and it's been in recession for a lot of that time.  Our FED is causing a lot of inflation in bond, stock and real estate markets."

She was never even offered a desk, let alone any benefits.  Classes could be cancelled on a whim and at the last minute.  Now, all the millions of gig workers are scrambling to survive - to eat, to find shelter.
Meanwhile, the president golfs, and Congress manages to issue one $1200 lifeline.  I guess it's time to march on Washington again."

2020-05-28 15:39,"I graduated with my Master's this May and I am losing the part-time job I held during school in a few weeks. I have applied to so many jobs since February and no good news. Many places are on hiring freezes. I  hope I could qualify for benefits, I didn't make enough money to qualify under the 'traditional' unemployment regulations. 

I am so worried about how this will influence my future ability to build a life for myself. I am already older than most people who go to graduate school, and I went back to school because I thought it would open more doors, but this is truly throwing any previous life plans and goals out the window. 

The disadvantage faced by 2020 grads cannot be overstated. We are entering a competitive job market with no signs of employment getting back to what it was, the quality of our education plummeted as on-campus courses went online and professors struggled to adapt (instruction so bad in some of my technically intensive courses like statistics, I feel I have no shot to even apply for those jobs), research projects, publications and overall ""resume building achievements"" are now up in the air. 

I regret going back to school at all."
2020-05-28 13:22,It is going to get a lot worse. The airlines have a huge overcapacity and cannot layoff until Oct. 1st.  State and local governments will be forced to layoff a lot of people when tax revenues stay very low and there is no money to pay workers. Colleges will also be forced to cut when international students stay away and when these people who have lost their jobs cannot afford to send their kids back to college. Any why go into more debt to pay for college now? Makes no sense. Corporate America is just starting to lay-off white collar workers.  Where will these people go?
2020-05-29 14:23,"Every morning I watch out my window as essential workers drop off their children at the daycare center across the street from my Bronx apartment. I am always relieved to see they all seem to be doing very well. When my 3 year old granddaughter goes back to daycare one day, I hope she and all the other children are able to stay safe and healthy too."
2020-05-29 14:36,"Any single child day care needs to run fairly full to break even. If only half of the regular roster of kids are coming back with their parents paying only half the revenues of pre-COVID19, the day care itself will likely lose money. This is because the overhead of staff, rent, maintenance, utilities does not decrease or increase in proportion to the number of kids enrolled. It is comparable to hotels and airlines and movie theatres, volume is the key."
2020-05-29 14:42,"I’m glad I’m not in the heartbreaking position of trying to provide for a family and having to rely on childcare now. 

In the end, children don’t do social distancing.  The guidelines sound good, but the air in an enclosed space is still circulating and children are irrepressibly drawn to each other.

How, from the perspective of a virus, is this any different from all the families of the children and workers getting together every day to socialize?  

If one person in one family gets COVID-19, every family using that the daycare will be exposed, as will the workers and their families, possibly before anyone becomes ill."
2020-05-29 13:46,I would no more put my child in daycare than I would vote for trump. For the same reason. They would be unreasonable arbiters of what is safe.

I don't know how they expected to pull that off with children under two years old. She decided not to send her daughter. Apparently so did other parents, and perhaps teachers. The center will remain closed until fall. Don't know what will change until then...

And give me a break with the temperature checks. It provides nothing but a false sense of security. The most dangerous transmissions come from people who are asymptomatic. They don't have a fever."
2020-05-29 14:46,"My son was, and now my grandchildren are in day care.  I’m familiar with the daycare environment.  There is no “social separation” with 3 year olds.  Children will touch and hug one another.  Toys are handed from one child to another. You cannot tell a child not to touch the face.  The opportunity to spread the virus are manifold.   It cannot be prevented from being brought home.  To parents.  To grandparents. To the neighbors.  Parents are and should be anxious.

The “Happy Talking Heads” on cable business channels speak about the so-called “V” shaped recovery.  With working couples being normal, there will not be a recovery. “V” shaped or otherwise, absent a solution to this danger.  

And I cannot see a solution."

Thing is.. it's not the day care facility I worry about.. it is all the kids that enter the facility that would concern me as a parent.  I simply do not know if the other families are infection free (keep in mind the asymptomatic yet infected characteristics of this virus in some) or if they even practice good hygiene and social distancing. 

I feel badly for small businesses that operate on a model of close human contact.. which exemplifies what the daycare business is.   But.. safety first... because with this virus.. lives are at stake.  Not likely that many small children will suffer badly from the virus, but their parents, siblings, and particularly grand parents may in fact succumb to complications from the virus.  This IS serious. 

If the nation wants to get daycare back up and running, which very much is a factor in restarting the broader economy.. one would think that the white house would do more than just kicking the can down the road and declaring it the states challenge."
2020-05-29 16:36,"Some may not willing to take the risk of sending their children to Day Care Centers. Whereas in some cases, where both parents go for work, might be forced to send. But the main problem is to the owners of those Day Care Centers. They have to take utmost care than before in keeping the children healthy from the fear of corona virus."
2020-05-29 17:02,"We are not only in the middle of a pandemic but it has highlighted the class warfare that we have been in for many decades.

The rich (the haves) would not send their children as they can afford not to and have them taught on line and one parent can stay home, Whereas the poor folks (the have nots) would have no choice but to send their children to school as they have to go to work and need both paycheck to just survive.

It is a shame that human beings have to make these ugly choices and then we have a so called leader who is least concerned with over 100,000 deaths of Americans in the last 10 weeks. 
He wants the country to open so he can claim success in handling this pandemic for his election chances.
It is pathetic we live in this time in our history where the leader is so anti human."

Food for thought."
2020-05-29 16:53,People have to do what they have to do. It is absolutely unacceptable not to have childcare for essential workers. Figure out how to be safe and smart about it.
2020-05-30 12:22,My daughter is a 40 year old single parent with an energetic year old son in a pre-K day care class. She was hardly able to work adequately from home as the underpaid manager of a small business that had acquired a paycheck protection loan from the government. Her office reopened 3 weeks ago and her child returned to day care—one that had remained opened for children of first responders. There was no other viable option. Remember the single parents before suggesting a return to the “idyllic” stay-at-home mom era of the 50s!

Did you hear? The ignorant right caused this massive problem because they partially listened to Swedish scientists, who run a social democracy. Now we are told to ignore the Swedish model as a success because it’s a sore thumb on the left wing propaganda. 

Oh, the right-wing for sure is not made up of angels; we certainly know that but the left has outdone themselves this time with their fine ability to shed blame as if they were made of Teflon.

The only group which seems to have won is the big zentral banks financing (with hooks) the trillions of dollars which will be loaned out making even more countries of the world beholden to them.

Since then, they have been unable to make contact with the EDD office, to locate my application.

I also called the Governor's office, who told me that EDD applications for PUA assistance might wait several months before receiving benefits.

When FDR faced massive unemployment in the 1930's, he launched infrastructure projects to provide employment and build our roads. Trump seems to have no interest in anything other than his reelection and given that he's done nothing to stem unemployment, jobs (apparently) don't matter.  Fortunately, some conservative republicans are speaking out and decrying Trump's inept handling of this crisis. Whether that has any impact on Trump is yet to be observed. Trump is ""in over his head"" and has no clue how to manage this mess. He fired the competent people Obama hired and replaced them with toadies who fear to criticize anything he does.

The last election was about hatred, for immigrants, for minorities, for urban dwellers, for Jews and Muslims, for the educated, for scientists and other experts.  And now we see the result, depravity running through every agency and cabinet of the White House, total disregard--even derision--for those who are suffering.  While many Americans are doing their damnedest to help others with donations of money or masks or food, or prodding their reps in Congress to pass another relief bill, the Trumpites take pleasure in amplifying the avalanche of nasty tweets.  And their reps in Congress turn a blind eye to this pandemic and its consequences, propping up a failure of a president at every opportunity."

2020-05-28 17:31,"""Over 40 Million U.S. Workers Filed for Unemployment Benefits Since Start of Pandemic""

This is a plague unto itself, one that is going to bring us to our knees or finally free us from the bondage of the unjust economic system that we had built.  

There are no easy solutions here. Ask landlords not to charge rent? Then how do they survive? Tell restaurants to obey social distancing? Well, how do they make enough profit to pay their workers when the margin before the pandemic was razor-sharp? Send kids back to school? HOW when classrooms were already massively overcrowded and teachers overworked? 

Every time I think I spot a moment of hope or relief I push through to the practicality of *how* to make it happen and it vanishes. 

The virus is a disease that may have a cure, a relatively easy one in that it will be a matter of a concrete shot that bestows immunity. There are no easy solutions to the damage done to our economy.  It's going to take a massive, systemic, multi-pronged approach (meaning thousands of prongs) to rescue this nation. 

Absent robust, universal, and profound change, there is no coming back from this. Because those 40 million people out of work will be out of options. As Dickens and Shakespeare always knew, there is no entity more ferocious or dangerous than a mob with nothing to lose. 

That means all of our fates ride on doing the right thing and finding a way to remake an economy that works for everyone. Our fates are truly conjoined."

 January 22, speaking in Davos, Switzerland, Trump dismissed the virus: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control.”
 January 27, top White House aides met about the virus, with one warning that an outbreak could cost Trump his reelection.
On January 29, trade adviser Peter Navarro   memoed  that the virus could cause mass loss of life and economic destruction.
After a February 5 briefing,  Senator Chris Murphy Tweeted: “Bottom line: they aren’t taking this seriously enough. Notably, no request for ANY emergency funding, which is a big mistake. Local health systems need supplies, training, screening staff etc. And they need it now.”
 February 25, Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases warned that “disruption to everyday life may be severe” as a result of the virus. Trump was furious at Messonnier and did not recommend social distancing until March 16.

Also, in the USA, you don't have a free public health system so people who are touring there would need to take out private health insurance before going to the USA just in case they catch the virus and end up in hospital. Also, the more people filling up the hospitals with covid-19 also means that young and old people with serious illnesses such as cancer treatment are going to have their treatments and surgeries delayed because the hospitals are full of people with covid-19 so all the other surgeries etc will be delayed and could indirectly cause the death of young and old people with other illnesses.

A number that is only going to keep growing and surpass the 20% unemployment level  of the Great Depression.

Between the upcoming inevitable increase in Covid -19 cases due to Trumps insistence on 'Opening  Up The Economy' too early and without adequate testing , coupled with  an increasing  number of Americans joining the ranks of the unemployed , due to a failing economy .

""We have two covers this week. In most of our editions, as America records 100,000 deaths from covid-19, we ask how it has coped. Many Americans think their president has handled the epidemic disastrously, that their country has been hit uniquely hard and that there is a simple causal relationship between the two. This is not supported by the numbers. Or, at least, not yet. The official death rate in America is about the same as in the European Union. Overall, America has fared a bit worse than Switzerland and a bit better than the Netherlands, neither of which is a failed state. That is because America’s handling of the virus reflects its strengths, as well as its weaknesses—and in particular its devolved system of government.""

President Hoover was unprepared for the scope of the depression crisis, and his limited response did not begin to help the millions of Americans in need. Hoover was stubborn in his refusal to give “handouts,” as he saw direct government aid. He called for a spirit of volunteerism among America’s businesses, asking them to keep workers employed, and he exhorted the American people to tighten their belts and make do in the spirit of “rugged individualism.” "" And the result was a generation of starving and suffering Americans and Hoovervilles everywhere, even in Central Park.

For both people living with T1 and their loved ones, if they were to rely on the article to interpret this study for them, they could easily gain a terrifying, and inaccurate, impression of danger (especially parents of young children with T1 diabetes, as T1 is much more common in children than T2).
I would also ask that here, and in the future, when reporters cite things like association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease, they include which type of diabetes this is referring to (and preferably define ""many"", since, undefined, for anyone trying to assess risk, it is a meaningless term).

Why?

We know, and have known for months, that Corona is different from most viruses we've encountered so far in that it spreads not just asymptompatically but that the virus-load is highest just _before_ you show symptoms. Measuring the temperature and looking for other signs therefor is only good for one thing: to inform the colleagues etc. that they might have already been infected...

Sure, that's better than literally ""nothing"", but what we would need is something like a pregnancy test for Corona. In the morning you get out of bed, take a shower, take your 5-minute-corona-test, brush your teeth - (only after the test!), check your test, and if it says ""positive"" you call your employer, and the CDC, and 911, and whomever else it might concern (and get a swab-test to confirm).

This would require about 700 million tests per week, so anything complicated (blood, swabs, labs etc.) is out of the question. It would have to be something small, cheap and cheerful (well, as cheerful as one can make such a thing). Since we spread the virus through breathing a breathalyzer-type of design might work.

I don't have high hopes about a vaccine. Fauci can say what he wants (with Trump virtually looming over him), it won't be quick, and it's possible it won't work at all, at least for any useful amount of time. We need to adapt our society, or we risk destroying our civilization!"

This mess is the reality of what reagan and the republicans have been lying to you about free markets and small government. They never wanted a free market or a small government. Only no regulation of what they do to make money and to take away the protections you put in place for yourself so they could better exploit you. Which is what is happening right now. They will kill as many of you as you let them to go on making money and the slow creep of restricting your freedom.

You idiots complaining about rights and the out of sight out of mind crowd, would you sue the fire department for using their axes to get into your house to save you from a fire? For trespassing to do so? That is basically the same thing as what you are stupidly doing to protest. 
The republicans could have made it easy for all of us by actually shutting down the economy instead of what they did was to restrict your ability to work which is necessary to stop the spread, but allowed the ongoing bills and interest to keep on coming. Why? Because millions will lose a lot and they will reap the benefits of collecting the cars and evictions and the years of bad credit causing the victims to have to pay higher rates."

Now we have *25,000* *NEW* cases *every* *day* with high transmissibility for at least 2 or 3 weeks just counting after symptoms appear, 1500 deaths daily, and we're far - perhaps effectively infinitely far - from herd immunity.

Unlike the recent awful eruption in the PA House of Reps when GOP Rep Lewis tested positive for covid-19 and is accused of informing other GOP reps but not  Democratic reps, if the GOP convention takes place in person, its all GOP.

Economists have no idea what will happen with the economy, which admittedly sounds rather odd.

But there it is, and it's really nothing new.

Instead of wasting pixels quoting the speculation of clueless economists, it would be much more productive to explore ways to fundamentally restructure the economy for the 21st Century in the post-Covid era. 

And, given their track record, it's probably best to leave economists out of that discussion."

The tanking of the economy preceded the lockdowns. It started when investors panicked at Trump's chaotic response to news of a pandemic. 

Whatever the variables, there are two constants: Trump will make everything more difficult and Republican will go to the mats to profit on human and environmental wreckage.

2020-05-30 0:33,"This article reflects the American glorification of economists. (Europeans value their sociologists.) Economists are good about writing in abstract but not very good about grounding their work in reality.

Half of this article is about the abstraction of the U.S. economy and alphabet soup of its rebound.

But what is the economy exactly? No definition provided, other than a lot of measurable things.

A definition is helpful so we know what is being discussed.  

Here’s one pulled from the internet: An economy is a system of making and trading things of value. It is usually divided into goods (physical things) and services (things done by people). It assumes there is medium of exchange, which in the modern world is a system of finance (meaning, not a barter system).

The key words are making and trading.

Some of the measurable things in the article don’t make sense, e.g., Google mobility data of people visiting parks. Others are secondary variables: unemployment. Some are closer at getting to the idea of making and trading: output, mortgage applications, and business capital spending.

Let’s leave out the financial market in the discussion. That is a unique trading system with a set of players who do not reflect main street or many Americans."

2020-05-27 19:10,"My kids went to both public and private schools, including a private school in Seattle where Bill Gates sent two of his kids.  Private schools tend to spend a lot more per pupil than public, most of the students are from wealthy, accomplished families, that spend loads of money on auctions and other fund raisers to bolster what they already pay in tuition.  Having been on both sides of the divide, I can honestly say most Americans would be ready to start a revolution if they really knew the incredible advantages in resources these schools and families have.  Bail outs for private school?  I think not!"
2020-05-27 19:18,"My very progressive family has sent our kid to private schools most of the time. Here's our take:

1. Yes, there are some schools that spend more per capita that public schools. Those are for the elite. Many private schools spend less per capita than the public schools.

2. A surprising majority of the kids in non-elite private schools have issues that the public schools simply won't work with. In multiple school districts, for example, dyslexia does not exist and late readers aren't getting adequate support. 

Ditto for kids who used to be diagnosed with Asperger's, many of who were written out of the diagnostic code in the DSM 5 to appease the public schools and insurance companies, who now don't have to provide services.

Even if your kid manages to get a 504 or an IEP, they can't truly get the services they need.

These more affordable private schools are forgoing space and fancy amenities to offer small class sizes and flexibility so higher-needs kids can get the help they desperately need to ultimately succeed.

3. Private schools  are small businesses (well, most are non-profits). Like small businesses, they employ people, they pay rent or a mortgage on a space, they keep money circulating in a community. 

This is one of the rare things I agree with De Vos on."

They are also providing meals to the students that need it. Why should they have to give money needed to keep the schools going to smaller, privately financed schools that are asking for steep tuitions?

Please keep this in mind: There are a lot of kids who will be forced to leave the private schools that run on ultra-thin margins and end up closing. Where will they end up? Public schools. Public schools that need to social distance, which is harder with more kids.

So many schools are bursting at the seams. The last thing you want is to CLOSE schools.

As a society, we have to find ways to give quality educational opportunity to all students....if that means helping out private schools who are serving low to moderate income students, so be it.  I am not inferring that all private school are better than public schools, I am saying that in some communities the difference between them is astronomical.  We need to find ways to keep excellent schools, regardless of whether they are public or private, afloat....our country and communities are depending on this.
One more thought, when parents chooses to send a children to private school, often at great personal sacrifice, they continue to financially support public schools through the taxes they pay.

Would force public districts ""to support"" private schools.  Again assumes that the money was meant for the public districts only, and it is the districts' money in the first place.

""The wealthiest private schools"".  The author's language tends to suggest a class war.  Not to mention, the money going to the public schools is going to the wealthier and the less wealthy. Nobody is stopping that.

When it comes to money it is always convenient. Private schools do not take all students like public schools, they pick and choose so they can have the best students. Let them finance their schools from the exorbitant fees they charge"
2020-05-27 20:11,Do private schools share their profits with public schools? Private schools that are private businesses should get the same rescue funding that other private businesses get.
2020-05-27 20:13,"This all raises some interesting topics.

Democrats want to give money directly to those who need it- that way they can continue to pay rent, buy food and other stuff, and as well continue to pay local taxes that the schools need.  The downside to this is that companies may lay off workers when they don't absolutely have to knowing there is a social safety net.  As well, as has been noted anecdotally, if your unemployment benefit is more than you were making working, some are choosing to stay home- especially when your job exposes you to the ""maskless"" out there.

The Republican answer is filter the money through to the business so they can afford to keep paying employees and cover fixed costs of their operations- things that certainly benefit the capital holders of the world.  The downside to this is that it forestalls the ""market"" corrections that all of those ""free market republicans"" spout off about on Fox News.  Plus, a lot more expensive hands will touch the money before it gets to the people.   

Mrs. Devos is just towing the Republican line, making sure that private schools fixed costs are not lost in the shuffle.  In the end, if the private schools use most of the money to pay salaries, what is the difference to the Democratic plan other than increased overhead costs?    A lot of private school teachers are at the lower end of the salary scale anyway- a lot of them don't make the salary of public school teaches."
2020-05-27 19:54,"I'm a public school teacher. I attended public schools. 
May I ask what do private schools offer that public schools don't? Do they teach math different? 
Is there a superior English Language Arts curriculum? 
Can anyone name someone who has made that much of a difference by attending a private school? 
I feel for those special kids who might have to attend those horrible public schools. The agony they must be feeling.
Something else is at work here folks...follow the money. 
I would LOVE to hear from a private school teacher or a product of a private school and explain to me why you are better than the rest of us. Thank you."

2020-05-27 20:20,"Quote from the article: ""Private school groups say 30 percent of ​the​ families​ they serve have​ annual incomes below $75,000.""

In other words, 70 percent of ​the​ families​ of children attending private schools have​ annual incomes above $75,000.

For context: according to US Census Bureau data, the median household income in the USA in 2018 was $61,937, i.e. significantly below $75,000."
2020-05-27 20:13,"The reason those parents fled failing public schools was because the schools struggled due to lack of money. Now Betsy DeVos wants to give tax dollars to private schools? No way. The public school system is suffering as it is they should not share precious few dollars with rich private schools. Those public schools also provide needy students with breakfast and lunch, which we have come to see is urgently needed with children going hungry in America. I hope congress gets involved and fights this notion, which is just DeVos pushing her private agenda."
2020-05-27 20:17,"Each year the New York Times has a competition for Trump's worst cabinet member. Ms. DeVos was crowned the first winner, and on the strength of that she's still around (cabinet level positions under Trump have had an over 100% turnover, an all time record). Some readers protested. Competition was stiff. Many said that as Secretary of Education she could never do as much damage as the Secretaries of State and Defense. 
But she won because she tries harder. Don't believe her when she says she wants private schools to be treated like public schools. Before her appointment she said many times that she wants the public school system destroyed. As this article notes, she is eager to break the law that was passed, which the leadership from both parties in the education committees of both houses of Congress have said spells things out in plain language. Don't think the law is fair? Put what you want in the next COVID-19 relief bill and if it passes I will accept it. 
Let us remember that Ms. DeVos took an oath to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"". That Constitution says no money may be spent except as authorized by Congress. But she doesn't care a fig about violating the Constitution, does she? President Trump store to ""see that the laws are faithfully executed"", which the Constitution says is his duty. Shouldn't he discipline her scofflaw actions?"
2020-05-27 19:55,"Mrs. DeVos is strongly against public school education. Why? Because she and her wealthy family are big backers of christian schools that have a very specific, very rigid agenda that they want to promote. It is based on ""bible family values"" and, if you look at their worst ideas, they are extremely repressive and narrow. Since private schools charge money and public education is free, forcing public schools to give money to private schools is for one reason and one reason only and that is to cripple public schools as much as possible. She can't close them down, but she would if she could. The idea that poor students need help is against their idea that the ""best"" people are rich and should control things. (Social Darwinism). You can find this out on your own if you read enough, but it's not widely publicized. It is always couched in socially acceptable terms that are absolutely legal and look good to a casual observer. 

Many narrowly focused religious groups are for creationism, against environmental intervention, anti-science, anti-minority and are interested in controlling a child's education from pre-K until after college. If you do not know this (and most do not) it is important to understand that the Sec. of Education is AGAINST public education!! They want to control the kids' minds and they are not alone (all kinds of religions have extreme versions). Please read about this so you are informed and stand up for public schools and public school teachers and standards."
2020-05-27 20:15,"Families who send their kids to private schools are paying up to $50,000 and more for yearly tuition per child.  On top of that, they're ""encouraged"" to donate tens of thousands more to the school's endowment.  How 'bout the private schools just ask an itty-bitty bit more - like, maybe, another $10,000 - and leave the rescue funds to the public schools to be extravagances such as, oh, let's say, pencils, and chalk, and a book or two.  I swear, this woman makes Trump look like a Rhodes scholar."
2020-05-27 20:16,"Betsy DeVos is / never cared for public education.  She pays token statements to educate the poor but truth be told, she doesn't care about anyone but the rich -- and, of course, enriching herself (as she profits from privatized schools herself).

Her position is just another move to shutter public schools and privatize education, to ensure those who are wealthy are educated and, as far as she is concerned, all other students who can't afford private school ... are on their own in the now ... ever more poorly funded public school.

DeVos, as are all Trump admin appointees, there to destroy the agencies and functions they supposedly are there to run."
2020-05-27 20:22,"“most Americans would be ready to start a revolution if they really knew the incredible advantages.....”.  I wish that were true.  However, the public-private divide has been known to Americans for decades, yet many seem to accept it out of some distorted belief in meritocracy and irrational fear of government.   When the dust settles, if it ever does, the public will learn just how much of US aid during this crisis ended up in the hands of those who did not need it - large companies, executives and private institutions. 2008 redux, but far worse."
2020-05-27 19:57,"I'm sorry, but if your ""private"" school needs public funds  to improve the quality of the education it provides or survive a crisis like the one in which the entire planet is currently embroiled or otherwise operate in any way, I've got news for you: it's not actually a private school. 

So by all means, allow these institutions to share in grants, congressional allotments, and other fiscal assistance meant for public schools. If they do, however, understand why myself and others like me expect those ""private"" schools to then adhere to the same ground rules under which public schools must operate. No promoting of religion or favoring certain religions over others, no discrimination based on religion, no class time devoted to malarkey like intelligent design or young earth creationism, no ten commandments posted in school hallways or crosses on school grounds, no mandated yarmulkes or hijabs (though students should always be able to wear such religious attire by choice), and no priests, rabbis, or imams playacting as principals, deans, headmasters/mistresses, or other professional educators.

It should be impossible to operate a private school, particularly one grounded in a particular religious faith, using public funds. That the pandemic is being used as an opportunity to attack or weaken that obvious and vitally important separation of church and state is a travesty."
2020-05-27 20:09,"This is outrageous.

The job of the government is to support and promote PUBLIC schools that are open to everyone. Period. There is no justification for support of those who choose to forgo the PUBLIC education freely available to them because they are wealthy enough and/or because they don't trust what is taught to public school children. The idea of supporting non-public schools is particularly offensive when religion is involved, as it is in most cases."

2020-05-27 20:08,"You may not understand my remarks, but you should know I'm a Catholic. I'm over here in Pennsylvania with a solid religious ethos everywhere. I'm happy to see so many denominations as one. The Democrat Attorney General here has expressed a hatred of Catholic Priests that was an exhibition of pure hate filled rhetoric on the Newshour as he discussed his far reaching investigation of sex abuse by clergy going back 70 years. Yeah, that's right, 70 years.  That's not an investigation. It's an inquisition, even of the dead and a political attack on those who stand out above all the thieves and criminals of society. But it's crazy over here. On Thanksgiving, I heard a woman yell out ""He's a Beast"". That's right. I'm not fully confident religious schools can keep people sane and from hurting others. Therein lies the wisdom of the founders who insisted on separation of Church and state. It's all too clear to me why. From the lynch mobs still searching for Witches and Warlocks, Devils and Demons to Republicans putting forth the insanity of the end of the world, the nation has gone nuts and I got caught up in it. So everyone should be concerned how the truly evil Republican party is pandering to every possible faith in America, only to appear good."

I choose a private school for my child  with a religious affiliation -Episcopal- because it aligned with our values. That was my choice to seek a school where religion was part of the culture and curriculum.  It is not a choice that should be supported with tax payer money.
2020-05-27 19:33,"Public schools are funded with public money and serve the public.  Private schools are funded with private money and serve their customers.  Whether these schools have a religious foundation or not is besides the point.  Private schools are not under the control of public entities.

Our public school system is fundamental to our democratic society.  They have been under tremendous pressure from charter schools.  Now this.  Take more money away from them and funnel it to private schools.

If this goes through, then these private schools must be charted to the public school system and placed under public control."
2020-05-27 19:23,"When private schools accept all students regardless of income, regardless of background, regardless of their family, then we can talk about getting public money.  Until then, no.

That's the kind of the thing we learn in public schools."

2020-05-27 20:27,"Sigh.  Let's not try to divert money intended for public education (doing so could very well be illegal).  Why not use the U.S. Department of Education as a force for good, rather than division? Interest in gap year programs for 2020 high school graduates is apparently through the roof.  How about using a tiny bit of the funding on developing a gap year public school internship program?  The program could place recent high school graduates in the public schools as aides/trainees who can help overburdened teachers while learning about education and determining if they have interest in pursuing a teaching career?"
2020-05-27 19:27,"I grew up attending public schools many years ago. My elementary school permitted students of Roman Catholic faith to leave once each week for a few hours and attend religious instruction at the Catholic school in the neighborhood. Betsy DeVos and her push to have my tax dollars go to faith based and/or private schools punishes the majority of children in our country who need or choose public education. Punishing the majority is undemocratic. Many private schools have non-profit status and faith based schools pay no property taxes to their local governments. DeVos is becoming a ""one trick pony."""
2020-05-27 20:28,"(1) What does the law actually say?

(2) With the previous discussions indicating that public schools use public finding and private schools use private funding, one must keep in mind that many private/religious schools also take advantage of public money via transportation costs (and maybe other expenditures).

(3) Also, to be fair, private school parents do, as far as I know, pay public school property taxes, at least in my state."
2020-05-27 20:33,"If a private school goes under, it's unfortunate, but the students there can then enroll in their local public school.  

If public schools are starved of funds authorized to them by congress, b/c they've been ordered to divert funds to prop up a private institution, then local and state taxing authorities have to raise taxes in order to effectively subsidize the private institution. 

Sorry Betsy, that doesn't pass the smell test.  Here's an idea: if the private school is struggling financially, raise tuition, or lower teacher or admin salaries, or scale back the plans for the new field house, or hit up some rich alums, etc. etc."
2020-05-27 20:34,"""Private, "" for want of a better word, means ""private.""

2020-05-27 20:28,"My folks sent all nine of their kids to Catholic grade school.  It was not cheap - ever!  Besides the tuition, there were uniforms and books to buy.  My mother was a wonderful seamstress so she was able to make our uniforms from scratch although the color of the material was just off enough that it was noticeable.  And of course we had used text books instead of new, so we all got picked on for being poor.

We also stayed after school and helped out with the janitorial duties like moping the dang classroom floors, washing the chalk boards, and taking out the trash.  the money we made went towards our tuition.

I hated grade school and except for one teacher, the rest were not very nice.  I can't recall how many times I had to skip recess and stand in the corner, balancing a pink eraser on the bridge of my nose.

The bottom line was that my parents never regretted sending us to this Catholic grade school and I never found the education rewarding, warm or helpful.  

I grew up to be a pretty crumby Catholic but I am a pretty darn good Christian.

I do understand why parents want their kids to get a faith-based education.  But my real education came in observing people and being mindful of the hypocrisy and double standards that occur.  

From all the bad and cruel things I was subjected to in grade school, I learned to be more forgiving, compassionate and caring about those who were also in pain and subjected to such mean and cruel behavior by others."
2020-05-27 20:31,"Why?  If she's so concerned about her beloved private schools, why not donate some money to them instead of flogging the US taxpayer for support for her own agenda?  

Public schools are for the public good, and public funding should only be directed to them.  Private schools have scads of wealthy donors to tap for help, and if they're facing ruin as De Vos claims, well, they should go under.

Every child in the US is guaranteed a public, not private or religious education."

If religious schools need funding they can pray for it - especially since they pay no taxes and thus should never receive ANY tax-money or resources - that would be the definition of wrong and unfair.

Private schools should have to resort to their endowments first before getting public funds. Besides, public schooling serves ALL regardless of religious affiliations or financial status, and have been systematically starved of funding for decades - unlike private institutions which have more resources."

2020-05-27 20:46,"Putting aside all the rich kids attending top prep schools (ex: DeVos's entire family), some will argue that there are also private schools providing an alternative for kids in struggling, underfunded public schools. But using public money to build up those schools only makes the problem worse for the struggling public school. If things get worse at the public school, more parents will want their kids (and their tax dollars) to go to the private school, and the situation will get worse. There will be more demand for private schools, and soon the entire education system is privatized, and out tax dollars will be subsidizing religious private education on a grand scale.

The Republican party should hang their heads in disgrace in confirming this elitist who shills for ""for profit"" schools that rip off the government and our veterans.  Why should private schools receive public funding when they are exempt from state regulation and can teach whatever they want?"
2020-05-27 20:47,"#45 and his ENTIRE cabinet are thieves and evil actors. That our elected ""officials"" enable their divisive and corrosive behaviors is on We The People, not on the mafia cabinet."

2020-05-27 20:30,"Don't forget the funding for the private security forces for the gated communities!! Simply because people don't want to be part of the community doesn't mean they shouldn't get funds from the community,  if the community is stupid enough to allow it.... which it seems we are."

2020-05-27 20:46,Can someone get DeVos a copy of the Constitution?
2020-05-27 20:54,"""Fifty percent of the school’s operational revenue comes from a corporate work-study program that could be affected by the economic fallout from the pandemic. Companies employ students in entry-level jobs, and students assign their wages to their tuition.

“They’re literally earning their education at age 14, which is remarkable in itself,”...""  Sounds like child labor to me."
2020-05-27 20:56,"If they take the public dollars, then they should be subject to the same regulations as all other public schools. Seen from another perspective, the private schools are asking to have their cake and eat it too."
2020-05-27 20:57,"Since private schools are businesses, don't they get the same help as other businesses during these hard times? And as with a business in a capitalist system, you may fail with few customers. With Catholic high school at least 15K per year, and no guarantee at all of in-person instruction, many students are opting for public school. I don't want my tax money meant for public school to bail out a religious institution. 
Does DeVos propose that wealthy private schools share their largesse with the low-income public schools in the poorer neighborhood a few miles away? It's only fair."
2020-05-27 21:19,"If private schools want access to public funding they should be held to the same requirements in terms of discrimination and curriculum standards.

Also - as others have pointed out - private schools have access to private loan programs and can borrow in a way that public schools cannot."
2020-05-27 20:31,"As the parent of a student in Jewish day school, I understand the challenges that private and parochial schools are facing--but the leadership of Agudath notwithstanding, there is no 'right' to use public funds for religious education.  Sorry, it's a lifestyle choice we just have to eat.  It's appalling that this disgusting woman believes that she's entitled to call the shots on a well-established principle of separation of church and state.  NO tax dollars for religious schools!"
2020-05-27 21:37,"This is a no brainer. Parents who send our kids to private schools also pay public school taxes.  We don't get any rebates, so we are in effect paying double. It's only fair that our tax dollars get distributed to private schools as well."
2020-05-27 21:41,"The US Constitution is clear - the state cannot support religion. Religious schools should not receive a single penny of government support. Private secular schools that serve low-income students deserve support, but religious schools should not be part of this program."
2020-05-27 21:43,"My children (2 boys) went to Catholic and independent schools for their entire education until college.  Although it was expensive, and we had to forgo certain items, (and not put tuition into our savings) it was worth every penny.

My sons graduated public college and are pursuing master's degrees.  They have good, professional jobs and are part of the strong middle class.

That said, I strongly believe in the separation of church and state and do not want any federal dollars to go toward private schools.

Additionally, not all parochial/private schools are swimming in money.  The staff are paid less than public schools and retirement benefits are not nearly like public schools teachers."
2020-05-27 21:51,"No.  Just no.

Private schools do not merit ""bailing out"" by our public schools.  We pay taxes for public schools, and everyone who sends their children to private school has the option to do the same with their children.

Unless public schools are going to follow the same curriculum, employ LGBT staff and faculty, and contribute to state retirement programs, just no."
2020-05-27 21:51,"My parents sacrificed to send my brother and I through parochial schools kindergarten thru high school graduation.  That was their choice.  They did this while we lived in Fairfax County, Va, at the time, one of the very best school systems in the country.  Again, their choice.  I find it appalling how, since GW Bush's administration, my tax dollars have gone down a slippery slope to where we now have to support activist religious institutions that was once considered unconstitutional.  At some point, the intrusion of religion into our private lives and pocketbooks will receive the backlash it deserves.  Hopefully it will come in the form of taxes."
2020-05-27 20:54,"Mark my words: This is why you don't want the federal government running everything.  Outside of Constitutional matters, the federal government has no business injecting itself into local affairs.  That is the job of the states.  Be careful what you wish for ... if you are able.

Our government cannot depend on being run by people of goodwill who we agree with."
2020-05-27 21:00,"""A range of education officials say Ms. DeVos’s guidance would divert millions of dollars from disadvantaged students and force districts starved of tax revenues during an economic crisis to support even the wealthiest private schools.""

2020-05-27 21:29,"Public school superintendents can simply utilize the frustrating legal strategy that the Trump Administration has been using throughout its litigious existence. Force DeVos to sue, then delay, delay, and delay some more, if necessary, through endless appeals. When a Democratic Administration replaces the present corrupt one, promptly withdraw the original cause of action."
2020-05-27 21:49,"The agenda is clear, bring public funding to private corporations.

It's the GOP plan, plain and simple."
2020-05-27 21:51,"And so it begins.
Decades ago powerful private school lobbies (and most of our politicians attended private schools!) and loud religious groups secured federal funding here in Australia. ""Choice!"" was the catch cry.
Fast-forward to today, the private funding growth dwarfs public money. Most disadvantaged and disabled kids attend public schools. They lack resources, do not harvest fees and have few megaphone, letter-writing parents. Their buildings are crumbling. So... parents are voting with their feet- taking out loans to send their kiddies to ""better"" schools.
America, welcome to the world of the two-tiered education system!"
2020-05-27 20:56,Public funds are used for the well being of the public.  The constitution says separation of church and state; I am sure she is not supporting non Christians.  Remember when being a Catholic was not acceptable for a president?
2020-05-27 20:59,"First, we pretty consistently underfund public schools, particularly in poorer neighborhoods. Next, we pay taxes to support public education, and most of these taxes are local and state. (Only 8% of K-12 funding comes from the feds.)

Private schools are more than welcome to coexist, but they have no claim to public funds beyond general infrastructure like clean water, functional streets, fire and police depts, etc. 

Betsy DeVos wants to marginalize pubic education in favor of religious and private schools, the better to indoctrinate America's students in proper values and citizenship as she sees it. 

I don't have an issue with some federal funds going to bail out private schools, but it should mostly come earmarked via the legislative process. Otherwise, states and locales should have the discretion to distribute federal relief funds as they feel is best. Again, their first educational priority is to adequately fund public schools."
2020-05-27 21:10,"Private Schools better be careful what they wish for.  When Uncle Sam gives money he makes demands. Are they willing to play by the same rules as public schools. Will they take everyone who wants to enroll? Will teachers be required to be credentialed? Will special education services be provided? Will these these  schools teach the parts of the state curriculum that conflict with their religious beliefs? Will boys and girls be treated equally?  These are all things required of public schools. If you want the governments money, than you have to put up with the governments  rules

. The  price of public funding is providing education to all in a non-religious manner. If you can't handle those standards than look some place else for money."
2020-05-27 21:51,"Look at schools, the post office, public lands. The GOP wants to turn all of these institutions operated in the public interest into commercial ventures.   Their model is the health care insurance industry and the result is those that have, get, and those that don't have, don't get.  Meanwhile an oligarch sits at the top and gets rich."
2020-05-27 20:45,Hold on.  Those parents who enroll their children in private schools still pay taxes which go to fund public schools.  Giving private schools their fair share of the tax revenues is only right.
2020-05-27 21:02,"There are school districts in Oklahoma that can't afford to run their school buses five days a week. There were a few schools that didn't turn on heat last winter because they couldn't afford it. There are schools in fairly prosperous towns in Oklahoma that do not send textbooks home with students because they don't have enough to go around.

Public schools are underfunded all over the country, and DeVos wants them to give away their aid."
2020-05-27 21:03,"Weren't Catholic schools in court last week saying that all their staff falls under a ""ministerial exception"" when it comes to employment protections  - asserting that religious institutions have the sole right to determine who can act as their ministers.  And don't they argue against providing birth control benefits to their employees because they are religious institutions.  Yet now, when it comes to getting taxpayer money, they assert they are quasi-public institutions because of the student population they serve.  It's one or the other, isn't it?"
2020-05-27 21:28,"Private schools should certainly be entitled to any relief available to other *businesses*, since that’s what they are. So for example, the PPP loan administered through the Small Business Administration.

Otherwise, too bad. Sorry your business is hurting — a lot of them are right now."
2020-05-27 21:43,"I usually support aid for private schools, but in this case, each of  those schools could have gotten a Payroll Protection loan (a grant to cover 8 weeks payroll). Something not available to public school distrcits. There are resources.."
2020-05-27 21:51,"Seems like the answer would be to fund public schools well. Then we wouldn’t be in this mess. The primary reason for private schools is segregation. Maybe, just maybe, it makes sense at this time of crisis to let them fail and restore public schools."
2020-05-27 21:12,"I, and all my siblings, went to parochial school 1st through 12th grades.  My parents  knew our school received no public funding, but they wanted us to get the best and well rounded education available with learning about our faith at the same time.  

They didn't complain about having to pay taxes for public schools because that is what good citizens do and we received the benefit of having a large public library.  

In the last few years I was in school, parochial schools did receive some federal aid in the form of dairy products -- milk, butter and cheese.  

It has been shown that the schools DeVos champions have very low success rates."
2020-05-27 21:33,"My kids went to an expensive grade school, then a public high school.  The education at the public school was top notch and the kids at least as well behaved as the wealthier private school students.  The education at the public high school was top-notch.  There were some excellent teachers in the public school.  Betsy DeVos is going down the wrong road."
2020-05-27 21:54,I certainly believe that our state needs to ignore this directive.  Public tax money should go to public schools which are governed by elected school boards. All children in the district are entitled to a public education. - if their parents choose to enroll them elsewhere they may but they then need to assume the financial responsibility.
2020-05-27 21:54,"There is a deep irony here in that even most of our public schools are funded by local taxes and, of course, we all know that people live with others in more or less the same economic level.  Even when schools are paid for by state money schools that serve poorer communities get less.  

In NY State not so many years ago the state lost a huge court case wherein we saw how over the course of decades certain areas had routinely been short-changed because of the percentage of poor students.  They promised up and down that they were going to redo the rules by which the money was doled out to districts.  They made adjustments but still under funded these areas and were taken to court again!  Frankly, to this day I don’t believe that a fair reassessment was made to these schools.
So, even if your state pays for local public schools I would not hold my breath that the monies are handed out in an even handed fashion.  

And remember: even when every district gets the same amount of money students in wealthier areas continue to benefit from a family’s higher than average income and the availability of purchasing extra curriculum experiences and books etc. Public funding of education supplies a floor but it shouldn’t be a basement."
2020-05-27 20:48,"Again, DeVos is looking to fund Sunday schools everyday with tax payer money. Sorry, but tax money should never be used to subsidize the indoctrination of children.

If religious schools need funding caused by an act of God they can pray for it - especially given they pay no taxes and thus should never receive ANY tax-payer money or resources - that would be the definition of freeloading and is considered unfair in America. That would be like getting an insurance benefit without ever paying an insurance premium.

Private schools should have to resort to dipping into their endowments first before getting public funds. Besides, public schooling serves ALL without discrimination and regardless of religious affiliations or financial status, and have been systematically starved of funding for decades - unlike private institutions which have more resources - especially from the elites like DeVos, who have received trillions in free money from society and the future generations now in school, as they evade paying taxes now looking for yet another tax payer handout for their kids education of privilege."
2020-05-27 20:53,Private schools (particularly religious ones) don’t pay income tax as far as I know. They shouldn’t be entitled to any funding from our government.
2020-05-27 20:54,"My tax dollars should not be funding private schools. Period. 
My tax dollars should never fund a private, religious school, ever."
2020-05-27 21:04,Public subsidies for private interests? Why is anyone surprised that yet another Republican (with a background that suggests a clear conflict of interest) wants to carry on the practice...
2020-05-27 21:07,"Another unqualified Trump appointee put in place at the behest of right-wing groups who don’t believe in education for all students, just the ones who belong to special groups by belief, color or income level.  She should be first out the door when the change in administration happens and a secretary of education take her place, one who actually is able to help make American public education one of the best systems in the world.  The wheel doesn’t have to be reinvented, it just needs competent guidance."
2020-05-27 21:22,I do not want my tax dollars spent on religious schools or prep schools PERIOD!  Isn’t there something we can do to stop this travesty?  I sure hope so. Maybe it is time for a tax strike.

At least I hope and pray daily for this."
2020-05-27 21:10,"Public education is supposed to level the playing field. To mitigate some of the undeserved disadvantages so many struggle under. Think of the contributions to America by students from immigrant and working poor families who have repaid over and again our investments in their education? 

DeVos is perverting government by using public education funds to perpetuate the unearned advantages of privileged students. Of course she is. It's the Republican way."
2020-05-27 21:36,"Most of the private schools are religious one way or another.  The US is a secular country, we should keep it that way."
2020-05-27 21:37,"Private schools are private for a multitude of reasons, social standing, religion, racism, etc. I know that the Catholic schools in my area don't offer special education and so they send their students to the public special education teachers. Their education in general seems to be sub-par with public education, as they rely on old methods of teaching. So the only reason they exist is so that Catholic families don't have to mix with non-Catholics and they have the option of dismissing students who don't qualify to their standards of admission. Another difference is that public schools (outside of wealthy neighborhoods) don't have the easy access to IVY league colleges and they don't prep their students for higher education in the way that private schools do. If they want to share in public funding, then they should send their kids to public schools, and the kids will be better for it. They will have to actually mix with all religions and all races and kids of various economic standing. They pay the same taxes that public school parents do, but so what? It's their option to send their kids to public school. Apparently they have the money. Don't expect hand-outs from middle class and poor families. But that seems to be a Trump standard."
2020-05-27 21:28,"More of the same-old, same-old from this white supremacist regime. Private schools originally cultivated the wealthy and their children, but really began to take off in the wake of Brown v Board of Education. Parents willing and able to pay for private schools were able to use them to evade the ""horrors"" of integrated schools. And the more recent development of private school vouchers is mainly a way of impoverishing the public school system in favor of private schools. Essentially enabling those inclined to avoid integrated schools, to do so at taxpayer expense.

These are broad strokes of course. Not every private school and certainly not every private school parent chooses private schools as an end-run around integration. But I believe this is indeed the overall situation."
2020-05-27 21:35,"Let private schools apply for business loans, since businesses are what they are."
2020-05-27 20:53,"Wow, Betsy, what a crusader you are!

Of course, since the financial boundaries of the public and private schools would be porous, that means that private schools that are fiscally stronger than nearby publics would share their money too, right? 

Oh, and that also means that private schools will have to play by the same rules that public schools do, and accept everyone, even students who lower your precious test scores? They'd teach the same curricula to the same students, I'd assume, if they were getting public funding for it--teaching creation is a big no-no with federal bucks. 

Well, that's osmosis for you. Something we learn about in science classes."

This backwards Robin Hood style of government is the Republican way. Socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor."
2020-05-27 20:48,"Let me see if I've got this straight:

Religious schools and the churches/synagogues/mosques, etc. establishing them are tax-exempt entities that pay no taxes.

Private schools are in most cases also tax-exempt entities that pay no taxes and, more importantly, select who can and cannot attend their institutions.

Public schools are funded by the taxpayer and basically must enroll any student who lives in the community it serves.

The CARES Act is funded by the taxpayer.

DeVos is attempting to force CARES Act funds to be diverted from public schools to religious/private entities that pay no taxes and have no obligation to educate a child who wants to attend its school."
2020-05-27 20:45,"It would be a gross misuse of taxpayer money to give funds to private schools. Every penny would take away from the vast number of public school students. Whether they pay 100% or not of the tuition, the families' of private school students have avantages unequal to their sublic school peers.  Instead of furthering the distance betweent he have mores and the have less, lets work on giving all children, an equal, quality education.

2020-05-27 21:27,Apparent;y the private option is not all that popular with taxpaying parents who have their kids in schools. Doesn't the marketplace mean we must  let them fail?
2020-05-27 21:09,"It's amazing how quickly the words, ""share"" and ""equality"" come out of Ms DeVos' mouth when the purse strings are opened.  Suddenly, we're all one big happy commune.  

She says, “The CARES Act is a special... appropriation to benefit all American students... There is nothing in the act suggesting Congress intended to discriminate between children based on public or nonpublic school...""

Sounds good!  And Congress didn't intend to discriminate when it comes to the quality in education between public or nonpublic schools.  But DeVos has spent years doing just that: discriminating between public and private schools by starving public schools of funds.  She’s tried to defund and dismantle public education and make it harder to help kids in public education.  She's created two tiers of education.

But now she thinks we should share?"
2020-05-27 21:14,"Betsy DeVos wants to do nothing except reduce already shrinking government support for public education. 

There is no better way to reduce important federal agencies to smoldering remains than to appoint as their chiefs incompetent, right wing extremists.  Under Steve Bannon's ""deconstruction of government"" scheme, Trump only selected Cabinet chiefs that have personal agendas against serving the public interest while they destroy the agencies they are supposed to be leading. 

Betsy Devos, Wilbur Ross, Ben Carson, Rick Perry, Steven Mnuchin, Ryan Zinke, Mike Pompeo - the list of the actors that have joined Trump’s Circus - many of whom have already departed-. goes on and on."
2020-05-27 21:26,"Suddenly everyone thinks the public school system in this country is so great. The richest public school districts in this country don't use better teaching methods than the poorer ones, they still teach the one-size-fits-all curriculum to the same standardized tests. You aren't doing kids any favors fighting for our conventional education system, don't bother. Why don't you just put them in jails, they won't know the difference."
2020-05-27 20:58,"The aid should be income-based. Wealthy kids, whatever schools they attend don’t need it.  Poorer kids — including those at Catholic and other private schools, do. It’s not the school you attend, it’s your financial need."

A semantic “union” that is part of an ongoing revised history transmitted through misinforming semantic surrealism. 
So the “Secy of Educ,” in a nation which does not have a national education system, enabled to develop sustainable levels of equitable, quality education for ALL, is concerned about private schools not sharing public funds, with public schools. The latter, in diverse urban, inner-city, suburban and rural areas and environments which range in types, levels and qualities of “education.” Do the private schools,religious and secular, also want to share the public’s state of diverse, adequately educated, teaching, athletic staff;effective administrators as well as necessary “wellbeing/health staff? Or whether or not the schools sites are safe and conducive for learning? Including arriving in school, and then back home safely?
As this “sharing” is being raised, perhaps the time is ripe to examine “teaching” which all too often suffers from “educational malpractice.” Inadequately preparing both “drop-outs” and “completers” with needed skills to discern Facts from Fictions.To gather valid generalizable information and create necessary understanding to effectively cope in,adapt against and function to change a nation’s toxic,WE-THEY daily violating!"

Another dull-witted, obsequious grifter happily strip-mining an already grossly insufficient public endowment for use by incorporated private (or religious, Constitutionally barred) entities.  It ought to enrage everyone in this country, no matter what their background or income level, with any sense of basic fair play, much less justice in its larger sense.  That the administration is using the cover of an epically bungled health crisis to further strip low-income people of basic resources is an act of sociopathic contempt.

2020-05-27 20:51,"Public school funding should be a concern to every community; not only is a solid education system the foundation of a successful republican system, but it also maintains social stability.  And because taxpayers provide the money, they have a say in curriculum, through a school board.  Ultimately, public school are responsible to their communities.  That is good.
Private school‘s accepting public funds, which is what DeVos and her supporters are advocating, will inevitably lead to taxpayers wanting a say, some control, over the “private” institutions that accept the money.  I suspect those leaders of Catholic and Jewish school will not welcome that.
DeVos is penny wise, pound foolish.  She sees privates school in financial trouble, and that is bad.  They serve a very important purpose.  But tethering them to public funds will ironically knee-cap their effectiveness in the future.  Public money begets public control."
2020-05-27 21:53,"We all remember how de Vos ""qualified"" to be secretary of education, right? Private schools are literally her family business, and they have made her family very rich. Her latest push is nothing short of embezzlement, taking the public school funding and emptying it into her own pocket. It is exactly the same tactic that president rump took in seeking bailout money for his various businesses. This is precisely why rump and his entire administration came to Washington: theft."

I am proud that our Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction has so far resisted Devos's seditious move. This funding of 3 separate school systems was never approved by voters.

2020-05-27 22:18,"I'm all for diversity, especially in education.  However, I'm at a loss to understand why my tax dollars should go to assist a private school, especially if the school in religious in nature.  ""The first amendment to the US Constitution states ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" The two parts, known as the ""establishment clause"" and the ""free exercise clause"" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the ""separation of church and state"" doctrine.  Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America's doctrine for church-state separation: no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one's will, and religious liberty encompasses all religions. In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, and support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary.""  Normally, I'm not a big advocate of litigation. In this case, I hope that someone starts litigation to stop this."
2020-05-27 22:19,"We all know that Betsy hates public schools, and this is just a smokescreen for not having to address the elephant in the room: most public schools are sure to lose funding due to parents opting to keep their children at home in the event that the physical buildings reopen before a vaccine. 

Public schools receive federal funding based on number of pupils. Let’s say an elementary school in a public district in Alabama has 250 kids. If 10 percent of kids have parents who decide that they’d rather homeschool than rely upon the district to make wise decisions regarding opening, this school will lose funding for 25 kids. This almost certainly results in the loss of at least one instructional position. Are public schools planning for this? Is Betsy?

My question for Betsy is, will public schools still allow kids to learn from home in the event that a state/district opts to reopen the school buildings? Or will this child be required to attend school in person? Many parents want to know the answer to this because they’d rather homeschool than risk it.

Perhaps if Betsy would elaborate on whether or not public schools have a workable plan in place to keep children and their families safe, then we’d be able to more accurately judge her stance on relieving the private schools. Public schools come first, Bets. What’s the game plan?"
2020-05-27 22:03,"Separation of church and state.

Why put money into private schools now that will start closing down next year after losing their public aid support?

Americans are already faced with a huge monetary deficit. There will be cuts along with tax hikes for the wealthy and corporations who do not pay their way as of now.

It educates people who vote. The public elects school boards to approve the curriculum, hire the teachers, create extra curricular activities, and supervise the work. When children from different economic and cultural backgrounds attend the same public schools, there is greater diversity in the classroom and better support for schools in the community. While the United States does not prohibit private schools created to serve wealthy elite families, religious groups, or other subgroups, we do not use taxpayer dollars to pay for private schools that are created to achieve radically different goals.

The biggest problem with public schools is that they are underfunded. In this time of uncertainty, racism, and unequal distribution of wealth, the federal Secretary of Education should not divert funding from public to private schools."

As for the Catholic schools that are losing students well I have only one word for you- pedophiles.

One phenomenon we are witnessing over and over during this pandemic is that the wealthy and well-resourced are experiencing for the first time what it feels like not to be able to buy their way out of a problem.  And suddenly they want everyone else to stop and help them, as if they haven't been ignoring the have-nots for decades.  When poorer people need help, they're just lazy bums looking for welfare.  When rich people need help, it's a matter of conscience to give them what they need.  Sure."

NO.

2020-05-27 22:22,"In Georgia there is a program (rather convoluted) that gives a married couple a $2,500 tax credit on their state tax bill for private school tuition. A credit is a dollar for dollar reduction of taxes owed, not a 'deduction' that is subtracted from total income that taxes are then calculated. So this credit can be worth 50% of your bill. Very good deal. The total credits issued are capped at $100m and that comes right off revenue that could be used to fund public schools.  
  And half are Christian Academies and/or descendants of segregation schools founded to circumvent Brown SCOTUS ruling. Court just heard oral arguments in two cases that are attempting to exclude religious institutions from any prohibitions in employment discrimination.

2020-05-27 22:12,I was lucky enough to attend private schools my entire life. The average taxpayer should not be paying for ANYTHING to go to private schools! All aid should go to public schools.

2020-05-27 22:15,"I think this is a terrible mistake.  Private schools should not receive aid earmarked for public institutions.  Aren't market forces supposed to decide what happens to private institutions?   It seems like Republicans are always for bailing out private owners but always against adequately funding public schools. 
Congress should allocate funds.  This smells of Devos saving her own businesses and protecting her private financial interests."
2020-05-27 22:40,Private schools can access the regular business bail out funds that are billions more than the measly amounts going to public schools across the country. There is no end to her attacks on children living in poverty to deprive them of education. Most private schools (just like the private hospitals) will steal far more than they deserve.
2020-05-27 22:26,"As a person who has been working in the world of independent schools and charter schools at the highest level, I say without qualification that DeVos is out of her mind and totally off base with her recommendations. At least regarding independent schools with large endowments. Do Yale and Harvard need bailouts. NO. Do Dalton and and other high profile independent schools need a bailout? No. Do some charter school networks with hedge fund backing need Bailout? No. But do some independent schools (secular and religious institutions) need support need financial assistance? Yes. One size does not fit all. DeVos has always been an elitist. Class conscious trending toward the negative. How she's stayed in her position so long is beyond me. Get rid of her, and put someone in charge of the Dept of Ed and we may be able to save our public -- including independent charter-- schools from disaster. Otherwise, the agenda of Trump and DeVos will ultimately triumph. Which is not a good thing for American and the vast majority of American citizens."
2020-05-27 22:32,Private schools need to raise their own money.  The wealthy can take care of themselves.

2020-05-27 22:50,"She has no right to steal from public school funding to assist private or religious schools.   It is  a theft of public funds.

But then what really do we expect in a country where  millions of children are going hungry while public funds are being channeled into one corporation after another?    Where the likelihood of a child from a lower economic rung being able to improve his/her socio economic status  is  almost nonexistent?  Who counts?"

If public schools fail, there is no place for those students to go. 

Aside from the obvious arguments against supporting religion-based schools, the whole definition of a private school is that it is a private enterprise. Supporting them with government funds would simply be Socialism. We accept public schools as a tax-supported Socialist undertaking, but since when does the Republican Party, or Trump, endorse additional Socialism?

Oh right... whenever it involves handing out public money to their friends and supporters."

Private businesses are being bailed out with federal aid, and I've seen few objections to that.The schools--public and private--should be helped as well."
2020-05-27 22:59,"I wish this article had explained why DeVos feels she needs to force public school districts to fund religious schools. Can't religious schools apply for funds themselves?

2020-05-27 23:14,"Why are y’all so hung up on this argument about property tax money being spent on public schools when you homeschool or send your kid to the Catholic system?

Let me bust out a couple ideas from an avid observer:

1) Where do you think the supports and guidance come from when parents homeschool their children? HINT: it’s not from curriculum-coordinators and subject-leads who work for your Catholic school board...

2) Stop talking about homeschooling. Their representation within the K-12 system is a rounding error. Leave them alone and let them figure it out themselves; just be there with a social-safety net to catch them when they topple over in the real world. (Maybe some magical man in the sky will catch them first?)
Pre-response to homeschoolers—> “But I homesch-“, “ROUNDING ERROR.”

3) We have this thing in Canada. It’s called a property-tax allocation form. When I bought my house, I filled out my property tax form for the city where I live. I ticked the ‘public system’ box instead of the ‘catholic system’ box. Now they know where to send my tax dollars. 
This would obviously be too simplistic to solve the complex array of institutions puzzle- Jewish day schools, other non-Christian religious schools etc. -but it’s an idea.

4) You guys don’t even hold a national election for something as straight-forward as who to elect to the presidency. There is not going to be a national school-funding stimulus that will fit each region."

But in order for that system to be moral, you CANNOT have the state provide unequal opportunity to children who have not had the change to work or make the choices that result in good or bad.

It is almost our single and only moral obligation to insure that all children get equal and excellent primary education. It's literally what separates us from animals. To give children of the rich the kind of head start that local (and private!!) funding gives them is completely dumb.

And PS, if you made the children of the rich compete on equal footing as children of the poor, our economy would boom like you wouldn't imagine. Imagine if eg Trump had been forced to use his brain instead of coasting through life..."

 Education has the potential to transform a society for the better, and the U.S. has some of the most brilliant educational researchers in the world. I have read their work. Listen to them. 

And for the one of the wealthiest nations on the planet, the lack of funding is unconscionable. Families should NOT have to fundraise to ensure their school has enough learning materials. Teachers should NOT have to have a second job to make ends meet. 

And students with needs need support. Empower your states (with funding) to make education transformational, rather than a social reproduction experiment.

Now whole denominations commit to bend the state to their version of right. Normally I follow a more Jeffersonian approach where, if the actions of religion does not “break my leg nor picks my pocket,” I leave it alone. Pity they can’t do the same with me.

Mullah’s, whether Islamic, Christian, or Hebrew, seek state control because they KNOW the truth, they have the answers, no need to think anymore. We will distribute government funds to support OUR truth, because, err... it’s the truth! Can’t you see that? Sounds like someone who employed Betsy.

We’re both atheists Betsy. I’m pretty sure you don’t believe in Odin, Zeus, Amun Ra, or Baal. Neither do I. The difference is I’ve made it one deity further than you.

The conundrum for the critical thinker is that religion must serve some element of adaptive function for our species. What that function may be is subject to scientific debate. Until there is a scientific consensus I will consider religion a stupid waste of time, but I suppose I have to respond for Betsy’s actions are breaking my leg and picking my pocket.

My tax dollars shouldn't be used to support a religiously based education period. I don't care how rich or poor the students are, if they are getting a private education then public tax dollars should not be shoveled their way.  Private schools can figure out how to pay their own bills, just like any other private business.  And I highly doubt Republicans would hand out public dollars to a Muslim madrassa - this is another of their stealth ways of promoting a Christian based private education.  

We had a public school system that was the envy of the world before Republicans began their decades long work of destroying it bit by bit (like nearly every public institution we have).  

Here's an idea for funding private Catholic schools - sell off the Vatican art collection."

2020-05-28 0:01,"This article is poorly written and simply parrots back much of DeVos's and others' inaccurate hyperbole. The CARES Act states that the relief money should be distributed to schools, both public and private, based on the percentage of low-income students in that school. Secretary DeVos instead is trying to make rules that districts need to distribute the money to private schools in their district based simply on the total number of students in each school. So private schools with a small population of low-income students will see a significant increase in the amount of funding they receive (with a matching decrease for other schools in the district with a greater percentage of low-income students).

So the issue is not whether private schools should or shouldn't get funding, but rather that the CARES Act funding was provided to help low-income students overcome the barriers to learning in this new environment (i.e. improving internet access, providing digital resources, more food distribution, etc.). Secretary DeVos wants to use it to provide general operating funds for all schools, regardless of their financial situation. That's her agenda (and some warped concept of ""justice""), but sadly for her that is not the law that was passed."

The Supreme Court decisions allowing private non-democratically determined morals rules such as not paying for birth control and abortions should also apply in the reverse direction if these religiously oriented institutions desire to dip in to the public coffer for funding. I should have a say in how MY money is used if its going to support these institutions, and I say NO.

I do not want MY money paying for institutions who teach belief in Zeus, Rastafarianism or one of the 18 versions of Jesus Abraham or Muhahmed's god for that matter, no matter how many poor people they happen to be able to wheel out.

If our society cared about teaching poor folks kids well, we would do well to emulate Finland. Elevate school teachers to the social and financial status of Real Estate Developers, Physicians, and Architects, hold them to it, and pay them accordingly. And like Finland, do not let private schools pay more per pupil than public schools.

Her hypocrisy has been out in the open since arriving in Trump's cabinet of grifters.  

But let's be clear, the right-wing conservative segments of America's Christian community have been fighting the Establishment Clause which denies any religion to establish itself as an official government faith. It also prohibits the State from establishing an official religion. This is the separation of Church and State.

Quite simply, this is not about denying the Freedom of Religion — to practice one's faith without State interference. Rather, it is about the freedom from religion — the ability to go about one's life without interference by a religion. 

This is what DeVos and the conservative right-wing Evangelicals fail to understand. What the rest of us understand is, religion is not based on any scientific evidence — none whatsoever. But then, as the comedian Bill Maher noted, ""that's why they call it faith.

Many spend their early years in the religious school and then head to the public high school anyway. 

When you consider the fact that the system of property taxes already discriminates in providing quality education to lower income kids, it would be my opinion that diverting any more tax dollars away from those schools is unfair.

Surely this is only fair. One cannot say public school isn’t for my family but their money is. And don’t tell me it’s your money from taxes - it was yours until you decided to go another direction. 
I’m somewhat sympathetic to these families. But I’m afraid my sympathy cannot extend to the Catholic Church - one of the richest organizations in the world.

Maine has a number of rural towns that do not have regional public high schools, and there is something called school choice.  For example, in Lincoln County there is a school called Lincoln Academy.  It is a private school founded in 1801. It is also the defacto public high school for the local towns, who pay for the school tuition at a state mandated rate. The school receives no tax money.  What the towns pay is below what it costs per student, so the way Lincoln and the other schools in the state make up for it is by recruiting international students, many from China, who pay way more money to attend. I suspect those students aren't coming back in the fall, and this money would help the school survive."

She should not have been made Education Secretary but of course the Senate passed her through and now she is has been reeking havoc on Public Education ever since.

There is a distinct difference between public and private education.  If you choose to send your child/children to private school, you must bear the cost of your child's education. Directly. By paying the private/parochial school they attend.
Yes, even when you pay school taxes, funding your local public school.

In no way whatsoever should public money, as in taxpayer's money, be used for any type of private schooling. Period.

The fact that we're even debating this is absurd.

It is another, precedent-setting step by Republicans to destroy our once-vaunted public education system,, to further wreck the mythical ""social contract"" and do it without concern or regard for students (public or private) most in need.

Like every Trump aid decision relative to coronavirus, the goal here is to siphon money to the wealthy, bring more and more of American society under administration control, and increase the pain and the hopelessness of American citizens generally.

Since that time I've sent 4 kid through Catholic grade school and an outstanding public school. Catholic school was my choice, and taxpayers should not pay for it.

It's called separation of Church and State and that is an understanding that should never be breached.  I  don't even believe in a god, ANY god, and I consider what they are teaching as basically propaganda and mind control.  
How would Ms. DeVos like it if we gave our tax dollars to a School of Islam or a school run by devil worshipers.  Because those are actual self described ""religions"" also. And please tell me Mr, Dolan, why I would want my tax dollars to go to an institution that has a sordid history of sexually molesting children? ""Faith based"" has taken on an entire new meaning since then and how do we know for sure that these horrible atrocities have been stopped? 
So called religion is one of the big reasons that this Country has practically been brought to it's knees. Because a good number of it's practitioners support some of the most immoral, crude and downright evil actions of an immoral leader. No taxes to private schools!"

This is just 1 example of the Radical Right's Playbook at it's worst--having it both ways.

Hopefully this chicanery will be challenged in court. And the Judge won't be one of the Radical Right

All that said, as a society we could consider supporting families such as those in the Cristo-Rey system. Yes, it screams of ""vouchers,"" but if it provides assistance to poor families struggling to help their kids move out of poverty via a good education--and in their case already working in Corporate programs to pay their tuition-- some assistance is  worth considering,  via different funding from Congress. I certainly don't agree with subsidizing rich families who already have all kinds of breaks, and have enjoyed a huge tax cut since 2017.
 
I, and others, grew up poor, attended private universities, and received Federal assistance. That enabled me to earn well, & pay hundreds of thousands in taxes for 40+ years.

This decision by DeVos is completely wrong.  Diverting money this way just deprives children in our public school of pencils, computers, decent desks and chairs.
De Vos, and all of our current cabinet members, need the boot come November.  I just hope the DNC and Biden come up with a platform to meet these dire times and a solid VP pick who can step in and do the job."

But what I find most troubling about this is the idea that DeVos believes she has the authority to issue orders about how  public schools can spend money allotted to them by Congress.

The runaway assertions of executive power by this administration are terrifying and pose an existential danger to the continued survival of our democracy."

Mr. Quellette, you're right about separation of church and state.  Non-public schools must rely on their own means to stay open.

The Trump Administration has produced such people as DeVos to form a government that is foreign to many of us.  He's responsible for the growth of two pandemics.  One is a diseased government; the other is the spread of Covid-19."

The separation of church and state must be upheld and this is something we should start monitoring closely since shameless Republican movers and shakers, like Ms. DeVos, are busy trying to bend our laws to fit their bidding, so that a biased perspective may be imprinted on unsuspecting children at an early age.

2.  If private schools are a business, should they be eligible for the business bailout money?

If a parent wants to send their child to a private school they have that right and that child has the right to the same governmental support that a child in a public school has.

I have little experience with the US public school system. My daughter has always gone to pretty good public schools in California. Not all teachers where great, but some were and that made a difference. I think most parents sending their kids to a private school do have reasonable public options.

A parent has the right to choose a religious-based education for his/her/they child. I have a right not to be forced to pay for it.  If that parent’s decision is based on the belief that the quality of public schools is not high enough, demand better. I have an obligation to pay for that."

As such, I'm conflicted-like I said I'm Catholic-by the fact that some truly working class families and their children could stand to benefit from federal aid that ideally would help them during this crisis.  However, I know too well that public schools, prior to the pandemic, were serving record number of free meals, to a record number of homeless children at a time when our schools are increasingly being segregated by race and income. The pandemic now has increased those struggles significantly.  

I recently received an email from one of my students who is out picking strawberries informing that he is too tired to do much school work and if he could turn in his school work in later.  

So while I don't doubt that parochial schools are successfully integrating and fostering institutions, I have a hard time ""bailing out"" the church when  the Catholic church continues to pay out millions of dollars to child abuse victims. Finally, Everson vs Board of Education (1947) makes clear the separation of church and state, by giving public money to schools that promote religious beliefs we are crossing that line."
2020-05-28 8:22,"I think this is a golden opportunity for America to rope the right-leaning sector of its upper-middle classes into taxpayer-funded education. If you look at the Nordic model of schooling, all private schools receive a significant amount of government funding, which in turn has made them dependent on this stream, which in turn has kept its clientele invested in taxpayer spending on education.
You are simply not going to see most people from the higher classes send their kids to public schools. Sure, Park Slopey types might, but class culture is impermeable. So you have to rig the system such that higher-class parents can continue to commodify education while also having skin in the public-school game.
Public funding of private schools does just that."

Their children, indeed, their entire families are used to certain deprivations. so in these difficult days, the poor should have no difficulty in bearing an extra load of hardships.  

The rich, on the other hand, have likewise gotten used to certain amenities of life. It would be cruel to ask them to forego their way of life - entirely.

All Secretary Vos is asking is that the poor must go on living with their life's daily grind they are so accustomed to so that the rich can go on living the way they are used to. The GOP formula is simple: In good times, the rich must get their proper (lion's) share of the tax cuts.

 That made me laugh. After 20 years of working in public schools, I can't tell you how many students have landed on our doorstep after being kicked out of private schools. Y'all pick and choose all the time."
2020-05-28 6:12,"The Catholic Church is among the wealthiest organizations on the planet. Perhaps they need to redistribute some of their own investment funds into their schools. It's bad enough that many faith-based schools promote anti-science views, now they want tax payers to fund programs that will only harm society in the long run? No thanks."
2020-05-28 7:58,"Lemme get this right: a school makes a profit and can go out of business, but a public school has to fund a business that can't keep itself going? I thought she was a capitalist. Nope, any excuse to make a buck."

2020-05-28 4:34,"I taught in public schools and we accepted children from every religion, color and creed, without expecting money from private or religious schools. I sent my children to public schools and they received excellent education. Private and religious school are wealthier than public schools, and people send their children to those schools because they want to, and should not expect money to be diverted to them from public schools. How dare DeVos thinks she has the right to take money from public schools to supplement rich private or religious schools. No way!!"
2020-05-28 5:57,"14 year olds should not have to trade their labor for education, the practice of private schools providing private companies with cheap labor to fund their operations is completely unethical and shows how far the Republican assault on public education has come. Unfortunately, the Democrats have bought way too heavily into the private/charter school industry's propaganda. The focus of public education policy should be, strange as it may seem, public education.

Of course Betsy DeVos is basically a monster, but Democrats could and should do better than a softer, gentler kind of neoliberalism."
2020-05-28 10:26,"Having had a lot of experience in both public and ( non religious ) private elementary schools, all in middle class suburbs, I have a few observations:

1) Stop thinking that all of these schools are for wealthy families.  While some families have 6 figure incomes, Others have parents working 2 jobs, relying on grandparents to help with tuition, and some also rely on public assistance.
2) don’t think that the teachers and administrators are getting rich either.  Their pay can be significantly less than what a public school teacher earns, and there will not be a pension waiting for them when they retire.
3) Private schools are typically more agile than public schools.  Our ability to put in programs to continue education through the pandemic has been applauded by our families and community , and is already attracting additional students for the 2020-2021 school year.

Our school will not apply for these federal funds, just as we have not applied for a federal small business loan.  We have had some families unable to pay tuition due to COVID, and as a result we will likely be taking a loss this year.  We will keep all of our teachers employed and we anxiously await the coming school year.

In general I believe that the aid packages have been poorly managed for both individuals and businesses.  If a legitimate private school ( or a business, or an individual) requires a boost to make it through these difficult times, then I’m OK with it."
2020-05-28 10:02,I don't want any of my tax dollars going to private schools.  That seems like a bad idea overall.
2020-05-28 9:58,The Federal Government commitment should be to public schools alone. Private schools by their very nature should rely on private funding and not be supported by the tax money of the public. DeVos and her family are involved in funding private Christian fundamentalist schools. She is biased and should recuse herself from any decision making on this issue.

For her, the only legitimate schools are those that indoctrinate vulnerable children’s minds and souls with Christian dogma at a young and tender age rather than exposing them as they mature to religions as cultural phenomena grounded in the tactical need to control and channel thinking.  In her warped thinking, human value systems not premised on Christian origins are vastly inferior to those that are, and she arrogantly insists that it is her divine mission to reorient public education to the point where its primary function is to infuse those values and the framework that underlies them in any way she can."
2020-05-28 4:34,"Betsy DeVos is finally expressing the thoughts and wishes of the forgotten millions who send their kids to private schools but in the process end up paying for two educations--the private education of their kids and the publicly-financed education for everyone else.  Of course, the liberals don't mind taking our money with nothing in return to show.  But if we should ask for parity and fairness during this pandemic, then suddenly they come full throttle against us.  At a time when I toyed with the idea of changing my vote in November from Trump to Biden, Betsy DeVos set me straight.  No Biden vote from this guy."

2020-05-28 7:26,"Betsy DeVos has never attended any public school, not from her beginnings in school through college. The college she attended has as its modern history the prohibition against teaching evolution and required of its professorial applicants a ""pledge of faith"" and there were negative consequences for any ""rebellious"" tendencies. The church, the Dutch Reformed Church, has in its modern history, racial discrimination and white supremacist attitudes about black people.
In Michigan, she and her ilk worked against public schools by forcing charter schools onto the public school system, but in Michigan, charter schools' history was one of great profit-making potential for the wealthy while creating schools that were inferior - a new ""separate and unequal"" system. It was their way of separating various populations, whether on bases of ability/disability, race, family economic status....
Devos got rich via Amway which many considered a pyramid scheme. Trump is destroying America. Devos is destroying America's public education system. These people who now run OUR government actually hate America but love to exploit it and loot it.
Get them out. And between now and November, obstruct everything they connive to do."

Where does the law require sharing public school funds with private schools? Where does it even allow it without perverting regulations? The virus is non-discriminatory, but public funds are for public education, not for schools and students who walked away from it. Yet another disgraceful move by this disgraceful administration."
2020-05-28 4:48,"DeVos has no compassion, no empathy, and she has no clue what it's like for a school to struggle with inadequate resources.

2020-05-28 8:07,"You Americans are confused about a lot of things. You want to play games with gray areas between public and private as long as it serves your self interests. 

This current attempt by DeVos illustrates the point: you have created a ""public"" education system constitutionally. It's a public asset. There are those who want to operate outside that system (which is their right). That education system is separate and private. It shouldn't matter if the schools are religious or not. If they aren't public, they are private. Giving them public funds is ridiculous.

A solution:  ""Opt in / Opt out"" - If you want to send your kids to private school, then you opt out of the public system and agree that you will not take advantage of that social benefit. In other words, educating your kids is on you. The private school your kids attend will receive no public money."
2020-05-28 6:41,"Beyond awful. I don't understand how these ultra-rich conservatives think they're doing God's work, unless Jesus was a preppy with a legacy admission."

Agreed, absolutely correct. 
Nobody is stopping you.
As it is so important, then you should happily be ready to pay for it. (And this applies also so Catholic schools). That would be a great mitzvah.

There are of courses places in the world where your school system would actually be part of the public school system (with autonomy) and receive public funding without issue. That is also your choice not to avail yourself of that."
2020-05-28 6:05,No Way!  Civil disobedience is king.  File claims saying that you will start a school that will teach that Donald Trump is the second coming.

2020-05-28 8:16,"Has anyone ever heard Betsy DeVos discuss the quest for knowledge, an idea or a book? Can’t she be the Secretary of Direct Marketing?

I feel for all kids who are trying to learn and connect with friends during this crisis. It is horrible for them and many children are in real jeopardy. I believe all children who need food and support to learn with educators should have that.

But Betsy DeVos does not make hunger a priority. She does not make learning a priority. She is not talking about lifting up children and the trauma they are experiencing now. No, as usual, it’s all about money, money, money: grabbing money from taxpayers and browbeating public schools where most children learn. Everything she does suggests to me that she hates education. Her attitude is: the public should pay her god and shut up. 

Forbes reports that she has $2B a year. If she cares so much about private schools failing, she could cough up and sell a few of her yachts or a sports team. And she should know that community members are already doing what they can to support local institutions without her dictatorial abuse."

Which in Trump’s case is creating political friction whenever possible.  The Trump government is rife with people who have no qualifications for the position they hold or are so politically bent that they are incapable of following rules and laws which are the basis for a civil society.

Get off your anti religion horse and respect others right to choose. You’re good at that right to choose bit when it serves your agenda."

2020-05-28 6:15,DeVos knows nothing about public schools and would love to see them abolished. Trump and his cronies have spent their time demolishing the best parts of America!
2020-05-28 12:16,"Although I disagree with the current administration on many issues, assisting inner city families by allowing them the choice to attend a faith based school instead of a failing public school may be the only policy I support. As the article states, 90% of the families in these communities are living at or near the poverty level so they are not the affluent wealthy as many who are against this policy would have you believe. Many choose to send their children to private school in these areas because similar to the wealthy affluent suburban public schools, it offers them a safer environment for learning."
2020-05-28 12:25,"I work at a private school and my children attend both private and public schools. I agree that taking money from schools struggling is wrong. However, the argument of separation of church and state makes no sense here. If private companies are provided aid then why should private schools who provide a service to families of many different demographics be entitled to the same help? So what if some are religious. The school I work at has many students on aid from the state. They are not the rich and privileged so many think about when thinking private school. However, many were failed by the private school system not because of a lack of funds but because of the sheer size and the amount of bureaucracy. I just don't understand in a democratic country how we can't see the need for both types of schools. I also don't see how our citizens would not want to help students as long as appropriate checks and balances were in place.

I visited a Cristo Reyo school in Florida. Many if the student's parents were migrant workers and the work this schools was doing was amazing. Many if these students would have dropped out or needed up in gangs if they were in the large public school as just a part of the masses."
2020-05-28 12:14,Institutions founded on the idea of segregating education based on who has the most money should not get public relief.
2020-05-28 12:50,"Do you want public dollars going to institutions with discriminatory practices?  In some states schools given voucher money discriminate against accepting certain types of students? According to a column on Huffington Post, nearly a third of the schools that participated in a Montana education tax credit program at the center of a controversial Supreme Court case maintain explicitly anti-LGBTQ policies.
 
How about schools that teach that evolution is not science?  Public money is going to schools of a religious nature that teach anti-evolution. State departments of education typically have the duty to determine the content of the school curriculum. 

Individual taxpayers should not have a say in how their tax monies are spent.  For example, I oppose war yet my tax dollars are used to build military equipment.  Why should a parent have the “choice” to decide how their tax money is used  just because they happen to currently have a school age child that they would like to enroll in a religious school?"
2020-05-28 11:58,"Just another example why America needs to invest more in it's public education. Some questions and observations about this article:
1. Private schools say 30% families have annual income below $75K. Show us a histogram, so we can see how many are below 50K and how many are below 25K, and so on.
2. It says Federal law already allows for some funding of poor students in private schools.
3. The vast majority are Catholic schools. Aha! Maybe many are Jewish. What percentage are outside those two religions?
4. While Jewish families and communities are welcome to give their children a Jewish education, that's none of my business. I am invested in education, not Jewish education or Catholic education or XYZ religious education.

It seems these private schools want the best of both worlds. They want to pursue an exclusive religious agenda in good times, but also want help from those they left out during bad times. Not happening."
2020-05-28 12:07,Like so much of Trump Administration another action that is just plain wrong.
2020-05-28 12:59,"I can tell you first hand that in the state of Rhode Island, that CARES act dollars are allocated based on free and reduced lunch numbers, EVEN if the school is a PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL.  Yet another attack on school choice, but this time within the public arena.  We are supposed to get equal treatment. But we do not.  We still had to buy chromebooks, develop an online school for distance learning, we still have to clean and sanitize when the students return, but because there are less disadvantage students (who, by the way are encouraged to apply to our school, but choose not to), we are supposed to come up with the funds to make the learning environment safe... on our own. That doesn't seem fair to me.  
I pay taxes to my town and the dollars are supposed to follow the student (my child).... why isn't it the same for the federal dollars?  Our charter school was the ONLY school who got $0 reimbursed from the CARES act.... the only public school in the whole state.  Whereas some schools in the state got millions.  I understand that some schools need more dollars... but to get nothing seems unfair and like a slap in the face.
Hey NYTimes.... take a look at that story for well rounded reporting."
2020-05-28 13:11,"I’ll keep my kid in Catholic school. It’s a sacrifice, but I want my child to fully know and live our faith. His fragile spirit depends on it right now.

2020-05-28 13:08,"I attended a Catholic school in a middle class neighborhood that’s likely struggling right now. It and others will likely claim that some economically disadvantaged students will be adversely affected. 

It will likely not mention that nearly all of the economically disadvantaged students it serves are exceptionally gifted at baseball, basketball or soccer. It will also likely fail to mention that it suspended, without pay, a teacher who became pregnant while engaged, but before her wedding. 

And though the school will tout its diversity, it will fail to mention that while it’s a popular choice among Filipino parents in the medical community, and white parents of adopted Asian children, only one percent of its student body (at best) is black."
2020-05-28 13:14,"1. It makes sense to support private school students. Closing a private school and sending the students to public schools is clearly more expensive to taxpayers than giving partial support to private school students.

But please, not one penny of of our tax dollars should go to  those who have turned their backs on free public education.

2020-05-28 14:55,"I think the people writing most of the comments need to rethink their positions. I believe education should be an institution that offers many differing worldviews. That requires a variety of schools, not just government sanctioned curriculum. Unless, of course, diversity is precisely what one opposes."
2020-05-28 14:58,"Some of these comments are honestly bothering me. The education our children receive should not affect the contributions or the help they should have. This ongoing competition between public and private schools is clouding the judgment of society. Instead of believing stereotypes such as the ones which state that private schools are ""wealthy and fancy"" and thinking that these schools do not need help, think about the children. These kids that attend private schools attend them for better educations and to have a good life. I can tell you right now, not all private school children are living a posh life. There are kids working their butts off at private schools so that when they are older, they can have the money to support their families because they had to grow up an impoverished life. So before you say that these funds should not go toward any private school because of unrealistic stereotypes, think again. We are all human. We all need help right now. We are all in crisis."

It is like asking the realtor to help build a garage after you purchased and own the home. They need to take responsibility.

2020-05-28 16:47,"Betsy DeVos is one of many in a long line of inept lieutenants of the corrupt, inept Trump administration.  Her myopic vision consistently practiced as Secretary of Education, clearly in ‘name’ only, is an affront to furthering educational excellence in our nation.   Further, Ms. DeVos represents the working definition of an insult to the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment."

You thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud About having to be scrounging your next meal 
How does it feel, how does it feel? To be without a home Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone 
Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely But you know you only used to get juiced in it Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street And now you're gonna have to get used to it...""

Just my 2 cents..."
2020-05-28 16:25,"Small private schools are necessary and needed especially in states with failing, over crowded schools such as California. View it as a small business if it makes you feel better. Their families pay taxes, their schools deserve to benefit from the Care Act.  I pay for school twice in California, to the horrible school in my neighborhood through my property taxes and then again to my daughters private school."

2020-05-27 13:57,"Perhaps because there is so little sports news, I have noticed that your sports pages have included a number of articles about chess, including this excellent piece. Why not bring back the Times chess column? Wouldn't Irina Krush be an ideal writer for such a column?"
2020-05-27 19:15,"Irina Krush graciously played against my daughter and her second grade team, the Mighty Pawns of St. Joseph's School in Kingston, NY, 20 years ago.   Ms. Krush was 15 at the time, and I remember her beating my daughter but being super nice and supportive about it.  Even then she was giving back to the game.  Great ambassador for the game.  I thanked her then, and I wish her well now."
2020-05-27 22:50,"So glad to hear that Irina is on the mend! I noticed her playing in the online Nations Cup, but didn't know she wasn't back to full strength. I remember watching her play in the Cairns Cup this year (there's online commentary by noted GMs). She's a wonderful role model for women in chess.

Hope she gets fully recovered soon."

2020-05-27 17:24,Good article on the resilience of Irina Krush. I hope she recovers fully. The picture of when she was 15 brought back many memories because of the white Soviet JANTAR chess clock with its loud ticks - you had to become resilient to ignore those ticks.

The usability window should be ""moved"" and expanded to cover those, perhaps 8 - 10,  first weeks of the ""reopening phase"" - when clientele are minimal and thus contributing little to the payment of unchanged salaries and rent/utilities etc. which will be needed. The effect of the existing 8 week window is not helping anyone who's employees and themselves are currently on unemployment. If anything it is incentivizing these businesses to use the PPA money as a traditional loan for this period of re-opening with the intention of paying it back, which will NOT act to support the RETENTION of current staff."

Yes, I lost more than an income. I had to sell my home and have gone through my savings. Its a bleak, disheartening picture. I am hoping I will die before too long. Death by Covid 19 doesn’t sound that bad anymore.

2020-05-29 14:31,"This doom and gloom about the economy is covering up the system's basic flaw. Laws and egregious behavior produced many citizens who lived on subsistence or near subsistence wages. Wages are a euphemism.  This label assumes a certain value, but neglects any built-in to prevent poverty or decent survival.  

All paper money or coinage is a Federal Government product produced according to agreed upon standards.  Society determines how much any one person can spend or accumulate.  When too many Treasury notes become idle, there is not enough circulating for essential exchanges.  

Somehow conservative think they should determine who should receive these dollars and who shouldn't.  There is no concept that society is suppose to improve survival. The labor force is what keeps people safe, healthyl, and content.  

This pause in the economy is manufactured and can be corrected by making everyone's contribution a priority, and support them, not with charity, but for the important role each plays. Goods and services have to flow fairly and be inclusive."

2020-05-29 15:23,"Times will be tough for many, and I sympathize, having lost my job in the Obama depression and forced into early retirement.  But, this is why planning for sudden loss of income is so vitally important.  It is why I worked full time while pursuing my undergraduate degree full time so that we would have income should I lose my job.  My wife waited to attend college full time until I had graduated.  Attend junior college for two years; it's more cost effective.  
Money doesn't grow on trees, and the estimates according to the University of Chicago are that 68% of the people collecting unemployment are making more unemployed than when they were working.  The $600/week bonus unemployment must end, and then we can and probably should extend the duration of regular unemployment. 
We are going to have to reopen and stoically accept that people are going to die from this virus.  The economy cannot be kept shut down for months or years."
2020-05-29 15:27,"Mitch McConnell has been holding up the HEROES Act (the next appropriations bill) because he is demanding a $140 billion tax cut for the rich.  Specifically for the rich - he's not even hiding it.  The HEROES Act would extend the $600/week PUA until January 2021.  It would provide extreme support for front-line workers (hence HEROES).  It would provide desperately needed aid for the States, most of which is earmarked for helping businesses maintain their employees.  And it used to include - wait for it - $2000 per month for every unemployed or otherwise needy adult.  THAT was completely removed by the GOP and even if the Dems decided to give him his tax cut, that direct payment is his absolute line in the sand.  So he has openly and consciously chosen to help the rich with a tax cut, rather than the needy with emergency assistance.

Setting aside how sad and outrageous this is, what I really don't get is that he seems not to understand economics even in a simple form.  The way to get an economy going is through consumer spending, not tax cuts.  If we all had money to spend, then sales and other taxes would be paid, providing revenue for municipalities, States and the federal government.  That is about as basic as it gets."

Their first complaint was their anger at losing the expanded unemployment benefits.  Second, they were scared of infection.  Third, they were overwhelmed with the state mandated changes to reopen the business.  
I feel like business owners were sacrificial lambs to the government.    
We were told to reopen so that citizens were on our payroll and not the states/feds, though they knew we couldn't offer the same pay rate as them .  They knew that the chance of infection is still in place but now if that happens, we pay for it with EFMLEA instead of through time on UI.  They did nothing to compensate us for the outlay to protect our staff and customers that was in their mandate.  
It is just a colossal shift of responsibility from the gov. to business owners.  If we were in a different line of business, we would've waited...I know many other owners who are do so exactly because of our employees complaints."

Mitch said, according to this article: "".... that any additional aid package must be far narrower than previous packages.""

Well, you tell that to those starving poor children, Mitch.
Tell that to those who have gotten a ""dollar a day"" to exist on.

You tell that to that 1% that has now jacked up  last year's ""Tax Cut"" from $1.5 TRILLION, up to $5.5 TRILLION after their lobbyists got through with it.

Time for that entire Bill to be rescinded.
Now.

2020-05-29 14:33,The reporting of Chinese government regarding Coronavirus reports death numbers is not possible or realistic. Having millions of cell phones disconnected in China in January and February could indicate that their death toll was enormous. They chose not to inform the world and to cover it up. Knowing about the virus in November 2019 they locked down Wuhan but kept sending planes full of people from China to many countries spreading the virus throughout the globe.   In mid-March they eliminated almost all western journalists.  Many Chinese doctors critical about the pandemic died and the bloggers disappeared. The YouTube videos with medical staffers pleading to world and sick Chinese being dragged from their apartments were removed from internet.  The refusal to allow the international experts in pandemic field to investigate China epidemic proves that China does not intent to reveal the truth.  China agreed they would eventually allow such investigation later and as many their promises  they made it might never happen.  Recently China decided to take on Hong Kong.  Except for the US there was a muted reaction of the western world.  The Western governments by tolerating China's misbehaviours for tens of years allowed China to grow into serious danger to the world.

The entire Coronavirus scenario was predicted in advance, and the US had contingency plans.

Under ANY normal president, the US would have been working with China, allies, and international agencies last November and December, to prevent this pandemic from leaving China to begin with.

Instead, Trump fired all the planners, denied the science, and refused all collaboration.

Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Depression.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

It was one the most significant factors in giving me and my brother the opportunity to move upward and out. When the roof over your head is secure, you can do much to improve your life and that of your children. To see people struggle to pay their rent and largely because the housing market has become so monetized, is painful. The expectation that low income households keep at least three month's worth of expenses in a savings account for emergencies is too much to demand when you consider how wages stack up against the cost of housing, food and transportation. Despite best efforts by housing advocates,  the issue of affordable housing keeps getting buried and/or ignored."

Enough of wasting billions on military (yearly!) and wasting billions to save corporations that should have died in this pandemic with their rotten debt.  Can this government at least once care for the future of this country?  Not only we are the only country where it is solely the parents who pay outrageous cost of daycares (while the workers there make on average $11/hr), it also seems like our government cared more to buy junk corporate bonds instead of helping the small businesses that are the straw man of this country!

Just so, one evicted tenet is a tenet homeless. A vast number of evicted tenets is landlords with empty spaces they can't rent, and no income at all to cover their investments.

When evictions reach a critical number, then rents will come down, as the only way to get any income from the property."

And, they will reopen.. not when Trump demands it, and not when Newsom permits it under state executive order.... they will reopen when it is assessed, based on science and data, that it is OK to reopen... under a new set of social interaction requirements and safety."

Most of us are so excited at the possibility of resuming our lives we are ignoring the very real probability this will be for naught.  We have not destroyed the enemy, we have contained it by hiding.  It sits in wait for us to reappear.  Until there is a vaccine,  we are fighting the enemy without anything that will stop it.  We held bold Memorial Day festivities and we continue to “ open”.  We are fighting a sophisticated germ with masks, and compulsive hand washing.  That is very sad. We need a leader.  A General to convene with governors and unify a  plan for states that are united.  We don’t have that, and I believe the temperature in July 
will not be cooled by rain, but heated by the mournful tears of hundreds of thousands people mourning our dead.  Gatherings and openings will once again become a silly concern. Many people agree with my terrible observation, but it is not popular to talk about deaths that we can not stop, and have not even tried to stop because we yearn for a “living” economy. Some concerns are hard to hear, so we do not discuss their probability."
2020-05-27 13:54,"While the coffers of billionaire have swollen, the downward spiral of many Americans is just starting to set in.

As stimulus programs end, and employment lags, there will be a flood of evictions. The number of homeless people in this country will skyrocket. And, I predict, there will be a steep rise in the number of suicides.

While the rich reaped massive financial rewards, and the upper middle class have endured, the majority of Americans will be feeling the second punch - and for many it will constitute a knockout.

It's incredibly sad that after enduring so much during this crisis, so many peoples lives will be rendered irreparable.

Then again, we the people, have far too often elected those who's only concern was to bolster the financial fortunes of the 1 in 100,000 who least need it, while sacrificing everything else, and everyone else, to that singular goal.

With the coming tidal wave of evictions, it's seems inevitable that the housing market will resemble the same financial inequality that was so pervasive before the pandemic hit. Only, what was once a rift between the have's and the have-not's will become a canyon.

I wonder what's going to happen to all those landlords, whose properties where priced at the middle point, when there is no longer a middle class? I suppose they'll meet the same fate as the rest of us.

Soon, there may just be billionaires, and those in poverty. And wouldn't the GOP love that! After all, it's been their goal for over half a century."

While both States had lockdown and stay-at-home restrictions -- the actual morbidity and mortality rates in NY were far more dire than CA.  There are various reasons for this such as housing density, mass transit vs. automobiles, viral spread via Europe vs. China etc.

However, even as the situation has clearly eased and improved in NY we find increasing concern regarding a ""second wave"" in CA.  And this concern rises even as both states start implementing a variety of ""reopening"" measures.

We briefly visited a devastated NY earlier this month.  Now we are scheduled to return again in mid-June.  It will be sadly ironic if in doing so we will now be headed towards relatively safety in NY versus a rising contagion in LA and CA.

Far too much ""politicizing"" has developed regarding how we deal with a pandemic.  Ideological ranting about ""lockdowns"" vs. ""reopenings"" etc. have increasingly clouded how we as a society confront a public health crisis.

We do not need ideological ranting and posturing.  We need to rely on scientific and medical professionals to both advise us and help us set reasonable public policies.

We certainly need to adapt our lifestyles into a ""defensive"" mode requiring masks and social distancing.

It will take time to beat Covid.  We need to find patience."

Take a bigger bucket to the pond you get more tadpoles with each scoop.  The corresponding, but even more significant data point is we’ve had less then 12 deaths per day the last two days... hence why the increase in reported cases is less significant."
2020-05-27 16:01,"Well, if hospital volumes are low or otherwise manageable then everyone should cheer each new, documented infection because it's one step closer to herd immunity which will almost certainly arrive before a vaccine (if it hasn't arrived already). Moreover, the documentation of infection is based on the molecular test for active infection. Nobody knows the true number of exposed individuals because antibody testing is underutilized and there are untold numbers of people who were exposed but asymptomatic"
2020-05-27 16:09,"California tops 100,000 cases. I can agree that we flattened the curve in California. I agree that things could have been worse. But this just is not good enough. LA seems to be having a surge of new cases. Why? Here in the Bay Area we flattened the curve and seem content with that. Why? Everyone is ready to reopen. Never mind the fact that when we went under ground on March 16, we had fewer daily new cases than we have now. Why are we not doing more? What is the plan for testing and tracing? What is the plan for protecting-really protecting-the elderly and especially nursing homes? We have seen what worked in S. Korea, Taiwan, Germany and Singapore. Let’s test. Test everyone if we must. Do it out in the open like the S. Korea drive through testing. Don’t call people to health centers to be infected or to infect others in a waiting room. Trace. Trace every case relentlessly. We can’t use the same cell phone tracking some countries use but we can put boots on the ground. Some of the countries that have had the best success are small with well controlled borders. That is no excuse for us not to try to eradicate COVID. Right now, not many people are crossing state borders. When we all started sheltering at home, a psychological timer began counting down. When it reaches zero, COVID or not, people will begin to return to their normal lives of socializing. We used that period to implement half measures and now time is up."

Are states isolated? Cities? Towns? Neighborhoods? Unless travel is restricted across-the-board resulting in a weeks' long downward trajectory in new cases, we must remain vigilant, i.e. use PPE, social-distancing, and sanitary measures.

The economy. Cabin fever. Conspiracy theories. Covid-19 doesn't care about any of that. It merely wants to go from host to host and grow. 

If we don't take all possible steps to stop its spread, it WILL spread. Is this so difficult for our politicians and (some) citizens to understand?"
2020-05-27 16:30,"It would seem to me the most important statistic is hospital admissions for Covid19.  As testing becomes more readily available it is inevitable the number of people testing  positive will increase.

It think it would be a mistake to ignore this fact in determining if a spike in infections is occurring."

We are also a very self sufficient state with a diverse population of talent across a multiplicity of fields. Add to this the fact we prize being Californians and want to work together. 

Gov. Gavin Newsom is reaching out to former CA governors and health experts to try and fix on the many problems needing addressing. Like Mr. Cuomo on the east coast, our state has a special place at the heart of our country, even if we lie geographically far west. In short, we'll survive this best we can by teamwork."

In Monterey, our county health officer has been vilified for his shelter in place orders— even though this has been effective. Only 8 out of 437k have died. Those most infected so far are the poor, usually farmworkers, who are housed in crowded facilities with little access to healthcare. 

But in white, wealthy Carmel, the whining at having to wear masks or avoid crowds has been fanned into a full-on constitutional crisis by our local weekly.  A tea shop owner    portrayed his selfish decision to reopen, without distancing or mask wearing, as a constitutional right. Our DA intervened, the  liquor license boys paid him a visit, even shaking hands, all to no avail. He’s still open, and has decided that spreading disease is acceptable behavior.

Meanwhile, right-wingers are paying for his attorney. And the GOP candidate who ran and lost against our Congressman is attributing (low) infection rates to foreign immigrants. So Trump’s politicization, victimhood, racism and anti-science has penetrated our village."

In the meantime another type of calamity will take / is taking place but who cares?  The wealthy in CA have more than enough of everything to withstand whatever comes their way, the rest of CA never mattered, nor it will, and the governor is apparently a weakling who relinquishes his responsibility, enough to be cherished in the so-called liberal media."

If Governor Pritzker had not acted so aggressively and prudent in closing schools, business and mandating the shelter-in-place order when he did, no doubt the number of cases and deaths in Illinois would be much, much higher.

Thus, the policies in Vermont are not to combat an existing epidemic here.   Rather, they are to discourage out of state visitors who may bring in the virus from their home locations.   As a result, the hospitality industry is tighter than a drum to anyone  right now.   When things re-open, it will be closed to anyone who has not sheltered in Vermont for at least two weeks.  Which eliminates weekenders.   Plus Vermonters are being encouraged to not leave the state, only to come back with virus picked up elsewhere.

We are testing more and more people and subsequently tracking.  Two ""musts"" during this pandemic.  That could have a lot to do with this up-ticking of cases.

2020-05-27 15:58,"People might want to ask themselves why the deaths caused by the SARS-2 virus are seemingly so much more important than the vastly greater numbers of *preventable* deaths that occur due to other causes each and every year. 
Medical errors, for example, are thought to cause over a quarter of a million deaths each year. For me, this is the one that renders the fear of the virus most incoherent. 
The fact that over half of the coronavirus deaths occurred in locked down facilities like nursing homes where health care professionals are always on staff, coupled with the statistics regarding medical errors and iatrogenic disease, makes perfect sense, does it not? What makes no sense is locking healthy people in their homes and capriciously shutting down businesses for months on end. 
In my opinion, the only rational response to the epidemic would be to urgently address the failure of America's medical system. All of the money and time wasted bailing out markets and propping up a bankrupted economy could instead have been used to fix the real problem. Then, maybe some good would've come from this nightmare.
Yet, even now, the rare comments I see such as mine are often viciously trolled by...whom?

Ca. is not tapering down cases as well as other states. The Santa Clara Public Health director, who initiated the nation's first lockdown advised we are opening up too soon.

My family has two houses, one in SF, one in Yolo Co. next to Sacramento. Both areas offered about 2 weeks of testing this month. In Yolo, the information came via Nextdoor, not the local news paper that I scan. There were no statements as to what the goals of this testing was, so who knows what it will tell us. If we want to sample, why not do the sampling scientifically so there is meaning in the numbers. As it is, just a random Nextdoor announcement  only tells you who shows up for testing and who knows what that means.  In SF notices were taped to front doors, urging everyone to get tested. Were all neighborhoods notified? I would have expected more from our public health departments.

I am still sheltering at home,but increasingly resentful our restrictions and failing economy are due to the utter failure of our government leadership and, much as it hurts for this medical professional to say, the failure of most of our public health institutions.

I'm tired of the media claiming that California is one of the ""hardest hit"" Covid-19 states when frankly it just isn't true on a per-capita basis.

   I voted for you, respect you, and  understand the reason we are opening too soon is that folks are not getting support, the corporate wealth is, even that which was supposedly geared towards small business, that stimulus checks have not come for many, and, in my circle, it is the poorest who have not gotten them. 
   But we will come to the same end if we open sooner than proper.  The only prudent alternative is stringent  state laws, unfailingly enforced, governing safe practice.  Having to close again due to the coming surge (and it is coming) will be just as, if not more,  economically devastating than staying closed. The huge emotional whiplash for us all, the right, middle and left will surely rip us apart.
  Likely it will be highly unpopular, we are a nation that wants its cake and to eat it top.  Possibly  you'll not be elected again, or get a boost to higher office, but you can save lives and leave a functioning state and, by example, nation for all children to become adults."

He often brags that he stopped people coming into USA from China BUT thousands of Americans returned from China & were not quarantined.
Also tens of thousands of Americans & Europeans were allowed to enter USA while coronavirus raged in Italy, Spain, France & other European countries> they were jammed in US airport arrival areas & also not quarantined. 
All of this was a complete failure by the US Govt, Trump's Govt. So today less than 3 months after the virus started in USA the US will record it's 100,000'th death from coronavirus AND thousands more Americans will die from this virus.
Trump's total mismanagement of this crisis is the main reason for these deaths plus 38 million Americans losing their jobs. Now some experts are predicting up to 40% of these lost jobs will not be there when the crisis is over and the virus cases & deaths will spike again earlier than next fall.

TX, FL, GA, NC, IA, AL, and MO are all seeing RECORD increases in daily and weekly cases and/or death tolls, and should actually be ""shut down"" again (or for the first time).

According to every major virologist, epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist, we now risk not just a second wave in the fall/winter (which may be more virulent, and appear at the same time as seasonal flu), but NO END to the first wave: i.e., it will simply continue as States re-open too widely too quickly, and new outbreaks occur.  Nursing homes, assisted living facilities, meat-packing and other food plants, prisons, and jails have been the leading places for huge outbreaks, and now we can add large warehouses (e.g., Amazon, UPS, Kroger, USPS et al) and houses of worship.

In one case, after allowing non-essential services to open, a hair salon in MO was the locus for a new cluster of 130 people because the two owner/stylists did not realize they were both asymptomatic carriers, and spread it to almost every customer who came in the first week.

If this number is extrapolated for all 2020, the total number of deaths in 2020 would be 9,120.  The population in California reported at the beginning of May is 39.78 million.  Rounding the population number down to 39 million and rounding the number of COVID-19 deaths up to 10,000 means that the death rate from COVID-19 for the year 2020 would be (rounded up from 25.64) 26/100,000.  This is an increase in the death rate of 4.3% from 609 to 635/100,000.

My wife and I were discussing the pandemic and both wondered what ever happened to Elon Musk's insistence that he'd reopen the Teslan manufacturing plant in the East Bay. Was he arrested, for example?

I checked. Turns out he was NOT arrested. Nor was anyone else. The plant reopened, and has been open ever since. The State of California simply OK'd the reopening, and that was that.

I don't know whether infections have occurred at the reopened Tesla plant, since that seems to be something that none of the media sources I read (the NYT, for example) deems worth reporting. At least one reader would like to know. The basic question is: 

'If the economy in my area reopens, am I more likely to catch the virus, or will my odds be about the same?""

Infection rates in reopened areas were predicted to ""spike"" soon after reopening. Some states (e.g., Georgia, Oklahoma, Colorado, Alaska) reopened several weeks ago, and some states never locked down in the first place. Have infection rates spiked in those states? If ""spikes"" haven't occurred, have rates nevertheless increased?

But why guess, when we have scientific data ready at hand? 

Many states (Georgia, for example) have been reopened for several weeks now, and some states never closed in the first place. Did the predicted ""spikes"" occur in those states, or not? If spikes did not occur, did infection rates nevertheless increase? 

As the reader probably guesses, I already know the answers to these questions: No spikes, no increase. But other questions are relevant. For example, has the infection rate been lower in lockdown states or in reopened states, or are the rates about the same in both places? 

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but I've never seen that key question answered anywhere. To rephrase it:

""Since lockdowns are hard on people (especially those who've lost their jobs, or soon will), should states reopen, or will reopening drive up infection rates too much, so that states should stay locked down?"""

So the important story about ""cases"" should use some population based denominator. California is 33rd in cases per million persons at 2,528.  Texas is doing OK too, with 1,991 cases per million population. 
Population density is a key driver of case counts/population. Large cities will generally have a higher case count/population. Cities with large, underserved, poor populations with the major American Comorbidities of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes will fare worst of all. Another dimension, a sad one, is  the total number of elderly. The US has about 53 million elderly and at 14-16% of the population is actually a long way from the highest proportion of elderly. But, it has the MOST in numbers, and numbers (not %) count. Unfortunately with COVID, people my age are at very high risk.

Without Federal support, the financial pain to the City due to the pandemic will be severe but relatively short-lived.  Budget cuts to various City services will hurt bad but will not endure.

As the hot weather moves in, there should be an announcement that mask wearing is only mandated for enclosed public spaces and mass transportation—NOT to simply take a walk by yourself outside while keeping your distance from others. We should take a cue from England in this regard, which has issued very sensible, balanced guidance on mask-wearing.

Until this article appeared, I've always heard just the opposite: that the West coast is NOT suffering from the virus as the East coast is. Even though this article says the opposite -- i.e., that CA is one of the hardest-hit states -- ""struggling"" is certainly not the right word. Though I've heard of others getting infected and dying (mostly back East), I've never actually met someone who has either had the virus or knows anyone out here who has had it. That includes LA. I even talked to a guy who lives in LA but grew up in NYC, and he says none of his relatives, even those who never left NYC, has had the virus. I don't deny that many people have had it, but very few Californians have -- certainly not enough that we're ""struggling"" out here.

""Deplorability"" is in the eye of the beholder. Democratic states let everyone vote, knowing full well that voters will consider most or all of their opponents to be ""deplorable.""

This would be an effective tactic, if they were complete and the state or national borders could be controlled to avoid reentry of the disease.

There is no  control of movement of people across state-borders and little for transit of the federal border.  Once a quarantine is eased do we not expect no expect a resurgence infections?  What then?  Periodic infection waves and periodic quarantines?

Not in SF (my dear wife cuts my hair in the meantime). But it's only a matter of time (and not much of it) before SF-based hair cutters complain that their counterparts in other CA counties are operating again, and so they should be allowed to operate too. They'll undoubtedly argue that their ""reopened"" counterparts are stealing customers, which are likely to be in short supply. And guess what? Those arguments will be persuasive. Just as Elon Musk recently re-opened the East Bay Tesla plant (daring Gavin Newsom to arrest him, to which Gavin Newsom responded by ""allowing"" Tesla to reopen), so too will other Bay Area businesses.

Testing indeed has increased (any SF resident can now be tested, free of charge -- our son has been tested twice already -- ""negative"" both times; my wife and I haven't been tested, but we're comforted to know that we can at any time). And increased testing indeed yields more ""positives"" (although 80-90% of tests reportedly are ""negative""). Indeed, many people have, or have had, the virus without even knowing it; 35% of them have no symptoms at all.

Increased testing is good, but it's incompatible with another ""test"" for reopening: a sustained downturn in the infection rate. The one and only test for reopening should be the ability (or not) of local hospitals to handle COVID-19 patients and other patients. By nearly all accounts, hospital admissions are way down, despite the pandemic, and so this ""test"" has been satisfied pretty much everywhere. If so, reopen."

But most lenders don't share the pain. Most lenders defer monthly payments but they don't reduce the interest rate, and some even accrue interest (almost always at a higher-than-market rate) on the deferred payments.

2020-05-27 21:30,"We've often heard that anyone who advocates reopening is not paying attention to science. 

Is this fair?

In the US, the infection rates and death rates are pretty much the same in ""reopened"" states and ""lockdown"" states. In fact, according to the NYT, the ""top"" area in both categories is Gallup, NM (NM being a ""lockdown"" state). I have no doubt that  masks and social distancing help a little, but I doubt they help very much. 

But why guess, when we have actual scientific data?

Several states (Georgia, Colorado, Oklahoma and Alaska, for example) ""reopened"" about a month ago, and some other states (South Dakota, for example) never locked down in the first place. Presumably we know what has happened in those states. Has the infection rate spiked, as was predicted? Has the death rate (as also was predicted)? Or not?

As the reader might guess, I already know the answers to these questions: No, the infection rate has not spiked, nor has the death rate, in any of these states. But even if the rate hasn't spiked, has it nevertheless increased? No, both rates have decreased. 

What I DON'T know, however, is how the reopened (or never-closed) areas compare to the still locked-down areas. That, it seems to me, is the big question: 

""Is someone more likely to get the virus in a reopened area or in a still-locked down area?"" 

That's the key question."

OK, discount it a bit for the older people who died, but the VSL already does that.

I think the covid19 metrics are somewhat dated and should be changed. Reporting accumulated confirmed covid19 cases across 2+ months doesn't speak to what most want to know. My guess is that most confirmed infections from March and April are run their course.  In the beginning only those with severe symptoms were tested but with increased testing being performed, the the count likely includes people with a less severe covid19. 

What is interesting is first, how many active confirmed cases are there [and whether the number increasing or decreasing], Second, the fatality rate and third, a running 7-day average test count including some figure-of-merit that addresses how deep into the infected pool testing has progressed."

Or alternatively, his second, boastful personality emerges, and he declares that he has done a marvelous job in containing the spread and limiting the number of deaths, which otherwise could have been in the millions.  Perhaps this could have happened if his administration had done even less  than the marginal and belated efforts done thus far. 

By any measure he way underperformed. To assess the consequence of his lack of action one needs only to compare the US response to those of other leading economies whose infection rates can be assumed to be factual as well. A rough measure of effective action is revealed in the time a country's infection rate lingers at half of its maximum rate of daily infections. For the European countries of Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and other smaller countries this dwell time is in the  twenties to low thirties days range, with Italy at 40. This was achieved through heavy testing, contact tracing, supplying PPE's and enforcing strict distancing rules and quarantines. Even the UK managed it at 50 days. For the US we are  at 62 days and counting, similar to Sweden at 60, which flaunted nearly all rules and stayed open."

In most states, this virus has been mild. In TX and FL for example, less than a typical flu year.
Consider deaths per million in MA is 939, NY 1536. Then look at TX (53) or the majority of states. Dramatically different.
Interesting that the NYT and most news organization didn't even report the latest CDC mortality rate numbers. Latest mortality rates from the CDC... remembering the flu mortality is .1% (which we collectively ignore). 
-- 0-49 years old: 0.05% (the flu kills babies and the pregnant)
-- 50-64 years old: 0.2%
-- 65+ years old: 1.3%
-- Overall ages: 0.4%
In response:
* Added nearly 6 trillion to national debt
* Laid-off or furloughed millions of workers
* Killed small businesses
* Crippled major industries
* Ruined the tourism industry
* Bankrupted the service industry
* Exacerbated mental health problems
* Subjected women to abuse and battering
* Shut down schools and colleges
* Given unbridled power to unelected officials
* Increased suicides
* Delayed surgeries and treatments for profound illnesses
* Infringed upon countless important civil liberties...

There were few headlines about it.

And there were no political blame games.

The greater New York City area has about 25% of all the deaths with this one.

W. Europe did not introduce a travel ban from China unlike Trump. Trump saved huge numbers of lives. 

The only area where our per capita death rate is substantially ahead of W. Europe is in NY area.   More than half of US deaths are nursing home related; more than 40% of US deaths are in NY area.  

Cuomo ordered that nursing homes admit coronavirus patients, but did not order to separate them.  This caused substantially greater deaths in NY area than in other states.  Look at very low Fla. per capita death rate (with their aged population; they did not make the Cuomo error with nursing homes.

My instinct is to blame Trump, of course. Or Xi Jing-Ping and the stupid, stupid system of government they have in China. But if I'm honest I can't blame it on anybody but us humans.

We are not designed to operate under these circumstances. I recently thought about why Italy was hit so hard and fast. Well, thinking it through I came to the conclusion that it was religion and compassion. 

After the first victims had died the Italian families came together to mourn. Those who had cared for the dying (and got infected, but were not yet symptomatic) hugged and kissed their brothers, sisters, aunts, nieces, nephews, children, friends, business partners, the lot.

I'm convinced that's the reason the virus spread so quickly through Italy, Spain and France, all ""touchy-feely"" nations, but didn't have quite the same effect in somber Germany. I hope someone will do a study about this one day.

In the meanwhile I live about 5 miles away from a recent Corona hot-spot. A Russian church community thought it would be a great idea to sing indoors without wearing masks! Maybe ~100 infected. Now Corona might be in my apartment block. Just spiffy!

2020-05-27 22:47,"Trump continues to cajole the normal folk who have to work, along with faith groups and lastly those who he believes he can influence in the election.
They are like sheep to the slaughter and are recognised as such by the President who doesnt waste an ounce of compassion on them in his quest to be reelected.
4 more years of this autocratic behaviour will truly change the United States of America."

He can try to deflect all he wants.

DJT has made it very clear who is in charge. It’s him!

And look at the country...

- Record unemployment 

- 100,000 dead from a pandemic that was mocked up almost 4 years ago 

- An economy unable to grow

-No healthcare plan (after 4 YEARS!)

DJT is done.

Still, I feel it is appropriate to thank Trump & all his enablers and supporters (especially the GOP politicians who are afraid of him) for this painful and tragic loss, the blood of those Americans are on his hand and those who support and enable him.  For they have supported and enabled a corrupt and incompetent president to lead us to this carnage. Peace be with all the lost souls & their loved ones.  We shall overcome!"

In 2020, United States seized being the world's leader. Falling under the weight of accumulated lies , self aggrandizing,  and delusion. It's demise probably accelerated by a couple of decades by arrival of a Latin American styled populist and a con man.  The final coup de grace delivered by a corona virus. 

The pandemic was entirely predictable and perfectly manageable early on.  However, succumbing to banal lies and TV optics, the US failed and the world failed with it.
 
As the UK ceded its world's influence and power to the United States after World War 1, so the United States in failing to rise to the challenge is ceding international influence and power to China.

We note that 3000+ people died on 9/11, and perhaps because it was a terrorist attack instead of a virus, our nation went into immediate mourning, shock, outrage over the loss.
Now we are at 100,000 pandemic dead in just a few months, and other than the poignant and beautiful NYT front-page memorial to the dead, a strange lack of grief and national consternation is masking the tremendous catastrophe that has befallen us.
The virus isn't alone responsible for this death and destruction. Trump's deliberate, wanton, reckless disregard for science and prudence contributed to tens of thousands of needless deaths."

But it is also perfectly fair to say that had he responded with competence, honesty, empathy, and trust in his scientific advisors, the number would have been much lower. 

How much lower? My guess is that we would be maxing out at 50,000 or less.

But history will show that through his own words and actions Trump has failed this nation in a way unprecedented in its 250-year history.

Will the United States ever recover from Donald Trump's failures?

My answer: Not in my lifetime."
2020-05-27 22:54,"What a sad marker this is for America - to be first in the world in fatalities, and what a lot of grief there is in the land for all those who have passed on!  If the Federal response had been better coordinated, more coherent and timely, according to epidemiological studies most of these American deaths could have been avoided.  But Trump's approach was through false reassurance, downplaying the pandemic, using every occasion to boast about himself and as a substitute for a campaign rally.  Unable by temperament to accept criticism or correction, the battle for Trump was always only to ensure his re-election at any cost.  It was never about the most effective ways to manage the national crisis. Now the Republican strategy is to blame China, while Trump distracts public attention with lies and bogus accusations, including of murder, to smear his critics such as Scarborough.    Such a catastrophic inability to manage and mitigate a disaster is is a guarantee of repeated tragedies if allowed to continue. It could have been foreseen as the result of electing a scam artist unfit for public office to be president. We can only hope that America can at least after November 2020 regain competence, decency, and honesty in government.  May its people be safer in future!"

2020-05-27 22:47,It’s only natural that a pandemic that viciously spread due to globalization and international travel would hit us the hardest.  No nation has ever been as aggressive or successful in pushing this economic dogma with perhaps the exception of the British Empire.  Our culture will figure out a way to profit from pandemics and unpreparedness in no time.  Does anybody believe this virus is going to be “the big one?”  The future will be grim because both parties will forever be globalist and no nation is safe because this really is the new world order.

2020-05-27 22:35,"100,000 deaths serve as a marker for the many inexplicable things about our government's response, including:
1) Refusing to heed repeated early warnings that the pandemic was coming and preparing for it.
2) Refusing to invoke the Defense Production Act to take over production of PPE, ventilators, and reagents and supplies for testing.
3) Refusing to take over the supply chains in order to make make sure supplies were distributed cost effectively, efficiently and in a pattern commensurate with need.
4) Refusing to make mandatory the CDC safety guidelines for making workplaces, long term care facilities, prisons and churches safe.
5) Refusing to deliver a consistent a forceful message to the public about their personal behavior, and to state and local governments about adhering to CDC guidelines for reopening. 
6) Failing to ensure that data reporting was accurate, complete and timely.
7) Failing to mobilize government resources to deliver food to hungry Americans rather than letting food rot or be thrown away.
8) Refusing to make sure that relief funds were delivered quickly equitably, and in sufficient amounts.
9) Refusing to collaborate with the WHO to strengthen the global response and influence WHO policy for the better.

Many of these failings continue as we speak.  I hope our government officials will visit some graves of those departed engage in some introspection about this dreadful state of affairs."

Some of this was unavoidable because the virus was spreading before anyone knew it. But the means we always had to deal with such a national problem was stifled by President Trump who was afraid that doing so would spoil the economy and his chances for re-election. Not a man who actually thinks much before he acts. 

Once he grasped the fact that the pandemic was too big a problem to ignore he was so far behind every effort that he made just highlighted what a mess he’d let develop.

But there was no plan, just denial, so we got chaos instead.

Your president obviously does not know how to manage the situation, and is too arrogant or pig headed, or maybe just not smart enough, to look at the success other countries have had around the world. The only way to control the virus is through a unified effort of social distancing and hygiene, but also a strong social support network so 'afterwards' there is still something left to rebuild on. This is no time for division or to use the virus to demonstrate what team you're on.

Today in the US we have over 100,000 dead.  That’s more than Americans who died in Vietnam.  Trump ignored all warnings of the coming pandemic and refused to face truth because his sick mind wouldn’t/couldn’t go there. That‘s not an excuse: in a court of law he’s still a murderer.  He’s clearly delusional.  Psychiatry knows that people with his type of mental illness, with increasing paranoia when feeling personally threatened, are a potential danger.  The psych. intake interview assessment always evaluates a patient re potential for suicide and/or homicide, which are two faces of a same impulse...killing.  The Trump case is challenging because he’s the President but the facts are the same.  If he were to go around shooting or stabbing people we’d intervene.  So.....?   What we’re experiencing is AS IF he were actively killing because he is allowing people to die through his inaction, paranoia, incompetence, etc....   So what is our government going to do about this?  Can’t we have a coup?  What are WE the people going to do?  Do we know how to March on Washington anymore?

100,000 Americans are dead from the coronavirus since February 29 this year.

There is clearly one and only one person to blame for this crisis and that is Donald Trump.  He had briefings in the first weeks of January this year and chose to do nothing but deny that the virus would even hit us.  He could have done what any president would have done and that is to organize the Federal and State health and medical science people and organizations around the country to get ready to fight this disease.  Trump did NOTHING but ignore the problem until it exploded in his face.  And now 100,000 of our fellow citizens are dead who wouldn't be if Trump had acted in January.

There was a Medical Doctor interviewed on NPR news the other day who was asked what he thought the death toll will be by this September.  His reply was that he expected another 70,000 to 100,000 dead on top of the expected 100,000 we have now reached.

Had it been Obama or Biden, this epidemic would not have spread as it has, and the pandemic task force, begun by Obama. would have been prepared with adequate tests, masks and other supplies.

What's being overlooked is the fact that nearly 3 million Americans die every year.  The majority of these deaths are of civilians who lived full lives.  We're all are going to die someday of something.  You don't get honored for contracting an illness and dying.  These aren't young people who sacrificed their lives defending America.  These aren't soldiers.  Enough is enough.  Now, let the liberals attack me for being insensitive.  For being reasonable.  For listening to my internal compass and speaking up."
2020-05-27 23:38,"We had a chance to nip the spread in the bud.  But it was spreading undetected for weeks even before we apparently knew it.  Trump played it down, putting us on the back foot.

We need to learn some lessons.

First, precautionary travel bans are useful (despite what we heard from experts). You can always open up again.  It's relatively painless, considering the alternative.

We also need to have a surplus stockpile of PPE.  Why did officials tell people to not wear masks for a whole month?  That appears to have been disinformation intended to serve the greater purpose of reserving stockpiles for health care workers.  We don't need manipulation; we need an adequate stockpile and the domestic capacity to produce PPE, tests and medicine.   Autarky is making a comeback after this.

We'll need a test and trace infrastructure in place for next time.  That means all the apps and training that we saw South Korea roll out.

And finally, we need a better way to isolate the sick, elderly and vulnerable.  Nursing homes saw 33% of the total deaths.  Cuomo sent 4,500 Covid patients back to nursing homes contributing to 5,000 deaths.  Poorer people in multifamily housing have 3 generations living together.  We need a way to house and feed these people outside of these tight spaces.

2020-05-27 23:48,"100,000 and growing is a terrible death toll by any measure. However as long as we don’t have a treatment or vaccine, we should prepare for this number to continue growing. All the social distancing we are doing is only delaying our exposure to the virus, it is not preventing it. I am disturbed by the implied assumption that we can prevent infections through social distancing. We can merely slow them, that’s it.

The best we can do at this point of the pandemic is manage healthcare capacity to ensure that when we are exposed and if we require emergency care, there will be a spot for us at the hospital.

We should not downplay the economic hardship that comes with a systematic lockdown either. Evictions, homelessness, hunger, and non-COVID deaths will happen (are happening) if we take a blind “let’s just stay home till we find a vaccine” approach which seems to be the one that many prefer. A fair assessment of risk vs other risks is necessary. Nothing is risk free in life. Just look at the lower number of fatal car accidents since we started the lockdown. Does it mean we should not allow driving to reduce car accident fatalities moving forward? A better question is how much risk should we tolerate and how do we protect those whom we know are most vulnerable without destroying everyone’s livelihood in the process."

* In terms of infection rate, the US is just about mid-tear as judged by infections per million against countries with a population of more than 4 million and at least 5,000 infections, with 4.5K/per million (Statista, World Bank, Johns Hopkins)
* In terms of the mortality rate for the top 10 countries with the most infections, we have the best (lowest) rate, at 5.9 (Johns Hopkins)

Yes, some people died who would have lived many more years, but that happens every year with traffic accidents, other diseases, and violent affrays.   You just can't expect all 325 million of us to make it to a ripe old age unscathed.   

People care about their friends and family, and feel it is deeply unfair that their parents or other loved ones died.  Deaths that hit you personally are always upsetting.   But you can't mourn everyone who dies, and you know that eventually it'll be you.

I remember being a young fellow and not thinking too much about old age and death.   Yes, if you are 25, you know in exactly what year you'll be 65, and what year you'll be 90.  But if you are alive, and your parents and family are still alive, you don't see that year as ever arriving, even though you know it will.   So for younger people, death comes as a shock.   

But if you're now part of the oldest generation in your family, your view is different.   You know death is real, you see friends your own age passing on, and you wonder how long you have left.   But now you know for sure that everyone really is mortal, and you don't have as long as you might like.   Where did the time go?   Was it just 1980 a few years ago?"

Exactly what you'd expect from our ultra expensive pharma-based healthcare system ranked 27th in the world that ignores, discredits, and disparages the hundreds of non-pharma biomolecules that are effective, safe, and cheap - but non-patentable.  

Other countries successfully use these alongside the few targeted hit or miss pharma drugs that sometimes help.  We do not because our healthcare and our government is captured by pharma.  The FDA, CDC, WHO, and NIH are all captured agencies via the revolving door and pharma funding.  

Yet people and the media do not object to the fact that our so-called healthcare is 100% ineffective against this virus - can't prevent or treat it.  Or that it's been ineffective against the fifty-year epidemic of chronic diseases.

People think it's normal for healthcare to kill 440,000 people with avoidable errors every year, and another 100,000 with correctly prescribed pharmaceuticals.  That's far more than the forever wars and far more than this virus - Every Year.

Apparently everyone believes the pharma programming that there's no alternative, and that MD's save people's lives.  Both wrong.  

A 2000 JAMA study found that MD's are the third-leading cause of death.  A 2003 more comprehensive follow-up study found MD's are the number one leading cause of death.

--Buried in the campaign finance reports available to the public are some troubling connections between a group of wealthy donors with ties to Russia and their political contributions to President Donald Trump and a number of top Republican leaders…In 2015-16 Blavatnik's political contributions soared and made a hard right turn as he pumped $6.35 million into GOP political action committees, with millions of dollars going to top Republican leaders including Sens. Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham.

He and his minions are responsible for the wildly successful administration objective of keeping them in safety, and at the same time, handing over as little money, safety, and support to the ""little people"" who, it's clear as day, he wishes to die of natural causes so they don't deplete the government piggy bank or, literally, to continue to exist to pester him about his corruption and authoritarian fantasies.

2020-05-28 0:19,"While we pass 100,000 deaths, many of them in nursing homes and other care facilities, Hong Kong has something like four deaths and none in their care homes. Why? Because they learned from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and put a plan in place. 

As soon as the outbreak occurred in the China, organizations and businesses sprung into action. Masks and PPEs stocks had been stockpiled in advance to respond to infectious outbreaks. Care facilities banned visitors altogether.  Testing was free and plentiful. Doctors came in to check the residents instead of taking them out for most treatment.  

In contrast, back in 2017, the Trump Administration dismantled our pandemic response team and killed new federal regulations that would have forced the health care industry to prepare for an airborne infectious disease pandemic such as COVID-19. 

After the N1H1 flu in 2009 outbreak, OSHA started work to formulate federal regulations to protect health care workers from airborne pathogens such as influenza, tuberculosis or the coronavirus. Federal records reviewed by NPR show OSHA went step by step through that process for six years, and by early 2016 the new infectious disease rule was ready. The Obama White House formally added it to a list of regulations scheduled to be implemented in 2017. 

Instead, here we are — thousands of Americans dead, our health care workers still short of PPEs, and our seniors  and communities of color considered expendable."

If the life expectancy is 80 years, the number of ""lost years"" is 6 times higher for each soldier than for COVID. In other words, the lost number of years of life for COVID to equal Vietnam would really be closer to 300,000 people. Again, it sounds a bit cold but the measure of life is also the number of years remaining."
2020-05-28 1:10,"I get sick of hearing how the number of coronavirus deaths in America exceeds all US deaths in Vietnam, and now, in all conflicts since the Korean War. 

It seems the real victims of those wars of choice, all those people from other countries who were killed in those conflicts, simply don’t register in the American consciousness. 

Well they do matter, and the fact is that the numbers killed were staggering. 
In Vietnam alone, more than three million were killed, thirty times the current US coronavirus death toll. Large numbers were also injured, many seriously. And all this in a small country with a rapidly growing population at that time of around thirty million. 

After losing the war, the US applied harsh sanctions to Vietnam for decades, but has been unable to prevent the country’s rapid post-war development. Ironically, Vietnam has handled the coronavirus pandemic very well, with only a few hundred infected and zero deaths so far. 

Perhaps instead of ignoring Vietnam, America should be looking closely at what they are doing to fight this dreadful scourge."

I'm sure it could not possibly be the case that the paper is not giving New Yorkers, and the whole country (since New York accounts for 1 out of every 3 deaths, not to mention a central spreading point) because assigning blame to local liberal democrats doesn't fit their agenda. It violates their new style guide, blame everything on Trump.

""Coronavirus Case Counts Are Meaningless*
*Unless you know something about testing. And even then, it gets complicated.""

And really, it's much less important to know how many had the virus since the beginning of time or January, than how many have it now, in your city, in your neighborhood, on your block. Go to the covid19.healthdata.org site for something like that. 
Is anyone doing anything or reporting about workers who will likely lose their jobs if they get tested with very mild symptoms and the results are positive? Does anyone think this is not happening? With 25% unemployment, is there a shortage of delivery people ready as replacements?"

2020-05-28 1:40,"A parable. Three times per week in the Tri-Cities, on average, local leaders walk a designated citizen to the center of our scenic Cable Bridge over the Mighty Columbia. They help that person over the rail using a little set of stairs built for the purpose. The city representative confirms they have their feet on the outside edge and both hands on the rail. It is their choice to let go. Nobody pushes them. As soon as both hands are on the rail and the hopeful patient gives a nod, the officials walk back to the shore to their cars and drive home. Those often-sick, often-old people look up at the cable towers, the stunning white cables, the blue sky, the billowing clouds, and pay for our freedom with a moment of discomfort. 
It’s very windy at the apex of the bridge. Some of the women and men hold on for hours before losing their grip. Some of them record their last thoughts on their phones. It’s funny how many wish they’d finished a TV series on Netflix. Many just let go right away. The final moment is sometimes a body-slap like a tiny clap, sometimes a kerplunk … a handful, more than you’d think, pull off a dive and survive long enough to fill their infected lungs with dark, cool, swirling river.
A lot of the people here prove true faith by staying mask-free. If we surrender to ‘science’, we flush our freedom down the toilet. You can remain at the base of the Cable Bridge for the Ceremony until your Uncle John, Aunt Mary... Mother. Father... or other loved-one has let go."

The Times tries to put things in perspective by comparing the death toll to the number of US military combat fatalities in ""every conflict since the Korean War.""  It would be far more relevant to compare the death toll from Covid to the estimated number of deaths from influenza over the past two years. That number is also greater than the number of who died from Covid. Significantly, over half the deaths from flu could likely have been prevented if everyone had taken the safe, simple and inexpensive step of getting vaccinated against flu.  Only about half the US population has bothered getting their flu shots in past years.

Let's remember that the lockdowns themselves are causing many deaths; just yesterday I read in this newspaper how vaccines for preventable diseases like measles are becoming unavailable because the lockdowns have shut down air travel. Deciding when and how to re-open the economy involves many complex, difficult, and highly consequential decisions. But they should be scientific decisions, not political ones. The scientists and leaders who address them must be considering the entire picture, and avoid tunnel vision, and especially avoid politicization."

Yes, it's an awful toll. Yes, earlier and stronger Government action like isolation o those most at risk of dying would have made it much lower. Yes, less stupidity by citizens would have helped. However, conflating Covid's toll with the death toll of war is nonsensical. In war, the average age of combat deaths was closer to 20 than Covid's 75. While all life is valued, the chances of a 20 year old dying from causes other than war is low compared to the chances of a 75+ person dying from something other than Covid. How many aged and frail Covid victims would have met their end around this time if not for Covid? In Australia, the 'flu case count at this stage of the season is down 99% (30000 vs 300), largely due to social distancing. That's saved many old and frail lives from 'flu, only a few of whom have succumbed to Covid instead."

He has the best Intelligence in the world with all the resources of the most powerful and consequential country in the world at his ready disposal. This has been wilful and criminal negligence. If I steer my car into 10 people deliberately and kill them it has same result for the people as if I did it through carelessness. Either way I would not get away with it. Teachers have duty of care of their students. If their negligence results in even one getting injured, the teacher is held accountable.
Trump has duty of care of 230 million people. His wilful disregard of multiple warnings is directly causative of this catastrophe.
America has the best Intelligence, most resources and the highest number of deaths (per capita as well as raw numbers) in the world. The weak link is clearly the unhinged commander-in-chief."

People who were let go by their employers are getting an extra $600 per week. That is $2400 per month on top of their unemployment. There is no reason people should be stiffing their landlord under those circumstances. Many people are collecting more on unemployment than they did while working so why should they not have to pay their rent? If you want to freeze evictions for those in need, there should have been some sort of means testing to ensure that people are not gaming the system. But there wasn't and now many people are gaming the system."

There are all ages who die from this awful virus.
Also, people with pre-existing conditions are everywhere you look and more susceptible to succumbing to this coronavirus. I am in my early 40s and I am one of them. I know of younger people without pre-existing conditions who have died from this. Also, any age group is important . We are all people with lives, loved ones, etc. and 100, 000 people lost in such a short period of time is so unimaginable .
I’m truly at a loss for words. So many people could have been saved if different decisions were made. And the numbers keep going up.

On April 26 the stable genius made the following categorical statements bases on his IQ and intuition: “The minimum number was 100,000 lives and I think we’ll be substantially under that number,” Trump said during a White House press conference. “Hard to believe that if you had 60,000, you can never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking.”  On May 6 President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration’s management of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States represents “maybe our best work.

There is a spirit of civic duty, solidarity, and cooperation. The impact to their economies has been far less significant. The politicizing of the virus, and the resistance to wearing masks, has been a public health disaster in the United States. Trump's failed response has magnified the scope of the disaster manyfold.

It would make sense to reduce COVID coverage, and fully eliminate COVID stories pertaining to those under age 50.  The number of deaths in that age group are almost undetectably low.

Every citizen entitled to vote became the necessary letter in due time. In decades, I never heard of election frauds in Germany because of mail ballots. That's an example of German Gründlichkeit. 

A couple of years a go, France was hit by a high  heat wave which caused a few thousand deaths among the elderly. Since, when a heat wave hits France, every elderly country-wide is regularly called on the phone by city hall workers for checking whether they need water, assistance for shopping, or medial aid.

government, local or hospitals, and most of all senior care centers) not have stocked up masks in large numbers before the pandemic blew up in the US, leading the CDC to claim they were not necessary or effective (right... that is why medical staff wear them). Or maybe the real reason was to pretend there was no virus, no panic, as Trump believed. Or maybe no one would have worn them anyway until deaths piled up.

Our efficient just-in-time production (not even local, and happens to be in China) , coupled with the GOP’s oft ostrich philosophy (except when politically expedient, such as pointing out debt, unless it’s to cut taxes or give taxpayer millions to big business) led us to unnecessary deaths and likely exarcebated the lockdown.

After the SARS outbreak years ago, we kept a small supply of masks on hand, just in case. (They are usually inexpensive, and useful for dirty household or garden tasks if no pandemic should strike). If we could do this, the way one stocks extra batteries, so could everyone."

Trump put a hand picked team in place and they proceeded to give horrible guidance that has left 100K dead and 500K+ infected. The early CDC and Surgeon General's statements and actions surely added tens of thousands to the deaths.

The finality is that, with the videos of cops executing blacks, there is no way that any ranking officer could feel that he has a totally unified force at his command. The rift in America's fabric is so deep that every front team is in question. We blacks just cannot see dying for people killing more of us than wars.

The West Coast strain much less so.  The West Coast strain has become dominant in the US which is why places like Florida are re opening without experiencing New York like surges. If this is true, and the West Coast strain is more adaptive (evidenced by more rapid spread) then it bodes well for the fall. I’m not a scientist so this is all based on observation but I think this article supports that theory."

In my wife's case, she had classic COVID-19 symptoms late Oct/early Nov. Her flu test was negative. Her Dr. concluded it was something like pneumonia but not pneumonia. My wife recovered at home. 

The two major sticking points to our theory has been 1) the consensus this originated in China in Dec and 2) why didn't more people get sick if my wife and friends had it? 

Well, now, as this article states, it's possible some mutations of COVID-19 don't spread/spread for very long. If that turns out to be true, then there definitely could've been mutations of COVID-19 here well before it ""originated"" in China."

She must have called about five times to ask for a test and never got one."

The idea that the corona virus was introduced to our shores in multiple cycles, makes total sense. And even more interesting is that many of the early seeds of the virus did not take hold, or cause a wider transmission.

Until it did.

In a twisted logic, this does lend some credence to president Trump’s early assessment that there were only 15 cases and it would go to zero quite quickly.

Unfortunately, as most experts probably knew from the start, the so called travel bans were as ineffective as sieves at holding water.

Ultimately, the virus got through and took hold. Excoriating Trumps early predictions of the virus not taking hold in the US and making a laughing stock of the US response to the outbreak."

2020-05-28 19:03,"I hope the pandemic is giving people a good look at how science works - especially the collective problem solving based on empirical evidence, reasoned debate, and revision. 

Our 'truths'  are arrived at and established by consensus. And subject to change. That the scientific method is similar to the legal framework of our constitution is no coincidence. They both grow out of the Enlightenment.

It is a great impediment that so many want truths carved in stone and fixed for all time. The craving is natural. But even the Bible and the Constitution, to be 'living texts',  must be open to interpretation, according to accepted protocols. Let alone the 'book of nature.' 

Our economic and environmental activities drive viral transmission. Our policies drive outbreak trajectory. It is remarkable to be able to study this on the genomic level. So often scientific research is ridiculed as a waste of resources. But knowing stuff is good."
2020-05-28 19:07,Its very interesting.  Its not at odds with the University College data from London in so far as the virus travelled in and out of the UK several times starting in November but obviously didn't really kick into high gear re: infectious outbreak.  They also found typical mutation rates of the virus.

Such studies are already in progress.  Be prepared for some surprises that may contradict the conclusions of this article."

It leads with an not so very indirect attack against Trump but buries the most important thing readers need to know and to which most of the comments posted missed: a preliminary version was posted online BUT ""it has not yet been published in a scientific journal"" nor has it even been accepted by a journal---so what if any scientific value does it have? None. Even if it is accepted it proves nothing not unless their findings can be reproduced. Is not this the way science is suppose to work? ! Has the reporter gone through the data? Has the reasoning and data been subject to review?  Clearly, what we have is a rather thin and t poorly supported thesis which the Times reporter has taken out of context and used to attack a position Trump has outlined. Most of what so called science is stating at present will likely be wrong until  time and study get to have their due. Stories like this are less than useless. I dare say the reporter here had very little interest in science and too ill informed to know what the science is. Considering how wrong most computer modeling has been why should the modeling here be taken as more accurate?Most of the outbreak spread out from NYC . Worobey claims that it was a second infection from China to Italy that led to the spread in Europe to U.S and hence giving support to Trump's claim that it was mostly due to China. Oh, what a web we weave NYTimes when you mislead."
2020-05-28 14:22,"The interesting question will be antibodies providing immunity to the earlier version (WA1) confer immunity to the, perhaps more deadly, mutated version (WA2).

They had instead relied on second-hand sources to reach the conclusion that she was an asymptomatic patient in their paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine on January 30.  When they finally spoke to her, they did make a correction to that fact."
2020-05-28 16:53,"Scientifically interesting, but irrelevant for solution strategies. Epidemiologists knew by mid-December that the virus was coming to America. Unfortunately, Trump had already thrown away the pandemic playbook developed under W and Obama, and he ignored the dire warnings experts gave him in January. That’s how we got here, and there is still no coherent strategy, so we can expect the virus to continue to spread."
2020-05-28 17:03,"So the virus that kicked off the epidemic was the one that came from China as the travel ban went into effect— probably from citizens who wanted to get back to their home country before it was completely locked down — and spread through the crush of other panicked citizens at the airport. 

Once again, had Trump allowed regular air travel to continue, as Obama did during H1N1 and Ebola, following the advice of health professionals, we may have escaped a serious outbreak in Washington State."
2020-05-28 22:11,"""For example, while President Trump has frequently claimed that a ban on travelers from China prevented the epidemic from becoming much worse, the new data suggest that the virus that started Washington State’s epidemic arrived roughly two weeks after the ban was imposed on Feb. 2.""

Why doesn't this indicate that cutting off travel from China *did* help curb the epidemic from  becoming much worse? 

 And why is Trump even mentioned in this article at all?  There are so many reasons to despise Donald Trump there is no need to make up more and, more importantly, no reason at all to drag journalism into the gutter.  We need a healthy free press.  We do not need a press that does nothing but reference Trump regardless of the topic.  Trump and his crew will be long gone in a few years at most but will life as we know it survive those few short years or will we have voluntarily given over our ideals, our aspirations and our free press to him as a parting gift?

Things may have been worse had Trump not cut off travel from China.  We'll never know for sure but who cares?"
2020-05-28 16:03,"This is fascinating. Thank you for the summary of this ongoing investigation.  Some take-away messages.

1) The virus can spread widely and quickly
(short interval between introductions and pandemic seeding outbreaks - Tacoma, Italy, NYC each with single-source massive outbreaks)

2) The virus is easily stopped by isolation
(WA 1 [single Seattle individual isolated hospital] and BavPat1 in Germany). 

Together these observation imply that any individual infection can either end a line (extinction) by effective isolation or ignite an outbreak. A technical aside: because the reproductive number (R) is a population average, these results, which imply that many infections cause few or no subsequent infections (low R), meaning that those infections that do spread involve many more new infections (high R).  

Because uncontrolled infections are just as damaging to our economy as stay at home orders, but also result in many more deaths (not to mention misery of illness and fear induced paranoia and chaos) it is imperative - IMPERATIVE - to establish wide-spread testing and contact tracing to:

1) IDENTIFY and ISOLATE infected individuals.

There is no number 2, because each individual failure to IDENTIFY and ISOLATE infected individuals leads to a potential new outbreak source."
2020-05-28 18:14,"This is pretty interesting as an example of how science works. Early work gets examined and its findings enlarged upon, or challenged, or outright refuted, and on and on. It never reaches an actual ""end."" It's also interesting from a social and political standpoint. What are we to make of these findings? For one thing, this should further debunk the narrative that Trump staved off a bigger disaster by ""shutting down China.""  It always bothered me that the media seemed to go along with Trump's narrative while NYT and others pointed out that many tens of thousands came to the US from the infection centers in China after Trump's phony ""travel ban"" which applied only to Chinese nationals."

2020-05-29 2:54,"As an actual scientist it’s frustrating to read these articles because the authors, usually with soft degrees, are really relying on their sources to properly interpret the science. There is often no ability by the press to have a healthy skepticism when it comes to highly technical science. 

The bottom line is simple- that the virus mutates and WA1 didn’t resemble the mutated virus of the later outbreak does not mean that mutation must have come from outside. The virus could have mutated similarly to the European virus based on some natural selective process based in the Northwest (I.e. cold and rainy). 

The press has unfortunately had a challenging time understanding this virus and coverage of it has been quite poor."

2020-05-27 13:38,"“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

― Benjamin Graham

Based on valuation measures we find best-correlated with actual S&P 500 total returns across a century of history, today's run to 3000 on S&P 500 brings likely 10-12 yr SPX returns to negative levels, and rival the 2000 and 1929 extremes.

There is currently no ""E"" in PE ratios, except for a handful of large tech stocks. They too have expanded multiples which are irrational. 

Las Vegas is closed. So, this is the substitute for casino gambling. It is not ""investing.""

The Fed is currently engaged in an effort to keep asset prices propped up. Particularly, the dangerous corporate bond market. 

Ask the 50% of Americans who are not in the ""markets"" if they care about the Dow. When the  stimulus rug is pulled out from under them, we'll still be left with double digital unemployment levels and a recession. 

Call me in October. Sell now if you are wise. It's a gift."

2020-05-27 13:41,"A lot of trading makes sense only to the entity doing it.   Saudi Arabia and Russia need money to run their economies, so they sell stocks from their sovereign wealth funds - regardless of price.   The rulers there don't want their country to collapse, so they do whatever it takes to get the money.   Meanwhile, over at Vanguard, billions of dollars in 401K contributions still come in every payday.   They have to buy the stocks in the S&P 500 regardless of price, so they do.   Now over at the hedge fund, each trader is expected to show a profit every day.  So they watch what the Saudis, the Russians, and Vanguard are doing, and try to trade in front of them. scooping up small profits and closing out their positions by the end of the day.   Meanwhile, at the activist investor group, they're picking target companies to take over, and trying to build positions without moving the price.

This leaves real investors, who actually want to own companies for the long term, with plenty to think about.   Should you pay $3176 for 100 shares of AT&T in order to be able to collect a dividend of $208 a year?   Or maybe you should spend $4509 on 100 shares of Cisco, take your $144 a year in dividends, and look for further growth and dividend increases?   It's hard to say, with all these different people buying and selling for reasons of their own."
2020-05-27 13:42,"Yes, the Fed is propping up stock prices by keeping interest rates low. But thats not the whole story. As if not more important is fiscal policy and our ballooning budgets deficits. 

Note this unhealthy dichotomy between the stock market and the real economy predates this crisis. Deficits exacerbated by corporate tax cuts have been inflating profits and thereby transferring income and wealth from the middle class to the wealthy for over a decade.

To be clear, today's fiscal stimulus is a necessary humanitarian effort to keep our economy functioning through this corona crisis. By propping up aggregate demand, we aim to prevent a larger than necessary decline in economic output. Failing to do so would risk a depression and profound human suffering.

Yet expectations for trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see, likely financed by the Fed, encourage market expectations of long term growth in profits to continue to exceed economic growth and thereby exacerbate wealth and income inequality. Make no mistake, this outcome is a policy we choose not a force of nature."

The actions buy time, and people with retirement in 401K's will probably be more relieved and less likely to panic, at least in the near term.  In fact a rising stock market provides a temporary source of money for those who have no other option but to dip into it.  

It seems to me that the Fed is moving one step forward and two steps back.  It never comes close to clearing its balance sheet, can't raise interest rates to cover the Nat'l debt and now has taken on the additional step of investing in corp. bonds. The last seems to be the most egregious use of money, albeit money they create from thin air. Its one thing to base the value of your currency on the productivity of a nation, it a whole different animal when the gov't backs certain corps. that are deemed critical to Nat'l security, aka too big to fail.

2020-05-27 13:54,"Supply Side Economics NEVER works. It is a a fake hypothesis with no causal mechanism and no data that doesn't disprove it. From Reagan to now, tax cuts never created more than a small bump in the economy, and never made up the lost revenue, as promised. Avg. Growth is DOWN 1/3 since 1980 not up.
Another Supply Side bailout of global corporations will be sent into new market bubbles to pop, just like their stock buyouts from the Trump tax cut. It will take more than a decade to recover just like after 2008.
Global banks keep getting free money from us, then charge us obscene interest on it!

If consumers get more money, increasing demand, they clear shelves of inventory. Businesses that can't keep up with inventory can always find investors to fill that demand.
In the short run, Demand drives Supply.
To recover quickly We need to grow the economy from the bottom up, because money trickles UP, not down.

The Representatives of We the People need to order Our Treasury to 'print' new money and give equal amounts to each citizen. For example, $9,000 per citizen ($36,000 for a family of four) would come to $3 Trillion. Because the hole in the economy is far larger than that, it would not cause inflation, but prevent deflation.

Citizens who pay debts will bail out banks, and citizens who go shopping will bail out retail and manufacturing.

That was about as pessimistic as it got.  If you rode it down, you remember how crazy it was.  

So from that nadir, even though there is more visibility into the certainly bleak earnings outlook, things actually look better.  Like a light at the end of the tunnel.  The outbreak will certainly simmer but the world is not in fact ending.  

In a way this is similar to that Kristof column from a few days ago that made the ridiculous assertion that billionaires are  getting richer while the the economy is crashing--because it only looked at net gains in wealth from the stock market bottom until today.  Which of course is like the definition of cherry picking.

The situation is unsustainable.

The developed world has been in a steady decline for the entire 20th Century due to the colossal failure of globalization, and the pace of that decline will be greatly accelerated by the economic carnage from Covid-19. Significant levels of social unrest are looming on the horizon.

And the next decade will be even more brutal for the developing world.

We need a paradigm shift and a new economic system based on entirely different, more inclusive and dynamic form of capitalism if it is to survive, and if we're to avoid a global cataclysm.

And we need it fast, because it's only a matter of time before the Ponzi scheme that is Wall Street collapses, which will be the catalyst for revolution, as severe austerity measures will be imposed on the American middle class and working class that simply can't--and won't--take it any more."

3.	Business will return to more or less normal by end of summer or early fall

5.	We’ve culled the business world of ho-hum companies that won’t survive, concentrating demand on the strong that remain

7.	The Fed has stated explicitly that “there is no limit to its lending power”, so even if #1 above turns out to be false, the Fed will intervene.

Alas, it will probably come sooner than we think! I suppose the lesson we should learn is this: If we build our economy on shifting sands, we should not be surprised if the house of cards collapses.

Cause that’s all the economy is, a collection of people behaving in certain ways.  We need to ask the question of why so many middle-class Americans feel that Trump was doing well shepherding the economy even though wage growth has still been much slower for the people in the bottom half of wage-earners and the gap between the lowest- and highest-paid works has continued to increase.

The pandemic has the potential not only to generate the kind of losses in stock prices that we would normally expect under such conditions, but also to wipe out the incredible gains that have resulted since 2008 due to policies that have recapitalized (and then some) the global financial elite. While, of course, and needless to say, allowing everyone else to fend for themselves.

Then just when  the fed funds rate was inching up to realistic levels, and bonds and bank CDs therefore were starting to pay decent interest rates, the pandemic hits. Now we're not only back to a zero fed funds rate and buying treasuries/mortgages again, the Fed is now buying corporate and small government debt such as munis. I liken this disconnected stock market situation to a bad sports team that keeps selling out its game tickets - no one can figure out why a 1 win/season team sells 60,000 tickets/game until we find out that the government reimburses 80% of the price of each ticket if you show up for the games.

That latter seems to be a derivative from propping up the markets.  The FED continues to assume the zombie idea of trickle down - adjust the stock market and unemployment will follow.   

Too bad it does not work because money leaks out of capacity investment in many directions, such as stock buy backs and investments in non-core activity or acquisitions that lead to firings.  So the FED creates a basic bifurcation between the rich and the People sending them further apart as they transfer wealth from one side to the other.

But buying unlimited quantities of corporate bonds is not quite sufficient to increase income inequality.  That's pushing on a string.

So an investment with no dividends, but rising intrinsic corporate value can still be a money-maker. And you can make money if others want to pay more for shares you own for whatever reason, whether or not the intrinsic corporate value has gone up.

I suspect that what's going on these days is that while the stream of dividends is falling, the cashout value is rising because more money is or is expected to be chasing equities. Lower interest rates drive investors toward equities, other things being equal, and surely a significant portion of the trillions being spent on COVID-19 mitigations will find its way into the equity markets, inflating asset prices.

This explanation requires no 'evil overlords'. It's just supply and demand reacting to an unprecedented national response to a health crisis.

As long as the Fed offered artificially low interest rates well after the carnage of the Great Recession, Wall Street gorged on cheap debt. Now the Virus has shattered the illusion that we had a deep, robust and equitable economy.

But fear not. The Fed rides to the rescue once again by removing virtually all investment risk.

Even the ""too cool for school"" comments here and at the WSJ are really bubbly: ""you liberals don't understand stock trading, we know earning will be terrible, earnings don't matter""

If you look at graphs of earnings and stock prices in past recessions, you will find that earnings do matter.   Yes a few quarters can go by with p/e's in the 30's and 40's, but after a while prices fall and it always comes back to the 16-20 range. 

I don't think the actual actions of the fed account for  all of the gains of the past few weeks.  Yes they pushed everyone out of bonds, and yes there is essentially an asset inflation effect with so much cash hitting the street.  

But its more due to the fact that the fed (which is heavily influenced by Trump, lets face it) has said in their words and in their actions, that they will do anything, ANYTHING they need to do to prop up the stock market.  This has given investors confidence.

Compared with the historical averages of daily trading volume (total number of shares exchanging hands between sellers and buyers) has trailed off since the recovery from the  bottom of the S&P 500 on March 23.  Yes, SOME investors have been buying stocks due to the Fed's relative devaluing of bonds-- but MORE owners of previously purchased stocks have not.  It appears to this investor that they've either been holding or converting to cash (and gold if the distinction is worth noting) and awaiting a second 'correction' in the stock markets on the anticipation that earnings and earnings revisions are soon to take a second fall similar if not as bad as the one that followed the February 19 high mark.

Generally, at the beginning of a recession, the risk of a bankruptcy ($0 equity value) starts to get priced into stocks on an expected value basis.  With that failure risk largely off the table, the only thing that makes this quarter's more important than 2022+ is cost of capital, which the federal reserve has driven to close to 0%. So a bad quarter or even two bad years doesn't really change the terminal value of a business because at a 0% discount rate, cash flows even in 10 years are as valuable as cash flows today."

I have watched this last year as stocks have bounced. Trump would announce Chinese sanctions on Monday, the Market would tumble, late Friday there would be a tentative agreement with the Chinese, stocks would rise.  Rinse and repeat. Someone was buying and selling, but I certainly was not big enough to play it.  In November, I caught it on the upswing and sold everything, how could this guy survive impeachment?  But on he went.  Stocks continued up and down. I haven't got the stomach.  

I thought of buying on the down, but there is no rationality to this market or this president.  Yes, the market is being propped up with free government money, but eventually, giving back tax money to corporations will make the poor poorer, the rich, very rich and we will see the final chapter of a trickle down economy: trickle up poverty.  

I've been to many places in the third world, it isn't pretty.  Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe, NZ and others are approaching this change rationally.  China with it's brutal crackdown in Hong Kong, will reap what it sows as will we.  The Republicans would be wise to be careful of what they wish for, think Venezuela."

There are 3 important things to remember about stocks, the stock market is not the economy, the stock market is not the economy and the stock market is not the economy. The column also remarked that absent a more attractive place to put money some investors are still willing to buy stocks. 
Of course the Fed's actions to prop things up, even buying corp bonds, creating more liquidity out of think air is a band aid over the gaping wound. Carry zeros over till they add up as the song lyric goes. After all they are a consortium of private banks and can do pretty much whatever they want.
There is some validity to the idea that some are buying on the dip with the hope that at some future time the Dow somewhere between 24-25k will return to its march to 30k or higher. My understanding is that the Dow's current valuation is really reliant on just a few top performers while most of the companies are lagging.
All this just serves to underscore what a poor barometer of the actual health of the economy the stock market is. Most Americans own little or no stock at all. As the 'financialization' of our economy has replaced manufacturing as a key component of our economic strength, the significance of the Dow is diminished if not in the uninformed eyes of the public.
The rise of day trading, institutional automated investing etc. has rendered the market as little more than a casino. It hardly reflects the fortunes of most Americans"

A quick check into Vanguard data shows that something like 85% of their investors have done “nothing”. - that is, they have neither bought nor sold anything in response to the market volatility. Much of these investors’ equity assets are in IRA’s and 401K’s, so presumably they are long-term investors.

So who moves the market? And who owns the market? Please define the percentages of individual investors, institutional  investors like pension funds and university endowments, and day traders looking for a quick return.

Many Americans believe that the stock market is owned by the 1%, without understanding that their pension, university, or favorite non-profit owns equities, even if they personally do not own stock.

Republicans actively undermine the well-being of small business, of communities, families, individual citizens. The continue aggressively to do so.

This didn't have to go this way.  It could still be reversed but, with the timid acquiescence of Pelosi and her tongue-tied Democrats that won't happen.  One suspects they don't mind all that much.

Today is bad enough, much worse than most realize and worse than most dour reporting here, but Republicans have sentenced us to decades of economic torture.  Defaults, repossessions, vile and aggressive collections; the collapse of businesses, towns, families; violence, drug abuse, suicide; careers, educations, companies and homes abandoned.

He said something very important about stocks not long ago.  He said, as bond rates approach zero, there's almost no limit to what a person might pay for stock in a company with earnings.  That's why I'm sitting tight.  There's only one way to make money in the markets right now and it's through investing in companies that have earnings."
2020-05-27 18:16,"Without any doubt, Fed policy has played a role in the market rally.  However, I think a bigger contributor is the fact that we are past the peak of COVID-19.  It says just above this article that daily deaths have declined 61% in the last two weeks, and deaths are a lagging indicator.  Every state has reopened to some extent.  While some businesses and some jobs are gone for good, many are coming back.

COVID-19 may be seasonal and, maybe, it will return toward the end of the year.  However, it appears a lot of investors are betting that it won't.  This is not an unreasonable assumption.  Remember the SARS pandemic (caused by a coronavirus relative of COVID-19)?  The deadly outbreak in Toronto began in March of 2003.  By July, the WHO declared SARS contained globally.  After May of 2004, there were no more cases anywhere."
2020-05-27 17:55,"The stock market of today is vastly different than it was when I began my retirement/savings investments.  Initially we (any investors that wanted to at least attempt to make wise investments) would look only at the potential for the stock company to be profitable.  This involved price / earning ratios and there are a host of other ""indicators"".  If the company made a profit the stock price was very likely to go up and your investment was a success.  Then along came the High-frequency trading (HFT),  a type of algorithmic financial trading.  This method allowed huge amounts of stock to be traded in a matter of minutes or even seconds. This emphazied any and all trends because ""sensing mechanisms"" were also employed that tell the big automated stock buying behemoth to buy or sell.  Of course interest rates matter etc. but the psychological knee jerk and betting culture is an incredibly strong component these days. 

When you combine this with the News Media giants like NYTs who love headlines that read either doom and gloom or ecstacy - it really lends volitality to what started out as a fairly reasonable way to invest for your retirement."
2020-05-27 18:01,"Economics - Some call the 'Dismal science' I would call the 'stupid religion' has a Nobel Prize winner named William Nordhaus who famously stated in a peer-reviewed journal article in Science (sept 14, 1991): ""Agriculture, the part of the economy that is sensitive to climate change, accounts for just 3% of national output. That means that there is no way to get a very large effect on the U.S. economy"". Kind of like saying 'The pineal gland is only 1% of the Brain's mass so we could survive without it.' Economic theory is killing us. Our inability to value the natural world which supports our civilization and economy is killing us. We spend $8 billion on halloween costumes (for ONE day of the year) and $3 billion for the entire ANNUAL budget of the National Park Service. We are in DEEP trouble and we are barely aware of it.

In other words, it is INVESTED into the local community.

What happens when you give the top 0.1% $5,000?  Pffft.  Perhaps it's added to their foundation.   Foundations are all very nice, but if taxation was proper in the first place, communities wouldn't be so dependent on the largesse of billionaires.

The reality check of the market going up is a simple reason, Fed is there to support and do what is needed for Corp. America and not SMBs.  

Yes, the earnings are going to be substantially lower in the 2nd quarter as well as the rest of the year since Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon but only certain industries (airlines, hotels, cruise, restaurant are few of them) will pay the price is the reality check. 

The people who have lost jobs are the poor working families in a service industry that does not affect the earnings of Corp America. They hardly have the savings to invest in the stock market. 

In spite of the middle class keeping this economy intact where 70% of what the US produces is consumed internally by the middle-class, eventually, this will reflect Corp America earnings when the bailout is no longer offered.

What happens if a significant portion of the small business community—businesses that comprise 44 percent of the U.S. economy—go under due the shutdown and a sluggish reopening?

2020-05-27 19:25,"When I was at the university in the 60's, I took a course on economics.  Capitalism was presented via the teachings of Adam Smith as channeled though the writings of Paul Samuelson.  In theory, companies compete for loans.  Thoss with the best ideas get funded and expand.  Those who lose out get smaller or go bankrupt.

But the free market helps the economy become more efficient in distributing resources to the people and raises living standards over time.

The US economy behaved that way until the Great Recession of 2008.  Look at the rates on 10-year treasuries:

2001-2007 4-5% about 2-3% above inflation
2010-2019 2-2.5% near the rate of inflation
Yesterday 0.69% about 1% below inflation

Low interest rates have allowed the federal government to run deficits year after year.  The reason is that real rates are negative.  Thus the government pays the debt back in inflated dollars and comes out ahead.

But investors noticed.  The 50% bond 50% stocks portfolio of 2005 became the 100% stock portfolio of 2015.

When COVID-19 hit, the Fed was FORCED to lower rates aggressively and buy bond ETF's.  If it didn't, state pension funds would have quickly gone bankrupt.

The problem is that we now have a managed economy at least when it comes to debt.  The logic that once led to higher living standards no longer applies.

Stock market wealth is like phantom wealth, held up by Fed policies.  Perhaps we can have another decade of negative real rates before the music stops.  But it will."

This started in earnest under Greenspan, and only increased under Bernanke, Yellen and now Powell. It's how the biggest reason the 1% have grown so much wealthier since the 1980's.

When will it end? Vast and growing inequality is accepted in the US, so an outcry against that won't end the massive printing. It will end only when we have raging consumer price inflation like the 1970's. That hasn't happened as long as China and other countries have been happy to send us enormous amounts of real goods in return for bits of paper. But that won't last forever."
2020-05-27 19:32,"Is it telling at all that there is enough extra money to throw around at the stock market rather than to buy actually needs or even a secure savings? It seems to me those that are investing are not sharing in any of the pain the rest of the country is feeling. No doubt some are just lucky ducks who aren't affected, but it would seem to me there are plenty who have so much discretionary income that they don't need it to go anywhere but the stock market. It doesn't unnerve them terribly that things have gone south, because it is all just extra for them anyway. This is bad for workers who need it for basics, to pay off debt, and the occasional splurge, but it works great for those on the top. It is also bad for public goods.

People have become accustomed to seeing their money grow since Obama's administration revived the economy, and they want that to continue. With the traditionally safe investment in bonds yielding very little return, they'd rather gamble on the market than say goodbye to the growth in their wealth.

If there's anything resembling confidence in the market now, it might derive from the ubiquitous truism that even amateurs like me have heard repeatedly; i.e., that the market goes in cycles and always rebounds from bear markets, so that, over the long term, the market is the highest-yielding place to park one's money.

They have lots of money floating around and nowhere else to invest it: Interest rates are hovering near zero, international markets are no longer reliable, and the rest of the U.S. economy is tanking. So the rich investors park their money in the stock market, confident in the knowledge that the Fed will bail them out as often as necessary.

2020-05-27 20:53,"I wish NYT would start reporting in an objective way on the role the Fed has been playing these last three decades. 
If we have so much debt it’s because the Fed with their self imposed mandate of 2% inflation and zero interest rates has driven every one into becoming a speculator in order to keep up with living expenses.
You have Powell saying there is no limit to what the fed can do and everyone looks fine with that statement. Having people with limitless power is dangerous for our society, especially when they aren’t really accountable to anyone, yet can tax, dilute and manipulate hard earned savings of millions of Americans without anyone noticing it. 
The Fed is the main problem.

The economy is not the stock market and the stock market is definitely not the economy, not when it comes to how our lives are going. Our government ought to stop basing its forecasts or its aid to the rest of us on how the stock market is.  

As far as most of us are concerned the last 40 years have been disastrous for savings and living standards.  Anyone born after the mid 1950s has not experienced the same America in terms of jobs or upward mobility, that his/her older brothers or sisters did.  The GOP saw to it and continues to do so."
2020-05-27 21:05,"Wall Street is about capital and providing capital for companies actually creating new wealth. When the economy is not expanding or is contracting, capital needs are low, just enough for businesses to keep doing what they are doing. Under such conditions, the markets should be steady as the economy is steady and dropping when the economy is contracting. When it's growing anyway, it reflects speculation in anticipation of growth, or it's just people trying to redistribute existing wealth into their own accounts."
2020-05-27 21:06,"What about stock buybacks as an explanation? Recorded profit forecasts don't really mean much as long as companies have built up enough reserves to buy back a portion of their shares and temporarily drive up prices. 

Current assets are more useful measures of short-term liquidity. Corporate income statement and cash flow fundamentals could be abysmal, but as long as they can  muster up some cash to manipulate the share price and produce a return for shareholders, it will keep them at bay. 

Seems that investors routinely ignore underlying factors as long as they're confident that management will continue to look out for them. And for institutional investors - as long as their quarterly growth stays on pace, they can market their funds as 'successful.' 

To return to fair valuation and rational investor sentiment, stock buybacks need to be made illegal like they were pre-Reagan. The federal government needs to provide stricter fiduciary measures to insure that fund managers are focused on the long term success of their portfolios, not just quarter-by-quarter targets. The Obama-era CFPB and Fid Rule were good starts, but Trump has turned those measures into skeleton operations.

Cuomo certainly didn't help by letting the Exchange reopen. While millions are out of a job and facing eviction, starvation, and constant anxiety - traders get to drive their BMWs into Manhattan and drive investor confidence higher. The disconnect is disgustingly real."

Treasury/Fed/Government policies are now mere sacrifices at the altar of the EMH, which takes for granted that the market is right all the time, but especially right when asset prices are at their peak. There are all sorts of moral and practical dilemmas posed by this unwillingness to  allow the business cycle to play itself out.

The article, towards the end, comes pretty close to pinpointing why the stock market has bounced back the way it has. Simply put, in addition to low interest rates increasing the value of stocks relative to cash or bonds, investors have seized on a number of developments that lead an increasing number to believe that a V shaped recovery is quite possible. The first is that a number of indicators of economic activity have begun moving up, as restrictions are loosened, and the second is the spate of positive news regarding potential vaccines. Yes, of course, the V shaped recovery won't happen if the virus isn't contained, which is why the vaccine news, if very preliminary, is so important and investors may be misguided in their positive beliefs, but there is a rational thought process at work that may or may not prove accurate."

2020-05-27 21:48,"A few technical points to keep in mind for those who think stock markets are a fantasy world, a casino, or an expression of political views, rather than the sum of ownership stakes of all listed companies. 

1) The Dow and S&P 500 are largely global firms. The globe overall has not been slammed as hard by the coronavirus as the US, medically or economically.  The worlds's most important growth area, East Asia, has contained the impact the best so far. 

2) The market index is expressed in a specific currency, the US dollar.  When any central bank floods markets with its currency, it risks future inflation, a fall in the value of that currency as measured in goods.  Stocks tend to keep up with inflation because companies produce goods, not currency.  Some see the market now as a hedge against inflation. 

3) Stock prices express the average of all investors' views of the sum (in present value) of all future cash flows, not just this quarter's or next year's.  Even after the rally, the S&P is down 10% from just before the virus impact. That may prove overvalued, but perhaps 10% is the total final size of the hit to future cash flows from an interruption of a few quarters. 

4) Interest rates are the foundation of valuation. Not only do zero interest rates support future earnings (less interest to pay on debt), but they make any stream of future earnings worth more in present value."

But, the podcast insinuated that because they are illegal immigrants that this country failed them and thus they died from the virus.  Many non-immigrant, legal citizens had the same sorrow hit their families.  Also, it tended to measure the failure of testing/treating appropriately against what was done and known months ago -- things change by the day as health professionals try to deal with this unknown. It was common at that time to not test people and ask them to assume they have the virus and to recover from home. Immigrant status had nothing to do with it.

Even people, who were personally affected tend to forget the reasons behind their personal loss. It enables politicians in power to ignore what Obama once said, ""good policy is good politics.""

That's equally true for good policies that a Govt and politicians fought so hard for. Remember unprecedented defeat of Hillary or unthinkable loss of Indian PM, AB Vajpayee in 2004 in the hands of Sonia Gandhi led Congress party, despite of doing enacting so many great policies and improved image of the nation, promoting patriotic feeling in the country and abroad?

I grew up in Massachusetts through the 2000s and can say that the history lessons covered slavery, the trail of tears, vietnam war, Iraq war and even Japanese internment camps. These lessons were part of our curriculum to have compassion in decision making in the future as well as freedom of information in the US which is protected by the first amendment. In college I studied Chinese history to learn from a none bias perspective information in China.

After reading about journalists and archivists being detained during the Coronavirus outbreak I can't help to wonder how true any information in China is.  What is the true number of infection cases?  Do the Chinese people know the government sent faulty test kits to other countries through Mask Diplomacy? Were these same faulty kits used to test Chinese citizens?

There seems to be a lot of defensive Chinese people which has led to deflecting criticism and disinformation.  What sort of backlash could increased transparency entail if news gets out that millions of people were infected instead of a mere 85,000 out of a population of our 1 billion?

The way censorship works in China is scary. I hope that people there are properly taught about the great leap forward, the cultural revolution, Tiananmen Square 1989 and the genocide of Uighur muslims."

The answer is that the public -- both in China and the USA -- are, as they say, ""not the sharpest tool in the shed"" (which is a polite way to say dumb witted).  Of course, this is a long-standing state of affairs from which all governments benefit and, thus, do little (if anything) to prevent.

That's a good thing. I wish the same thing for all of you back in the US.

On a side note: I started reading Camus' La Peste ('The Plague') when the epidemic hit, and got about halfway through. But the epidemic here was well controlled before it brought up the kinds of social tensions described in the novel, and apparently now coming to the fore in the UK  and the US.

She is drawing attention to a pattern in Chinese history and the pandemic today. She points to two reasons: the central government and its own people who shaped by history and social/political/cultural forces. Although there is amnesia elsewhere and driving factors may be different, that's not the point of this article.

He didn’t want to have to go back to that life again, not knowing when or where his dinner was coming from.

Growing up, we all heard stories. 

My point is that Chinese people have been through a lot. When the communist took over, people were no longer starving and they all have homes and jobs. The communist beliefs were accepted. The people were slowly brainwashed, and the ones who didn’t comply were killed or sent to prisons, lucky ones escaped to Hong Kong or Taiwan.

All these Fed moves have nothing to do with the real economy. They are all designed to bail out Wall St. once again.

It took up to 4-6 weeks to secure the testing supplies needed to find the cases.  When the testing increased, the number of new cases identified increased too!!  It is very frustrating that this correlation between testing and finding cases is not part of any narrative.  This is precisely how lack of national response crippled the state responses, and allowed the virus to spread undetected.

In the USA, we run tests on individuals, and test on each individual sample. However, when the people in Wuhan get tested now, they were first tested in groups. Each group contains maybe 10 to 20 person.  The nurses will collect samples from each person within the group, then combine these samples together and check as a single test. The test maybe take some time, but it is very accurate. If the combined sample result was negative, then all the 10 to 20 person in that group are clear. If the result is positive, then they will contact everyone inside that specific group again and test each one of them carefully. 

In this way, you can increase the testing capacity easily by 10 to 20 folds for any country. Actually, this idea comes from the questions those software companies normally gave to their candidate engineers, to use the minimum tests to check as many people as possible.

Imagine if we in the US can divide people into small groups based on the neighborhood, and collect the samples and test as groups as well. Then we can quickly know which neighborhoods in the US are infected with this virus. Then the government just needs to track the activity for those infected area, and in the meanwhile we can start open up the rest healthy neighborhoods and recover the economy slowly."

Why is it so easy to pump billions into corporations and tax cuts for the wealthy, but so difficult to send a monthly check to Americans to keep them afloat during this difficult time?  For those who don't need it, the checks can be considered an interest-free loan come tax time next year, but right now people are suffering.  And the men in Washington -- and they are mostly men making these decisions -- don't seem to care."
2020-05-27 11:11,"All  economies have entered the pandemic burdened by debts.
China debt to GDP was 303%, Japan 237%, US 110%, UK and EU countries, close to or over 100% in 2019. Now they all are opening their wallets to ""print more debts"", due to the virus destroying the economy. Where is all this money coming from?
I find it difficult to believe there is this much money in the world. We are in Gazillions territory. The usual sharks, like Venture capitalists, Banks, billionaires or Corporations, are very unlikely to invest in Government's Bonds, paying next to nothing in interest.  German, Danish and UK bonds returns, are actually negative. Investors would be paying those Governments to buy their paper. Am I the only one having the nagging suspicions that it is not debts that are being printed, but cold hard cash. Governments control the printing presses after all. Could the  debt  be  just  a digital figure in the cloud that never gets repaid? Is it being kept there, as some ort of bogey man, to scare the populace into acceptance when it is  trotted out every time any Government, for ideological or pollical reason, wants to cut services, welfare, education or health budgets? 
Just curios, that all."

We now have authoritarian virus deniers who have called the virus 'just another flu' taking unproven drugs as a preventative that offer no protection and actually cause harm.

Stimulus packages are popping up all over as governments realize that the economic fallout will be widespread and ongoing for the foreseeable future.

Major businesses are coming to the realization that they cannot survive in their current format under these conditions of social distancing.

Many people have had it and are dispensing with masks and doing what they want.  They will now become the new vectors of disease spread which will keep new cases forming and prolong the pandemic.

Controlling this disease will require not just a city, or state, or even national response.  It will require a global response.

2020-05-27 12:00,"Thankfully most of the governors in the US are caring enough for their citizens to take actions to protect them.  Some Trump loyalists are working to curry favour with Trump and will be foolish in the face of aa virus that has killed over 100,000 Americans.  This pandemic is a war, and America is losing the war.  The virus is winning.

Those governors who are not taking measures to protect citizens will see second wave of the disease that will devastate the people again, likely even greater than the first round.  Those that think that heavenly deities will protect them may suffer even more and will be the carriers to infect others.  

I’m amazed that politics is dictating the approach to how America is handling this virus.  The virus doesn’t care about politics.  I’m amazed that the vulnerable (those with underlying conditions: obesity being a big one) are not taking the virus seriously.  

America will not learn the lessons from the first wave and maybe not even the second wave.  Eventually a vaccine will be developed and be available; but only those with the money to afford it will be a belt to get it.  So, Trumpian economic policy will dictate who gets to live or die in America.  

Thankfully there is an election coming, but I’m saddened to see that people are so foolish as to gather in large numbers to have a pool party or flock to the beach without taking protective measures.  They forgot so soon. They will not remember in November.  That is what Trumpians want."

COVID-19 doesn’t know or care about politics or freedom or religion. It knows that only that if you are foolish and expose yourself to it, it will infect viable hosts. Viruses are like that.

I’m amazed at how foolish some people (a lot of people actually) can be in the face of a virus that threatens to kill you.  I listened to some on the news claim that Jesus was going to protect them. I listened to some say that they were not going to wear a mask since President Trump wasn’t wearing one (I’m going to guess here and say that they likely don’t have his healthcare resources) and then there are the majority that are treating COVID-19 with the seriousness that it needs.

So, as with all things in the world, there are differing opinions about what to do to mitigate the effects of the virus.  The Trumpian approach is to let it wash through the nation and take its victims.  At the end the healthy will survive and it will all be good.  But this is the approach that is the GOP favourite and gives them the political advantage.  This is the approach devoid of care for human beings.  This is the approach that is based on survival of the fittest.  The Darwinian approach. And so, right now in America, the people need to be aware that for the most part the federal government is not willing to help mitigate COVID-19, the victims of the virus are the ones that they are philosophically bent on ignoring.

The EU now, and in its earlier forms, has always had an internal  tension between deeper integration and separatist nationalism.

One can hope that the Members will recognize this is a critical inflection point and once again realize that working together has always proven to be far more successful and peaceful than the alternative.

If this deeper integration move comes to pass it will both signal a new phase for the EU and prove to be a positive outcome that actually could probably never have come about before Brexit.

About 20% of U.S. ""coverage"" is actually some form of Medicaid.  Either ACA expanded Medicaid, or a pre-ACA Medicaid.

In many states, all Medicaids, for people 55 and over, are not really insurance, even though the Federal and state governments misrepresent them as insurance in their statistics.

They are subject to Medicaid estate recovery.  Medical bills are paid temporarily for a person, but need to be paid back by a person's estate when they die.

With Britain gone from the EU, the deeper Franco-German relationship that pre-dated the UK's former membership is showing that it remains a viable force to foster deeper  European integration.

Several decades ago Britain signaled that it could never really be a full member of the EU when it refused to join the Schengen regime.  It doubled-down with its rejection of the Euro currency.  Brexit was simply the final act of Britain's estrangement from the EU.

Now, with this joint debt proposal, Macron and Merkel are signaling a new direction for the EU to follow.  Granted it will be a challenge to gain a buy-in of the northern nations but hopefully it will come about.

Europe needs deeper integration more than ever as the US fades from the international arena into neo-isolationism.  This proposal signals a viable path towards a stronger and more dynamic Union."

2020-05-27 22:59,Donald Trump and his administration are making a compelling argument that the Americas need to respect.  Their argument is that they could have killed more Americans and put even more Americans out of work if they had done an EVEN worst job at managing Coronavirus.  For once I agree with them.
2020-05-26 17:48,"All it takes is one non-compliant visitor to spoil the experience for everyone else. If and when institutions and entertainment venues start enforcing necessary ""guidelines"" uniformly and without exception, perhaps more people will be willing to visit theaters and other public spaces."
2020-05-26 17:49,"The issue is going to be that of social distancing.  Enforcing this in live theater - ion other words, playing to a half empty house - simply is not financially feasible, for the presenters or for the artists."
2020-05-26 17:58,"It's gonna be tough- this article got me (an out of towner) thinking  about my theater experiences- first, fly to JFK (ain't gonna happen), take the train to midtown (nope), stand in line at TKTS (again nope), stand in line to enter the theater and then sit elbow to elbow in a theater that was designed when people were considerably thinner (no, and finally no)."
2020-05-26 18:07,I feel bad for the actors and theater owners on Broadway.  This is just not something they thought could happen.
2020-05-26 18:11,"Live theatre on Broadway surely will make a comeback, but it will not be until there is a proven vaccine against the virus and audiences don't feel threatened. Theater owners can sanitize, people can wear masks, but the chance of transmission is still there. And what about antiquated ventilation systems? Some of these theaters are more than 100 years old and that has to be taken into consideration. Sports arenas, theaters, and places where the public gathers are going to suffer."

2020-05-26 18:19,"As a now retired ex-New Yorker who went to countless Broadway and Off-Broadway shows over the 10 years I lived in the city, I honestly cannot see Broadway, (when it re-opens) being anything remotely as I fondly remember it. The first episode of an out-of-towner, (or a local), causing a  flood of contagion in a theater will cause irreparable harm for ALL the productions playing. When, sometime down the line after re-opening, tourists read about an asymptomatic patron (or cast member) with no fever, spreading it to an audience that when dispersed, will take it to other parts of the country or the world...will be another nail in the coffin of tourism in the city, specifically 42nd Street and above. Speaking for  myself, I would not be able to 'lose myself' in whatever great production I was viewing when I hear that first COUGH from somewhere nearby my seat. Even if the cough were because of a dry throat, or something innocent, I would never be able to enjoy the show  in the way it was before Covid-19. (B.C.) This scenario goes right out the window of course, theoretically, after a vaccine is developed. Unless the patron coughing is from a part of the country opposed to all vaccines and is a staunch anti-vaxxer. Going to see 'Little Shop of Horrors' or 'Long Day's Journey into Night' was never meant to be dangerous or complicated, or fatal."
2020-05-26 18:23,"The entire structure of a Broadway house is not amenable to social distance.  Think of the crowded stairwells, bathrooms and aisles as people rush around, shoulder to shoulder, to get to the bathrooms before the 15 minute intermission is over."
2020-05-26 18:23,"If theatre goers want social distancing, ie one third the number of theatre goers, ask them to pay three times the normal orice for a ticket.that way, the actors and owners get their pay, andthe audience gets to see a play.

If one third of the usual number of fans are not willing to pay up, then no plays. It is really very simple."
2020-05-26 18:41,"Based on other Coronavirus seasonal patterns (highest in the winter, lowest in the summer) the best current strategy is to perform outdoor, socially distanced, smaller, cheaper versions of Broadway shows during the months of June, July and August.   Starting in the fall will be highly problematic for cast and audience unless there is a vaccine."
2020-05-26 18:48,"Bingo. 

Consumer confidence will only return when people believe that everyone else will behave responsibly and follow social distancing rules. 

The more people flout the rules and behave irresponsibly, the longer it will take for consumer confidence (and economic growth) to return."
2020-05-26 18:56,"At age 75, my personal answer to when I would go to any type of gathering (theater, sports, lecture, religious service) would have to be not until there is an effective vaccine.  

Otherwise, it is not worth the risk."
2020-05-26 19:09,"As a flyman standing in the wings of theaters by the fly rail  awaiting my cue to fly in or out  a drop I was always taken by the amount of ""spray"" two or more actors could put out during a dialogue or song.  With the stage lights focused on the action or in the glow of a spotlight watching from side gives one a great view of the amount of atomizing that is sent out over the first couple of rows of seats.  Singing or an argument raises the level of spittle significantly.  Enjoy the show.
Glass in front of the ""fourth wall.""  Really?"
2020-05-26 19:16,"Much more reasonable than anybody could know ... unless they've been to a NY theater - whether on- or off-Broadway.

There is VERY SELDOM - in my numerous shows (as an audience member) - one that passes without a cellphone or 2 going off. I've overheard many a heated exchange, and they often include, ""I told my babysitter only to call if was urgent.""

Talk about self-centered - not that one's kids don't merit our love & attention!

I guess ""vibrate"" doesn't do it for such individuals.

And then there are those who text - not too many - and those who need to check their messages 5-10 times during a 90-minute show - plenty of those, some young, some not-so.

Sorry for a rant, but I am among those who would do anything short of risking death to see a show after a couple of months of ""withdrawal.""

It DOES get worse - ushers are either poorly paid contractors or volunteers. EVEN IF they were inclined to get involved with ""enforcement,"" the evil-doers KNOW that they have a kind of immunity from censure or eviction, because that would be STILL more disruptive.

Yes, right now, most people likely to attend most shows are probably ""law-abiding"" and considerate. But ""we"" are not known for sheepishness, we citizens of NYC. I haven't a doubt in the world that a whispered, ""Would you please put your mask back on"" would draw a 2-word or 3-word response, both featuring a word even older than Shakespeare.

It won't help when the NY theater duopoly announces, ""We've had to raise our prices."""
2020-05-26 19:27,"For many years, I have brought groups to Broadway and Off Broadway shows. I usually saw 20 shows per year.  Unfortunately this April, I had to cancel 4 groups from Los Angeles.  This was  most disheartening and disappointing time for my groups and myself. 

I cannot wait to go back to Broadway and to the museums, but I would insist on everyone wearing masks, sitting at least one seat apart from another person, a temperature check,  and a well proven vaccine before I would attend another show."
2020-05-26 19:35,"Broadway shows are just another way for the idle rich to spoil themselves. Nobody needs to spend $849 to see Hamilton. 

Getting back to charging four figures for tourist families to see Disney stories they paid $5 for in 1994 should be far down the priority list, maybe after the city figures out how to protect MTA workers when the second wave hits."
2020-05-26 20:18,"Was lucky enough to enjoy about 10 Broadway & Off-off-Broadway shows in 2019 and early 2020 via discounted tickets, but I won't be going back to live theater performances until there is a proven effective vaccine for this virus.

No form of live entertainment is worth the risk for me, and that includes the Met Opera and Carnegie Hall."
2020-05-26 20:47,"Everywhere I go these days there are *always* people with no mask, and not social distancing.  Everyday I see photos on numerous sites of people protesting about ""freedoms"" and not wearing masks and gathered in large groups. 
It is not what a business does/does not due that I pay attention as they reopen, it is the behavior of other people."
2020-05-26 20:56,"They are correct in their fears. I monitor the door at a store and hand out FREE masks to customers who don’t have one. Most customers are understanding and kind but more than a few are quite arrogant and want to loudly express their right to not wear one. I get to hear all about their constitutional rights. It is exhausting and maddening when I know how important it is to wear a mask to protect the other person. I wear a mask for 7-8 hours, it is hot and uncomfortable but I wouldn’t dream of removing it for even a minute. 
To the people who complain, If you hate wearing a mask you’re really not going to like a ventilator."
2020-05-26 20:59,"As the world's greatest lover of opera and classical music performances, it's simple: no vaccine, no performances.  Period.  Nothing to debate, rationalize, or argue about.  My health and my impact on everyone else's health is just too important.  It breaks my heart, but that's how I feel.  PS - I could never imagine staying away from what I love most either."
2020-05-26 21:00,"As a senior who is a frequent theater, opera and classical concert-goer and lives in Manhattan - this shut down of my favorite activities has been most painful.  But the alternatives would be too frightening to contemplate. While I would love to feel able to attend live performances again with masks and social distancing in place, I think the reality is that I won't be comfortable doing so until there is an effective and safe vaccination.  Or much more effective medication."
2020-05-26 21:14,"I will stay away from theaters and concerts for the same reason I desperately want to resume attending live performance events: I love the performances. But, I also love the other audience members and artists and I don't want to risk possibly unknowingly infecting them or having them infect me. For the foreseeable future, my love will be from afar."
2020-05-26 21:20,"They are right to be afraid, and just take an example from the airlines. I flew on a two-leg flight last week because my airline had been sending me regular emails with videos from the CEOs explaining their new safety protocols, particularly the requirement that all passengers wear masks on flights. Thinking this was a logical and important rule, considering how compact people  are in the close quarters of a flight, I booked a flight to save an otherwise 16 hour drive for a necessary trip. I regretted it. On each flight leg there were passengers who took their masks off as soon as they were seated (two who were seated directly behind me and who talked throughout the flight, also commenting about their dislike of the mask rule), and flight attendants never reminded or asked them to put them back on. On one short flight leg, the attendants did not even come down the aisle once during the flight. When an attendant instructed all passengers to remain seated on landing and deplane one row at a time to keep the aisles from crowding, the majority of passengers ignored the request and rose and crowded the aisle. When asked, the crew said they had no ability to enforce the requirements. In the airports, many people, including pilots and flight attendants, took their masks off, even though Chicago O'Hare and Philly International were fairly busy. A TSA worker said that he was also disturbed how many people at the airport did not wear masks, and urged me to write the FAA."
2020-05-26 21:28,"Classical music concerts and opera worry me less.  Broadway shows, attracting a different audience, many from states where rebellion against social distancing and masking is occurring and spending just a few nights ""on the town"" in NYC, those Broadway audiences will be a greater risk."
2020-05-26 21:48,"My region opened today - just today - for Phase 1, allowing manufacturing, construction, warehousing to reopen. The traffic today was double last week's, and last week's traffic was double that of the end of April. I saw construction trucks, plumbers' trucks, kitchen remodeling trucks on the road earlier this month, before we ""opened.""

No, people are not going to follow the rules.

We know that this virus is most destructive at ""super-spreader"" events, and can, uncontrolled, infect so many that one infection can lead to 64,000 before 3 months have passed. 

We don't yet know how masks and hand sanitizer will affect that R0 (although the President is willing to use the RNC Convention as an uncontrolled experiment.)

So don't expect me in any crowd, inside, with recycled air and people who don't know that the mask has to cover the nose, an important organ in the respiratory system, to be effective. Or where people will slip it off because it is hot and hard to breathe through.

I'll wait for a vaccine, or at the very least, a demonstration that indoor crowds are safe."
2020-05-26 22:05,"We attend monthly Broadway performances, commuting by train from our home in Poughkeepsie. We have a backlog of cancelled shows and very much look forward to the opportunity to see them performed. Unfortunately, that will not happen until I am vaccinated, or until this virus has burned itself out with ""herd immunity"".  I don't see either of those things happening in the next twelve months, so any offer of a theatre insisting on masks, or daily disinfecting, or 6-foot spacing (how much does a ticket cost then??!!) will not bring me back. I love the theater more than I can describe in words, but I won't risk my life for it."
2020-05-26 22:37,"First of all, Broadway will not reopen unless there's enough advance sales.  Secondly, it's not just the seats, it's the line at the rest rooms and the lobbies.  Many performance companies have determined that proper distancing equates to a crowd equaling  20% of capacity.  Unless they're gonna pay five-times as much to cover operating expenses we're not opening anytime soon.

I work at a non-for-profit performance venue in NYC.  I am one of the furloughed ""creatives.""  All the folk with portable jobs, Legal, IT, security, HAVC, and those fine people in HR still have jobs.  And healthcare.  The public comes to see our work, not theirs, and yet we're the first to go.

The severance was quick and brutal.  They're cutting off our health care at the end of September.

The enormously wealthy donors and board members need to finance our health care.  Me and my peers will be out of work the longest of any class of American worker.

We need help now."
2020-05-26 23:05,We can't trust people to stay off their phones during a performance when the only thing at stake is the concentration of the performers and the enjoyment of fellow audience members. I will not be going back to the theater - or other live performances - without a Covid-19 vaccination.
2020-05-26 23:06,NO show is worth risking one's life.
2020-05-26 23:15,"Visits to museums and art exhibits are out for now too.  I was very sad to miss a much loved yearly event in February, but there would have been too much risk, especially as getting there would have been via public transportation.
Even the local grocery store is out for now; my last visit in mid-March was a hazard avoidance exercise.  Thankfully, a supermarket 40 miles away provides on-line ordering and then will bring the items out to the car.
If we had sane leadership, everybody would be strongly encouraged to take the recommended precautions, but that's not happening for a while."
2020-05-26 23:16,"A totally reasonable fear, not just about Broadway but about gyms, bars, salons and virtually any venue, particularly indoors."
2020-05-26 23:17,"As soon as there’s a vaccine that’s readily available, I will start buying tickets."
2020-05-26 23:21,"It's the same everywhere - airlines, theaters, the Las Vegas Strip, grocery stores - you name it. They all make a show of caring about their customers' health and safety until the customers refuse to comply and then they beat a hasty retreat back to where they wanted to be anyway - doing nothing different than before.  Why would they want to seriously implement any of these restrictions that are only going to make it harder for them to stay in business? I suspect they're hoping and praying the customers won't stand for it. 
As long as mask-wearing and distancing are suggestions, not law, it will not be possible to change peoples' behavior. 
All vulnerable people - those with underlying conditions or the elderly - will be pretty much confined to their homes for the duration of this disaster. If I sound defeatist, I guess I am."
2020-05-26 23:22,Spread the word-- Super Heroes wear masks. Our most prominent ones include our health care professionals.
2020-05-26 23:24,"One of the reasons why my wife and I divide our time b/w NY and LA is to enjoy live entertainment.  Our tastes are relatively broad but do lean toward jazz and classical concerts, popular B'way musicals (but few ""extravaganzas"") as well as some ""more serious"" dramas on occasion.  We also enjoy an occasional ball game (Yankees in NY; Dodgers in LA) albeit we gave up our partial season Yankees tickets a few years ago.

In other words, the main reason we live where we do is to enjoy the many cultural opportunities available in the two most ""cultural"" cities in America.

We are both saddened with the fact that the theaters and other venues are ""dark"" and perplexed when it will be that we will feel confident to once again ""go to a show"".

I do think September is ""too soon""; particularly for indoor venues.  And, indeed, I'm worried about that ""jerk"" as well.  I'm hoping our tastes are such that we'll filter out most of that kind of person.

It's such a tension, like so much else with Covid, between choosing what you like to do versus avoiding what is potentially a dangerous situation.  We will certainly follow closely as the entertainment and sports industries seek to find a safe way to ""reopen"".  After all, how many nights can you stay at home streaming another video?

As to museums.  I've already argued here that they should reopen now with admissions limits and social distance markings.  We need somewhere to go on a rainy day!"
2020-05-26 23:32,"If folks can’t even adhere to the no pictures/recording rules during a live theatre performance, how can we expect folks to commit to wearing masks?

Before covid-19 I found a lot of theater goers ruined my experience by talking and checking their phones constantly. I don’t want to shell over a ton of cash to have to also worry about folks who can’t follow health protocols."
2020-05-27 0:03,"Broadway shows are a primary tourist attraction, be they from outside of the state or from 'the Island'     While those from Manhattan are mostly rational and recognize responsibility along with rights,   others are far less so."
2020-05-27 0:45,"It's not just the audiences who need to feel ""comfortable"". I work on feature films; like theater, the actors and crew work very close together. Costuming people, putting on hair and makeup, stunts, fights, dancing, singing. Building sets, having fittings, the list goes on and on. All this is not possible with social distance, and most not possible with a mask. 
Also, like another article in The Times today, the unions simply will not permit it until all workers are safe and protected."
2020-05-27 1:00,Is this idea feasible:  The theaters might have to stoke deals with cable TV companies to broadcast their productions nationally on numerous nights with a live socially distanced audience in the theater.
2020-05-27 1:25,"I am sure the theaters will have proper security outside of the theaters to try to keep people distanced and to make sure that people are wearing masks. I think that is a given. I feel the problem will be once they get inside. There will be people who lower their masks and will be upset if asked to keep it on. If there is no vaccine in sight by the end of the year, these venues may be forced to put the responsibility on the patron to ""attend at their own risk"" so to speak. once inside and possibly in smaller venues, eject those who do not comply. That, though, would probably require more onsite security as ushers at these places and probably even house managers would have a verbal fight on their hands. (I have sen it happen pre-covid) But honestly, I feel that if people are not coughing or sneezing without a mask on it should be ok. The masks are meant to stop us from infecting others. It will be those that don't comply that will, again, be the problem. Just my random thoughts on this."
2020-05-27 1:47,there seems to be this lovely notion that people care about their fellow man.  They care about themselves.  There are a few exceptions true.  Very few.
2020-05-27 2:01,We recently cancelled two Broadway shows for June. Until there is an effective vaccine against the virus we will not be travelling whether by air or cruise ship.And live theatre and great NYC restaurants will be put on hold. I love NY will be a fond memory and a pledge to fulfil post vaccine. Right out of Cats. Memories.
2020-05-27 2:28,"I won’t go to a show if I have to wear a mask. Wearing one is peer pressure and I choose to not go where it is required to wear one. Despite zero science on masks’ effectiveness, I will wear one to go to a store/market etc. so as not to get hassled and mask shamed under these new quasi laws.

Until masks are no longer required universally, few public venues will get any people coming to any.

Having now cancelled my seasons NFL & NBA tickets I have no plans to attend any public events requiring masks in the future."
2020-05-26 22:03,"People are reliably unreliable. Maybe in NYC most would wear masks. Here in Texas, Covid 19 is just the flu with mask, and spacing protocols unnecessary and unworthy for most."
2020-05-26 18:04,"It makes no sense to open Broadway because the actors/performers will not be able to maintain appropriate social distance.  As for the audience the article mentions people worrying about others being jerks well yes people should be worried about that because all we keep hearing and seeing are people not following rules, going to boardwalks and beaches etc.  People are selfish and cannot be trusted therefore no reasonably intelligent person is going to be any part of this."
2020-05-26 18:41,"Bravo to the headline writer for not mincing words.

Interested to see what it will read in the print edition."
2020-05-26 19:15,"This fear of jerks is not just hurting the Broadway economy but the economy as a whole. I had one bad experience getting take out next to a man who refused to wear a mask or practice social distancing, and that did it for me.... not doing that again!
These people who want to flaunt their liberty to remain selfishly un-masked are both the same people demanding we re-open and the ones who are making it harder to do that!!
Our ability to fight the virus and work together is critical to our economic future.  If you love this country, and want it to succeed, follow the rules!"
2020-05-27 0:19,What is their plan to deal with coughers. They need a sick policy. Some sort of refund for the sick so they don’t come to the theater because the ticket cost them $300 or more. And if you have a cough you must leave the theater.  Almost every time I go to the theater it’s like a TB ward
2020-05-26 18:57,"Yes, jerks are a potential problem almost anywhere these days.

However, in the foreseeable future I will not be going to a theater, cinema, restaurant, library, classroom, gym, auditorium, grocery store, big box store or any other enclosed space holding dozens or hundreds of people until someone develops a cure/vaccine for Covid-19. 

Surely by now all NYT readers know that coronavirus is spread not only by coughing and sneezing but by the mere acts of breathing, speaking and singing. Put a few hundred people in an enclosed space all breathing the same air; what could go wrong?

As for airplanes, trains or cruise ships? You must be kidding.

If finding a cure/vaccine takes months or a year or even longer, I can pretty easily avoid the above-noted indoor spaces by using Amazon, grocery delivery services, streaming services, Zoom and Peloton.

As someone in the older age group that is especially vulnerable to severe illness or death from coronavirus, I am highly motivated to avoid exposure to the disease. 

Of course, everyone has his or her own risk tolerance level; mine is extremely low where coronavirus is concerned."
2020-05-26 22:31,"I live in a small rural coastal town in Maine. Our grocery store has done a great job keeping up. They have provided shopping with safe distancing markings on the floors, one way aisles and someone at the door counting customers to stay within state mandated occupancy requirements. They have a large sign at the entry which states that face coverings are required. They also provide them for those who don’t have them. Whenever I have gone in Nearly everyone has a face covering on and abides by the guidelines set forth. Those who don’t, fit a very consistent profile. Men- who are usually heavily tattooed, burly, and who’s expressions are angrily defiant. On a recent shop I noted 6 of them, not all together. What is their issue? The mask is provided-free. It’s (almost) domestic terrorism. I bet they consider themselves “Patriots” protesting for their individual freedoms. They can’t see beyond their narcissistic selves that many in our community, including myself, have families we support with multigenerational members including 90 year olds. Unfortunately, they are also the ones whom, through their lack of judgement, could very well be amongst those who are most likely to spread the disease. Maybe natural selection will take it’s course."

People there aren't so stressed."
2020-05-27 2:55,I would imagine the demographic of Broadway theater goers surveyed trends toward the groups vulnerable to Covid.  Maybe this is an opportunity to lower prices so the less vulnerable (but more economically vulnerable) can afford to attend and be introduced to the wonder of Broadway.
2020-05-27 3:20,"I would return in September to live theatre under 3 conditions: New cases are declining, everyone in the audience wears a mask, and everyone's temperature is taken (including the performers)."
2020-05-27 3:36,"In addition to potentially dealing with uncooperative audience members (aka jerks), out of town visitors have another similar concern: who wants to risk flying to NYC (or anywhere else, for that matter) to see a live performance if airlines cannot or will not enforce wearing of masks, social distancing, etc.? Of course, that issue is not limited to Broadway, and must be addressed if the travel industry is to fully recover."
2020-05-27 3:38,"I can’t blame the anxiety of potential Broadway theatergoers. There is a growing problem with disrespectful behavior in theaters: using cell phones (or not turning them off) and texting during performances, talking, and coming late and disrupting others. Many people seem to feel like they’re in their living rooms instead of a public space with others. So why would others trust that these people would be responsible in this situation?"
2020-05-27 4:16,"Theater and movie theater audiences have been jerks for years. Yakking and cell phones alone are huge deterrents, but at least they wouldn't literally kill me. I have been a theater buff for 70 years but I may never enter a theater again."

2020-05-27 4:31,"All it takes is one super-spreader and the whole theatre is sick. 

Indoor spaces will only be safe if they can figure out how to immediately remove and replace air particles with purified air on a continuous basis. If they could somehow remove the air we breathe out we probably wouldn't even need masks or social distancing."
2020-05-27 4:31,"The issue of mask-non-compliance will have to be resolved.  If the venue does not enforce the rule by ejecting rogue audience members, word will quickly spread and people will stay away.  (And think of the loud arguments during a performance.)  So the solution, not surprisingly, will be commercially-driven.  (By the way, the so-called constitutional argument is laughable - a private venue has the right so set its own rules as long as they are non-discriminatory.)  The airlines problem is trickier - mid-flight ejection is not a practical option.  There would have to be a federal law so that violaters could be arrested upon landing.  Good luck with that."
2020-05-27 5:48,"It was difficult to tolerate the bad conduct of NYC audiences BEFORE the virus.  And now some of them may be infected?  Ummm, internet offerings are looking pretty good right now."
2020-05-27 9:49,"We keep harping about Broadway in the near future. But what about Central Park right now? My unofficial count is that 75% of runners don't work masks, 90% of cyclists and about 20% of walkers."
2020-05-27 10:23,"So assured to learn that ""Broadway won't tolerate social distancing"" in your article.  In that case we can look forward to ""When we dead Awaken"" or 'The Dance of Death' as audience favorites. 

Making a killing on Broadway can't work anymore. Especially if there is no audience left and actors unwilling to perform. How can horn players play without releasing droplets, or actors project ?

Wake up !!"
2020-05-27 4:39,"Along with the general selfishness that seems to be infecting our society, the growing expense of going to live theater or music (or movies, for that matter) gives some people another excuse to be inconsiderate - they paid good money to act that way. I can barely afford one or two tickets a year now. I certainly can't spare the jerk surcharge under life and death conditions."
2020-05-26 22:20,"Ther have been enough arrogent people attanding live events in the past, I can only imagine requesting masks and social distancing.

The guy and his new girlfriend 'dancing' at a concert in the front row of the balcony, while everyone behind them strains to see the stage. The older man in front of you at the opera who won't take off his hat because he's 'cold'. The loud drunk guy who can't quiet down during a sax solo. And the endless supply of cell phone users at any performance who think they're in thier kitchen. 

 There is so much inconsiderate behaviour already, what makes you think these people will wear a mask in the dark for 2 hours?  Ha!  I've seen enough, I'll be staying home indefinately."
2020-05-27 1:42,"Can you imagine the mid-show “whispering” when masks are added?  What, I can’t hear you!"
2020-05-26 20:20,"Hooray! We have a name for them now, ""the jerks""! And the great irony is this: the jerks who insist on their “freedom” and “rights” and “business open as usual” are the very people who will keep the economy suppressed. I’m not going out as long as they’re out."
2020-05-26 18:54,"I am afraid of jerks as well.  Many of them seem to frequent stores, beaches, and streets in many parts of my state.  I'm going to wait out the natural selection process..."
2020-05-26 18:38,"Good luck - they cannot even monitor people from taking videos, making recordings, looking at their phone and recording the musical, clinking the ice in their glasses, eating with noise that rivals pigs at the feeding trough, much less coughing, wearing a mask and gloves.  Yeah just think of the lovelies that are ignoring the social distancing and wearing masks at other venues or walking down the street.  Humans, however wonderful they can individually be and as a whole, can also be the stupidest, mean-spirited, selfish and uncontrollable in their personal behavior, speech and action - wait, isn't that the current state of the executive branch?"
2020-05-26 21:48,"The Broadway theatre are often very old, the seats very small.  If the show is crowded, the person next to you - often some overweight 30 year old - is in your lap.  I've been swatted in the face by the guy next to me who was talking animatedly to his friend beside him.  Manspreading is rampant.  No, I'm not going back soon.  As much as I love NYC and the theatre, I'm getting older.  My absence may be permanent."
2020-05-27 0:28,"My daughter and her family drove from Virginia and paid dearly for great seats at ""Hamilton"" only to hear a woman on their row talk loudly on her cell phone throughout the performance.  Ushers did nothing to silence her.  Jerks like this have prompted all of us to ditch all future Broadway attendance. We'll miss the great shows and talent but not the audience jerks and brats."
2020-05-26 22:04,"Umm for starters.  No travelers from Missouri allowed.  Ditto Texas and whatever other state is not Covid neutral.
 Not till 2021 summer of course."
2020-05-27 1:50,"Lets set things strait. 

Fear of jerks is a real time concern everywhere.

Going to a theater at this time is lunacy.

To prove what? Your important? We knew that already!

Why not stay at home and give everyone else a break from your self-centered indulgence and be part of the resolution and not the problem.

There are plenty of other hobbies/interests that you might pursue find interesting without endangering  the rest of society."
2020-05-27 11:18,"I subscribe to the Goodman Theater here in Chicago. It is planning a 2020-2021 season. As my regular seat is in the balcony during a weekday matinee, I often have no one sitting immediately around me. That said, even with distancing in the seats, what seems to be a real issue is how people get in and out of the theater without crowding together.  Usually, especially in leaving, there is a throng moving together down the stairs and through the lobby. It's hard to imagine a bunch of Americans eager to get out before rush hour fully sets in patiently waiting as the crowd thins at 6 feet apart intervals. 

Another concern is patrons who wear a mask into the theater, but then pull it down below nose or even under their chins once the performance starts ( a highly likely scenario)… 

I am not someone who is particularly afraid or anxious during this crisis, though I do take recommended precautions. Still, I do see very real potential problems."
2020-05-27 12:13,"We are regular theater goers, upwards of two a month thanks to TDF, but with this ongoing pandemic and our ages we will have to forgo the wonder of live theater. There’s nothing like the joy and beauty of live theater, but it’s not safe. We saw three shows and a performance at Radio City over three weeks mid January to early February. We ate out and of course used subways from Queens, as well as crowded in around Times Square. All while virus was lurking around us. At one performance we were close enough to see what came out of actors mouths. And we got sick. I was so bad I couldn’t walk ten steps without struggling to breathe. Thought it was flu despite having had senior flu and pneumococcal vaccines. Now no it so sure. Was it COVID-19? We were in all the right areas of town and venues, with lots of European visitor, who we now know brought this to NY, joining us at shows. 

There is no viable way to make the old, tight theaters safe for audience or actors and musicians. It would even have to be as extreme as three performances a day, with rotating casts and socially distanced seating. But it won’t and can’t happen. 

So this too may be a huge cultural and economic loss to NY until a proven vaccine is given to all. Until then we will mourn one more piece of NY that makes it what it is."
2020-05-27 12:27,"It isn't just Broadway shows how many times have I heard someone cough loudly at the ballet or symphony? Too many times especially in the fall and winter. I did ask to be moved once when a lady was hacking and coughing in our row. With C-19, I will need to avoid going all together because there is too much risk. Live stream and pay per view for performing arts may be the preferred option until there is a safe and effective vaccine available."
2020-05-27 12:51,"It seems very odd that this polling did not mention any age demographic. The audience for most Broadway shows are older and would seem to suggest a greater concern for possible Covid-19 transmission and health consequences.

And, given the ridiculous, if not offensive (personal editorial comment) expense for a Broadway ticket, which effectively prices young patrons out of the theater (and, hence, future supporters of theater, ditto edit comment), the risk ratio to attending the theater makes it even more troubling. 

Producers have largely used the same business model for Broadway productions for decades. It would be wise if they -- and the dozen-plus unions they collaborate with -- used this time during the pandemic to revisit and rethink the basics of their business, how they can attract a more diverse audience, offer more new and, especially, classical plays, and at prices that are truly affordable (so that we never have to hear about tickets to, say, ""Hamilton,"" selling for nearly $1,000, which, to me, is criminal...yes, my final editorial comment)."
2020-05-27 13:34,"I had a glorious time visiting Broadway this season. I saw ""Inheritance Part 1 & 2,"" ""West Side Story,"" ""The Minutes,"" ""Company,"" and on my second day in Miami, ""COVID-19"". I LOVE NY! The theater is my passion! I won't we going to Broadway until there is a treatment or vaccine."
2020-05-27 13:40,"It is the same story in Montreal - individual concern versus societal concern. We forget that rights and liberties come with responsibilities -- and right now, these responsibilities demand individuals do everything possible to avoid causing harm.

Montrealers are in a similar position: large population,higher density (nowhere near NYC). It angers me that individuals chose to ignore distancing guidelines and recommended mask wear, yet cannot think of the care workers, medical professionals and first responders which will bear the brunt of the consequences... and then cry during the second wave or waive their right to ignore mandated vaccinations."
2020-05-27 14:15,"The closing of Broadway theaters has broken my heart. But I insisted on a refund of every ticket for this summer, then donated to non-profit companies, to Broadway Cares, and to the Actor's Fund.

Ms. St. Martin is entirely correct: theater is not a low-density enterprise, either for audiences or for performers. And so, regretfully, I will not buy another ticket until 1) an effective vaccine becomes available or 2) an effective treatment can stop the worst ravages of the disease before it becomes life-threatening. The fun of theater is crowd reaction, and right now, whether masked or unmasked, the crowd is just plain dangerous to the audience and everybody else they come into contact with later."
2020-05-27 14:22,"I am a theater regular.  I will gladly wear a mask, gloves or anything else required if it means I can attend a glorious day/night at the theatre!   We must all accept that to bring our beloved Broadway/Off Broadway back we must all accept that wearing a mask will be part of a new normal. Waiting for a vaccine does not seem realistic as I wonder it about distribution to regular people.  Mask wearing and  staying home when sick are the keys to normalcy."
2020-05-27 11:19,"""Fear of jerks"" is exactly why we are keeping our bookstore locked and letting people in in small numbers, as well as the curb side, delivery, and mailings that we continue provide.  We will have some face coverings to give out if people need them, but nobody will be allowed in who refuses to act in a safe way. 

Thanks to Trump and his cult, not wearing a mask is the new MAGA hat, and even though we live in a community that has taken the virus seriously and mostly responsibly, this is a very mobile society- anyone can go anywhere."
2020-05-27 12:26,"This is the Reality in America today “JERKS” are invading personal space across the board not just the Theaters.These folks have no personal discipline or regard for others. 
This is a key factor of the “Dumbing of America” and sad to say the Media and Entertainment Industries are enablers."
2020-05-27 13:09,"I think the fundamental failure of the government and corporate America to provide the general public with the kind of N 95 mask that is protecting health care workers is going to really hurt not only theaters, but retail, restaurants, bars, and museums.   As it is, the masks we get won't protect us from infection, only from spreading the virus, so we are risking infection if we go into a confined space with jerks who refuse to wear a mask.  The city refuses to enforce the mask rule.  Why should we go out and support anything if we don't feel safe there because of people who won't wear a mask or wear it correctly?   I find it infuriating just to go out for a walk at daylight because of all the 20/30 something brats who refuse to wear a mask outdoors when they are jogging or biking, so why should I expect something different in a theater?   The economy won't bounce back until people feel safe, and the government's failure to enforce masks/distancing is making me feel unsafe to leave my apartment.    Good luck filling even half of a theater."
2020-05-27 13:16,"A Broadway show is bad enough when you have to sit next to a 30 year old man-spread! who needs a seat and a half.

2020-05-27 13:59,"Life is a gamble in the best of times. If you're concerned about health and can't let it go, stay home. There are no certainties in life no matter what our politicians and TV commercials tell ya."
2020-05-27 13:11,"People were already jerks. Talking. Laughing and knee slapping and sighing so loud as to drown out the actors. Eating. Cell phone use. Old people, young people- they crawl out of every demographic pit.

Add masks and distancing? There will be blood."
2020-05-27 12:43,If any city is likely to have jerks it's NYC.  Theatre attendees need to take protection as personal resposibility.
2020-05-27 13:14,"This is stupidity itself. I don't know the likelihood of transmission in a theater today. I don't know what the likelihood of transmission will be on Labor Day and I certainly don't know what it will be on January 1st 2021. And neither do any of the people polled. If there's a second wave, there's a decent chance that infection rates will be higher in January than September. This type of speculation, absent any understanding, data or science is a waste of time.

Here's what we do know. Whenever these theaters can begin to reopen, things are going to be different. There may be restrictions on capacity. There may be segments of the population (elderly and sick) that are discouraged or not allowed to attend. There will be fewer tourists for some unknown period of time. With all these issues, if the theaters are going to attract audiences there will be a bigger spotlight on the other barrier to entry that existed before the pandemic: price. Ticket prices are going to have to drop...a lot. And to make that happen, theaters, producers and unions need to be working on that right now. Union rules and rates need to change or we are going to see theater closings all over town. It was not long ago that many current theaters were dormant, decrepit or fantasies. We will see a swift return to that condition if it doesn't become drastically cheaper to put on shows."
2020-05-27 16:58,"I attend dozens of shows on and off Broadway every year.  I've renewed several of my subscriptions for next season after receiving refunds for canceled shows this year.

Yet I don't know how I will feel about attending whenever theaters reopen.  I strongly suspect many won't wear masks throughout a show just judging from my daily walks in Manhattan right now.  It's astounding the number of folks without masks, with masks covering the mouth but not the nose, and those with masks on their chin ready to pull up only when required upon entering a store.  Selfishness rules here in NYC.

If flight attendants on planes are not empowered to enforce mask rules in flight then what hope do theater ushers have?"
2020-05-27 17:35,"No vaccine. No shows, period. 
Seeing live theatre was a pain before covid-19. The cell phones, the costs, etc. I can live without it. Same with sports.
I am finding other ways to fill my time."
2020-05-27 13:47,"the jerks have always been with us in public spaces like theatres, only now they can also kill us, just look at the jerks at the beaches and bars. I don't go to theatre much, the prices baby the prices so I'm not going to be affected by all of this. When I do go to the theatre I make sure I am in the orchestra on the aisle. Going to movies now are also full of jerks. What to do?"
2020-05-27 15:37,This is my concern about going anywhere.

2020-05-26 18:00,"I do not used to comment about articles or news, but in this case I have to do an exception. Coursera is making history, never before knowledge from the best professors and universities had been available for so many people. Additionally, students are able to meeting with each others, debating, seeing and assessing what others do, finally, you can learn and grow, it deserves the biggest thanks."
2020-05-26 18:00,"Many education institutions, MOOCS or traditional, often seem to miss the point about Value and Exchange Value.  Education and skills increase the value of a worker in the labor market but that does not mean employers are willing to pay that worker a commensurate wage based on the time, expense, effort it took to acquire the skills by the worker.


There are Millions of people unemployed around the world,  increasing downward pressure on wages across many job categories.  As wages fall, there becomes less of an incentive to pay for classes or even take classes, if there is no foreseeable economic benefit in the future.  Sure, some people like to learn for the sake of learning. However, taking a class does not mean completing a class to its conclusion.  The low wage environment for the next two years will most likely keep course completion rates as low as they have been since the inception of MOOCs"
2020-05-26 18:03,"Well, I hope people don't expect they can offer little attention AND actually learn something useful.  Learning isn't easy, but it's available to those who put in the time and effort.  If you don't have the self-motivation, why bother learning a new skill that you'd clearly never apply yourself to be good at."
2020-05-26 19:53,"Naturally free courses encourage people to try out areas of learning about which they have been vaguely interested, and naturally lots of them drop out when their curiosity is satisfied.  It is logical that those who pay for a course will have a deeper commitment - but there will be fewer of them.
What matters is the number, not the percent of those who finish an online course.  These are people who know have knowledge or a skill that they did not have before.  Their increased capability benefits all of us."
2020-05-26 21:04,"I have to say my experience with online classes has been wonderful. I truly dislike taking notes so being able to review class material - including the course IM chat transcript and lecture - works well for me. No social distractions and unlimited access to a vast library of reference material is a huge timesaver. 
Attempting to complete group project work is a hassle as folks often don’t show up but I find that’s true for on any site course."
2020-05-26 21:07,"For those of us who have completed our education, MOOCs in the humanities offer immense value. Global History Lab, taught by Jeremy Adelman of Princeton, is a wonderful brush up for those of us who were partially educated in Western Civilization. Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania offer marvelous philosophy, art, literature and history courses."

Especially in our rapidly changing technological world where periodic learning new skill sets increasingly is required. On line courses are very actively used in the military, medicine and high tech computer fields. Not surprisingly there’s resistance from those enjoying the benefits of full time staff at the brick and mortar institutions. Especially true for public school education. Just as the web opened up dramatic new universes so too the bright future of online learning. The future is on line earning. The past is brick and mortar."

In the Future, something like this is planned.  Everything that is online distance, now:  will be gone, gone, gone.

2020-05-27 0:57,"I took a Coursera class on Interactive Python Programming from Rice University a few years ago, did well (helps to have an engineering degree and six patents), helped some people out on forums, and was invited to serve as a teaching assistant, which I did for a couple of years.

Some interesting stats from one class: 

* 107,000 students signed up from over 100 countries (class was free), ranging in age from a 12 year old in Sweden to people in their 70's and 80's

* drop out rate was roughly 50% each week but we ended up with about 8,000 students completing the final project (an interactive game similar to Asteroids)

* some people look at the dropout rate and say ""this is a waste"", yet no one left less knowledgeable than when they signed up

* others look at the 8,000 who finished and point out this is more students than the instructors would teach at university in many years.  And many of the students were from countries with limited educational opportunities.

All in all a good experience (I've taken other MOOCs that were not as well presented).  Shout out to the two professors who put this together, Joe Warren and Scott Rixner."
2020-05-27 1:18,"The model of learning in these online courses is actually the way we are supposed to learn but aren’t able to in school, that is to say, active learning. The videos are short, if you like you can speed up the tempo, or you can read the transcript. You can write notes on the screen if you like, and after each video there is a short quiz. Furthermore, you can view a video again and again, or you can - if you are one of those people who are unable to follow steps A to Z - jump to videos farther ahead and than back again. 
All this makes learning incredibly more fruitful and interesting for those of us who are lousy note takers and highlighters, whose minds wander during a lecture in a real classroom, wishing there were a transcript they could take home or to the library and pour over."
2020-05-27 3:16,I have taken MOOCs via edX and Coursera since 2012. I love both these platforms. I've dropped out of some and completed many. Some were free and others were paid. Completing a micromasters from MITX is one of my proudest achievements.

2020-05-27 8:22,"Three highly recommended MOOCS, all Ivy League professors, all free. I’ve completed two with the third in progress.  (1) “Modern & Contemporary Poetry” (ModPo) on Coursera with University of Pennsylvania’s Al Filreis. Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman through today’s edgiest poets. Filreis convenes panels of brilliant teaching assistants, asks incisive questions, never lectures. Students worldwide review each other’s essays during the live fall semester, many return to ModPo annually.  (2) “Learning from Ebola: Preventing the Next Pandemic” on edX with Harvard Global Health Institute’s Dr. Ashish Jha. He traces lessons that inform Covid understanding and strategy. Jha interviews key on the ground players in the West African pandemic including, to my surprise, Chelsea Clinton. Recorded five years ago in 2015. It gets poignant when Jha asks pandemic experts, “we’re sitting here five years from now, will we be in a better place?” (3) “Civil War & Reconstruction: 1865 - 1890” on edX with Columbia University’s Eric Foner, one of the most renowned historians of our time. Foner taught this class for 30 years, recorded his final lectures and it’s like witnessing the last concerts of a great orchestral conductor. Course divided into three sequential classes. Foner says, “parallels certainly exist between the decade before the Civil War and our time.”"
2020-05-27 12:48,"One online learning platform not mentioned in this article is FutureLearn based in the UK. A friend recommended it to me several years ago and I found their learning model of short videos, activity-by-activity focused discussion forums moderated actively by course faculty and teaching assistants, periodic quizzes, and access to authoritative online resources and images like 3D models and specialty databases have kept me fascinated.  I've taken (and completed) courses as diverse as ""Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier"" to ""Forensic Psychology: Witness Investigation"" and will be starting a new course ""Introduction to Production Design for Film and Screen"" at the end of next month.  I have found these courses far more compelling than traditional lecture classes I have taken on campus where you sit in a classroom full of students who are absently browsing their email while a professor drones on behind a lectern, his occasional questions going unanswered  by the vast majority of students who appear bored and essentially uninterested. Like Coursera, FutureLearn's courses are free unless you wish to obtain a digital certificate, priced at a very reasonable amount. Even though I am now a retired education technologist and no longer interested in a second career, I enjoy the mental stimulation online learning offers so pay for a certificate as a way to support this online effort."
2020-05-27 13:49,"One thing I'm surprised by is the lack of camaraderie and emphasis on peer relationships and network building.  Looking back on my college years I really can't remember how to find the cosine of an angle but I remember very well my first kiss or the friendships I formed some of which I still alive and well.  Ultimately, it's the people that matter.  I started forming study groups and I find it helps keep me motivated and engaged.  Discord is also great for online community chat and joinhowdy is great for live video discussion groups with people who share my interests. This has helped me tremendously as I have tried to adapt to a changing world and overcome the barriers to learning alone."
2020-05-27 12:21,"MOOCs are doing a great job of covering every aspect of education & they have a built in advantage of a bigger success of teaching as students who enroll with them want to learn themselves rather than being forced to go to school. 
From MOOCs to mainstream education need to fill one big gap in education that needs to be filled. Our education system is geared towards providing the expertise to earn good money. There is no universal effort to teach how to save and invest money. As a result most people in America earn good money but almost half end up without any savings let alone with any investments.
Again America is an emotionally challenged country because our experts lump the brain and mind as the mind. Thus we have cutting edge mind education while brain education is not only missing, the brain is miseducated. 
MOOCs must note that it is brain education that generates emotional health (EH) that is the foundation of health, education, society, relationships, happiness etc. 
Along with short videos I have thought of creating educational songs that will teach brain education. Here are two songs that I have produced.

MOOC's don't resemble the courses I took at all. My online classes had a limit of 20 students. We introduced ourselves to each other and formed a community.

MOOC's do have ways to break into smaller groups, even if organized locally.

But I do not understand why people keep writing about MOOC's as representative of online classes. Thousands of students, when many universities and continuing education programs offer quality online classes for 20-25 at a time."

I and Karol started a small business together when i was in the college and the business was growing from strength to strength until i left to further my education in German. It happened all of a sudden 6 months after i went to Germany that i lost contact with Karol. His phone number was no longer going through and he stopped responding to my emails. After my 12 months study in Germany, i return home to see that Karol has brought another woman into our home. He drove me out in the middle of the night and i was double heart broken because he was my boyfriend and business partner. I stayed with in a friend's house because my foster parents was late then.  When i was chatting on Facebook with a school mate of mine in Germany, he introduce me to Priest Odibo and told me that the man helped him. I wanted to hurt Karol for all he has done to me but when i contacted the priest of the temple, he told me that Karol was under a spell. I begged him to destroy the spell and bring him back to me. I act according to his advise and four days after i contacted him, Karol called my friend and told her that he wants to speak with me. I taught it was a nightmare but when i close and opened my eyes, i notice that it is reality. I and Karol got united and we are getting married in a month time.

Some offered  ""No where else"" classes, including a Harvard Med School class on gross anatomy (human dissection). However, after a few years, the emphasis shifted dramatically to making money.  I felt like a second-class citizen as some classes denied exercises and homework answers to those not paying for certificates. As a retiree, I have no need for certificates,  but exercises are many time required to learn the material. Perhaps, the pendulum has swung the other way and everyone has full access to the class materials.  Sincerely, I hope the universities make lots of money from certificates, but equally don't forget their early mission of education for all."

Millions of people lose their jobs. Their jobs are gone, maybe one in two of those jobs is gone forever. We, as a society, can't help them. Some very influential people at the top are not actually worried what will happen to those people and their families; rather, they are very worried what kind of message it would send to help them (see endnote).
Millions are also losing ability to purchase health insurance. Many people and entire families will either avoid seeking needed medical help until they are forced to go to the ERs. With bankruptcies looming, many will turn into today's paupers - fallen outside society with no meaningful way back in. 

We are witnessing a massive failure. We are becoming a poor nation, abandoning our collective sense of society, and abandoning our most vulnerable and young children. We don't provide services, and increasingly don't care to, not even pretend to care.

Endnote- during the potato famine in Ireland, mid-1800s, the English ruling class chose to let the Irish starve to death lest that they might fall victim to moral hazard. That's exactly McConnell's sensitivity in our times."

The victims of this pandemic are all Americans.  But I ask why is it that the most vulnerable of our society are affected more adversely...the aged, people of color, prisoners, and now our children, our future.  So we await for Congress's next step in helping our kids.  But how much hope can we have when Congress includes Mitch McConnell's Senate, and the Oval Office houses a man who cares more about the numbers of his supporters and Wall Street rather than the numbers of those affected directly or indirectly by Covid-19."

The historical experiences of famines show that hunger results in serious diseases with clear physical signs. Once you have seen pictures of skeletal babies in Ethiopia or Yemen, you can’t unsee them. Starving children during the artificial famines in the USSR and China dropped dead at far higher rates than adults. So why is the obesity rate in kids going through the roof in this country? The US has a higher percentage of morbidly obese children than any other industrialized nation. Clearly the parents have no idea how to feed their children, stuffing them with junk instead of real food. If you want to send money to the families, at least require that the parents buy fresh produce instead of garbage. The debit cards should be limited to non-processed food only."

I also have served as a Camp Nurse for the Fresh Air Fund, which services underprivileged kids of NYC.  Jenny Morgenthau - where are you?  You have power and should be utilizing it with our US Congress.  

Children have done absolutely nothing wrong in these times.  They are non political.  They don’t even care about that stuff.  They are helpless.  They are innocent.  But they should be hungry?  No food on the table?

The lack of food for Americans, especially children has been climbing for years. This deplorable and unnecessary situation should NEVER happen.  But it has while food banks and repositories barely hold on with the meager donations they have received in the past. 

This pandemic has brought this crisis to the surface and yet, the federal government can't even seem to manage something so simple as providing ample food for families and children on a daily or weekly basis.

3) South Carolina hesitated because of $1 million in administrative costs? That works out to less than 20 cents per resident, to get millions pumped into the economy. What's wrong with this picture? (Hint: see #2) above)

But even without a temporary crisis, there is chronic dependence on the government to feed children.  School provided meals are becoming the norm in many areas.  Parents expect that their children will be fed by someone else.
Where is the responsibility - other than in abnormal hard times or family disasters - of so many parents to care for their own children?  Has the expectation of government support become the norm?
So many people now have children they can't afford.  There is an expectation of entitlement with which not everyone is in agreement."

All, while cynically pretending to ""care"" about the fortunes of those that don't belong to their elite clientele.

Do you want a society which delivers the kind of broad happiness and social mobility that the Nordic model provides? So do I.

Do you pine for real social equality? Equality of education, opportunity, and treatment under the law? So do I.

But, we're not going to get it, if we keep electing people who's only goal is to drive a massive wedge into that equality for their own personal benefit, and the benefit of those few, the 1 in 100,000, who least need the protection and sole consideration of the federal government.

Keep electing the greedy, the self-centered, the self-serving,  the self-absorbed, and that's what we'll continue to see all around us.

Hope is not lost. There is still time to save this country and fix what's wrong with it. But that hope, and that time, and the opportunity they present are quickly slipping away.

2020-05-27 14:24,This health crisis has served to reveal severe deficiencies in American society of long standing. Deficiencies now amplified. Here the issue is children dependent on free school breakfasts and lunches during the school year. Those fortunate Americans not dependent on the government Food Stamp program are unaware that the customary government monthly food allotment is far from generous. Ask a Food Stamp recipient and they will tell you every month is a struggle not to run out of Food Stamps before the month is over. Now in the midst of the virus pandemic we see states with aggrandized needs unable to organize the official mechanisms required to distribute benefits and food. The social safety net in America has been an unsubstantial social welfare product and now become one with big holes in it.

Watching the hourly pandemic-related ads on TV, we could complacently believe that aid and food distribution volunteers have it (almost) covered.  Growing up in the '60's, my family experienced a period of situational poverty without the resources of aid, food banks, or credit, which I doubt my proud parents would have accepted. On the leanest days, we ate noodles for dinner with nothing on them so my mother could send us to school with an apple, carrots and peanut butter sandwich, plus a precious 15 cents for a carton of milk.  Now, though, I think of our modest-sized backyard and wonder why, beyond the clotheslines, did we not grow a vegetable garden?  There would have been tomatoes, cucumbers, peas, radishes, lettuce, beans...Someone needed to teach me. Today, empty school buildings usually sit on unused land, equaling missed opportunities for community gardens and/or volunteers with a clearance to plant seeds in recycled containers for backyards, patios, window sills.  Bring back some seed for next year and repeat the cycle.  The web is full of seed-saving techniques.  My favorite from my visits to the Midwest is:  www.seedsavers.org

Ok. I do not know this woman's struggle and surely $10/hour is not a livable wage. However, this statement seems like a testament to the other side of the problem: many Americans have no idea how to feed themselves. Sloppy joes? Even cheap beef is expensive and has low nutritional value. And look at the cover photo for the story: mayonnaise slathered meat salad on a (likely highly processed) crossaint with a tiny piece of fruit. What about a diet revolving around dried beans, rice and cabbage? Those are incredibly cheap, highly available and provide some real nutrition.

So 1/3 of households with kids go to bed every night and wake up every morning hungry.

Food insecurity in households with children under 18 has increased by about 130 percent from 2018 to today according to Brookings with no end in sight.

No parent should have to ""pretend to be distracted"" while their kids grab for seconds because they are hungry.  Nor should a child tell his or her parent that they are full when they truly are not, only so their parents could eat.

Enough with the political red tape already.  This country is heading into the 5th month of this pandemic. 

I understand why it will take awhile before a vaccine for this virus can be found to be effective and safe.

But for crying out loud already.  We are talking about providing money and/or food to families, to young children, who are hungry, if not starving.  

This is NOT rock science.

The notion of young bodies not receiving the proper nutrition, especially during the years of growth, could have lasting if not detrimental effects.

We don't learn much about Pandemic-EBT, as mentioned in this article, but perhaps that program needs expansion.  Maybe the long lines at food banks et al giveaway sites mean we should make EBT regulations a bit more flexible, give more fed $s for EBT outreach, do more to expand a program that was providing  the ""federal nutrition safety net"" we already had before the pandemic.

Capitalism certainly has appeal, but without accepting the liabilities carried, it is just another excuse for avoiding social responsibility. Where are the wealthiest men and women in our nation when our kids need them???

We don't need legislation if simple human generosity existed among the richest and apparently most selfish of our citizenry.

Among other diversions they can accumulate trillions of dollars dollars, launch useless rockets, purchase and maintain rarely used residences throughout the world and, in exchange for a vanity plate at the door, endow already wealthy universities.

Time for us to take a look at the the national accomplishments of President Eisenhower, a rarely cited Republican hero, who used what are today considered over the top taxes to advance a unity and equality among our citizenry which has never been matched.

Instead politicians as well as much of our citizenry cite the ""Hollywood Hero"" Ronald Reagan as one of our great Presidents when in fact he is on a par with today's White House occupant.

China with their realistic and brutally honest approach to the future is in our rear view mirror. 

Our delusions appear to finally catching up with us and we may have to kiss our fleeting trial with greatness goodbye."

2020-05-28 0:02,"I know it’s hard to believe, but it is very difficult to give away money without problems, especially when recipients number in the many tens of millions.

From its inception EBT has experienced both individual and organized fraud. Despite rules against doing so, many individuals spend funds for non-food items like liquor, beer and cigarettes that do not benefit children. Some recipients have even sold their EBT cards on Craig’s List and other online sources.

Some store owners have been convicted of committing massive EBT fraud running into hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.

Even with all sorts of procedures and controls already in place for its cards, EBT has an ineligibility rate of almost 2%. This means that for the new program described in this article, for what the article holds out as 30 million hungry children perhaps up to 600,000 might actually be ineligible to receive the benefits. 

Helping many millions of people/children usually adds up to many billions of dollars, so we are not talking about paltry sums here; this is why EBT is an ongoing target for small- and large-scale fraud.

Americans are a charitable people. However, while we must do better to get food to truly needy children in a timely manner, we must also guard against those who would abuse and steal these funds, which of course are provided by taxpayers."

Some viruses in the air may be more infective when the air breathed in is cold. The space in which meatpackers work may be refrigerated as a whole, making for a more infectious environment.

This might lower the chance of infection.

Concerning keeping your distance: when I worked in the UK in the 90s, there was much publicity given there at the time about the UK opting out of the EU's 'Social chapter'.  One of the rules and regulations therein was that workplaces should be at a certain mutual distance.

I can appreciate why people enjoy those various meats, but honestly, I have never been able to rid my memory of those sights and smells when I was young.

To this day (and it's been well over 60 years), it is difficult making meals with meat as the main ingredient which is why my husband does all of the cooking and I remain the consummate baker.

""Smithfield would not supply any data."" Did the reporter talk to any floor workers? The horrific conditions inside meat plants, the utter disdain of management for worker protection, the gutting of workers' ability to organize for their own protection, and the enforced secrecy that hides the horror is part of the glue of denial that holds American life together."

Though the company had a ""wear mask"" policy in effect he was still allowed to tour the plant without a mask. Weak executives bow to him as though he were a God.

I get the Harvard special health reports monthly and they say we should only eat red meat of any kind only 1 time a month.

2020-05-26 14:14,"Regarding meat, less meat eating is better for the planet and better for our health.  I became a vegetarian between the age of 18 and 19 (It just happened and was not a conscious choice) - that was over 40 years ago when vegetarianism was not common.  My mother, worried about my health,  sent me ""Diet for a Small Planet"" and ""Nutrition Action and Nutrition Scoreboard"".    I was hooked on nutrition and ended up with extensive formal education over the years and making it a career.  I still subscribe to Nutrition Action after all these years. 

In the early 1980s I saw a documentary about chicken.  This was after I had read  ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair.  They showed a slaughterhouse with chickens on a conveyor belt and the workers cutting the tumors off before packaging.  I was grossed out beyond belief that people would eat such unhealthy animals and that wasn't even the point.  They were trying to show how efficient the process is.  

That said, I also find the concept that people would eat meat that had been processed by workers who are infected with a contagion also to be the height of disgusting.  Much less, forcing these people to work when they are sick and spreading disease.  

Farmers forced to kill their animals due to massive over supply inspires profound sadness for them and the animals.

We need better balance with our food - balance with health, balance with animal rights, and balance with the planet. Perhaps CoVid 19 will show us the way."
2020-05-26 13:55,"Corona virus has not gone totally from the Chinese soil. But before that, unmindful of the health problems it created, wet markets already opened in China. The reopening has drawn global ire. At a large food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, signs forbid the selling of wild animals and live fowl, while announcements calling for “victory” over COVID-19 play on a loop from speakers. In the US too, the administration in some states are favoring opening meat outlets. Can't people forego meat for some more time, at least till the corona virus goes? Or at least the workers in these meat shops and slaughtering houses has to undergo complete health check up and must be provided all the necessary protective gears."
2020-05-26 14:20,"Wuhan tested 6.5 million people for the corona virus in a matter of days.

With a citywide campaign, designed to prevent a resurgence of Covid19, involved mobilizing thousands of medical and other workers and spending hundreds of millions of dollars.

With the central government covering the testing cost, as well as coordinating the logistics, the aim of restoring public confidence that is needed to help restart the economy, shows how they move forward.

Our Nation, with its inept “leadership” still largely sits on its hands. Arguing over a “wait and see” approach to stimulus in the Senate, coupled together with a President who seeks to push the actual coordination off onto 50 different State governments, is a recipe for disaster."
2020-05-26 14:39,"Trump is not concerned about victims of COVID-19. He is concerned about not losing Nov. 3rd.

2020-05-26 14:26,"Wisconsin's conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice Patience Roggensack said in justifying ending the governor's ""Safer at Home"" order that ...
The surge in Covid19 was ""due to the meatpacking""—"" that's where Brown County got the flare,"" Roggensack said. ""It wasn't just the regular folks in Brown County.""

Justice Roggensack seems to display an attitude that meatpacking workers are not ""regular folks"".  Perhaps this attitude popular among some conservatives and business leaders helps explain why an accurate accounting of the health of meatpacking workers is elusive.

One can't help but think of Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" of a century ago and wonder what if anything has changed."
2020-05-26 14:19,"In the absence of reliable data, it can be assumed that the number of infected meat processing workers is much, much higher than reported. In fact, the number of those sick and deceased  from the virus in the entire country has been under reported for political reasons. We are most probably well beyond the 100,000 that the Trump administration has allowed to be reported."
2020-05-26 14:25,"So we're not getting death or even illness numbers from Florida, Georgia, meat packing companies, assisted living facilities and the CDC is mixing their testing results to inflate the number of tests given. You've got to hand it to them, keeping everyone in the dark is a great way to win the ""open up"" argument. It's like magic for evil people."
2020-05-26 14:27,"I remember when Trump was first elected, several of my neighbors who voted for him jumped with unbounded elation. I always had my reservations about Trump knowing his history and being from NY, to me he was always a con man. My instincts made me feel deeply disheartened when he won the election. 

I would hear from neighbors, friends and even family, give him a chance to do his job….he’ll be great. Well, I did give him a chance and he failed miserably. The last 3 ½ years has been horrible for the country and he has made the country not only a laughing stock all over the world but created division and friction within the country as well as alienating many of our allies and continues to do so without restraint.

Millions were captivated by Trump the con man and the country is now paying a huge price. The handling of COVID-19 is another example of how Trump has failed us ( nearly 100,000 have died and millions sick). COVID-19 was not created by Trump but he could have acted responsibly and stepped up to curb its insurgence instead of downplaying and calling it a hoax. 

Ironically, the joy and elation experienced by my neighbors, friends and even family members has long since left them………it was short lived. The illusion of false hopes and promises were exactly that……an illusion.....what we got is chaos."
2020-05-26 14:27,Shouldn't all businesses have to officially report COVID-19 cases? It should be the law.
2020-05-26 14:31,"The last thing you want to do in an epidemic is withhold information on spread of a disease and testing for the disease.  But that's exactly what we're seeing.  Even the CDC, the most respected infectious disease organization in the world prior to now, is combining virus and antibody tests in its reports and thereby creating a falsely inflated view of our level of surveillance.  In several states, high risk facilities like nursing homes, prisons and meat processing plants are either under tested or having test results withheld from the public.  Cause of death data are also being redacted from death reports in a least one state.

All of this is being done to beautify the data in an effort to help Trump politically.  Politicization of this health crisis, either through data manipulation or encouragement by the Trump administration to open economies without having met its own guidelines for infection containment, is dishonest, dangerous and despicable.  People will die who otherwise would have lived because of it.

What kind of president is it who allows people to needlessly suffer and die in order to serve his political interests?"

 If you can avoid buying these brands, and dump their stocks, there might be a message. South Africa heard it, lettuce and grape growers heard it. History offers us useful lessons, if we choose  to pay attention.

Boycott them.  Worried aboyt the jobs these folks need?  well here's a thought: they have to be healthy and alive to work them and make money., 

Not an applicable argument if they are DEAD."
2020-05-26 14:42,"I have a serious question to which I'd appreciate a factual, insightful response.  What may be the impact on contagion of a virus introduced at a meat packing plant, if any, when raw meat is frozen for (say) three to five days prior to thawing and cooking?  In short, can the virus be 'killed' if frozen?

Could such a process kill the virus and to what degree of certainty?  Are there any variations of the freezing process which might best reduce risk of contagion, such as use of dry ice or if brought to a very low temp by way of an industrial freezer??  

A brief medical article along these lines would be of help to public health.  Thank you."
2020-05-26 14:42,"I have a major problem with meat-packing industries not reporting to local health officials any CV-19 illnesses that take their workers offline. (That will assume these businesses aren't going out of their way to protect their workers and in some cases actually making the disease spread among the communities where they are located.)
Clearly they don't want that information to get out, to the detriment of their essential work forces and beyond. 
I also have a problem with the federal government forcing openings of businesses without giving clear-cut measures for keeping everybody safe. 
What happened to OSHA? What happened to regulators? This government has dropped the ball in so many NEEDLESS ways.
You want to open businesses again, you best be sure to protect the workers that bring you the goods and services. Otherwise people will start boycotting products if they haven't already.
And workers will (as they should) go on strike.
Nobody should have to risk death or be forced to sign waivers saying they own't sue the company for bad practices. 
This ""elusive"" information shouldn't be a one-way street if we are to survive this pandemic."
2020-05-26 14:24,"Perhaps it's time for a national (re-) reading of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. While many focus on the few pages that address the absolutely horrid conditions of meat that left the factory, Mr. Sinclair's initial reason for writing the book was to show the conditions of immigrant workers during America's gilded age. Yes, publication of the novel led President Roosevelt to push the Meat Inspection Act and the creation of the FDA, each of which continues to be weakened as time passes.

Fast-forward to now, when so many of those who work in the meat processing plants are *still* immigrants, so many now from Latin American instead of from Eastern Europe. Of course, there have also been outbreaks in Louisiana (PRIVATELY OWNED) prisons where undocumented workers were sent after raids in Mississippi last year. 

There is no justification to hide this information. Of course, we, the people, should be demanding that our elected officials actually do something about this situation. Unfortunately, far too many are content to sit back and let things play out in a deliberately moderate (at best) pace."
2020-05-26 14:26,"The lack of information falls directly at the feet of the CDC. Collecting infection data is one of their primary responsibilities. Its accurate and up to date. 

No company, or State can refuse to comply. Threaten to file a a Freedom of Information Lawsuit, that should get  everyone's attention."
2020-05-26 14:46,"Facts are facts.  The first coronavirus case in the United States due to community spread was in California.  We locked down completely and immediately. By contrast, the New York governor talked about turning the spigot and how much to turn the spigot and trying to get the spigot turning right and staged the lockdown hoping to keep from having to do it.

California's deaths are very low, when you evaluate them per capita or compare them to the less populous New York, or many other states.

The people here catcalling us are mostly from those states which wear their religion on their sleeves and bellow about the sanctity of life.  But when push comes to shove, the only thing they and their governments have considered sacrosanct is the almighty dollar. We, by contrast, have shown we actually value life, and 90 percent of the lockdown here has been implemented not by the government but by the people."

Furthermore, as most are aware of Trump's childish attention span, he has grown tired of dealing with matters such as border invasions, North Korea, and now the pandemic.  Those are all yesterday's news.  Its back  to playing golf while bashing opponents to his reelection.  

Never forget that while the NYT published the names of some who have died from COVID-19 on their ""front"" page, to Trump, those deaths and those yet to come are in his ""rear"" view mirror. He is moving forward with more important things to worry about."

2020-05-26 14:18,"Here in my town the health department has been pretty clear about the big case load at the pig packing plant, less so
at the modest case load at a large construction site in Campustown. 

While they did not tell us directly the exact total number of cases at the  pig packing plant, they did give home locatiopn by zip code, and race/ethnicity. In fact they added a field to their report because of the pig plant. That field was ethnicity. 

These two events almost doubled our case count in a week. 
And its clear from the reports: essentially all the cases were young male Blacks or Hispanics. ""White + Asian"" percentage 
dropped by a factor of two, Hispanic rose to 51%, and sex went from about 63% female to about 47% female. 

If this is typical, one can easily see why in many places they want to keep numbers secret. Simply put, left wing news outlets don't want to ""stigmatize"" their main clientale. However, the statistical legacy of the Rev. Bayes tells the rest of us who to avoid (especially in the small town with the pig plant). 

As I said, they did not report statistics on the workers on the large construction project, who were all one trade. But an acquaintance of mine works there and told: similar patterm but nowhere near as dramatically uniform.

2020-05-26 14:57,"I think that Donald Trump and the GOP have shown their true colors here.  It may not have been obvious before but it is now.  Americans health is far less important than the bottom line of profits for shareholders.  If a few thousand employees become seriously ill or die because profits take precedence that's too bad.  That's fewer people needing government assistance, making demands for better pay, and employees are replaceable.  If anyone thinks that this is a callous attitude for our leaders to have s/he needs to look at who we've elected into office for the past 40 years.  Very few of them could be characterized as caring, compassionate, and humane people.  

It's fine to pay people extremely low wages in America.  It's fine to hire illegal immigrants while inveighing against them.  It's fine for people who work to be unable to afford medical care, a decent place to live, to have their children go to failing public schools.  The bottom line is all.  

We're not supposed to worry if the people handling the food we eat or cook are healthy enough to work.  We worry more about the humane treatment of animals than we do about our fellow human beings.  We worry more about the right to carry a gun than we do about any other right.  In fact we spend more time on trying to keep that right secure while failing to ensure every of age citizen's right to vote.

How will I look?” trump, his mouthpieces like Faux News, and his minions, personify this inner turmoil they struggle with daily, by word (like the above quote) and action (fearful of donning a mask for the safety of others). They cannot make a decision without that ultimate (in their minds) consideration: what is everyone going to think of me? 

It is their insecurity and self-doubt that drives them. 

Forward thinking people wear masks without hesitation. They are more concerned with the impact mask wearing has on those around them. They realize the mask is not for their own protection, but for the protection of those they are near. It is not a perfect solution, but it is one easy-to-do act of consideration. Common courtesy. They are secure in their self-image and don’t concern themselves or their actions with whether others might see them as “weak.”

I get it that now that the summer means beaches, pools, bbq’s, happy hour, and other ways of crowds gathering, that this order means nothing to them. I suggest to them to go to google, and relive the hardest hit states pandemic data. To other states, start with the NY numbers. Watch video clips of so many dead bodies, there’s no place to store them. People criticized NYC when they had to load refrigerated trucks with the excess of bodies because funeral homes and morgues had no room. People couldn’t bury their dead families or even be with them while they passed. We can’t blame the governor. He did what he could with the resources he had. The federal government didn’t acknowledge a problem until this pandemic spread like wild fire. The citizens of our country cried reopen the economy. Was it worth the loss of more lives? Ask a family member, or a best friend of even a single person that died. I want to be able to walk into a store without a mask or gloves also, but not at the expense of my life or someone else’s. It’s not worth the loss. Human lives are precious, and many don’t realize how precious until someone they love is caught up in this illness and doesn’t survive."

Each and every country on the globe has faced an identical challenge in the virus.  The US, Brazil and Russia are the three worst performers in the world when measuring the number of Covid-19 infections, and ultimately will record the highest death statistics.  These are countries with tremendous physical, financial and intellectual resources, yet all have failed miserably in testing and contact tracing, the proven approach to reducing the contagion.  One need only look to the leadership of Trump, Putin and Bolsanaro, three megalomaniacs who defy logic, reason, science in favor of egotism, to understand why their countries have failed to do what so many other countries have managed to achieve to limit the pandemic.

2020-05-26 15:24,"The general election scenario that Democrats are dreading:

""We are about to see the best economic data we’ve seen in the history of this country,"" says a top former economic adviser to Obama.

In early April, Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration and now a professor at Harvard, was speaking via Zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties. 

The former Cabinet secretaries and Federal Reserve chairs in the Zoom boxes were confused, though some of the Republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the Democrats suddenly concerned.

“Everyone looked puzzled and thought I had misspoken,” Furman said in an interview. Instead of forecasting a prolonged Depression-level economic catastrophe, Furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the November election could offer Trump the chance to brag — truthfully — about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gross domestic product growth ever.

Furman’s counterintuitive pitch has caused some Democrats, especially Obama alumni, around Washington to panic. “This is my big worry,” said a former Obama White House official who is still close to the former president. Asked about the level of concern among top party officials, he said, “It’s high — high, high, high, high.”

As I have said 13 weeks ago, we responded to the WHO declaration of the pandemic in a wrong way. How we as a nation responded? As if it was a panic pandemic. Lock downs were unnecessary except in the 2 most populated countries in the world, India and China and in the most densely populated cities in the USA and elsewhere. I have been communicating pearls wisdom of a life time, I received from father who survived 7 pandemics after being born during the worst pandemic 100 years ago and my own research to whoever cared to listen or to read my writings including in NY Times. I call people my ""herd"". They may not have acquired ""herd immunity"" but hopefully they acquired herd common sense that has kept them alive. 

The lock downs and business shut downs have done colossal collateral damage to the nation which should have been anticipated by the pathetic cowardly politicians. I doubt whether there was a single sane person who did a proper risk benefit analysis of the consequences. After doing everything wrong that has only resulted in US deaths approaching 100,000, suddenly I see masks are being religiously worn inside the Wash.

2020-05-26 16:30,"There are no surprises  here. The lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop, and will not prevent a recurrence of Covid as they are lifted. They were designed to flatten the curve, and prevent a surge in cases that threatened to overwhelm our health care system.  In this regard, they have succeeded.  

We can hope that by lifting the lockdowns carefully, responsibly, and with testing and PPE (especially masks) available, the resurgence in cases will be slow.

I don't think most epidemiologists and public health officials expected the lockdowns to end the pandemic; the corona virus is simply too contagious, and now too prevalent, to be stopped.

The lockdowns themselves are causing lasting severe harm, and cannot continue in full force indefinitely.  They are already causing extreme poverty, hunger, and starvation worldwide, as global trade collapses. Indeed, a major reason there is still a shortage of tests and masks is the collapse in global trade caused by the lockdowns; the US can no long manufacture these (and many other) essential products on our own shores; too many factories have been closed, and the lockdowns are closing even more.

We need to find the right balance between slowing the pandemic and allowing the global economy to recovery, or many  more will die.

It is frustrating that the City's great diversity is working against it meeting the critical data points needed to ""qualify"" for reopening.

Governor Cuomo has done an excellent job in leading NY through both the horror of the rising contagion in March and April.  Similarly he has helped NY achieve both the curve flattening and subsequent downward trend in morbidity and mortality due to Covid.

But it is now imperative that we start to accept that the unique character of NYC is such that it may not meet the critical ""data points"" for quite some time, if ever.  

At the same time, NYC holds almost half of the State's total population and it, by far, its key economic engine.  Simply put, until NYC ""reopens"" the State can never hope to truly reach economic recovery.

Yes, many of the experts with whom the Times' has consulted believe that opening too early will lead to a second wave.  They may be right.  But there's another side to the situation, which the Times seems to underplay:  opening too late and continuing draconian lockdowns too long itself causes many deaths world wide.  Many experts, including the World Bank, have reported the horrific growth in worldwide hunger and starvation, from the breakdown in the global economy.

We need to judge which is worse, the deaths from extending Draconian lockdowns, or the deaths from loosening them too soon.  Unfortunately, the truth is simply unknowable today. 

The Times may wish to stop referring to anonymous experts, and name its sources.  The paper should also indicate whether or not the expert models include the serious negative effects of the lockdowns. The Times should report on the big picture, with several perspectives.

Admittedly I haven't really looked deep into the numbers from the states that have been open longer/didn't shut down vs Massachusetts and NY.

REPUBLICAN state and local officials are refusing to release infection rates from trump-favored businesses if the data makes trump look bad. NOT KIDDING.

When large meat processers in Iowa and Nebraska became hotbeds for COVID, everyone wanted to know what safety measures would be taken. Oh the promises of cleaning, precautions, PPE that were given. Tyson too! When the guidelines finally came out, they were watered down so much that the CEOs could just choose (or not) to protect their communities. No requirements at all, and no consequences. Profit protected from us, labor.

And don't forget the REPUBLICANS inserted legal protections for businesses who #1) stayed at trump properties when lobbying and #2) donated to trump

REPUBLICAN officials even BLOCK the release of infection data from (for example) nursing homes IF that data doesn't comport with FOX's preferred line. Not just 'we don't know how many', but 'you don't need to know how many'. This is OK with trump's base, who celebrate Typhoid Donnie's powerful mask avoidance.

I walked to one of the large grocery store chains in my area.

In the vestibule, I was prohibited by one of the store clerks in bringing my new, unused bag into the store because management did not know where my unused bags had been.  

However, two different customers were allowed to enter the grocery store with their small dogs which were placed in wide and open utility cloth totes which sat in the child seat section of the cart.

It is okay to bring dogs into a grocery store but heaven forbid to use a brand new, unused plastic bag which I purchased from the same store last week for my groceries.

And, if history continues to provide the best prediction of the future, these regions will be most likely to experience the worst casualties during the coming fall and winter. They can also anticipate the slowest economic rebound relative to regions which remain vigilant. 

If you're genuinely worried about the economy, you need to understand that responsible social behavior and a centralized message from leadership are the two most essential things we need to be striving for. What we don't want, is for the United States to be on the wrong side of the curve when other countries have largely put COVID into containment. They could potentially refuse American travelers and business until we shape up and given what Donnie has put them through, most wouldn't blame them. That could be catastrophic to our economy for decades."

After all, the city and state should not have to expend extra funds to deal with the convention, other than maintaining the rule of order and usual safety on the streets.

Let the Republicans decide for themselves how many and which Republican ""worthies"" are allowed to attend their convention. After all, they are adults, right?

Easy enough.  If they are prepared to offer their fellow Republic ... er ... member of the Cult of Trump ""wisdom and understanding"" they should be allowed to have at it.

But here's another reason not to participate in the meat-eating industry. Primarily so that our toddler-in-chief does not have to go without his burgers, ""meat packaging"" plants (a euphemism for animal torture and death camps) are staying open, and their owners exempt from liability for worker illness. This means that if workers would prefer not to show up to these coronavirus-spreading facilities, they cannot claim unemployment, unlike other workers.

If you are still eating meat--if, as well as being willing to subject animals to hideous torture and to destroy our beautiful planet, you are now also willing to cause workers to risk getting coronavirus--well, you tell me what word we should use to describe you.

Also the issue is not the spread of the virus but the deaths---the flu spreads widely every year and more people die from it in some years than have died with this virus--so maybe your reporters should give some context---what is the spread rate? Less than 1%? Many more diseases are far more contagious than the coronavirus but you would never know if you read the Times. So according to the NYTimes and the many liberal states only when there is total absence of the virus in the population then and only then should the lockdown be lifted. Where is the logic in this. You need to protect the people most at risk and not treat everyone as if their risk is equal. Is not this what insurance companies and medical practices do? And you cannot treat the whole nation as if they are NYC. If NYC wants to stay in lockdown until a vaccine by all means.

FEMA went door to door in Long Beach  after Superstorm Sandy, bearing blankets, bottled water and FEMA rations. FEMA r
didn't ask for financial  statements. FEMA rations were provided to all . 

I had contacted New York State and had asked why the government wasn't delivering FEMA rations. The answer was that it is the Federal Government which decided to authorize the distribution of FEMA rations. 

There is no time to wait for the government in  terms of these hungry children. My grandfather was president of U.J.A. Federation Childcare. I have found notes of meetings from the 1940s.

Florida's and Georgia's governors have pitched for the Republican convention. While neither is a party to the convention contract between NC and the RNC (neither is Trump), any lawyer (I'm one) will tell you that all states have a tort cause of action -- differently named in different states -- for interference with others' contracts. What Florida's and Georgia's governors have done skates very close to the line, perhaps well over it. The RNC may (or may not) have a right to walk away from its contract if NC rightfully refuses to perform on coronavirus grounds, but Florida's and Georgia's governors aren't allowed to encourage the RNC to do so. That's a tort, and NC would be entitled to damages (very large) if that occurs.

I doubt it will, though. NC will drag its heels, as it should, in responding formally, and will essentially keep the RNC guessing right up until the convention. NC will honor the contract, but almost certainly will rely on its ""force majeure"" provisions to insist on certain protective measures, as it should. The RNC, equally predictably, will stumble over itself to assure NC, and the world, that it will behave appropriately at the convention. Some delegates and others will; some won't. And NC predictably will complain, and may even sue, about the slackers, arguing in essence that the RNC is responsible for their misconduct."

But, if one does such comparisons the lesson to learn is not that China is ok because the US is coming close: the lesson to learn is that if we are not vigilant, we will get to the same place.   

Some commentators claim, without evidence, that the Chinese trust their government more than Americans.  Who can say?  There is no free speech in China.  No doubt many Americans distrust their government, with some justification, but that is not a point in China's favor.

And some commentators crow about China's recent economic growth.  No wonder China has high growth rates.  The same CCP that now bungled the economy for decades, and then turned to crony capitalism only when they realized they could become super rich themselves.  On a per capita basis China is still much poorer than the west, the countryside is still backward, and factory working conditions would make Engels wince.

The first thing that comes to the strange minds of liberal Westerners during an economic crisis is people will for some reason revolt or push for political freedom.

Yet the article also says an explosive number of Chinese citizens are JOINING the government during an economic crisis. 

You Westerners have an unhealthy habit of rioting during periods of crisis and unfortunately this has caused you to assume everyone else in the world would act the same. 

Unfortunately for you folks, we have a much more collective spirit and are actually aware that the future lies in the government taking charge, not rabid individualism."
2020-05-26 16:36,"This article shines a microeconomic light on the difficulties faced by Chinese youth entering the job market. Their sense of certainty and confidence has been shattered, always an agonizing experience. 

But if America succeeds in breaking its reliance on China as the low cost link in its industrial supply chain, their loss will be our gain. Those jobs will return to America and China's immense economic leverage will diminish, even as we pay slightly more for our manufactured goods. And that is the goal that I believe America's president recognizes as his first priority."
2020-05-26 17:17,"Another China-bashing article by Keith Bradsher and friends attempting to attack the legitimacy of China's government. Nice try.

If ""not getting people back to work"" actually constitutes a good cause for overthrowing a government, as Bradsher loves to hint when talking about China, then maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and start advocating for the overthrow of the US government.

""Legitimacy"" is a constant presence in propaganda against China's government. To be precise, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Modern China, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been in existence since 1949 for 71 years. China is one of the charter members of the United Nations and is one of five permanent members of its Security Council. 

In the last 40 years, China has lifted millions of its people out of abject poverty, and is now recognized by USA no less, as a legitimate challenger to its dominance as a world power. Read William Barr's official speech in February this year.

So why is this recurring question of ""legitimacy"" applied to China? Anyone who witness ""regime change"" and assassination of Iraq's Saddam Hussein should not be surprised. Challenging ""legitimacy"" of government by USA is a constant theme in its foreign policy. There are plenty of precedence, such as overthrowing the democratically elected Chilean president Salvador Allende, continuous effort to thwart Cuba's Castro, invasion of Panama & Afghanistan, attempted coup in Venezuela, etc."
2020-05-26 19:18,CCP has delivered for the last two decades and the people have held up their end of the bargain by being obedient citizens.  What the future holds for either of these parties is unclear in the context of the evolving World.
2020-05-26 19:46,"There is a huge lack of self reflection in America, one of the reasons for its decline. When one points a finger, three point back.

Americans are continuously fed false premises about China, here the choice is: ""the Communist Party derives its political power from the promise of delivering a better life for the Chinese people."" CCP is not comparable to the CEO of JC Penny or Hertz.

The tactic is just a rehash of the old ""legitimacy"" question about any enemy government, such as Iraq, Libya, Chile, Panama, Cuba, Venezuela. ""Legitimacy"" provides USA with the cover to invade and dethrone the government, calling it ""regime change.""

Western media's line of attack against China used to be: CCP's power is based on oppression, thought control, propaganda, brainwashing. Since China became the world's factory and pulled millions of its people out of abject poverty into middle class, western media need a new script. 

By now China is breathing down the neck of USA as the top economic power and competitor in advance technology. What else can the doomsayers do to paint a pending disaster for China? Many have tried for 40 years. 

Chinese media should tell Chinese citizens that covid-19 is  a chaotic disaster in USA as President Obama put it. Their newspapers should publish daily unemployment and covid-19 related death figures in USA, and how gleaming cars are lining up for hours to receive free grocery. 

Ms Huang Bing is lucky she's not an American actresses."
2020-05-26 19:47,"""Finding work for a generation has become a major priority for the country’s leaders, who have promised a better life in exchange for a lack of political freedom.""

First of all, it's doubtful that Chinese leaders ever proposed such an ""exchange.""
Second, it's also doubtful Chinese citizens, who happily touch their cellphones to kiosks that automatically download a tracking app for virus control -- see ""political freedom"" the way so many Americans do. Especially all those American  beach and churchgoers crowded together in violation of government regulations, scientific information and consideration for others."

There are rooms for improvement in employment future.  Chinese government will defocus on export and refocus in domestic markets for future growth.  Government will spend many billions on infrastructure projects, which requires many engineers, technicians, parts and equipment suppliers and workers.   Since China thrives on coastal areas, they will now develop central and western interior of China.  That will need many young people and entrepreneurs to join.  With fewer jobs in the coastal areas, young people will move to interior with lower pay in the beginning for better future and growth.

Things change fast in China.  Young people are more adaptive and agile.  They may complain but they also know the reality.  They won't stay if there are better opportunities elsewhere.  Chinese government is counting on that."
2020-05-26 22:02,"""China’s top leaders pledged this weekend to “use all possible means” to create jobs"" -- Heartwarming to see a government that cares about creating jobs for its citizens.

With 40 million unemployed, it is time to end the fiction that there is a shortage of U.S. workers.

Our government should have an immigration policy that supports sourcing workers from our population and our educational system. In contrast to stimulus checks, it costs next to nothing for the U.S. government to stop issuing foreign worker visas. When we bring in foreigners to work, we are really offering them the right to take one of a limited number of jobs in our economy, taking jobs that would otherwise go to unemployed Americans."
2020-05-26 22:54,"In America, there are neither jobs nor freedom. Great Depression levels of unemployment, 100,000 dead.

On hospital charge masters the sky’s the limit, and insurance companies benefit regardless because premiums cover their costs. The only people who pay are patients faced with ever higher premiums, co-pays and deductibles based on ever-higher prices, who don’t know about financial aid because hospitals don’t screen them for it, and who can’t afford their bills. Then hospitals treat patients like deadbeats, send them to collection, sue them, and garnish their wages. At my Providence-affiliated public hospital the median wage of patients sued is $32,000. Hospitals are getting outlandishly rich while driving the poor further into poverty. This must change. Charity care is obviously not working so we must outlaw sending patients to collection and suing them. At least we must minimize the damage hospitals are doing to the most vulnerable.

Former Fed governor Richard Fisher bluntly admitted a few years ago (after leaving his position) that the Fed's ZIRP policy and quantitative easings (QE) were designed to jump start Wall St. in the aftermath of the 2008 meltdown with the ""hope"" that some of the benefits would ""trickle"" down to Main St. While it certainly helped Wall St., very little trickled down to the masses. In fact the masses accumulated billions more in debt, financed at upwards to 20% from the credit card co.s who never lowered their rates. So much for Main St.

We are seeing the same thing again, but worse this time. Zero interest rates only benefit those who gamble with our money. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc., all became bank holding companies in 2008-09 and have used the FDIC protected funds to gamble away with scads of collateralized loan obligations to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, now fully back-stopped by the Fed while banks pay prudent savers zero interest on their money. Zero interest doesn't help the economy recover. It never has and never will. It ""helps"" a govt. with $26 trillion in debt.

Besides 9% uncovered in the U.S. now due to various ACA issues, there is a serious, less well known problem with much of the ""coverage"".

About 20% of U.S. ""coverage"" is actually some form of Medicaid.  Either ACA expanded Medicaid, or a pre-ACA Medicaid.

In many states, all Medicaids, for people 55 and over, are not really insurance, even though the Federal and state governments misrepresent them as insurance in their statistics.

They are subject to Medicaid estate recovery.  Medical bills are paid temporarily for a person, but need to be paid back by a person's estate when they die.  It's a loan until death for medical expenses, not insurance, and people with this financial bomb often are unaware, due to inconspicuous notice by the relevant agencies.

The problem only exists in 10 or so states, like MA, NJ, and MD.

Some states fixed the problem, partly or completely, starting in main ACA provision year 2014, by amending their estate recovery policies.  E.g.: NY and CA.  (Making at least all ACA coverage real insurance.)

Come COVID,  there is a budget problem in CA, and the new budget proposes to undo the fix, which it did in 2017.  (See: <a href=""https://wclp.org/analysis-may-revision-of-california-2020-2021-state-budget"" target=""_blank"">https://wclp.org/analysis-may-revision-of-california-2020-2021-state-budget</a>/ .)

Unfortunately Home Depot discontinued its curbside pickup the very day the lockdown started easing.  I put in a gardening order, arrived, and it had been discontinued without notice.

Let's keep in mind that pre-Covid the CRE market was already troubled.  Retail store properties were already experiencing rising vacancy rates.  Even in the toniest areas of Manhattan such as upper Madison Avenue the number of vacant stores was staggering.  Every neighborhood in that borough had store vacancies -- mostly arising from the dramatic shift to on-line consumer purchasing.  A development that has, if at all, only become more prevalent as the result of the Covid lockdowns etc.

The attractiveness of residential properties is similarly dimmed by the current high levels of Covid-related unemployment.  Levels that have led at least New York to declare a moratorium on any non-payment of rent evictions if such non-payment is ""Covid-related"".

Given these factors it would appear that the ""play"" in CRE purchasing right now requires deep price discounts from sellers  as buyers may well have to plan on a considerable ""warehousing"" period before finding new tenants.  Also worrisome is to purchase an occupied structure only to then find that tenant either in rent default or headed that way.

Yes, there are opportunities in the CRE market; but they're not for  buyers with weak fortitudes."

2020-05-26 13:59,"It is probably culturally inventive for a ""big nose"" (round eye) to make a suggestion, but use cooking chop sticks which are longer than individual chop sticks for serving. Individual chop sticks h are about 8 inches long.  People would be aware of the difference when they move the longer one to their moth."
2020-05-26 16:17,Hmm ... I recall reading that it is bad table manners to use one's chopsticks for passing morsels of food to others at the table.
2020-05-27 21:44,"As an avid eater of Chinese food, I find the communal nature of it one of it's best aspects, it provides a variety of shared dining experiences that western style individual portions utterly fail to provide. My family has come to enjoy it so much, that now when we go to eat fancier western style fare, we strategically switch plates so we can all try everything.

That said, finding some middle ground for the sake of hygiene makes sense. Serving chopsticks are cumbersome as they don't transfer larger amounts of food easily (hence people generally ignoring them). Serving spoons are little better, as many Chinese dishes don't sit well in a spoon.

Might I suggest the world's chinese restaurants consider serving tongs instead? The disadvantage here is that they spill easily, so perhaps someone could devise a serving utensil that is easy to use, versatile and transfers a large portion all at once?

Even so, the next time I go to eat Twice Cooked Pork and Fish Fragrant Eggplant with my family, I'll probably still grab each piece of pork straight from the plate..."
2020-05-28 12:24,A while back my wife and I were eating at a local Chinese restaurant and we were using chopsticks. A Chinese family at the next table were trying to teach their young children to use knives and forks like American do. The kids pointed to us and complained that why yhey could not use chopsticks like those Americans.
2020-05-29 0:03,"The beautiful photograph of the set table by Ms. Giulia Marchi makes me wonder, are chopstick-rests, like knife-rests, ever provided at such repasts?"
2020-05-29 13:42,"We use serving utensils when we eat with others beyond the immediate family. It is cumbersome I admit but necessary these days. In the absence of serving utensils which I think are best, we would grab food with the tops of our chop sticks as these have not entered our mouth."

It has been a treat for me to have my college son home for a few extra months even if he doesn’t emerge from his bedroom until noon.   My daughter has discovered the piano which neither child wanted to play when they were younger.  They are old enough to handle watching The Godfather.   The chess board has made an appearance.  We have enjoyed the hummingbirds, woodpeckers and grosbeaks.  Knock on wood we get through this unscathed.  Trying to make the most of it and savor the moment."
2020-05-24 22:01,"This has given the opportunity to some who were in a routine that was not questioned, to regain some time and some control over how to arrange a flexible schedule.

The busy, active family is now doing yardwork as a team and playing badminton and other yard games I hadn't seen in years.  The kids sit well away from the friends who visit while they cheerfully chat away outside, no cellphones in sight.  They miss the human contact they had at school and during other activities.  We hear a lot more of the family on the other side, screaming and shouting and berating each other.  It's not new, just a lot louder and more frequent.  

I guess it's like old age.  Whatever you are, you become more so when in quarantine."
2020-05-24 23:04,I believe that the virus has brought my family closer. It gave us more time to spend together and less time worrying about small things that we don’t talk about. We never really ate dinner together and just did our own thing but now there is no excuse.
2020-05-24 23:16,"I’ll miss it too, and I live alone so most of my family time has been by phone. But we talk more often and for longer, it seems since no one has to rush away to do something. 

I’ll say this, I had my pay cut but have never been more at peace. Don’t tell my employer, but I might be willing to accept less pay longer term for a secure job working from home like this. There’s a reason they call it the rat race. You never realize you weren’t getting anywhere until you have the time to step back and look."

2020-05-25 1:18,"I read every name. I grieve for them, and for their families.

I am also deeply conscious of the fear, hunger, and uncertainty being experienced by the almost 40 million (if not more) people who have lost their jobs.  I have done my best to help everyone who touches our lives. 

I am angry at the inadequate, dishonest response of our federal government. I can hardly wait to vote in November. 

I am hesitant to say this, but this has been a very unusual time for our family. Our children are grown (24 and 28) and live their own lives in different parts of the country. We are lucky if we have dinner together every three months. They moved in with us in early March, and we have been together every day for nine weeks.  Our daughter just left for New Orleans and our son returns to Brooklyn on Tuesday.  We are definitely closer.  I don’t want it to happen again, but am grateful for the unexpected time we have had together.  We have experienced an overwhelming amount of love."

But then again, there were slaves who aligned with their owners.  History is filled with endless surprises.  Joy in the face of suffering is a reality, and the stories are worth telling.  But in the long run, these stories tend to fade because they compromise the prevailing narrative. If the pandemic worked out well for you, there is nothing wrong with that.  But be careful.  Most don't want to hear about it."

I like reading these stories of families, husbands, wives and children together during SIP. I hope that those who are with family during SIP realize how lucky they are."
2020-05-25 3:41,"I haven't said this to anyone, but even though our income is down, we are happier. We used to struggle to eat together once a week. Now every breakfast and dinner we do as a family. We cook eggs, pancakes, French toast or similar every morning. My husband and I are talking about quarantining until there's a vaccine, partly for safety (he has an underlying condition) and partly because we don't want this way of life to end. I know we are very lucky so I don't mention how well things are going to anyone."
2020-05-25 4:00,"Well I won’t miss the numbers of the dead rising by the thousands daily, or the anger of watching an incompetent federal government lie their way through the horrors of this pandemic, or having to remember to wear a mask to the market but I will miss the quiet and seeing families walk or ride together daily because there’s no soccer, baseball, piano lessons, ballet, track, or even vacation planning to worry about now. 
On a recent neighborhood evening walk, I could smell at least  1/2  dozen dinners of different ethnicity being cooked, something that was not normal during the week in the pre-pandemic days. So many more birds in my yard,more tweets/songs per hour.
I do worry about those who live alone, have no friends or family to call daily, no yards or respite from the lonely days and nights."
2020-05-25 4:23,"It took some adjustment to have no preschool for my son and my husband working from home. In fact, the first month we thought we would be miserable the whole time. But then we realized how we’d begun to appreciate the slow pace and extra time together. My husband even admitted although he loves the NBA, he’s liked not having it monopolize his free time the way he let it before. We do miss our friends, though."
2020-05-25 4:37,"My grandparents are 89 and 93 years old. We have a large family of many grandkids and great grand kids. When I visited, I stayed outside, 10 feet away, and it was a nice visit. One of my cousins showed up at grandmas house with his son to spend the night, eat together inside, and hug. I am so upset. Why in the world would he do this?! There are about 12 family members who want to go over to grandmas house and visit like normal. Are they crazy?! They say they are “over it” and “not that worried.”  I’ve cried all day."

Thankfully, I've got a place to live in Idaho. There are many corona virus cases in mainland than Hawaii. I was afraid of coming here but I am safe now. On the other hands, what I see is during this pandemic time  families are more closer and they give time to each other. The host family that I live with get to see their other family members come visited to them. We have mini sacrament meeting just seven family members at home. I realized that we were busy with work and we didn't have time to spending time with family. Now is the time to do that.I am currently living away from my family but I am glad to see all my family members together on video call. I have stress and other people have stress about being jobless and less income. I cannot do anything about it so I need to think in positive way. Stress can make me sick.  I just need to enjoy for the moment that I live."
2020-05-25 5:42,"Just tonight, as my son came to snuggle next to me in bed while I read a book, and then my husband came in and sat on the bed with us, and we just talked and listened to the rain, I thought that it was maybe one of the best moments of my life. We've had a lot more of those moments lately, especially because my husband used to work nights. Now we have dinner together every night, play games, talk. There is a lot of anxiety about the world, but even so, we have in some ways been happier. It's a good lesson, and it's important to enjoy those moments. They don't take away from the suffering, nor do they make it go away. But it's a reminder to be very grateful for the moments we have, when we  have them."
2020-05-25 5:55,"I am feeding my kids home-cooked meals three times a day, we are going on daily walks or bike rides, and to date I have missed out on over 100 hours of commuting time in my car.  If the restaurants and movie theaters were open, this might be the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

This downtime was sorely needed, and proves that Americans need to take a long, hard look at the quality of life we have been lacking compared to our developed peers.  We work longer hours, with fewer vacations, and yet we have no healthcare, little retirement, and very little joy in our lives.  This situation where the average worker is not respected to be anything other than expendable is insane, and I hope that Americans use this as an opportunity to demand a higher standard of living.

With such a high unemployment rate, what I fear is that things will get worse.  With so many people desperate for work, employers will be able to treat their workers even worse."
2020-05-25 6:01,"In many ways the lockdown has felt like a never ending three-day weekend, for my husband and me. The last time we spent three weeks together was more than ten years ago. We have never before been together like this — 24 hours a day, for two months straight. And now I find out that his office is going to make the WFH thing permanent! I am not sure how I feel about that. My kingdom has been invaded and occupied. I will have to adjust. 

With all of the frustrations and sadness (and panic and worry), I suppose this lockdown has been good for our marriage. We were living very separate lives before this. Each busy in different ways. Now we have to work together."
2020-05-25 6:10,"Here in Italy, much of the country closes down each August for a couple of weeks. Factories and shops close, production stops, people go on vacation (this year probably closer to home). It's a practice that has huge value in terms of rejuvenating people and allowing them to spend time away from the daily grind. Funny thing is, the world doesn't come to an end because things slow down or stop. 

On your side of the pond, the ""work ethic"" has created a very different world. During my life as an American, most of my associates, family and friends hardly ever had 2 weeks off. Many would take payment in lieu of vacation because they were either deeply in debt or, I suspect, they were addicted to their jobs. Everyone finally gets to ""discover America"" after they retire.

Here's something to ponder: you would do well to spend less time working. I know that sounds absurd but the American consumption lifestyle drives a never-ending quest for more. I think this disruption has helped you realize that there's a lot of stuff you don't need, a lot of running around you don't need to do, and that ugly old car you've wanted to trade in actually works just fine. 

The Italians have phrase for this: Il Dolce Far Niente (the sweetness of doing nothing)"
2020-05-25 7:56,"Yes, the virus has brought cheers to some families and sadness  to some other families. Cheers, as most of the family members were together all the time for such a long time, which normally happens only during festivals and other family function days. Sadness, some who got struck somewhere else, may be in a different country, in a different state and could not return and unite with their family due to restrictions like no flight operations, no trains and  no other transport services. For example, a brother of mine who went just a couple of days back before this corona restrictions were enforced to a neighboring state, got struck in a stranger's house, and could not able to return and unite with me as all the transport came to a halt in India. Hope the situation improves and those who were struck away from their loved ones, unite soon."
2020-05-25 9:22,"This pandemic is terrible, especially for those who have lost loved ones.  I lost three beloved family members in the last five years, and I am glad they are well out of this.

However...

So far I am healthy.  I am a teacher, and we go hard all year long.  This was a tough year.  When rumors swirled about school shutting down in a few days (ultimately, on March 13) I hoped it would be so.  I desperately needed sleep.  I needed down time.  I needed to clear my head of the clamor of student voices that persist even in my dreams.  When school was called, I went home and I slept for three straight days....

Since then, I teach online (my students are handling this wonderfully; I'm very lucky).  I have more time to rest.  My house is spotless.  I spend more time with my animals.  I've gone back to experimenting in the kitchen and I enjoy it very much.  I read.  I take walks.  I am so sorry this is happening, but for the moment, I am reveling in the time that I have, the peace that I have, the quiet of my dense city neighborhood.  There's less pressure.  Less chaos.  Less wasted time.  More efficiency in everything.

When school picks up again in August, I have no idea what that will look like.  It will be a very stressful time.  Mistakes will be made.  There will be anxiety, and fear.

I treasure the time I have RIGHT NOW.  I may never get this experience again in my adult life.  I cherish every moment."
2020-05-25 9:25,"“Things you normally do when you’re celebrating.”

2020-05-25 9:54,"It has taken a tragedy to recollect the essence of the American dream...a dream that is constantly transmutted into the nightmare of some deprived indulgent gratification. It is a pathetic plight that the perversion of a consumer economy has cast over the American Dream. With the veritable becoming the quaint, 

I am an American living and working in Austria. I reside adjacent to a vast park for walk and more physical recreation. With a partial shudown of the economy and other restrictions there is to be noticed a number of out-of-the-ordinary activities on its green. Most notable is that number of baby carriages has increased largely, and the number of MALES pushing them and fondling toddlers has increased dramatically. 

The greens are spread with blankets (proper distance) and on open spaces there are all-manner of physical exercises (proper distancing). Every tree is occupied by an individual  reading or simply listening from some device. Is here a scenario for lament? Is one to sorrow that these are not punching timeclocks? Is life without a job inevitably dull? 

Is the article an elegy? Its indivividuals cited to be mourned? Or is it an affirmation? A blessing for recollecting that family Thanksgiving is not meant for only 1 day a year, and a job description is not a homage."
2020-05-25 11:25,"This is my favorite article since the Times has been covering the virus. Mr. Wilson has created the feeling of life on the page. My son is in a different part of the country and I'm trying to figure out how to see him. This article showed me what I am missing by being separate during this time. That is oddly consoling. I love these families, and I hope we all slow down and create a new culture that favors such respites—in good health."
2020-05-25 11:47,"I’m happy to read in the comments about how wonderful and rejuvenating quarantine has been for people and their family lives. I feel nothing but happiness for you. 

That said, let us not forget the people we’ve lost, the jobs that aren’t coming back, and the people driven overnight into abject poverty by businesses shutting down and the economy tanking. Next time you’re experiencing your joy with your family, take a moment to reflect on what you can do to help those people in need so they can have some joy too."
2020-05-25 11:48,"Finally, a story that I can relate to. My spouse and I have been working at home since March and are grateful to still have  our jobs. I feel more rested, sleep better, and even work longer hours than I used to, with breaks to cook, exercise, and care for my mother. My spouse and I have ""coffee breaks"" in which we pop into each other's workspaces to chat. We cook together and eat more healthily. Pre-pandemic anxiety and stress ruled. Rushing to get my elderly mother ready, commuting 45 minutes one way to work. Arriving home late. I'm thankful more now than ever. My community takes COVID seriously. People wear masks in the store. They practice social distancing. There are no good, ol' boys marching around with AR-15s, threatening our local public officials. My biggest concerns are for others and for the horrible job Trump is doing."
2020-05-25 11:51,"Before quarantine my marriage was fraying at the edges. We often would retreat to our own corners and resentments. This time together has enabled us to communicate more, understand each other better and find the pleasure again each others company. We were able to reweave some of the fabric back together. Maybe we'll make it another 25 years."
2020-05-25 12:01,"As an American living in Prague the pandemic hustled my husband and I forward on the path of the quality of lifestyle we have consciously and happily been adopting. While I hate the reason for it, mourn with empathy for the tremendous loss of life and worry for ourselves since we hover at the age of retirement, never have the contrasts between our past and current lives been so stark. We are fortunate to be in a country that did, and is, handling the virus swiftly and cooperatively. The attitude here is ""we"" versus ""me"" and the idea that taking steps to keep everyone safe benefits all is an underlying norm. This basic human concept should not be politicized and when politicians try to do so here it seems to be ignored. I worry for our family in the US and watch the constant fighting and distortion of the tenets upon which the country was founded. 
This is only a moment of time, not a black and white ""forever"". Even the the people of this country, under Soviet rule not so many years ago which came just shortly after the Nazis occupied and destroyed much of it, understand this and adapt. 
For the moment we make our stay-at-home life as full as possible and know the time will come again to linger at cafés and pubs and (although it will look different) traveling throughout the continent from our central location. Interestingly, it's our American expat friends here who are most anxious to return to ""normal"" and willfully violate precautions as even as guests in this country."
2020-05-25 12:16,"I am trying hard to battle the stress, but having 2 immediate members with essential jobs, one working with the public, and the other still taking mass transit, and an elderly mother who is recovering from Covid in a rehab center who has many other issues, I am finding myself in and out of success.

There are moments of clarity, sure, but I wish it would all end already.

I am happy for those who are becoming ""woke"" in certain aspects of their lives, and I hope that they can continue their new found epiphanies, be it environmental, relationship, self-discovery, or spiritually oriented. If people just go back to their same old ways, we really will not have learned anything."

My son plays independently for hours in the backyard, and this is the first time in his 6.5 years that he’s had an uninterrupted stretch of weeks to develop that ability. We also dance nearly every day. Life is slow. We savor chats with our neighbors. My son’s anxiety has decreased dramatically, and he has made tons of imaginary friends."

Even though our Governor tried to instill safety and order, our Republican Supreme Court let Wisconsin loose - and loose it is.  

The COVID numbers have not substantially subsided, but by golly, those Wisconsinites (and out of state visitors) who couldn’t respect the threat of spreading COVID for a beer in the bars and anywhere, have brought our state great shame and probably will increase those COVID numbers even more.

The innocent have been stomped on by complete foolishness."
2020-05-25 12:37,"Stanton’s Best Advice For Surviving Trump And the Coronavirus Crisis, All Personally Tested And Guaranteed To Work, More Or Less:

--- Sit in your yard, if you are lucky enough to have one.

--- Tune out of all further editions of Trump’s daily fake news follies. He cannot be wished away, but do your best.

--- Take a walk in the fresh air every day in a place that isn’t crowded. Masks optional.

--- Keep in mind that there are always a lot of people worse off than we are, and find a way of helping some of them.

--- Call some relatives and friends and talk to them about old times, including ones you have been mad at and haven’t talked to in the past five years.

--- Watch just one news program every day.

--- Eat and drink in moderation, but joyfully.

---  Adopt a dog, cat or a horse or do something else that helps animals.

--- Read books and watch movies that make you laugh. This is no time to improve your mind.

--- Think about the times in your life when you were at your happiest. Many of them were simple things that didn’t cost any money and didn’t require any miraculous improvements in our politics.

--- Pray every day, or -- if that doesn’t work for you -- complain to G-d. Someone may be listening.

Perhaps most important of all, do not embark on any personal improvement projects like learning to speak Hebrew, becoming a master chef or cleaning out your closets. All such activities are doomed to ignominious failure throughout this present and continuing emergency."

I see it & hear it in my neighborhood: families tending their yards together, siblings playing catch in the street, kids squealing with happiness playing with their parents on a weekday.

I have to say though, SIP is difficult for those of us who live alone. I'm a hugger and I miss human contact. I visit with family outside from a distance of 10 feet, giving each other virtual hugs from across the deck. But it's not the same. 

That being said, I'm using the phone more, using zoom and FaceTime like I never have in the past. Quality time with friends and family, although virtually, has increased. And I'm grateful for that. Grateful for technology. Never has technology been so important for mental & emotional survival.

2020-05-25 14:55,"This is not on this piece, but needed a space to riff off Times coverage of “With little else to do.”
It’s fine to devote some features, such as “Smarter Living” or “At Home,” to multiple ways to stay amused, even better to maintain sanity, and admirable to find some positives in all this, such as physically serving others in new or just realized ways. But at some point, “Amusing Ourselves to Death” is no longer a sufficient or meaningful goal. 
The Times is not sufficiently hitting the elephants in the living room. While one series asks “What Needs to Be Different?,” and some columnists discuss this, you’re missing just how much trouble our society and planet are in.
I’ve commented several times when this question is asked, it is not connected with the ecological cause of the pandemic, and hence what needs to be done differently there. 
The threats to our planet and society go well beyond that. While you’ve been doing well on climate change and better on fairness, democracy is a mess, hunger shooting up, and biodiversity and mental health quiet crises.
We need many new ideas for changes, to identify and end barriers to them, such as obsolete conventional wisdoms, and implement. We can’t go on the way we have been-even if there hadn’t been a pandemic.
Putting this together, why not encourage those looking for something to do, or even if they aren’t, to think about how society needs to change, prime them with a resource, and provide a forum or means to contribute the results."
2020-05-25 15:51,"For many, the pandemic has been tragic.  But the world needed to slow down in so many ways."
2020-05-25 18:11,"I get the article I do, but there is just something about such an article in the midst of this that is unsettling. For the vast majority of people who have lost loved ones, or have lungs or other vital organs permanently damaged, or have lost their livelihoods, this does not amount to a self-help moment of reflection, personal development, and learning to cook new recipes. No, for most these are desperate times with a corrupt government unwilling to do what it takes to mitigate this epic disaster."

2020-05-25 15:19,"This endless harping on how the virus has helped people discover the beauty and joy of cozy, retro family life is troubling on many levels.  This is a virus that is disproportionately killing the poor, the black and brown, and the elderly, i.e., the socially vulnerable. The hasty retreat to, and valorization of, the supposed safety of the nuclear family does not help. 

Like anything terrible, this crisis might well have pleasant consequences for some, but those consequences should not be highlighted on the front page of the NYT.  To do so is to show a form moral solipsism that is really disturbing."
2020-05-25 17:26,"This time being forced to slow down has made us so much closer as a family and healed my marriage. We were always wanting our family to go slower but realized that we were surrounded by people always on the go, with soccer games 3 states over and endless activities. We said no to a lot of the craziness before COVID but it’s lonely if you’re the only outlier.

Now we’re cooking more, getting out of debt, bonding with our teens, and talking a lot as a family about saving the earth. We’re also scoffing at the sad, silly people who play fast and loose with others’ lives when they refuse to wear masks or social distance."
2020-05-25 12:24,"Airlines are messing up. By packing planes people like myself, who was a frequent traveler for business, will fly less. I would actually start flying again if there were cross country flight options that weren’t so crowded. But there aren’t so now I don’t know when I will get on a plane again.  If I have to stay six feet apart in the airport and they are leaving middle seat available in coach, why is every seat filled in business?"
2020-05-25 12:34,"A global pandemic of a highly transmissible deadly virus has been a daunting challenge for all nations. But imagine for a moment if we had a president who rose to the challenge? 
   
   Imagine if Trump had acted on the information given to him in January. Yes, he stopped some travel from China, but then he did nothing, or worse, he denied there was a problem for six long weeks, until finally declaring a national emergency in mid-March.

   Imagine, instead, if he had been a real leader? Picture FDR or Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill. Or even Ronald Reagan or George W or Barack Obama. Imagine if Trump had rallied American know-how. Imagine if he set the tone by taking the threat seriously, by ramping up production of PPE, by creating centralized guidance, by taking responsibility for combating the crisis, instead of leaving it all to the states?

   Trump has demonstrated a monumental failure of leadership. Unfortunately, he is still failing. To tweet ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" is not leadership. It is reckless. To refuse to wear a mask is not leadership, it's abdicating his responsibility to portray what all good citizens need to do to protect our fellow citizens. 

   Trump was tested. And he failed miserably. Yes, the test was as difficult as any we've ever faced. But isn't that the time when real leadership rises to the moment? Trump failed the test. Please remember his incompetence in November. If we can make it to November."

2020-05-25 12:55,Let Trump golf without scrutinizing him over it. He's done his time in the office. Everyone is allowed a day off once  in their lives. CNN is trying to make a big deal out of it and I hope other online sources don't sink as low.

2020-05-25 13:03,Trump was the “only I can do it” candidate who then as President complained that Obama didn’t leave him an instruction booklet telling him how to respond to this kind of emergency....even though Obama actually DID leave him the literal “playbook.” I guess you can lead a horse to an instruction manual but getting him to read it is another matter. Sad.
2020-05-25 13:07,"Trump again demonstrates his lack of compassion, his lack of empathy.  100,000 Americans and he’s working on his golf game.  He has been removed from this tragedy since its inception.  His only concern has been its effect on him and his re-election prospects.  He has no shame."

I say this for Brazilians protection because not to many people have the discipline to social distance, wear masks, or even care whether their fellow citizens get ill. Just as long as they can go to the beach, sit at a bar, or congregate in mass."
2020-05-25 14:00,"There is a time to mourn and a time to reflect. May be memorial day during COVID-19 times is the appropriate time to think about what we can do for our fellow Americans to empower those suffering to be able to stand on their own feet. 

My question is the one similar to the question Sec. Clinton asked at the Benghazi hearings ""What difference, at this point, does it make?"" It makes no difference if there is no change in empowering the African Americans (AAs) as Abraham Lincoln did. They need to have equal job opportunities as the whites. They need to have equal access to health care and equal translation of evidence based science. Among all the racial groups the disparity gap between the rich African Americans and poor African Americans is the highest.

AA leaders like Dr. Ben Carson, Senator Tim Scott are the leaders that seem to be addressing these issues that Americans should care about if they want to see African Americans lifted in spirit and in living standards in a dignified way. Yes everyone needs help during times of suffering, not self inflicted or own control. Yesterday at a gas station, I saw a homeless person sitting outside. He did not ask me for cash nor did he ask anyone else. He did not have a sign saying he was homeless. I was not going to throw cash at him but I wondered whether he was hungry. I had the convenience store clerk ask him if he would like some food from the store. He said sure. I happily paid for it. We need to help Americans help themselves."
2020-05-25 14:01,"America will shortly pass the threshold of 100,000 deaths during The Novel Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020. The only thing Americans should be reflecting on this Memorial Day is accepting the reality that America is not exceptional and we must work hard to make America a more socially responsible country that functions much better than the present version does. We must resist deluding ourselves into attempting to merely return to normal as though we were a well-functioning country prior to this pandemic."
2020-05-25 13:41,"""Dominic Cummings...made a journey of more than 250 miles from London to Durham, in the north of England, at the height of the national lockdown"". ""Some scientists and opposition politicians have warned that the episode risks undermining the credibility of government health messages on the pandemic"".

Ohhhh, undermining the credibility of government health messages. Was Mr. Cummings traveling alone? Was he traveling by car? Just how did he pose a threat of spreading the virus to anyone else? 

Just because the government can issue edicts it doesn't mean they are credible. We have our own share of asinine decrees in this country issued by authoritarian governors and freedom loving Americans are beginning to openly defy them in every state. Unless English health officials can provide a credible reason to condemn Mr. Cummings, I say Kudos to him and I hope he inspires others to force the government defend their decrees."
2020-05-25 13:58,"This President has the feelings of a pet rock.  

Instead of celebrating the entire holiday weekend with respect for those who died so he could evade the draft, he has played golf, and threw tweet epithets at the Speaker of the House et al.

This man is bereft of any decency and feelings whatsoever.

Although it may not happen, due to his continuously underhanded actions, the best thing that could happen for our country would be to wake up the day after election, and find out that our next President would have most of the normal  attributes that almost every other prior President has had."
2020-05-25 13:52,"Beleaguered by lack of leadership. Imagine Memorial Day with a president at the helm that has not a single compassionate bone in his body. That’s right, we don’t have to imagine it, when are living the nightmare every day."

2020-05-25 14:17,"Today is a solemn day of remembrance and reflection, especially in the light of the nearly 100,000 of our fellow citizens, our friends and loves ones who have perished. Those deaths and the war we're still fighting to save others have tragically reopened those ancient wounds of division and racism the nation fought a great Civil War to end. So, on this day as I, a 79-year old, continue to ""stay-at-home"" I remember my Uncle Jack, a German-Jewish refugee who gave his life on the beaches of Anzio so that we all may live free of oppression and tyranny that has now descended on America. And so I also take solace in reading Lincoln's Gettysburg Address that concludes by saying, ""It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."""
2020-05-25 14:39,"The real challenge facing a democratic administration is dealing with the considerable damage trump has wrought and will continue to over the remaining months of his term. The nation has been living through failure of presidential leadership so epic, so sweeping  that recovery will be a formidable task. The one big plus for Biden is that he has an equally formidable bench-strength of capable leadership talent on full display these last months at his disposal ready and able to hit the deck running come November."
2020-05-25 14:14,"We must remember that men fought, died and were permanently disabled so that we could be here today and have the problems we have.  Remember to thank those who saved the U.S.A."

If this crisis impacted red America a lot more than Blue, things would be a lot different than they are now. Specifically, you wouldn't have the President calling for re-openings and calling out red state governors. You wouldn't see armed blue state protesters going to state houses. 

We are two Americas, both before Covid-19 and now. The difference is that this crisis has served to shine a bright light on the enormous differences."
2020-05-25 14:51,"This should be a solemn occasion. 

A remembrance of our soldiers and sailors who gave up a lot and some gave their all.

I, for one, and my family thank them and remember their honor."
2020-05-25 14:57,"family activities, cookouts/barbecues, and sports are great, but it's most important to remember what Memorial Day is truly about. Being respectful and enjoying the freedom that came from the sacrifices of the Armed Forces - those who died and those who served and survived -  and others could include a visit to a cemetery or monument for a moment of silent reflection. 

yes - their sacrifices allow us to participate in the activities that go along with the start of summer and they would probably be pleased that we partake. 

the pandemic has proven to be even more horrible than i could have imagined, but we can adapt. we have done it before. but it will take mutual respect and caution to keep the coronavirus in check. there will surely be more cases and more fatalities and ending stay at home orders will contribute. i understand that the country has to move toward getting back to normal, but until a vaccine is approved, social distancing, face masks, and more will be required of all of us. 

so take the lesson of Memorial Day and apply it everyday. it isn't partisan. if wearing a seatbelt, or observing speed limits, or going through a TSA checkpoint protects us, wearing a mask isn't so horrible. it's a matter of respect for your fellow Americans. we will all be better off."
2020-05-25 12:55,"This is the grimmest Memorial Day in my lifetime.  We are led by a man who not only refuses to mention all the sickness and death affecting so many Americans, but flouts convention further with vile personal and racist attacks on Democratic leaders and activists.

The contrast between the words and behavior of top officials of the past with this man couldn't be greater on a national celebration of service.

It was also depressing to read about the divide between red and blue states in terms of virus caseloads.  The worst caseloads and havoc wrought by Covid-19 have been in Democratic strongholds while red states have escaped largely unscathed except for meat processing plants.

I never imagined a  major health crisis could be so blatantly politicized, but I clearly underestimated the depths of US polarization."
2020-05-25 14:58,"As an elderly Viet vet I find I don't much care for 21st Century memorial day.

When I was a kid, the Memorial Day ceremony in our small rural town was genuine and affecting.  It was led by WWII vets and largely focussed on remembering the men in our rural county who had died in that war.

There were some flags, some speeches, and a small brass band.

People were respectful and seemed to take the meaning of memorial day fairly seriously.

I find none of that in contemporary Memorial Day.

Go to the beach and get COVID if you want.  It doesn't have much to do with the men and women who died on beaches 75 years ago.

A grumpy reflection from an old vet."

Most of the fatalities happened in the 2nd wave. People felt put upon by the quarantine and social distancing measures imposed at the outset and when they were lifted, there was rejoicing in the streets. A few weeks later however the 2nd wave hit with a vengeance killing tens of millions."
2020-05-25 14:28,"""Tone varying by state"", reflected  in the tone set by the two political parties that now represent the divisiveness of our society.  Our president persists in setting an inappropriate and false tone (this cursed affinity  with fake and distaste for truth), the tone sounded again  in his always avoiding the mask.  From the beginning, impelled by his  ambition to win in 2020 and fearful of the economy remaining slumped if lockdown is not ended, he continues  to minimize the problem (vaccine around the corner and good medicines, like his hydroxychloroquine or his clorox internally or whatever) so that we should open up and we must go back to houses of worship (the evangelical vote) and workers must return to their places of work  (the meat workers too)---while the dead pile up.  The parties differ in their approach to this virus and Republicans are more likely to crowd the beaches maskless. The Democrats and their governors go more slowly, more fearful and more realistic.
We can see the importance of setting the right tone in the disaster gripping Brazil where President Jair Bolsonaro follows  Trump's example of pooh-poohing the coronavirus while the dead pile up with too few graves to contain them."
2020-05-25 14:30,"The US and a lot of its people appear very shameless from outside.

The photos of crowds over the weekend is just appalling. Does anyone understand the notion of temporary sacrifice for longer-term gains? I want to do a lot of things. I can't wait to go see a movie again, to get on the train and see some mountains, and so on... but we must be patient and more selfless.

Sure we have had some issues here with crowds at parks as the lockdown restrictions are relaxed, crowds which the police soon break up. But our curve has also flattened for the time being. Today 8 recorded deaths in a country of about 18 million, with 209 new infections.

2020-05-25 15:23,"We will never forget. Trump and his GOP minions continue to ignore the experts who have been proven right time after time.

And we are honoring those who not only died in our wars but also those who gave their lives in another battle of sorts, that being against an invisible, microscopic coronavirus.  Yesterday, the New York Times revealed in an extraordinary and poignant way the most recent of our own who have died.  We read about 97,000 plus of us in all walks of life, of all different races, ethnicities, and ages who suffered in ways that defies the advancement of medicine through and up to this year, 2020.  I will refrain from getting into politics.  But I will express what Donald Trump has refused to say, and I think I speak for millions of my fellow Americans:  Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers are with those who have passed on and with those loved ones left behind.  We will not forget you."
2020-05-25 15:37,"Honor your loved ones and commemorate Memorial Day, but please do it with care.

A nurse that I spoke to said that it appears that rigorous use of masks (even when only ordinary cloth or surgical) coupled with scrupulous use of hand-washing/and or hand sanitizer, avoiding high touch surfaces, remaining at a distance from others, and avoiding crowds appears to reduce COVID-19 transmission dramatically--perhaps by 80% or more.

Sure, it's no fun, but if we don't slow this disease down, we're going to be in a world of pain in the near future when it comes roaring back.

2020-05-25 15:40,"I believe that the current data the Times reports showing a higher contagion rate in ""Blue"" states and regions versus ""Red"" ones is misleading on several fronts.

To steal a point from Governor Cuomo, this current report is akin to being a Monday-morning quarterback during half-time.  Or, to paraphrase a late, great NY Yankee, Mr. Yogi Berra, -- ""It ain't over until the fat lady sings.""

Simply put, you report these data points as if the pandemic is past and it's time to do one of those ""what have we learned analyses"".

But the pandemic is NOT over.  The huge outbreak in NY, NJ and, more generally, the ""Blue"" Northeast is attributable to the arrival of the virus via European contact.

Also, yes, these more dense urban regions in which the virus could rapidly spread, tend to be Democratic.  But as the virus now continues to spread further even as less-impacted ""Red"" areas start to both ""reopen"" and therefore engage in more ""social gathering"" it will likely start taking its toll in those places.

Whether ""Blue"" or ""Red"" is immaterial to stemming the spread of the contagion.  Social distancing and mask wearing when that's not possible is paramount to keeping R(0) below 1.0.

As Governor Cuomo often points out -- you need to focus on the data and the metrics.  It's science; not politics.  Any so-called leader who believes the opposite is sending his ""base"" or ""flock"" into harm's way.

In the end, the virus is not Blue or Red.  It's color-blind."

And so many individuals and families live by such a thin margin that 2-1/2 months of pulling back could damage them forever. Foreign nations have stood for years against invaders and put back their societies afterwards, but Americans are chafing. 

I put a lot of the blame for this on- yes- Donald Trump. A real president would have made a plan to immediately support the most vulnerable individuals and businesses first, then to draw the country together to get through this, taking the time we need to eradicate this virus.  Instead, there is chaos and disunity, exactly what shouldn’t have happened. And a president who continues to sow discord, in the hope of saving enough of his base to get re-elected."

2020-05-25 15:55,"Just reporting that blue states have more covid 19 deaths than red states is misleading; the virus doesn't know a ""D"" from an ""R"".

To rule out the effect of population density, death rates need to  be expressed per unit population. Democrats tend to live in cities more than rural areas. 

We should also recognize differences in international commerce between blue and red areas. The area first hit by the virus in the US was Santa Clara Co. in the Silicon Valley of California. The virus was next found in the Seattle area. Both of these areas have extensive travel and commerce with China. On the east coast, the virus arrived from Europe (mostly from Italy) and landed in the commercial areas of NY and NJ.

The media should distinguish between southern California, where our cases are concentrated and northern California where we have flattened the curve. Southern California is a bit more purple than blue. 

It was the public health departments of six counties in the SF Bay Area that were the first in the US to use its authority to lock down activities/businesses that could spread the virus. The county governments then followed suit. This is also the case in Seattle, where the local public health departments worked in coordination with the local jurisdiction and Governor Inslee. So although blue areas had heavy case loads, these areas also had efficient, public health led responses that saved lives. As the virus moves into rural areas, let's hope they also respond as wisely."

March 8th, testing shows the first cases among NYC daily commuters with no nexus to foreign travel, March 10th the national guard is sent into New Rochelle and Seattle is locking down, most of Europe is lockdown, NYC is wide open. March 15th the Bay area goes on Lockdown, NYC is wide open, the Mayor proclaims it is not possible to close the schools, Governor Cuomo insists the Subways and Rails must be kept open. Cases of the Virus are pouring in all over the City and Suburbs, businesses big and small across the city start shutting down on their own. March 18th, the schools finally close when the Teachers Union threatens to walk. March 22nd, after days of publicly dithering back and forth over terminology the Mayor and Governor agree to “Pause” New York at 8:00pm. Subway, buses and rail run full schedule for another 10 days. This is not a hindsight analysis, everyone knew the lockdown was coming, California and Europe were locked down, workers at large corporations and small businesses closed up Friday March 13th."

2020-05-25 15:56,"C19 is deadliest in blue states.  Does this tell us anything significant about how political perspective can translate into lifestyles that are more vulnerable to public health threats?  

Well, the liberal side of our political spectrum is, at times, pretty good at telling us ""do as I say, but not as I do"".  A few examples:  blue states have the most smokers, the greatest obesity, and highest levels of diabetes.  Some will say that these are high population states.  So, you would think that they would be head and shoulders above the red states after decades of government programs to eliminate these major health issues.

Then there is taxation.  High tax rates in these states, but they seem to be able to leave large loopholes in place for the top 1%.  Then, when Congress limits state tax deductions for federal income tax, the top one percent blue state folks squeele like stuck pigs.

Nfext, the ""front platers"" who defied NY and NJ shelter-in-place orders and fled to eastern PA bringing with them C19 that has led to skyrocketing infection rates and undoubtedly contributing to the deaths of many (PA has car license plates only on the back, NY and NJ have them on both FRONT and back making it easy to spot them). It became so bad that the PA governor had to curtail VRBO and ArBnB rentals in PA eastern counties.

I could go on for pages.  You get the idea.  I suggest that the blue state folks do some self-examination about their track record regarding ""doing what I say""."

Trump and his minions know full well that they cannot really hold a ""traditional"" political convention this year.  Besides the utter recklessness such an action would be -- how many delegates and other attendees do they really think would show up?

Even GOP stalwarts are not likely to jump into the breach and gather en masse during a pandemic.

So, Trump and his thugs, knowing they really have to cancel a big convention turn this into a political spitting-match.

What Cooper should do is tell Trump and friends that they are certainly welcome to gather together in Charlotte.  Then let's see what the GOP decides to do."

I guess I hoped he might respect this as a solemn day to remember those who died in service for this country and who have died from the corona virus.  But, true to form, his first concern is himself and managing the stagecraft for his acceptance speech....months away. 

But no one should be surprised by this. Theatrics were also top of mind for him when he ordered back to West Point graduating cadets from across the nation to be present in June for his commencement speech. And, not content to have the cadets simply present for the address, he has ordered they sit closely together too. 

If attendees at either event are sickened, I suspect he will conclude that it was worth it. After all, they got to see him."

For people age 65 and older, the CDC puts that number at 1.3%. For people 49 and under, the agency estimated that 0.05% of symptomatic people will die.""

So for people under 49, that is 1 out of 2,000 if you get sick.

The odds of dying from an accidental injury in 2018 were 1 in 1,334.

Again, for under 49 age group, you are more likely to die from an accident this year than dying from Covid if you actually get sick."

If I was all-powerful, I would run facial recognition on the photos of the millions violating common sense and milling in crowds, in parks, on beaches, at bars and restaurants, and list their names for all health care providers -- EMTs to clinics to hospitals -- to  check.

We all also have to be locked down with a very strange, clueless, annoying uncle. 

He's always around. 
He inserts himself everyday. 
He never shuts up. 

He makes trouble. 
Deliberately. Cause we sense somewhere deep inside he just might know better. 
Or maybe we're wrong and he's just a mean man.  

We're trying to get through a bad situation and instead of support he says things to demean us, provoke us, stoke animosity among us. He seems to thrive on a bad vibe. 
Not only is he no help, he always seems to want to hurt. 

Useless around the house. 
Doesn't bring any skills to the place. 
Says he is good at everything but we've yet to see him pitch in and be a team player - even if only to find encouraging, empathetic words to move us forward. No, just the opposite… he irritates for the sake of it. 

We're stuck with him for now. 
Though I hear we'll be able to get rid of him soon. I pray. 

I wish on this day of solumn memory we had a different uncle who might cheer us, lift us, say stuff like:

""I know how hard this is. Let's stick together like we've done before. Like a family, like soldiers who we honor today. All in it together, caring about each other.""

I long for that uncle."

Regardless, people expect and apparently are willing to accept the horror of another 100,000 deaths as the price to pay for a return to normalcy. It’s like how  Americans have grown used to the president’s hate-filled, venomous weekend tweet storm emanating from one of his golf clubs after a Sunday riding in his cart with his pals.

For example, it is a simple fact, supported unanimously by researchers who have examined it, that Trump, by delaying the coordination of national stay-at-home orders, is responsible for at least 36,000 deaths.

If you must respond, simply point out one of the following two deflection tactics: 

Deflection tactic #1 – Change the subject  (a) it’s worse in other countries (b) the 1918 pandemic was worse (it wasn’t); (c) it’s Obama’s fault, because he didn’t start working on new pandemic preparations after the H1N1 flu in 2009 (he did), (d) etc.

Deflection tactic #2 – The Deaths don’t matter (a) more people die from the flu (they don’t) (b) they’re all old people who would have died in a few months anyway (c) they’re mostly black and brown people who eat too much and don’t take care of themselves (d) they’re mostly democrats in blue states (e) etc.

And so I am finding today to be extra difficult and a rather empty and meaningless holiday. Nearly everyone I know who professes their support of our military has shown absolutely no respect at all for America. These same folks have made a mockery of my family's sacrifice and service and suffering by ignorantly comparing America's governors to Nazis and the wearing of masks as unpatriotic.

Additionally, our president is on a golf vacation while more Americans get sick and die, and it becomes more apparent every day that the sacrifices of Americans who stayed home and businesses who stayed closed were for absolutely nothing.

By such guidance we may heal."
2020-05-25 17:32,"All these tweets, name calling and threats will disappear on Nov 4, 2020, if Donald Trump loses the the election, which is highly likely. He has to take care of his own freedom, as his Presidential Shield will be gone with election results, Feds in SDNY are waiting."

2020-05-25 17:04,"Obscene about richest, most financially secure hospitals receiving the lions share of bailout money.
“The Providence Health System, one of the country’s largest and richest hospital chains, sits on nearly $12 billion in cash, which it invests, Wall Street-style. In a good year, that generates more than $1 billion in profits.

And yet this spring, Providence received at least $509 million in government funds, one of many wealthy beneficiaries of a federal program that is supposed to prevent health care providers from capsizing during the coronavirus pandemic.”

This is the way things go in the United States. Make the rich wealthier. Also, worth pointing out, Providence is run by the Catholic Church. They refuse to provide contraception or terminate a pregnancy - even when the mother’s is experiencing life threatening sepsis and severe bleeding."
2020-05-25 16:52,"Move the Republican convention from Charlotte?

Well, good-bye and good riddance.  Locally, we're still perplexed that 19 or the 20 cities asked to submit a bid for the convention didn't respond to the GOP, but Charlotte did.  Maybe Trump could hold the event in Brazil."
2020-05-25 17:35,"I hope North Carolina tells the impeached current President to take his convention elsewhere! Attendance will be minimal, anyway, so there will be no big cash incentive to host it. By then the second wave of COVID-19 will have hit and, just possibly, even the republicans will be getting nervous. Always assuming trump isn’t sick himself by then!"
2020-05-25 16:55,"President Trump himself equated the Covid-19 epidemic to war, calling himself a ""war time president"". But one of most potent weapons against spread of the virus is testing and contact tracing. Trump's policy is to leave that to the States to figure out, just as he has left it up to the States to make all quarantine, safe-at-home, and reopening the economy decisions. The President hasn't actually done barely ANYTHING on the federal level to wage this ""war"". I can't name one substantive decision he has made - only issuing guidance which he then promptly undermines (other than border/flight restrictions). Can you imagine if our country was attacked in a real war? Trump would probably leave it up to each state to arm and defend itself!"

2020-05-25 17:16,He will never be the example to follow. He will and is the one who goes against common sense and healthcare. So it’s simple ignore the truly ignorant and think of others and the requirements most doctors are advising. We are not through this pandemic yet as much as we might wish. This is not a 30 minute episode of a tv show.
2020-05-25 16:38,"Things would be quite different today had trump not dithered early in the year and not been mindlessly reckless before that! The nation was left vulnerable and in  ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" mode as he deliberately dismantled important measures of the previous administration to protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and guard against other possible infection situations in the future. There would have been fully supplied, certified and operating testing facilities in place and functioning (they still aren’t). The virus catastrophe could have been effectively contained (as Ebola was), and perhaps even avoided. When asked about this by a reporter trump, brushed it off as “a nasty question"". This president has deliberately put millions in mortal peril. He has blood on his hands, no question."
2020-05-25 17:53,"Neither candidate is near their top-game, what ever their game.  If this is the best America can offer up then best outcomes are off the table.  Even at our best we would have lost 100k to this pandemic. Now that it has become a political issue we may put a zero on that.
The politics of the pandemic are much more dangerous than the actual virus.  It is hard to understand people who politicize things like this but I guess they have their entire being/existence invested in their political identity.
I get how the confirmed cases number is an underestimate since we're not doing enough testing.  But what's the basis for saying that the death count is an underestimate?  Are you accusing state public health agencies of mis-reporting?  If anything, I could see it being an over-estimate because, in the absence of testing, any death from ""flu-like symptoms"" becomes a COVID death."
2020-05-25 17:53,trump never misses a chance to line his own pockets.  What he sees is an opportunity to move the republican convention to Florida where he just happens to own property that he most certainly will propose as the new site for the convention.  Sad thing is that his supporters will think it's a brilliant move on his part.
2020-05-25 17:13,"I was overcome with grief and a sense of failure reading about the Holyoke Soldier's Home and the deaths of so many who fought for our country. They gave everything for us and we failed them  when it counted.
I grew up in the Pioneer Valley and vividly remember the pride we all felt when this home opened. It is situated on a hill overlooking the valley bisected by the Connecticut River. The Commonwealth, under Governor Dever, had provided well for the veterans who had faced down Nazism and the Holocaust. These men didn't brag and bluster, they did the job in front of them and then came home to live ordinary lives.
Somewhere along the way, their sacrifice, became less valuable to us. It became less important than reducing a state deficit. We let them down."
2020-05-25 17:37,"Wouldn't it be hilarious if Trump followed through with his needless new feud with North Carolina, pulled the plug, lost the state, and also couldn't find an alternate venue for the convention?

Although the pandemic is crushingly tragic, in 2020 Trump's world is definitely collapsing into bitter satirical farce.  Voltaire and Moliere must be so jealous: Trump's own self-destruction involves social parody and political absurdity on a scale that even they would have been hard pressed to imagine."
2020-05-25 17:42,"As a longtime North Carolina resident, I would be happy for the republicans to take their convention elsewhere. Governor Cooper should not bow to pressure from Trump."

2020-05-25 17:44,"We don't really fight wars for defense any more. We do it for politics and business. While the soldiers may be brave, most of the time they should have been kept home. Our ""defense"" budget is ridiculously high. It is clear that we do this so that we can be the bully of the world, and as with most bullies, we are also the most fearful and weak internally. We have of late wanted to honor the expendable workers, er, I mean essential workers, but that certainly would not include a living wage and healthcare. 

Much of what we do on days like this is give thanks to ourselves for being such wonderful thankers of others, temporarily when we can get credit for being so wonderful. Aren't we great? The exceptional Americans. Exceptionally good at death and destruction, and happy to do it for benevolent and wonderful corporate overlords."
2020-05-25 18:04,"Trump actually spared a few precious moments during his busy golf day to visit some veteran memorials?

No doubt he did it for the press coverage rather than to pay respect and homage to those who really cared, loved and died for this country.

I miss you Uncle Pat.  I will always love you. Thank you for the courage and bravery you had on D-Day, at Normandy."
2020-05-25 18:27,"Biden has had everything his way-Sanders Out, Obama endorses, Democrats Behind, and yet, and yet he cannot keep his message positive and stay in his lane. Let's hope the laying of the wreath today isn't a foreshadow of his chances."
2020-05-25 18:32,"Once we had the 'deplorables' now we have the 'non-essentials.' Neither the left-center nor right-center represents people who continually are on the losing end of large systems and policies. Everyone knows Trump is not a pro-vote, but a no-vote, a form of satirically dissent against the political system. Traditional political lines no longer matter, the split is between large systems vs. localities and liberties."
2020-05-25 18:47,"Thanks and kudos to Governor Cuomo for ensuring death benefits for fallen frontline workers.  This somber tribute evokes the memory of the benefits extended to the first responders on 9/11/01 and it so in keeping with NYS's social conscience.

It's going to be a challenge to pay for this and so much else in this crisis.  But somehow, we'll do it because: We're NY Tough."
2020-05-25 18:51,"One thing is more sure than that of the Covid-19 virus coming in the first place; that it will resurge or another virus will surface in the future.  The Spanish Flu travelled the world in a vastly different time vis a vis ease of travel and lack of controls.  If Covid-19 virus had been the Spanish Flu it would have been far more deadly.  What these two pandemics have shown is that technology, social discipline, and strong central controls are the answers.  These past six months can be seen as a test as well as a warning.  The test is, who determines the response; those that would endanger others touting rights or those that pull together to defeat the threat.  We are experiencing both and it is obvious that the warning is expressed in the actions of those that would trade the well being of others for superficial needs.  Equate going to the beach with infecting and killing someone.  America must take a seriously good look at itself.  America must stand its ground against those who would choose their personal rights over the right to life for all."
2020-05-25 19:12,"NYC public employees are already entitled to a death benefit of up to three years salary whether they are essential workers or not.   I don’t know what Gov. Cuomo is adding.  Maybe he just doesn’t know.  State employees might be different after he stripped to the bone their retirement plan and benefits during his first term.   

As far as paying out of the State Retirement System, one would wonder if there is any money left in it after he “borrowed” it to build a bridge that he could name after his father."
2020-05-25 17:27,Trump is refusing to have his party in NC unless there is more opportunity for disease transmission. This is like an outlaw motorcycle gang refusing to have its annual drug and weapon swap meet in your town unless the mayor guarantees all police will be off duty that day.
2020-05-25 17:59,"Many other countries have done a credible job of controlling the virus. We though, too often are not a country but merely a conglomeration of individual states. The president wants states to do the bulk of the work as each sees fit. We could be a sick country for some time."
2020-05-25 18:17,"Three million people die in the U.S. every year.

By this time of the year, there would be over a million deaths.

Many of the 100,000 Covid-19 deaths are of people who because of their pre-existing conditions had very short expected life-spans.

The lockdown has caused more misery than imaginable.

The lockdown by Democrats is to help them politically by sabotaging the economy and disrupting the American way of life."

2020-05-25 18:25,"That blood is on Trump's hands.He can say what he wants. Tweek the numbers any which way. He can blame Obama. But, this happened on his watch. This will be his legacy. He wants to be reelected so bad. He'll do anything to make it happen."
2020-05-25 18:28,With Joe finally out of the basement his handlers must be shuddering because they know that the next gaffe is just around the corner.  The mind of Joe Biden is gone and he is now feeble.  This feebleness will become more apparent to most Americans as the race for the presidency continues.

2020-05-25 18:07,"Bravo to Joe Biden for showing us the correct way to publicly honor the Nation's war dead on this pandemic-ravaged Memorial Day.

Here's hoping that next year he'll be the POTUS at Arlington and we can all once again be both responsible and mask-less."
2020-05-25 18:18,"A picture, or in this case, two pictures speak a thousand words.  Juxtaposed are Donald Trump with no mask paying tribute to our dead and Vice-President Biden, hand in hand with his wife, and both wearing masks doing the same in Delaware.  On our left, symbolically,  is the new, defiant, and arrogant American; on our right is our traditional, respectful, and once respected constitutional democracy.  What more does this country need to understand all that is askew and wrong with this present administration?"
2020-05-25 18:57,It is very heartwarming to see Joe & Jill Biden at the Delaware Veterans Memorial service! They are both  great role models during this pandemic & truly understand the significance of today.  The contrasts to the Trump's is monumental!!  Thank you Joe & Jill!!
2020-05-25 19:23,"It would be better if President Trump was seen wearing a mask but it has been said he does wear one in private.￼￼ He has said that he is regularly tested for the virus and his test results have all come back negative.￼

If he did wear a mask,  he might be ridiculed by those who despise him and say he is weak. He cannot satisfy his detractors because whatever he does it is always wrong. He must do what is right for him and just ignore all the complaints. Many of us feel he is doing fine.￼￼ He is in a no-win situation with his enemies and that will never change.￼"
2020-05-25 18:07,"Ironically, Trump doesn't realize that if he moves the Republican convention to a very large venue in a city with a large number of Republican voters, such as Houston, it will ensure the maximum benefit to Democrats in November, as the virus will have removed many Republican voters."
2020-05-25 18:56,Why is old bone-spurs showing up to honor veterans? Has he no sense of shame? Or at least some awareness of how out of place he is in the presence of veterans--living and dead? A golf course seems to me the more appropriate venue for him when those who sacrificed are memorialized.
2020-05-25 19:01,"￼Marge Keller,

President Trump does deserve a break once in a while. After all it is memorial day weekend and he has the right to play a round of golf.￼. He does need some R&R as he has been watching the pandemic closely and advising with his task force team. Why should he be deprived of a little fun on a long weekend?  

I believe President Trump is sincere when he visits Arlington National Cemetery to pay his respects to those who lost their lives for our freedom.  He does care about our military and respects them highly.￼ If he ignored this very important day he would be condemned by the Trump haters. Yet if he does attend he is also criticized. He did the right thing and we should commend him for supporting our military.￼"
2020-05-25 19:18,"Time to celebrate democracy, not Trump-ocrocy!

Never mind. I'm sure it is."
2020-05-25 19:12,North Carolina should say immediately that given the severity and volatility of the pandemic they can't in good conscience offer any guarantees at this point about the Republican convention being held in August.
2020-05-25 18:02,"President Trump is willing to have people risk death so he can have good visuals for the Republican Convention. Taking 20 to 40 thousand people from all over the country and packing them into a auditorium will kill people. The virus has not changed. It is transmitted in exactly the same fashion as it did before. If the governor buckles under to Trumps demands he will have a outbreak of cases in the area around Charlottesville and the members who attend could spread the virus back into areas of the country that have been spared from the virus so far. You can not find anyone who knows one whit about pandemics who think this is a good idea, that it not a high risk scenario. And it appears that Trump is more concerned with his re-election then the fate of Americans."
2020-05-25 18:57,"Our veterans are dying as we speak. And they need to be supported and protected because it is our duty and honor.

Instead of a homer or a hit, he took three called strikes in a row. He walked back, walked through the dugout, and headed to the golf course. A lot of people in the stadium roared their approval, shouting in the face of those who sat still, shocked by his behavior."
2020-05-25 18:02,"“The Trump administration’s new testing strategy, released Sunday to Congress, holds individual states responsible for planning and carrying out all coronavirus testing.” 

So Trump’s strategy is do nothing except pose before the cameras, promote quack cures, blame others for the failure to prevent civil-19 deaths, take credit for anything that is successful (or seems successful), and continue to sow division between Americans in a time of crisis. Want to successfully fight the pandemic? Then throw Trump out of office this November."
2020-05-25 19:07,"For one day a year, we are asked to pause and remember those who gave everything.  

We all know what Trump is and what Biden isn't, but today isn't about them or their masks.  

Given the threats we face and their size, why don't we make military service a requirement for anyone who wants to be president?  Think of all the incompetent presidents we would have been spared.  

We're in an awful mess, but we would not be here at all without people who put their differences aside on the important things.  For some jobs, that's a basic requirement.  Thank you all for your service."

Yes, we memorialize those who died in wars since then too, needless deaths, dangers to us were exaggerated by various presidents, our country was not in danger as we were from the Axis powers.  Ironically, this weekend we memorialize also those felled by covid-19, with thousands of unnecessary deaths attributed to leaders who once again failed us."

2020-05-25 18:11,Trump doesn’t care about infecting others — he does not wear a mask — so as long as his Republican friends are okay with that he should have his convention as crowded as he wants it. Maybe they can do a lot of chanting and singing in a big Florida ballroom. Let freedom ring!

2020-05-25 18:25,Biden recent comments just showed how comfortable he is with Black people. Biden verbalized what most Black folks I know think when they refer to supporters of Trump who are people of color. 100000 dead and counting can't be lost on the side shows going on. The numbers don't lie and the numbers prove somebody choked when they should have been leading. Having served in Vietnam I can't forget the weekly body count of fallen troopers .To think that the virus might take twice the 58000 troops lost in Nam is mind boggling.I remember while the shape of the Paris Peace table was debated troops were still paying the price as the war dragged on.

2020-05-25 19:59,"I think having the Republican Convention in Charlotte this summer is one of the best ideas I have heard in months.  President Trump is so smart to encourage a good old-fashioned convention at this point in time.

Spare a thought also for the 100,000 dead because of the virus, so many of whom could probably have lived longer if the US had a more competent president and administration and had established a lock-down a couple of weeks earlier.  Some of those who died from the virus had survived WW2 and concentration camps."

It's not just that he is a serial exaggerator about his wartime experience or civil rights involvement, but even when confronted with sincere questions that have an edge to them, he goes over the deep end.  One time he challenged a guy to pushups who simply was interrogating him about his changing stances, and most recently, after being questioned about his positions that have to do with minorities, he came out with the ""you ain't black"" nonsense. To me, the most reprehensible part of this was the 'aint' -- as if all black americans say 'ain't instead of 'is not.'  Biden is a now out of the closet racist who will never acknowledge it, and hence he will never support policies like universal basic income or health care for all that would level the playing field most of all for minorities."

Remember that the first war America fought was fought by those that had a claim to property and not just collecting a salary and reciting a creed that enlisted personnel don't understand fully because they never lived by any honor code. There is no honor in being foolhardy.  We all make mistakes and sometimes we repeat the same ones. The shame in this is never having changed before changing isn't an option.

2020-05-25 18:22,"Trump's actions create his own warped memorial---that should serve to warn Americans of future  dictators who wear the mask of president of the U.S. 

And by refusing to wear an actual mask to protect from Covid19, Trump has an insulting message for We the People,   not printable in the NYTimes. 

Biden's mask shows the contrast vividly. 

Our Leader's authoritarian attitude of defiance weakens our democracy every day. Trump has disseminated a psychological infection and aided by GOP state media monopoly-- FOX News-- it ravages our politics across the country. 

We lack a political vaccine to immunize voters from obvious lies and manipulation. This is aided by lack of regulation of big money influence in our politics, and by increase in social media that spreads propaganda, used by both GOP and the Russians.  

From the poisonous swamp Trump arose out of, there lurk future political critters, ready to surface, financed and marketed to voters. This will intensify the exploitation of millions of vulnerable Americans, already weakened by our political infection."

The real leaders and power centers run the State apparatus of complete government control.  Biden is just such a figure.  But even more problematic, as he doesn't know the difference between his own states of mind.  He is therefore the perfect candidate for special interests that want complete control of the executive office.  As JFK wisely said, ""the most dangerous man in the White House is the man who can think for himself.""  Biden is the exact analogue of JFK's warning: the danger is deflected away from the powers who seek executive office control, and onto the the public itself. by those powers who are no longer in check.  That includes constitutional civilian control of the military, perhaps especially."

If those who gave their lives so that Trump could play golf are to be memorialized by the ""wartime president"", maybe their names could be engraved on a wall somewhere, just as we do for our fallen military heroes who have likewise given their lives. In return for the sacrifice of our brave soldiers, we enjoy comfortable, free lives in a formerly great country. In return for my grandmother's sacrifice, Trump gets to play golf. She deserves at least to have her name remembered."
2020-05-25 20:10,"Dishonor is Trump's stock and trade, he simply shouldn't be allowed to take part in any ceremony seeking to pay respect to this nation's fallen.

Similarly, many buried at Arlington and other military cemeteries are dishonorable. While some did act ethically defending America, yet many participated in aggression wars, some engaged in terroristic behavior, exterminating innocents, and some also used derogatory racist words that we shouldn't repeat here.
Since honoring the dishonorable is morally wrong, we should remove all the dishonorable from Arlington and other military cemeteries. Honoring those who participated in aggression wars, killing and maiming innocents, or other actions violating correct ethical values must no longer be conflated with those who ethically protected America."

I have read curious statements in these comments about blue states and red states, as if the virus has the power to discriminate between people according to their party affiliation. This is patently absurd. Simply put most big cities are more likely to vote blue and most rural areas tend to vote red.

Doing things safely is just not Donald Trump's way. The man is despicable and nothing. he does surprises me.

Trump-appointed acting Navy Secretary even made a big show of mocking Crozier to his crew before quitting over the backlash. It's hard not to be cynical of the pomp and ceremony on this Memorial Day when it seems like military personnel, dead and alive, are nothing more than re-election props."

Very complex, I know, but THAT is what we should elect Joe Biden for, not just to replace someone who struggled with the job from day 1.

This country is filling up with those who will increasingly choose the easy, cheap (as in easy), and undisciplined solution to its tough problems.  They elected an undisciplined king of easy, cheap answers to everything.  

Without those disciplined veterans and leaders of old there is little mystery in what the world would have been.  I fear that the trend lines and jejune leadership of this nation are pushing us to instantiate another, very different answer to that mystery."

Well it might be similar to the past when an unpopular conservative at the time called Mr Winston Churchill, who was nearly thrown out of the Conservative Party prior to World War II because he opposed appeasement to Hitler, was suddenly picked to be PM. In a time of crisis  Mr Winston Churchill formed a national unity government from the best of all parties, he took scientific advice. But it was obvious that the buck stopped with him. It was on his watch. If it went wrong he took the blame. He was the Prime Minister. So explain to me how President Trump plays golf and shakes hands on US memorial day as if nothing has happened when 100,000 US citizens have lost their lives. In the UK we have an unelected aid,”President Cummings” giving a press conference against all civil service or aids employee codes. Please excuse me I am so angry.

That tiny form of symbolism – the wearing of black masks – is about as strong an indictment of Trump's incompetency and unfitness for office as one can make: no unnecessary pomp and circumstance required.

I keep thinking about what a wonderful First Lady Jill Biden would make: elegant, articulate, intelligent and a dedicated teacher. Contrast that to Melania who wore an ""I Don't Really Care. Do U"" embossed jacket when existing a plane in Texas while the administration's child separation immigration policy was raging.

Now I am too old to  move so I stay home during this virus pandemic and looking outside from my bedroom window. I just wonder how many of our recent presidents have served in our military services? My older brother did. He was drafted by the US Army in 1943 and he was dispatched to the Pacific to fight the Japanese. He told me many horror stories about WWII.  He passed away in Fairfax County , Virginia more than 15 year ago.His last job was a janitor in the Woodward & Lorthorp dept store.  George H. W.

Nonetheless, I do think that CA is going too far in its describing the ""terms of reopening"" for such places.

I understand the rules regarding limiting total occupancy -- after all that is in many ways nothing more than revising the fire code.  As is requiring such places to define social distances (eg. perhaps closing off every other pew with caution tape etc.).

But I do not think CA, or any other governmental body should provide rules or ""advisories"" regarding forms of worship including discouraging or banning singing, object kissing or such etc.

Such detailed proscriptions or even advice steps too deep into the realm of state interference with the form of worship.

All levels of government need to walk a very narrow path in how they address social behavior and admonitions during this pandemic.  The goal is to seek the broadest compliance with meaningful health precautions.  The preferable means to do so should be weighted heavily in favor of voluntary cooperation.  Police-style ""enforcement"" should be reserved for the most blatant and egregious exhibitions of irresponsible behavior.  Behavior that puts others at risk of contagion due to the actions of the ""violator"".

Remember Obama pushing his justice department to end medical coverage for millions in a lawsuit against an existing, popular program? Just when people out of work were losing health insurance!

And, remember how outraged the right was about it all!
(remember Hannity had take sedatives cause the veins in his neck were about to bust!)

That Obama…

He wrote letters to his parents every day. And returned to marry the girl of his dreams, my mother. They were high school sweethearts. He came back with shrapnel in his forehead and parts of his skull, and life-long lung problems.

My husband was a Vietnam veteran, barely 18 when sent to Laos, the Vietnam border, Thailand and The Philippines.
He excelled in Morse Code. Which sounds so antique.
He had to delay his college time. And spoke of a difficult transition---how he was older than those in his classes. And how often he felt estranged and isolated."

Seeing how some people are behaving themselves while others are stepping up, I feel dismayed that the will to sacrifice for the social good is a dwindling value in this country. I am grateful to read stories of those who step up to help others. Some of the asks are so simple. Wear a face covering and don’t mingle in groups. How hard is that?"

Contrast that with Obama and Biden who oversaw a failed surge in Afghanistan, disastrously withdrew too early from Iraq forcing a redeployment to re-take lost territory, failed to right size our forces in Syria so they could win and leave. They were quite the pair. Trump has fixed all of the above so Biden an sleep in peace.

BTW: Biden never served and is not President. He shouldn't salute. Reinforces the mans' presumptuous and utter ignorance."

How about a less severe looking mask, a soft blue color, for instance?  The Times today has an article about face shields.  In some ways they are superior to masks and we can see the face.  Biden in a face shield would look less formidable, we could see his facial expression.  We see Trump's facial expressions all the time.  Biden needs to work on his ""pandemic"" appearance."

There is a phrase 'Only In America'  well this mask issue  really is Only in America. 
For everywhere else in the world 'if they are available' people are wearing masks out of concern not just for their benefit  but more importantly out of concern for  their fellow man. 

Yes only in American will you find a significant group of people  too stupid to understand that wearing a mask has nothing to do with your politics or a politician  they follow.
  No wearing a  mask keeps you your family and your community safer."

health workers, police officers, firefighters, etc. These people perished in a war that took more lives than the Vietnam war and Korean war combined, brave warriors in the line of fire  battling the virus to rescue the rest of us. This action reveals his priorities, life above all in a state with huge financial deficits that the non existent federal government has refused to cover. Wouldn't it be nice if we did have a federal government that would honor these pandemic warriors in a similar fashion, especially  on Memorial Day."

2020-05-25 22:09,"So Trump grabbed another headline by threatening to change the venue for the Republican convention (a distinct non-event) in Charlotte, NC.  It probably won't happen, and if it did it would be a disaster because of the short time for preparation.  It's news only because of the message that he wants to send to his base, and the media has no choice but to send it.  It also sends a message to all of the veterans who died for this country.

2020-05-25 22:09,"Does Mr Trump have no shame? At long last, has he no shame? 

Well, of course he doesn't.  Anyone anywhere in the world can see that that is the case. His respect for veterans extends only as far as they can grovel to his brilliance, bone spur strategies and such.

I went to visit my grandfather today, and thank him for his service, and replant the veterans' flag holder at his grave. It's a different reality than Mr Trump's golf course."
2020-05-25 23:47,"The President continues to show he is not a master deal-maker; he's a bully who knows nothing but ultimatums.

The thing is, everyone is well aware he doesn't hold a good hand, he can't put on a good poker face, and his probable outcome is more work for the GOP organizers and looking like a petulant baby.

No one can predict what August is going to look like."
2020-05-25 22:47,"Looking good Joe!  So proud of you for wearing a mask - a badge of honor now for those who are patriotic towards their country and who care for their fellow man.  On the one hand, we have Trump, a selfish man who was only focused on not looking bad for his relection so didn't push for social distancing soon enough nor enough testing, and then there is Joe - steady through hardship."
2020-05-25 22:28,"I don't understand why America glorifies war so much. To me, going to war is something we should be ashamed of and avoid at all costs. But our exaggerated self importance and excessive patriotic zeal make displays of military might desirable, even necessary. If only we viewed scientists as highly as soldiers, our world would be much different."
2020-05-25 22:01,"Trump isn't just thinking of moving the convention, he's setting the stage for delaying indefinitely the election. He sees the polls, he sees the reaction to his incompetent handling of the Coronavirus response, he feels the reluctance of even his most ardent Republican supporters to blindly follow his chaotic actions, and his only real chance to remain in power is to suspend or call into question everything that threatens his power. We simply cannot let him succeed."
2020-05-25 22:24,Seems like Memorial Day would be difficult for a president to mess up. Leave it to Trump to prove me wrong. I remember the names of my friends who were in the service at the same time as me. Some died overseas and some died prematurely afterwards. It's their day and for all that came before and after them. Not a time for playing at politics.
2020-05-25 22:59,"A national testing plan which says all testing is up to the States, and all needed resources have already been provided, is not a plan whatsoever. It’s yet again Trump declaring he’s responsible for nothing. To prove that, he’s given us a plan with nothing in it. 
But no problem, he’ll soon be back on the links, and we’ll be distracted by his inappropriate, disrespectful behavior. Better that than allowing us to really focus on his continued failure of leadership during a national disaster."

I hope when he's there he takes a moment to reflect upon and apologize to the thousands of soldiers, sailers, airmen and women interred at Arlington who fought bravely and gave their lives to defend against the very tyranny and Fascism that Trump has brought to America since his inauguration. His presence there is a disgrace. He should be barred from ever setting foot in a national cemetery."

You are an object to be traded, bought, sold, and disposed of.  100,000+ Americans have been disposed of as part of Trump's attempt to seize absolute control at the behest of his masters Charles Koch, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping.

But even without a flag, a mask has become a symbol and a real sign of one's true regard for country and fellow citizens.  Mr. Trump behaves like a ruler, one who believes he and his family can ignore the rules set for everyone else.  Boris Johnson displays the same attitude, defending a key aide who blatantly violated quarantine rules.  But in democracies, people expect leadership, not rulership - leaders who act in the interest of us all, who themselves adhere to the rules and set by example.

Perhaps May 30th should return as enshrined as the Fourth of July and Christmas or New Year's Day.  Perhaps we could all mark May 30th  by honoring our war dead visibly by wearing the flowers of our states (as the Brits wear poppies  on November 11th each year), honoring our forebears who died for our freedom.  Visual reference helps us all to remember what the day is about.  The only visuals that come to mind lately are beer and barbecues.

But these 98K plus dead ""citizens"" had it too and the 40+ million Americans who are out of work due to bungled awesome response by Mr Trump and his stooges has equal rights under the  constitution  to life and prosperity..
Not sure what will change the life of us  the 98% citizens  now taken for a ""grand""  ride by GOP   and its  leader The Great ""Trump""."
2020-05-26 2:53,I am so sick and tired of Trump’s inability to allow the focus to be someone else besides himself for one day.  His golfing and tweets over the Memorial Holiday weekend were reprehensible. It was wonderful this weekend to see a public appearance by Joe Biden and Dr. Biden.  A fine example of presidential dignity and future representation of our great country.
2020-05-26 1:04,"We really are in a huge science/economics experiment right now. Never in the history of the world have countries shut down as a response to any disease. I think our mistake was to think that the Chinese shut down response was proper. Now we see the real agenda of the Chinese, to take Hong Kong by force, without firing a shot. So the coronavirus has helped the Chinese Communist Dictator for life eliminate the biggest threat to his power. Pretty clever."
2020-05-26 1:59,"Trump is all talk.  He is ""leading"" while crouching behind all the ""little people""

""Re-open"" he demands!  And then is seen out at his private golf club, playing a round without another soul in sight.

""Open the churches"" he demands!  But nowhere is he seen sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with congregants.

""I don't wear a mask"" while surrounded by responsible people wearing their masks and protecting him.

And Trump is just talking big about the convention.  There is no way Trump will attend a convention where he will be expected to be among a large crowd of strangers, without the ability to prevent Covid-19 from raining down on him."
2020-05-26 2:12,"I feel a deep-seated need to share how I spent my Memorial Day weekend, for anyone who will listen.

Not willing (under the circumstances) to go to my father's military cemetery in Rhode Island and face a potential crowd, I had to content myself with breaking his casket flag out of its case and holding it for a while, remembering the fine man he was and the 22 years he gave to our country.  I then spent some time holding the polished wooden case containing his insignia and medals, which I mounted myself after he died.

I then returned to the task my wife and I were busy with all ""holiday"" weekend: putting our affairs in order.

Neither of us are sick with COVID-19--not yet at any rate--but we're both of an age where the virus could send us to our graves in very short order.  We decided to leave each other clear and concise instructions should the worst come to pass.

Then, in my mind, I slammed together the necessity of our sobering task and the meaning of the day, and I was filled  with a seething contempt.  Our ""president"" is a sickening sight standing before the Tomb of the Unknown, and his ""leadership"" is a national scandal and a global source of pity for the American public.  If he was truly the leader he claims to be, we wouldn't be facing 100,000 dead on this solemn day.  

In one respect, I'm glad my father is gone.  If he'd lived to see a creature like Trump as Commander-in-Chief, it would have broken his heart."
2020-05-26 1:27,"With respect to hospital finances and Federal subsidies, I do think you have painted this portrait with too broad a brush.

First of all, you treat all reserve funds as simply a rainy day bank account.  Implying that these institutions should simply dip into them when they face extraordinary operating expenses such as arise from the pandemic.

It would be helpful to first learn how much of the billions in funds you note are restricted reserves versus unrestricted.  Only unrestricted reserves would be available for such diversion.  And doing so would not necessarily be advisable.

Even unrestricted reserves are generally dedicated to capital expenses rather than operational.

Since the Federal subsidies are made available to institutions that are experiencing extraordinary operating expenses any institution in such a position would appear to have a fiduciary obligation to seek such funds.

Applying capital reserves for any operating expenses, particularly if extraordinary, could put both the Board of the institutions and the management in legal jeopardy.

I believe you have not done a thorough job of financial analysis with this article.  It seems more intended to spread heat rather than cast light.

Financial analyses should be very detailed and consider all constraints.  This article is simply too superficial and unprofessional."
2020-05-26 2:49,"Trump is really incapable of empathy.  The few times when he is required to read some kind of statement about loss or suffering, it is always a stilted and unemotional recitation.  You can tell he is doing it only because he has to, and it was written for him by someone else.  Meanwhile. FOX ridicules Mr. Biden for showing a good example by wearing a mask today, while what passes for the leader of our nation does not.  Trump spends all his time tweeting conspiracy theories, ridiculing Governor's trying to protect the public and wasting the taxpayer's money on his golf expeditions.  We have no real President - we have a venal and vicious man pretending to be the Chief Executive.  The sad thing is he doesn't seem to have any grasp of how he should behave -I've never seen anything so pathetic."
2020-05-26 3:01,"Memorial Day is the day to remember and to honor those who sacrificed all for all.
But today we have a POTUS who can't be bothered to set an example for even a trivial sacrifice in solidarity with all his fellow Americans who have done all they could to help our nation persevere through a pandemic, nor to show the slightest compassion for those who have been afflicted, nor for their families, nor for the people who cared for them directly. And that lack of example leads other Americans to do the same. 

It's not just a mockery but an utter repudiation of the idea of sacrificing all out of love of country when we can't even all agree to wear face coverings or to stand a few feet apart or to give up social events until better treatments and testing are available.
""Make America Great Again"" this Memorial Day has turned out to mean ""Make America Childish and Selfish Now."""
2020-05-26 1:46,Is it really up to Trump to call all the shots about the RNC? Doesn't make any sense to me. He will be the Republican party's nominee for president unfortunately. That is an honor I personally feel he doesn't deserve but the party should hold the power to decide who the nominee is and where the convention will be held. He treats those people of the party like a bunch a lackeys.
2020-05-26 0:58,"The commenters pretend its a somber day but every comment only insults and berates Mr Trump! And is gushing over Mr Biden as if he were a GQ cover model!

Nate Cohn’s The New York Time’s political map of Democratic Party’s Districts and the spread of Corona Virus in the US showed us something shocking. The deep blue Democratic districts in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Michigan where the most deaths occurred; also happened to be the base of Democratic Party’s political power and their Congressional representation. The Spred of Corona virus showed a devastating Public Health crisis in these same Congressional Districts. But the Democratic representatives of these districts seem to have abandoned their constituents. They completely ignore the colossal Public Health crisis of their deadly districts!  They pay no attention life and death issues consumed by anti-Trump hysteria, or Impeachment madness Jerry Nadler and Chuck Schumer and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez’s, Global Warming craze. Or the district our impeachment champ Adam Schiff represent is the current epicenter of Coronal Virus deaths in the US. The elected officials are alienated from reality and do not serve the needs their constituents and left out to decay and die? The Democrat in US have the highest China-virus deaths in their districts but have done little or nothing even to this day to mitigate risks—"

2020-06-03 18:53,"Obesity and the chronic diseases associated with it (diabetes, high blood pressure) are huge risk factors for Covid-19. You left a key piece of information to the last paragraph and then didn’t discuss it at all. This is something within most people’s control, and we have been finding much more effective ways of managing it (using eating windows, intermittent fasting, focusing on vegetables, ketogenic diets). If everyone took better care of themselves, we would have much less need of medical care in general. Why is the NYT not encouraging this instead of trying to make so many people a victim who blames society for not taking better care of them when many have it within their own means with some guidance and encouragement to better their health?"

One of the factors mentioned is a lack of vitamin D, which people with dark skin build up more slowly when outside than lighter skinned people. In the Netherlands a study of IC patients also suggests a correlation with low vitamin K (spinach, broccoli, kale) levels."

2020-05-27 15:18,"Just call the stock market what it is—a casino.  

There is no reasonable expectation of investing in a company to give it capital  to grow, hire employees and return a decent dividend to investors.

Instead, the money movers make a grand profit off every transaction, whether it’s a gain or a loss.

The way Wall Street operates is the equivalent of the investor betting red or black, and the house getting its cut off every bet."
2020-05-27 16:47,"MedRxiv and bioRxiv emulate arXiv, which was started in 1991 for physics, astronomy, mathematics and related fields.  ArXiv works very well, putting on-line the distribution of ""preprints"", unrefereed copies of papers (also submitted to journals), to speed the distribution of information.  The distribution of preprints has been routine in the physical sciences since at least the 1950's.

ArXiv is lightly moderated to keep out crackpots, but otherwise submissions from vetted contributors are not reviewed.

There are differences.  Developments in the physical sciences rarely have financial implications.  It is unusual (though not unheard of) for preliminary results in the physical sciences to be wrong, while much of clinical biomedical science is plagued with a ""reproducibility crisis""."

Sure, but journalists and headline writers have a professional, moral, and intellectual responsibility to dispassionately report and write.  A good start would be to qualify information within the headline.  E.g.:
