2020-03-10 15:15,"I enjoyed this movie a lot the first time I saw it. I bought it years ago to add to my ""simulation"" collection of films. Another simulation film I enjoy is ""Unstoppable"" about a real-life runaway train. ""Vantage point"" is also excellent.

Now if you want another simulation about an unstoppable disease try ""The Andromeda Strain"" which was written by Michael Crichton WAAAAY before the HBO Westworld and Jurassic World entered the scene. That one centers on how to isolate and destroy an alien disease rather than it's effect on the populace.

As for the Coronavirus, it's good to be aware, prepared, and maybe even a little scared. Thankfully this is not Spanish Flu territory (yet). We will just have to wait and see how things develop.

Oh, and Contagion was always a movie worth watching. Kind of sad it too a real world outbreak of flu to make people realize that."
2020-03-10 15:16,"""Pandemic"", a recent documentary film on Netflix, is prophetic about what is actually taking place today and how this may end. A must see!"
2020-03-10 15:30,"Life imitating art. Typical for our times. This could all be a reality show for all we know, with most of us watching cable news streaming 24/7 from the comfort of our living rooms, a popcorn bucket in hand. The stakes are high and deadly, of course, but most of us will be watching it all unfold on screen, thinking we're safe."
2020-03-10 15:32,"We'll definitely get to a 'contagion' virus at some point, but covid 19, while bad, isn't the same as something like ebola, but with the ability to be transmitted like a flu or cold.   The main issue concerns  overwhelming the medical system and the hallowing out of government.  Many will get through it, won't be pretty, it's up there with global warming, nuclear war and AI as existential threats."
2020-03-10 15:34,"I don’t really see how listing populations of cities portrayed in a film about a highly contagious virus reflects the director’s supposed “OCD.” 

Maybe be more mindful of using mental health terms so loosely (and inaccurately) in an article, especially one relating to disease in a cultural climate that is probably exacerbating symptoms for many people who suffer from the aforementioned disorder?"
2020-03-10 15:38,"I laughed out loud at the line, ""classic Damon"" and this was a good reminder why I should take a break from all the Corona virus infection updates, breath a little - through a mask, of course  ;-) and re-watch Contagion."
2020-03-10 15:37,"Contagion is a great movie, but I think this author got the wrong message.  The disease in Contagion is incredibly much worse than covid-19.  Far more lethal, insanely more contagious, it is a real world-wide plague on the level of the bubonic plague outbreaks in the Medieval age.  There are enough deaths to affect society in a major way, rule of law breaks down a bit.

The message to get from the movie is that this covid-19, basically a variant of the flu, is nothing to worry about at all.  People are panicking far too much, and that's causing some irritating phenomena like a run on toilet paper at stores, but rule of law is not disintegrating.  Hardly anyone is dying, certainly less than a hundredth of those that die from the flu every year.

So by all means watch Contagion, as it really is a good movie, but just like 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, I Am Legend, and other great apocalyptic movies, it should reassure you that things really aren't that bad.  The main thing with covid-19 so far is that the media is going absolutely bananas hyping the heck out of it, and thus lots of people are paranoid and terrified.  The reality is, it's not that big a deal, and definitely not the end of the world that everybody seems to secretly desire."
2020-03-10 15:22,"From ""The Pessimist's Guide to History"" - by Stuart and Doris Flexner --

""Mariners returning to Europe in 1346 brough back tales of a deadly plague that left thousands of corpses piles up in cities throughout China and India.

The next year the news came in a more ghastly form, as trading ships sailed into European ports with virtually all their crew dead or dying of the plague.

Tradesmen infected with the bubonic plague spread the disease to Sicily, and from there to North Africa and to southern Italy.

Within months all of Europe was consumed by the plague...

[...]

As the plague spread from country to country, it devastated whole populations.  By 1348 millions were dying in England, France, Germany and Austria. ... Half the population of Florence perished within six months.

[...]

All efforts to understand the causes of the plague or stop its spread failed miserably.

[...]

When the plague finally abated in 1351, an estimated twenty-five million people had died in Europe.  About one-third of the world's population had succumbed.  

No one was spared; not royalty or nobles, church officials or whole friaries, artisans or patrons of the arts... 

It was the most devastating disaster ever visited upon the world...""

2020-03-10 15:33,"Neither is:
I Am Legend, 12 Monkeys, or 28 Days Later, but they can all teach us something.  Be ready."
2020-03-10 15:54,"""And the Band Played On""... book by Randy Shilts, also made into a not-bad movie... is an amazing exploration of the politics of disease, in that case AIDS of the 1980's."
2020-03-10 16:06,"I've never seen the movie but you don't need fiction to know just how bad epidemics can be.

My parents who grew up before there was a polio vaccine remembered the not infrequent polio epidemics where they could be playing with an apparently healthy child one day and a week later that child was either dead or in an iron leg.

  There are still many people alive who lived in fear of polio and even many who had the disease and remember the fear they lived in about whether they would be crippled for life."
2020-03-10 15:24,"Contagion was eye opening to me when I watched it a few years ago.  Kate Winslet’s character never lost her humanity. The scene where she is lying in that bed and the person next too her was suffering and she was reaching out to give that person a blanket, as sick as she was, she saw someone else needed help.  Unlike the Jude Law character, a monster that was on the same team with that terrible virus. He was no different than the extreme right wingers, like a Rush Limbaugh.  This movie made me think a lot of what is happening today.  But it was a nonfiction book that scared the life out of me, The Hot Zone."
2020-03-10 16:08,"in truth, it isn't a good movie but various scenes stay with one forever even if you watched it only once.  What the movie does right:  the health workers in the film get sick and die too.  We are already seeing that with coronavirus."
2020-03-10 16:11,"I checked other sites and found that the death rate in Contagion was 20-30%, an order of magnitude greater than COVID 19. This was briefly reassuring until the movie's death count for the US alone, at some point in the movie where all was chaos, was 2.something million. That puts Contagion right in the middle of our COVID-19 scenario. 

If, say, half the US population contracts COVID 19 and the death rate is about 2%, as a lot of data suggests, that's 3.3 million deaths in the US alone. Or say it's 20% infected, which is the high end of our usual flu contagion rate: at 2% mortality, that's 1.3 million deaths. 

But of course that's not counting people who become severely ill and recover, yet require hospitalization to get through it. Severe cases in China typically last 2-3 weeks. Data indicates that 81% of people who contract COVID-19 don't require hospitalization, but if 19% do, at a 20% infection rate that's 12.54 million Americans requiring hospitalization for, say, one-to-two weeks. The American Hospital Association reported 36,353,946 people hospitalized last year, with an average of 4.6 days of stay. So 12.54 people staying an average of 8 days is a 60% increase in hospital bed requirements. 

Perhaps our streets won't be trash-strewn fear zones ruled by crazed vaccine-seeking gangs. But COVID-19 promises a lot of disruption. Like climate change, an illness doesn't require more than a few degrees of change to up-end a society."
2020-03-10 16:27,I made it through the first few minutes and then I was like Reality is already bad enough without all of the scary background music too. I find YouTube videos of beautiful gardens more to my liking.
2020-03-10 16:27,"Contagion was ok regarding the actual disease and numbers, which were a bit light. Where it did an excellent job was in portraying the role of epidemiology and health agencies work in response to a new bug. It did a good job touching on societal disruption but didn't address the economic and long term impact. Admittedly that would have been difficult. 
If you want to understand a real pandemic, excellent books about the flu pandemic are available: Kolata, Spinney and Crosby for starters. Quammen's ""Spillover"" discusses zoonotic jumps from animals to humans very well."
2020-03-10 16:33,"“V-Wars”, new on Netflix, is along the same lines except people who catch it turn into monsters for a time. Apparently it’s caused by a germ (or something) released from Arctic ice due to global warming. Not very good but I want to see how it ends."
2020-03-10 16:56,"I am on the wait list for this film from the local library - it seems there are a few of us who want to revisit this film. What I remember most from my first viewing is the ease with which the virus was transmitted - by everyday transactions - and all the smart women who work to figure it out using science and logic. And who have a conscience. As the number of cases of COVID-19 grow and the outbreaks of fear and anxiety develop, I have been waiting for someone to,  like the Jude Law character,  show up and claim a government conspiracy and assert there is a secret cure that is being denied the public.  But it seems Facebook is already providing that."
2020-03-10 17:05,"No, No and No. Watching Contagion is always fun. Not only is the high point of the movie Gwyneth Paltrow getting the virus and dying from it. They actually top that part of the film by doing an AUTOPSY on her and removing her brain!! Love it, love it, love it. That made it the ""feel good movie of 2011"" for me, hands down!"
2020-03-10 17:15,"The movie also boasts strong anti-union sentiment, which alas may also be some viewers' idea of a good time"
2020-03-10 17:26,From a purely academic and epidemiological perspective the last scene tracing the source of the virus from bats to Paltrow was eye-opening and prophetic about the effect we have on the world around us and how the world fights back.
2020-03-10 17:29,"I find Contagion surprisingly relevant considering its age. The only element missing is a cruise ship. Otherwise, not much has changed in the world. I found it very enlightening and informative when I first saw it in 2011, and learned the basics of contagion spread--fomites, face touching, R factor. It allows me to trust the professionals coping with all the unknowns they're facing right now, and how we need to value and respect our government professionals, in spite of the elected ""leaders."""
2020-03-10 17:38,It's ironic that Gwyneth Paltrow has transformed in real life into the character played by Jude Law.
2020-03-10 17:55,"I can't believe this - my husband just watched Contagion a few nights ago. I only stayed in the room a couple of minutes to see Gwyneth's death scene! How did everybody else make out by the end of the Movie?  
Seriously, I have little faith in this administrations ability to face this threatening  challenge with any competence. 
Please, everyone take care of your senior family members and friends; and stay away from large, unnecessary gatherings."
2020-03-10 17:58,"My husband and I both worked at CDC for more than 20 years each. Contagion gets a whole lot right and not much wrong (or not terribly wrong). No Epidemic Intelligence Service officer (not ""inspection officer"") would wear heels. They're in the field for too many hours a day. And, BTW, Bryan Cranston isn't ""some kind of admiral"" -- Public Health Service officers are members the uniformed services and carry real Navy ranks. My husband was a captain.

It was refreshing to see frontline public health and health care workers being shown for the unsung heroes they are. We rewatched this last week and not only has it held up over time, but seems prescient in its depiction of a zoonotic chain infection. Despite having his parents disappear on a moment's notice throughout his childhood, the movie scared our 20YO son enough that he had to quit watching. It's a good primer for what can happen when everything goes wrong.

Like some of the posters here, we don't think COVID-19 is the high death-rate pandemic pathogen we drilled for over and over. We lived through SARS and H1N1 at CDC. Collectively we still don't know enough about COVID-19 to estimate R0 or CFR with any accuracy at all. So people should try to be calm, practice good hygiene, maybe lay in some nonperishables in the event they get stuck at home, and be thinking about neighbors who may need help in the event of more widespread infection and disruption. A few good movies to watch can't hurt."
2020-03-10 18:00,"Contagion really isn't a good movie.  It's a Sonderbergh rush-job, similar to so many of the movies he pops off without a thorough development of the script (most recently High Flying Bird and The Laundromat).  The major problem is the wonderful final sequence, outlining how the contagion first entered human society, should have started the movie so that we're engaged and knowledgable as to the real source of the threat.  Recall with Corona how quickly we had a fairly good idea of how/where the virus began.
Yes, it's always fun to see how the virus spreads, but for a good story that does that, and then moves on to more, check out Stephen King's 1400-page-magus The Stand."
2020-03-10 18:02,"Eerily, I watched a 2016 movie, called, ""Viral"", that was a mixture of science fiction and reality, that was set in the USA, about a virus and people being contained in their homes, and it showed a real life TV clip of Obama saying you don't have to worry about the virus as it is not airborne. If it was airborne then we would be very worried."" It showed people catching the virus and going into self isolation, and then the government sending in the military to keep them within their own region. It was a great movie and well worth watching. 
This movie was eerily in NZ TV about a week or two before a public announce was made about the coronavirus. The movie was made in 2016."
2020-03-10 18:03,Don’t shake anyone’s hand!  Just don’t.  Elbow bumps and foot taps are juvenile.  Say hello or goodbye like an adult and resist the urge to be creative.
2020-03-10 18:18,So we cough and sneeze on our sleeve around the inner elbow and then we bump our outer elbow areas?   No thanks.
2020-03-10 18:20,Just rewatched this. Riveting. So well directed. And obviously based on a lot of research. I wish it had remained in the realm of fiction.
2020-03-10 18:32,I presume this movie hasn’t made Trump’s playlist.  His “policy” actions might have been a little different.
2020-03-10 18:36,"“The other day, I watched a businessman wipe an entire train seat with disinfectant and then park himself in it before it dried.”

It’s impossible to know if that disinfected seat protected him and/or others from the virus. But, as is the case with reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, there’s certainly nothing to lose.

Clean air, water, energy, and surfaces can only help."
2020-03-10 18:39,"Around Christmas 2017, I came down with a version of the flu, which was particularly nasty that year. I think having gotten the flu shot a few months earlier as I always do helped a lot, but I was still bedridden for about a week and began reading something I had downloaded to my Kindle but forgotten about. Turned out to be ""Station 11"" by Emily St John Mandel about a flu pandemic that wipes out most of the world's population! I am not a Sci Fi
fan, but found this book very compelling, under the circumstances."
2020-03-10 18:53,Watched it recently. While very much an exaggeration in terms of virus caused deaths parts of the film were almost too accurate and too painful to watch. Not exactly an escape from day to day reality.
2020-03-10 18:54,"SPOILER ALERT:  For me the best thrill in Contagion is the ending, which reveals how the virus was introduced to the human population - by deforestation which forced fruit bats to leave their natural habitat and hang around nearby farms. I was stunned by the prophetic accuracy of this detail because after the making of that flick there was the Ebola outbreak in western Africa, a region unfamiliar with this disease. Epidemiologists traced the outbreak to a fruit bat forced out of its natural habitat by deforestation. Seems these flying rodents are reservoirs for all kinds of viruses and are best left isolated in the wild.

As for the coronavirus, scientists have so far traced its origin to the notorious wildlife trafficking in China, possibly from bats or from the critically endangered pangolin, all poached from their natural habitats. Chinese demand drives the global illicit wildlife trade, so it was nearly inevitable that the latest virulent disease attacking humans would originate in that country.  Then again, considering the destruction of other animal habitats around the world and in the U.S., there's no doubt more killer epidemics lurk in our future."
2020-03-10 18:57,I've been thinking about Contagion too.   A huge difference between that fictional time a decade ago and now is that Contagion assumes a US government both confident and in good faith.  We've got neither.  Pretty scary.
2020-03-10 18:58,"Thanks for this humor in a nervous time. I watched Contagion a few days after my county announced the first case of community transmission in the U.S., just to boost my mood.  I, too, winced when Paltrow's hand reached into the peanut dish, and I'm never using a salad bar again.  The scene that stuck in my mind was the riot at the pharmacy when they didn't have enough of some drug that was supposed to help, and later the bingo-style lottery to determine people with which birthday would get the vaccine first.  All in all, it made me glad I work from home."
2020-03-10 19:06,"Humor is needed right now. But I haven't rewatched Contagion, so I contented myself with watching Dustin Hoffman and Renee Russo slog through the execrable ""Outbreak"" and the one and only season of the tv series ""Containment"". Now that one is creepy."
2020-03-10 19:17,"Read this somewhere: Never take anything seriously that's shown in a place where they sell candy in the lobby.  And I'm a big media fan. It's mostly fun, not real."
2020-03-10 19:18,"Very nice piece. The most memorable scene is when the Red Cross runs out of body bags. 
The movie promotes the narrative of a slow totally powerless governmental response but fortunately the WHO and CDC come across well. The uncertainty of the threat we do not understand is what interests filmmakers. The real threat of running out of ventilators is never shown. Epidemics - the cripplers and killers -have been a great resource for screenwriters. (see Cinema MD. A History of Medicine on Screen)"
2020-03-10 19:23,I rewatched Contagion as soon as I heard about Coronavirus. It was definitely not comforting.
2020-03-10 19:52,"The most important part of the movie is the last 1-2 minutes where it shows how the virus spread into humans in the first place. Deforestation. Environmental destruction. Nature is trying to tell us that destroying ecosystems will come back to haunt us. We never listen, and we'll never learn. We prefer to run after the viral fires. It would be much better if we prevented them."
2020-03-10 19:53,"Thee is no way I would rewatch Contagion at this moment in our history. It feeds the worst of our fears. It's a movie, it's suppose to entertain and scare us, and that's exactly what it does (and more). I would not recommend this film right now."
2020-03-10 20:04,Watching timely cinema is key to understanding humanity and societal nuances during unique scenarios. We should not be afraid to relate to a fictional situation.
2020-03-10 20:13,"This movie was quite good. I don't need to watch it again, but I just wanted to say, of a lifetime of great performances Kate Winslet's in particular was fantastic.

The irony is I would have recommended this movie pre-outbreak just to appreciate its story telling style and high quality."
2020-03-10 20:16,"""to see just how bad things can get""

Personally I don't waste time using Hollywood fiction to get a handle on reality.  After all Hollywood is just one giant fantasy."
2020-03-10 20:20,"""Contagion"" does not come up with a worst-case scenario, at least at the local level.  Imagine this: an epidemic complicated by a Category 5 hurricane hitting a major city in a country run by a government which doesn't believe in government."
2020-03-10 16:30,Letter of Recommendation: Plague Inc to play on your iPhone!
2020-03-10 16:36,"Or, you could turn off the TV and read Albert Camus' ""La Peste""..."
2020-03-10 16:49,"This was an thoughtful, enjoyable article until the head-scratching, ""The movie doesn’t predict the racism and xenophobia that have broken out in the United States."" In a country of 330+ million there is bound to be a few buffoons and boors, just like the tame example given. ""Racism"" and ""xenophobia"" used to actually mean something, but they've been so over-used that they are losing their significance and weight."
2020-03-10 17:02,Here in #Hove I had missed this movie - and shall seek it out. It reminds me that there was a terrifc Australian movie The Clinic. I wonder if this is around?
2020-03-10 18:43,"The director of Parasite made ""The Host""  in 2006 with the same lead. It's about a monster that results from formaldehyde in the drain of a morgue that get into the Han River in Seoul The resulting monster is the host of a new virus whose speared leads to a national panic. A lonely fight to rescue his daughter from the monster leads to persecution and brain surgery by the state while the monster thrives. All the face masks and haz mat suits are very 2020."
2020-03-10 19:54,I can't tell you how long it's been since I heard or saw the word nincompoop. Probably since the last time my mother said it. Three cheers for more words!
2020-03-10 19:23,"The movie, Contagion, sheds light on the fact that CDC is more than just a health care organization, it is also an  intelligence gathering organization in the same sense as the CIA. Kate Winselt's  character is much more than an ""inspector:' she is an Epidemiology Intelligence Officer, who collects information about disease, so that CDC officials can develop policy to confront it. The movie also emphasizes the clandestine, or secretive, way in which vaccines and antidotes are developed and distributed. In the movie, the antidote is developed in secret and even once its produced and ready for distribution those facts are not revealed, except Fishbourne's character risks his job and security clearance to give it to the woman. So when you hear the government talk about the virus and what it is doing to combat it, keep in mind that you are not gutting the full story, or you getting the story it wants you to hear. Also keep in mind that there are some people, depending on their social and political import, who will get the antidote and vaccine before others. Cheers!"
2020-03-10 16:27,"""Understand the virus at a cellular level?""   Viruses don't got cells."
2020-03-10 18:49,"Many horror films of the 50s-70s have to do with the irrational fear that most Americans have about ""catching something from somebody."" Night of the Living Dead"" ""Invasion of the body Snatchers"" More recent dystopian films are far less subtle about this fear and are right up front about infected people coming to get us.
Many think these movies were about the fear of communist infestation. I rather think its because we associate microbes with evil.
The reality is microbes are everywhere and mostly they are beneficial. Our hand sanitizer mentality is ridiculous."
2020-03-10 16:23,"You've written:

“ 'Contagion' explains the terror; it’s an explanatory drama. Scott Z. Burns wrote the script, and he embeds us with the crisis managers, scientists and bureaucrats who are looking, rationally, for answers, devising containment strategies, working toward a vaccine. Elected government is all but negligible."" 

Again: ""Elected government is all but negligible.""

I think it may be time for Soderbergh to release a new edit of ""Contagion."" I was in Chicago in late 2010 when a Senate Hearing was being filmed for the movie. Dick Durbin - as in U. S. Senator Dick Durbin - was the Chairman at the hearing.  I was among the politicians and lobbyists in the front row of the crowd. ... The scene was cut from the film. 

It's not too late. Maybe it's time for a real Senate Hearing now. With Dick Durbin in a real role at the hearing."
2020-03-10 17:49,"I missed seeing 'contagion' in the theater. My bad. I need to watch just to see Kate Winslet deliver that pithy line, ""stop touching your face."" For that alone, all Americans should see this flick."
2020-03-10 20:05,"The disease in Contagion was so much more lethal it’s almost silly to compare our current situation to it. I only saw it when it first came out, but didn’t it pretty much kill everyone who got it?

But the one thing I thought was so interesting in that movie was the explanation of the R-naught factor—the math of contagion. It’s the high contagion aspect of COVID-19 that is so scary and while it doesn’t merit panic, it certainly merits serious action to stop the spread. And some day, there may be a more lethal disease that spreads this easily and then we will really want to have an administration who knows what they’re doing. Heck, a friend of mine and I were just saying that the emails we both got from Delta and United Airlines were much more informative than anything coming from the White House. Who knew people die from the flu? Inspires so much confidence..."
2020-03-10 18:24,"Another movie I would recommend is Virus from India. It is a movie based on the real Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala and does a really good job of showing the responses, reactions, and emotions of front line responders as well as their near and dear ones. Available on Amazon Prime."
2020-03-10 19:23,"As a microbiologist with an interest in pandemics (although they are not my area of expertise) the movie Contagion struck me as the most likely scenario for a highly contagious and lethal new pathogen.  It actually made me feel ill.

It especially hits home as every day I watch people not wash their hands after using the bathroom; freely wipe their eyes, nose, and mouth with their hands, and then open doors or push elevator buttons with those same hands; shake hands and then touch their faces.  Sneeze into their hands and then touch everything in sight.  Doorknobs and door push plates sticky with hand grease/food, that have clearly not been cleaned for years.  Etc., etc., etc.  

We are slobs and have no concept of a reasonable level of hygiene.  Now I see news reports showing people frantically cleaning door handles, doors, handrails, desks and tables.  These are things we should have already been doing regularly. They are certainly things I have been doing.  

How long since you cleaned your keyboard, mouse, and mousepad?  I’ll tell you - probably never.  

Maybe this will be the wakeup call we need to improve our regular hygiene habits.  I doubt it, but will hope for it anyway.  Trivia - you know what the most contaminated object you touch on a regular basis is?  It’s the gas tank fuel filler.  That handle has probably never been cleaned.  Every time I fuel my vehicle I wipe down the handle and wipe my hands with baby wipes afterwards.  Stop worrying about toilet seats."
2020-03-10 19:25,"I would recommend ""Pandemic,"" on Netflix, as an alternative. It SEEMS prescient for this particular moment, but only because it portrays serious scientists and medical workers who do the hard work whenever something like this comes up, and know that it's only a matter of time (like, maybe, now?) that something really serious raises its ugly head...again. It seems to have been made pretty recently, but I haven't actually checked. There are a lot of references to, um, funding...or the lack thereof.
There ARE people in the world who have dedicated their lives to understanding these outbreaks, and trying to mitigate their effects. I would love to hear more from them, with (to use the name of a recent Stones tour), No Filters. Ahem."
2020-03-10 17:05,Best part of the film was seeing Gwyneth die.
2020-03-10 18:53,"Some stories done on this virus by the media can't be avoided because they serve the public's interest. This isn't one of them.

This was totally unnecessary, shed no light, and served no purpose but to garner clicks for the Times and make those who read the headline and/or article that much more on edge.

Is that what we need now?"
2020-03-10 18:02,"Over blown, over hyped movie, filled with overacting."
2020-03-10 18:50,"I fear the virus will peter out and the death toll will be fairly low, less than the annual flu, but then Herr Hair will take the credit and be reelected by a landslide for keeping us safe."

In an age where solid information is available to us instantly, twenty four hours a day, there is no excuse for such ignorance.  And yet.

Only this week a MAGA hatted woman defined socialism as 'not standing up for white people.'  The corona virus is among the least of our worries as a nation, and a culture."
2020-03-10 21:01,"As I recall it was ""Contagion""  that had that haunting scene of the selfless heroine visible through  a clear plastic body wrap, being buried in a makeshift grave. A horrifying depiction of our humanity  and vulnerability and the anonymity of death. A reminder of what it is like for first responders and health acre workers, especially nurses,  who selflessly and valiantly risk their lives to save others. In the end the front line workers who sacrifice themselves do not get to bask in glory .   It was a  testament to the incredible courage  and love for others that these people show us every day, and a reminder that being famous or making the most money is not the greatest reward, nor the holiest state,  to which a human can aspire."
2020-03-10 15:03,Thanks-just enough humor. I have been thinking about this movie a lot- I have relatives that say this is still the scariest movie they have ever seen. One last comment on the Kate Winslet character- she died.
2020-03-10 21:46,"I don't have access to Contagion and never saw it.  My Netflix has Outbreak, which I re-watched this week and enjoyed it.  It was not as similar it sounds as Contagion is to this virus.  I am looking for all movies related to it because I do think that people are overreacting so it more entertaining than scary.  More people die from the flu.  My area has no hand sanitizer and we are almost out of toilet paper.  People here in NC are already going a little crazy with only 2 cases of the virus."

2020-03-10 22:35,"I rewatched this movie, myself, a few weeks ago. It was a perfect primer for the things that are currently unfolding. I used to think of it as a horror-thriller, and it is, but now I know it is also in many ways far too realistic."
2020-03-10 22:55,"An infectious disease specialist I know recently told me that ""Contagion"" was pretty accurate in terms of disease spread and the effects that uncertainty and bad information can have on an already apprehensive population. The Jude Law character I found especially relevant, given the internet rumor that drinking bleach would prevent the virus from getting a toehold. Maybe the best we can derive from the whole covid-19 experience is to appreciate the importance and vital necessity of listening to scientists and experts who actually know what they're talking about.  We'll need that appreciation when the droughts, heat waves, floods and heretofore unimagined effects of climate change become commonplace."
2020-03-10 21:58,One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. It was just a really bad version of Outbreak.

2020-03-11 1:07,"Dear Mr. Morris,
Thank you for taking the time to write about this movie, which is being forwarded to a friend of mine in the field of public health, an admirer of your work, who gave me circa 2011 one of your books.

She has been traveling the world on mission for many years from East Asia to India and onto the South Sudan.  America is her home.  A brilliant water engineer, she continues to branch out, and your recap of 'Contagion' will be of interest to her.  Project WASH is close to her soul.

Away on another continent, my fear is that she may not be able to return as scheduled because this virus is spreading at an alarming rate (a neighbor earlier thought it was astonishing that The National Guard is now in this sinister scenario.  For fear, he laughed uneasily).

You are both made of stronger fabric, and my idea of fun in limbo is tackling the daily NYT Spelling Bee, or falling asleep in front of 'Bachelor'.

""The only people who flip out are civilians"" may not be true in this real documentary, having seen since the beginning of this week, some Americans, injected with a perverse sense of pride, working, or walking about as if they were courageous and invincible pioneers.

""Blindness"" by Jose Saramengo comes to mind, where only one woman left with sight is able to take the lead and organize forays into the remains of supermarkets; you would like to revisit or review the above, timely for your readership.  

Stay well and panic-free.  Your voice is needed."
2020-03-11 1:33,"I saw the movie when it first came out, and my DVD is out on loan. 

I thought that it was an exceptionally intelligent film, embodying so many examples of ""Show, don't tell,"" like: [SPOILERS]

--the audio clip about the nurses refusing to work until anti-infection protocols are in place (a very reasonable demand, as demonstrated during the SARS epidemic, which devastated care-givers), juxtaposed with an image of a nun caring for a patient

--the 911 menu options: this is what society and order have come to

--the series of pictures of dead monkeys, followed by not-dead ones

--the bottles of vaccine coming off an assembly line shows the passage of time

--putting the virus to ""rest"" in the freezer next to SARS and H1N1--the crisis is over"
2020-03-11 5:18,We have contactless credit cards now. We'll be OK!
2020-03-11 5:31,"Thank you, Mr. Morris, for this piece. In the early days of news of the novel coronavirus, I wondered why Contagion was never mentioned - now it seems to be everywhere. And obviously, for very good reason. I worked on the film, & it was clear that Scott Z. Burns & Mr. Soderbergh were committed to accuracy & precision, with a team of public health experts - Kate Winslet spent time at the CDC & was advised by a CDC doctor in preparing her role. 'Fomates' & 'R-nought' were two things that really stuck with me from the script - I knew somehow they would be relevant in real life.
May I also recommend an astonishingly  prescient piece (except maybe not, it should have been obvious), dating back to 2004, from Harper's magazine, written by Dr. Ronald J. Glasser: We Are Not Immune. You may need a subscription to read, I don't know, but go to harpers.org & take a look."
2020-03-11 5:35,Just checked my multi-county library system website for this film only to find that all 60 copies of the DVD or Blu-ray have been checked out!
2020-03-11 12:43,"Great review. I came across Contagion again while surfing the movies available on my television. The spread of the disease all happened so fast... I almost wish the movie would have taken more time, another hour, to flesh out the characters that the actors portrayed so compellingly -- Kate Winslet was taken too soon. But I guess that was the point."
2020-03-11 14:01,I showed Contagion last month to our graduate students as an adjunct to our seminar course and was amazed at how much better the movie got in the 9 years since it was made.
2020-03-11 14:16,What I liked best about the movie is how it did focus on all the surfaces and implied how viruses spread. I showed this to my kids and hope they found it useful to realize how often they touch things other people touch.
2020-03-11 15:23,I too searched out contagion this week and enjoyed how scarily realistic it is to Corona virus. yes it's theatre at it dramatic best but they do say art imitates life.. maybe now life is imitating art.

However, it is marred horribly by your casual reference to Spielberg’s “OCD.” This is neither accurate nor funny, and truly demeans the suffering of millions of people who really do have OCD, which is so much darker and more horrifying an illness than being organized, or keeping things by color.

Please take a bit to review the real illness, and why casual references to it do so much harm to its sufferers, as that could further inform your otherwise engaging writing.

Thank you."
2020-03-11 12:11,Once was enough.
2020-03-10 17:23,"A 90-120 minute commute on NJ Transit, the subway and by foot would dim your eagerness of going into the office on a regular basis. Once or twice a week is bearable, once or twice a month or quarter is even better. But since 95% of my work is solitary and I interact with people in offices around the globe, where I sit makes little difference."
2020-03-10 17:25,"It's just personal. I have tried to work from an office and cannot. I worked in offices for 10 years, struggled to adapt, had people yell at me for napping. Since then, I've worked from home offices for 22 years in creative fields (interior design and then law practice involving immersion in writing briefs). Most of my work involves long periods of intense focus, followed by a decompression lunch break, often a nap, coffee break, and then another round of deep immersion before handling calls at the end of the day. Something like 4 - 2 - 4 - 1 hourly periods during the day.  This keeps me sane and productive. Plus which, my god do I love naps. 

In an office, people kept bugging me, or footfalls and phone rings broke my concentration. And then, of course, the person I know only casually who asks me about my weekend, drones on about their life, and brings out the worst aspects of my anti-social nature . . ."
2020-03-10 17:26,"Personally, work from home gave me much more creativity and productivity.  My experience with working at the office in the past five years was that there was very little of the ""bumping into people"" going on.  Most were tethered to headsets either listening to music to block out the noise in the open plan office or on headsets talking on conference calls.  Most lunches were eaten at the desk while working or reading online.  Socialization was almost non-existent.  
Working from home, I have the same access to anyone on Slack while I eliminate a hour or more of commute time and all the stress that entails.  Now I schedule an hour on my calendar every afternoon when my kids come home from school to hear their chatter about what they did.  I see more of my family, get more done, and feel much more positive about my job, which I believe leads to more creativity."
2020-03-10 17:26,"I work almost entirely from home (in the office one or two days a month), and it works for me. The nature of the work you're doing surely must have an impact. If you're in a job that demands ""creativity"" and ""serendipitous contact"" to be effective and successful, then yeah, maybe you need more interaction with colleagues. If you're a medical coder, a data-entry clerk, a proofreader (hmm, ARE there such things any more...?), a database content manager... you need focus, quiet, and limited interruptions. And I'm not sure I buy that the reason for kitchens and snacks is for the ""spontaneous encounters"" - I suspect it's more so that employees won't need to go home. I'm lucky - I will NEVER go back to 90-minute commutes, and would blow my brains out in a cube farm. A study in the wake of a transit disruption in London showed that after service was restored, a large number of  commuters never went back to their old method (Larcom et al., Benefits of forced experimentation... 2017). Flexibility!"
2020-03-10 17:28,"As one of many people strongly encouraged to work from home in the Seattle area, I can't really say I'm enjoying it. Home is where I decompress and disconnect. Home is where I don't work.

Maybe this compartmentalization is old fashioned, but I feel like these boundaries are important for my mental well-being. It enables me to be at my best both in my personal and professional life. When I'm at work, the only thing that matters is work. When I'm home, the only thing that matters is my life. My bus commute is the perfect buffer between these two.

A lot of my co-workers are rooting for these changes to stick, but I'm looking forward to be back at my desk, so that my place can go back to what it was, a home."
2020-03-10 17:28,"As someone who has worked remotely for the last 2 years, My company being in California and me living in NYC, I agree totally with this article. Remote work is indeed overrated. I tried working from coffee shops, but they are too noisy or the seats are too uncomfortable or the internet connection is not good, and besides using my dual monitor at home is much better, now I only work at my apartment, during the work week I spend around 21 hours a day alone at home, my only social interaction is when I go out to walk the dogs or short shopping trips. Over the last 2 years I have seen my productivity go down, and I am going stir crazy, I love NYC, for me it's the ideal place to live so I was faced with a difficult choice, I decided to move back to California once my current lease is up, the alternative is of course to stay and change jobs, but for someone in his mid fifties that is not really an option."
2020-03-10 17:30,"Well if one considers a pandemic as ""inconveniences"" as well as ""exciting time for some fans of remote work"", then I think loss of touch with reality may be a bigger problem than ""loss of creativity"". The article argues that one needs an office because ""being near other people also allows us to express our most human qualities, like empathy and collaboration"" We are facing a pandemic which all doctor's consider a serious threat to our health systems, not even speaking of > 4% death rate in Italy. May be this would be a good place to start working on empathy and collaboration, and may be just for a day ignore ""inconvenience"" and focus on what is important for our societies?"
2020-03-10 17:19,"I worked from home for 13 years while my children where young.  While it did inhibit my career growth mostly because of all the type A's, who cant bring themselves to relinquish any modicum of control, would form social bonds while in person that I did not being remote. Today my industry had moved to Boston and the company that I work for feels as Jobs did so I drive to Boston from CT and stay away from my family all week. To tell you the truth I am tired of corporations arbitrarily deciding ho I work jut to squeeze more productivity of of a man who is already running as fact as he can."

2020-03-10 17:36,"I couldn't disagree with the author's general conclusion (that most people shouldn't work remotely as a blanket statement) more. I have been working from home in a creative field for 9 years, and have never had a more productive (or creative) time in my career. I presently work with a team that's distributed across the globe, and our other remote workers are notably some of the most innovative in the group.

One way or another, moving people around physically just to gather them in an open-office pens is not environmentally sustainable, nor is it ideal for many people. On the other hand, it's certainly not for everybody -- extroverts who get energy from continual human contact will likely feel drained, but this can be helped somewhat by finding new ways to use collaboration tools. I'm physically capable of working onsite, I just find it hugely disadvantageous. What's evident here is that the conclusion is colored by the author's own personal preferences/style."
2020-03-10 17:29,Anyone that quotes Steve Jobs as someone with anything to say about good ways to work automatically gets ignored by me. Quoting sociopaths is not hepful.
2020-03-10 17:37,"As someone who worked from home for a decade and now is office based again, I can truly say office based work environments are overrated.

Most of the people around me are solitary contributors  who tend to work very plugged-in with little to no social interactions going on. The team I work on sits in a non-contiguous space so I do not sit near anyone who is a member of my team. Most of the meetings I attend are conference calls, with the occasional face-to-face meeting.

Enduring a mass-transit commute every day to go into an office where I neither see my team members nor speak to the folks who sit around me, there is literally nothing I gain from being on-site. And with the work I do, it can just as easily be performed remotely."
2020-03-10 17:38,"Speaking as an introvert, I tend to get overwhelmed by extroverts at the work place. I am FAR more productive working from home. I don't want to be forced into socialization or small talk at work. I hope this because the norm. But if extroverts want, they can go to the office everyday or just choose a profession that requires them to commute to be in person. I'd rather be wired in at home."
2020-03-10 17:39,There are plenty of ways to foster creativity and collaboration and empathy in a remote work environment. There are a few good things about working in an office but  I hate so much of the rest of being forced to go to an office everyday that I have sworn never to do so again.  The one theme I agree with in this article is that people should be able to have leeway to do what works for them.  Obviously not everyone can do anything they want.

This is different. Deal."

Fixed it for you!

Certainly there are advantages to working in an office and I cherish my opportunities to hang out with colleagues face to face. But I've been remote since 2006 and I'll be honest, it would take a LOT of money to convince me to give up the time, money, productivity, and yes, the creativity that comes a home office."
2020-03-10 17:42,"I completely agree. My job isn't creative, but I do have many daily interactions with coworkers. I also need to put my work clothes on get out of the house. Who needs to look at the floor that needs sweeping when you're trying to get your job done?"
2020-03-10 17:44,"This is so not a one size fits all choice. It took me a while to adjust but now I like it. I am not as ignored in meetings and ageism isn’t a factor. I go to a coworking space but not often enough to justify a subscription. In this age, when it is healthy again, companies should allow workers to design their environment. 

If companies make use of more fluid coworking spaces and offices employees can also be more fluid with their environment. Having kids and moving from city to suburb or vice versa change the way you want to work. Let technology serve workers rather than always the employer."
2020-03-10 17:46,This really does depend on both the home environment and the office environment.  Some workplaces really do foster creativity and team work.  But many more are just soul killing offices.
2020-03-10 17:48,"I live alone so when I'm working from home it's just me.  All day and into the evening.  I'd much rather be in the office, so I only work from home when I need to. It's really nice to have the option.  That said, the other half of this equation is open offices.  I didn't mind them too much until I started sitting next to somebody who is pretty loud on the phone and has a different standard of tidiness than I do. Fortunately, SHE works from home quite often, which suits me just fine."
2020-03-10 17:51,"I think it works better for some people then other and it works better in some situations then other. I used to work at the office for 3 days and at home for 2. Now, I am working from home all 5 days. The key is that the workplace provides state of the art telecommunication softwares so that people could collaborate remotely as if they sit next to each other. They may even be able to see each other if they so desire."
2020-03-10 17:52,"The company I work for is E based, all remote workers.  I prefer it to a physical office for many reasons. Since I work in accounting, all of my work would be remote whether or not I was in the office.  Almost all accounting systems are remotely based, not locally hosted. I don't miss the people who work sick and spread colds and flu around, commutes on snow and ice covered streets and the general drama that takes place in most offices.   I am quite good at separating work and at home because I have usually worked jobs that require significant time past 40 hours a week.  It is something you learn in order to survive mentally.  Since I am nearing retirement, I hope to never have to work in an office again."
2020-03-10 17:26,"The NYT has published an endless series of articles about how we need to take climate change seriously, which means making major changes in our lifestyles.

If climate change is really that serious, then efforts to reduce it trumps (no pun intended) all else. If everybody who could telecommute to work did, that would majorly reduce carbon emissions. Just note the difference between peak commuter traffic and Sunday traffic, and think of how much pollution and carbon emissions we would prevent if EVERY day looked like Sunday.

Take all the objections in this article, stack them against the consequences of climate change, and they shrink to insignificance. Are you really arguing that your “increased creativity” at work is more important than preventing future suffering for your children and grandchildren (not to mention every other living thing on earth)?

If you take climate change seriously, then you need to embrace telecommuting despite any potential drawbacks. If you’re arguing against telecommuting, then what you are really saying is that climate change is an overblown issue. You can take one position or the other, but you can’t take both."
2020-03-10 17:58,"The research cited by Mr. Roose doesn't including two (2) major influencers in the work at home debate: the type of work they are engaged in, and personality of the individual.  Also, 'creativity' is notoriously hard to measure (some say impossible).

As an electrical engineer who has done creative work for many years in grey, windowless company cubicle farms, and worked from my 'dream office' that I built in my home, I would have to say that my work from home was much more creative and productive.  My occupation is designing electronic products, which is both cerebral and creative.  My projects are always done under tight (and usually unrealistic) deadlines.

In the cube farm, I am constantly interrupted by a cacophony of phones, meetings, people with questions, and a lot of useless activity that didn't really contribute to my output one little bit.  The same interruptions happen in my home office, but I have some control over them.  In my home office I could get two (2) hours of uninterrupted time right away in the morning...something impossible in a cube farm.

All of this suits my personality.  It does not suit the Type-A personality of many others, like salesmen, micromanaging bosses, extroverted types and the control freaks among us.  It doesn't work for people who need a boss to hold their hand.

And for reasons I really can't fathom, the home office debate never ends."
2020-03-10 17:59,"I've worked a mixed schedule of telecommuting and working in an office for the last 20 years. I have yet to experience any of the serendipitous collaboration or creativity while in the office. Nor has anyone I have ever talked to. Maybe it is the nature of my work (computer programmer on a team of managers and business analysts) Everyone has noise cancelling headphones on in an attempt to block out all of the auditory distractions.  The only advantages of open offices are as a place for extroverts to interact and mistrusting  bosses to ""keep an eye on"" their workers.

My health improves due to telecommuting- I am able to sleep more, eat more healthy food, and stay out of a car and traffic. And, needless to say, I am way more productive. I hope that this grand experiment due to Covid-19 will convince more managers that there really are few downsides to having their teams telecommute."
2020-03-10 17:38,"I expect that within days, my workplace will mandate a work-from-home policy and I am absolutely dreading it.  I am in my 60s, I have my way of doing things.  My home has always been a no-work-enters-here sanctuary and I have thus far succeeded in protecting it.

Why would I want to isolate, apart from the obvious escape from possible viral contamination (I’m not an idiot, I get what’s at stake).  I have friends I see through the week that I’d miss.  I hate to cook.  My coffee is terrible.  And if my husband is stuck at home too, how am I supposed to work around him?

No – I need the structure, I need the stimulation, I need to get out of the house, I need all the focus that the office provides.  My neighbors can be noisy jerks.

I mean, I love going home in the evening but I don’t want to be forced to stay there.  Won’t work for me."
2020-03-10 17:55,"I get that you want people to read your book, and as somebody who works from home myself, I fully acknowledge the tradeoffs mentioned here.

2020-03-10 18:04,"There are benefits to both options.  Working from home, you get to set your hours and have the flexibility to work appointments, kid stuff and other things into your day.  It really can be quite wonderful and freeing to do this. 

Working in an office has its own positive aspects.  You tend to be more stimulated by officemates and others.  You can create good, lasting friendships and you're not in your home environment, where, let's face it, there are distractions.

All in all, I'd choose working remotely.  Office politics can create an unhealthy atmosphere.  Then, there's company rules, etc.  I'd rather wear shorts at home."
2020-03-10 18:04,"This would be a legitimate argument if people had half hour commutes. As someone dealing with the worst traffic in America every day and a crumbling public transit system suffering from decades of disinvestment, I would be highly interested in hearing why I should value commuting for 3-4 hours to my job every day rather than spending that time with my kids."

I've been a telecommuter for nearly a decade, and it took me a year or two to finally find a routine that works for me. In the mornings I am most productive in isolation, so I brew a pot of fresh coffee to perk my brain up and sequester myself in my home office. By lunchtime I'm feeling more social, so in the afternoon I usually head to either a coffee shop or my local library where I am surrounded by people that I can choose to interact with should I wish to do so. (More importantly, I am far away from plush living room couch that beckons me to sweet slumber while my lunch is digesting.) 

Bottom line: different people prefer different work environments, and the nice thing about remote work is that you have the freedom to tailor your work environment to your own needs. By all means, if you feel most productive in a traditional office environment, go rent a desk at a co-working facility."

2020-03-10 18:12,"What about all the people who don't have working from home as an option? Food service , uber/lyft drivers, nurses, bus drivers etc.(the list goes on) don't have this option to complain about getting paid to sit at home in their sweats eating food from their fridges during a health crisis let alone ever! It sounds like the author needs a vibe check and could put that pent up energy to maybe understanding that the system is broken for many and benefits only a few."
2020-03-10 18:13,"I'm allowed to work from home when necessary.  I wouldn't want to do it all the time though.  Too many distractions at home, I get more done in the office."
2020-03-10 18:15,"Of course working remotely has its benefits and should be an option. Sometimes. But I think what all us humans are realizing, as we stream movies, order in coffee, plug into our laptops in cafes, forego shopping for Amazon.com... is that we also need/crave human interaction. Often more than convenience."
2020-03-10 18:16,"Au contraire, working from home is great.  My management representatives didn't think that it would work out for the company. A year later they conceded that it was a win win. 
That is not to say that it is easy.  I had to wage a constant battle with my wife to disabuse her of the idea that just because I was there didn't mean I wasn't busy.  

Still overall, I think that working at home can be much better than going to the office.  As much as I worked at a great company, working from home was better.  I was able to home school my son who is on the spectrum."

2020-03-10 18:19,"Absolute hogwash.  Net group creativity hinges on the quality and maturity of the individuals on the team, not the location of team members.  I have run a consulting practice for 21 years of urban planners and designers individually located in Boulder, Park City, DC, and elsewhere, with the highest level of creative output.  It takes a different kind of people and different kind of commitment; the location is not the issue."
2020-03-10 18:19,"I had the chance to work from home 20 years ago when it was just becoming feasible. After a few weeks, I asked my company to find a cubicle in a local office with computer connectivity.   The experience was similar to the isolation I felt as a stay-at-home mother and I became depressed.   I was much productive at an office even though no one there did anything remotely connected to my work. I'm happy for the people who can work at home but it is not for everyone."
2020-03-10 18:20,"That ""1.5 work-from-home days per week"" finding happens to be very close to what I feel most comfortable with, go figure.  One full day per week + 1 (or occasionally 2) half days generally is all I need to achieve what I consider ideal work-life balance - for me.  I do get cabin fever when working from home more than 3 days in a row.  That said, my commute is only 20 minutes and my office is comfortable and modern, so its not a pain to get or be there."
2020-03-10 18:20,"I think the best option is doing both, and taking into account the weekly workload. As far as human interaction, I wholeheartedly agree with the author, we need it. Isolating ourselves everyday would get old regardless of how productive we are. Here is where I disagree, I'd much rather spend more time at home than commuting/being at work -period. Have you never heard of weekend? Community Service? Bible Study? Wine Tasting? A telephone? 

No, let me stay home, trust me, I will figure out how to keep my humanity and creativity."
2020-03-10 18:25,"I've worked in offices and for the past 12 years have worked from home. Like most things in life there are pros and cons. While I miss being with colleagues on a daily basis, I enjoy the flexibility of working when I'm most productive (morning person). I don't miss the traffic of a daily commute or constant interruptions during the work day. Working solo does take getting used to but for me it's been great."
2020-03-10 18:33,There is something to be said for the collegiality that comes from working in an office. There's nothing like being able to visit a coworker to ask a quick question or bounce an idea.

At this time, it would be healthier for all if you shared how to adapt and make it work , and gave your complaints a rest."
2020-03-10 18:34,"I've worked at home for 10+ years.  

The other day I had to go into the city in the early morning.  Seeing rush hour traffic for the first time in a couple of years was an eye opener.  How do people do that twice a day 5 days a week? The wear and tear on your car, your health and happiness must be incredible.   

I'm much more creative and engaged from my home office.  

Working at home is almost a lifestyle.  I tell people, ""I work all the time, but only when I want to."""
2020-03-10 18:35,"Despite long commutes, I prefer working in an office over working at home.  When I was between jobs, I often did some freelance work at home.  It was a battle for me to ignore the dirty laundry and dirty dishes.  I would not want to be required to work at a ""permanent"" job at my home; I don't have the extra space for my work materials."

Mullenweg wrote, ""...build a culture that allows long-overdue work FLEXIBILITY.” Many companies accommodate employees needs with work needs. Examples: 1-2 days for my department where interaction does create synergy in our various locations. Though, we do quite well collaborating with global co-workers across India, UK and Pacific USA time zone. Regardless if in office or at home, we use Skype and Teams to collaborate  w/video cameras for formal meetings. Long hours, catching early meetings, and having little privacy for sensitive personal phone calls, working from home allows us to throw in laundry, make MD appt., get to the 5:30 local yoga session etc. 

Content workers, well rested is key to creativity and enthusiastic toward the technology that supports collaboration. This morning, in Chicago, I was in a productive and fun brainstorm with UK and NY city. We've never met face-to-face but we are on the same page on solutions a sharing idea."
2020-03-10 18:37,"Sorry, but these annoying clickbait headlines are overrated : Sorry, Stop saying, One Weird Trick, Overrated, and all the rest of them.  

And all of this data cherry-picking to provide fake answers to the real problem : Don't decide how other people work for them.  

Decide what you're willing to pay and whether the way they want to work works for you at all; then measure whether you're getting what you paid for.  If you have no way of measuring whether you're getting what you paid for other than prescribing the precise conditions of the work, then you are probably one of the 80% of managers who have no business deciding anything for other people.  If you negotiate with people as equals rather than treating them like children or lab rats, I find you get much better results.  Oh, yeah, and you have to give meaningful evaluation, both upward and downward; every student knows ""C+, no comments"" is worthless; whereas a ton of comments, with follow-up discussion results in fruitful discussion among peers about how to make everyone stronger, including the manager.  

I'm glad the research gets done, but I'm still not sure what good it does in practice because, if, e.g., you don't know that a shoulder-to-shoulder open-office plan is awful for coding, then no study is going to cure what ails your mind in this regard."
2020-03-10 18:37,"Nicely put.  Exactly my feelings in my current working from home situation.

When I find it frustrating though, I tell myself that it is MUCH less stressful than worrying I may either get or spread the virus to someone I love. 

So at the moment it is the less stressful option.  By far. We are the lucky ones."

If that's how you're going about your remote work, you're doing it wrong. I've worked from home for close to 7 years now and the boundary between being ""at work"" and ""off work"" should be maintained even though your commute is down the hall. I shave and get dressed normally, have breakfast, say goodbye to my family and ""go to work"" in the home office. This is essential both for being able to focus on work but also for making sure you ""leave work"" at the end of the day and don't bring it home with you."
2020-03-10 18:40,"Let me understand this better you've worked from home and loved it until you read a book that told your although you may be more productive, get sick less often, don't contribute to more air pollution by being stuck in traffic daily. I didn't even mention that they are saving money by not having to drive upteen miles daily and waiting in a lunch line every for unhealthy lunches they have to pay for.

Smaller offices, smaller pollution, less cost for your employer too.

Well, I not of your generation so I don't find intrusive people a need to die for and I've had plenty ideas over the years.

What you don't say is that Steve Jobs was a great sales man. He was and I admit it. He was also a person that didn't trust other people. Finally, when all your ideas occur in your home why should you share them with the company who is not going to pay you for them but is going to assume property of you intellect. You'll get your weekly hours for 45 years and the owners and investors get to retire at 40 to invest in other companies. 

Hmmm? What do you see that is wrong with this picture?"
2020-03-10 18:40,"I've done both, although I haven't worked from home exclusively. 
 I'm in agreement with a few other people here: 1-2 days a week work from home is optimal.  That means schedules have to be set (with set days that everyone is expected to be in the office) and more video meetings, but I find when I do 1-2 days consistently at home, I know which tasks I can do better from home/in isolation and which flow better when there are people I can easily find and bounce ideas off of.  
With 1-2 days at-home work, traffic will still be lighter, workers get a break from driving, packing/buying lunch, etc. and offices get more productive workers.  
Managers -- especially those dependent on micro-managing their workers -- will have to change.  AND, that's where the most resistance is.  P.S. I do know some workers who when given the chance to work from home, know themselves well enough to turn it down because they wouldn't be as productive."

I have temped within the last 10 years and been back in cubicles out of necessity and it is the worst thing possible for creative (writing) work or work requiring intense concentration, like fact checking. Working in an office is a nightmare for either of these because you have constant distractions and really, do I need to know why someone's husband does or doesn't put the toilet lid down, or why they wore red socks. And I get to work with my dog snoring nearby."

As for ""Studies have found that people working together in the same room tend to solve problems more quickly than remote collaborators, and that team cohesion suffers in remote work arrangements.""

I believe this is because most people are dumb followers depending on one or two brighter than average people in the office to help solve problems.  Many think they are solving these problems themselves but they really are not.  So when their informal ""support"" network is lost, as may happen when they are working from home, they become like a 3 legged chair, just wobbling along."

ALL office workers should have the CHOICE to work from home at ANY time for ANY reason as long as they're still productive.

It's outdated people like you that keep millions of us chained to our cubicles day in and day out.

Just because you prefer to not work from home does not mean the rest of us should have to do so all the time, especially if our job can easily and efficiently be done anywhere in the world."

For most people, no one cares what ideas they have. They're expected to get their mindless paperwork done, on time or faster, with a minimum of fuss.

2020-03-10 18:42,"I'm sure the author of this piece is being sincere in their assertions, but I think if readers look behind those, they'll see some dubious assumptions that are ingrained by American work culture.

Haven't left the house for ""hours (days?)"" to interact with another person? Go to a coffee shop or meetup, make small talk with someone. Nothing stopping you.

Working in your sweatpants? Shower and dress yourself.

Missing a creative outlet? Pick up writing, a visual art, or any other creative outlet.

Need collaboration? Propose a project to a friend or partner (or your kids, if you have 'em).

The author's assertions show just how little value and effort we're conditioned to assign to time when we don't have to ""go to work."" There are tons of pursuits in life whose purpose is more than to add to your employer's bottom line, which you may find more fulfilling, and which might have more value to the society. Remote work enables us to spend less time at the office, but it's only worthwhile if we make use of the time we reclaim."
2020-03-10 18:42,"I have worked from home for 19 years.
It’s important to rise like any other work day, dress, eat and then sit down and work.  Take a lunch break and stay focused. For me that means no music, no TV, no talk radio.  I behave as if I am in the office. My whole team is remote but everyone is accessible - accessibility and responsiveness are key."
2020-03-10 18:43,"No one size fits all. It is my business to be creative and innovative and I've been far more successful and happier at it since I started working remotely a few years ago. The ability to focus uninterrupted, and at will, and the productivity gains from simply not commuting to and from work alone are enormous. Add to that being able to clean, do laundry and pick up my kids from school whenever needed and the beauty and comfort of a nice home workspace, not to mention the impact on the environment, and you can understand why someone would never want to go back to working in a sterile office space afterwards. Of course some people would get lonely. But the kind of people that prefer to work with computers over messy humans with their quirks, antics and fraught relationships can only flourish from it. The only thing better would be to have a nice good looking robot play thing to joke with occasionally lol. Working from home is the best!"
2020-03-10 18:43,"If you work in an open office, creativity is not what you think it is.  The noise levels and movement make it hard to think. Huddle areas which are out in the open, don't cut it.

Actually no, you're not supposed to be doing anything about remote work, except making the choices that work for you and your team. Flexible work arrangements are about just that - flexibility, not making everyone rigidly adhere to one way of doing things. I find this frustrating about American work culture and suspect others may too; people and organizations' desire to dictate what works best for everyone. Maybe time we gave that a rest."
2020-03-10 18:44,"Much like anything, too much, too quickly is a recipe for discontent and poor results. We have constructed a culture around being present in a physical space for 8 hours a day, and most workers accept it and are acclimated to it, even if they acknowledge how draining and incompatible with modern life it can be.

Working from home, flexible hours, and above all, the elimination of the antiquated, Industrial Revolution-era notion of a 40-hour workweek just makes sense in the 21st century. 

However, those things take time to develop and cultivate in the broader culture. Employers and employees who have not accepted the possibility of having flexibility in the workplace, including working from home will naturally be resistant to change, especially if it is demanded overnight. This virus and the quarantine is a very sudden, and very rapid change in how workplaces operate, and I don't blame people for resisting it. It does bring about the bigger conversation we need to be having about work and life though, but it's sad that it takes a pandemic to start it."

My ideal schedule would be to lose myself in the intensive focus aspects of my work from 9pm-2am, sleep until 9 am, then be available for my occasional meetings as needed from 10am-5pm while I fill the rest of the time with errands, household chores, and an afternoon power nap.

Not having the stress and scrutiny and sense of feeling trapped in the drudgy routine of a long, unpleasant commute, of being trapped in an office, of feeling pressure to look/dress a certain way. If I want to be social or exchange ideas, it can be with people I actually want to be around. As such, I also recognize my privilege in being able to control my work environment. I would reserve my concern for the many, many people who MUST go to work, regardless of risk, in environments whose risk factor they cannot control."

Some of my remote activities are not just myself: I collaborate with colleagues from around the country/ world using technology. As an introvert, this is great for me.

I work out of an office once per week and spend about another day on average at various job sites. Work aside, I'm at my most creative in bed, at night. That's how it works for me.

All that said, I work with a team of people in multiple states and countries. Some of today's video-conferencing solutions are superb - great audio, stellar video, etc, etc. I'm fortunate to have a leg in the tech world, but one doesn't need to in order to make remote work successful for them.

I get far more accomplished three days a week at my dining room table - or a picnic table at the beach, if I’m so inclined - than I do during my two days in the office, each of which requires a three-hour round trip commute. Still, I adore my co-workers, and interacting with them in our highly social, too-cramped office is a highlight of my days there. For me, the mix - and the flexibility - is ideal and I consider myself lucky to have it, especially after having spent  20 years in a corporate cubicle."

I have worked from home most of my adult working career.  I usually work in whatever I’d have to go out in to meet a client or pop into an office. In the case of the coronavirus you may not need to do that but you still may need to have a work outfit to get work done. 

Uniforms set people up to get work done. Think of a fireman or cop - their uniforms are part of the utility to do there job. Can I work in sweatpants? Yes. But I better have shoes on or I’ll hit the couch on the way to the fridge. 

Not so many fridge trips, either. In fact, do some time blocking to stay working for a certain number of hours. Set work hours and let others know what they are so you are not  interrupted while working. 

I am way more productive at home than at the office. The office banter seems trivial to me - plus I can get that over the phone. When I’m having a hard time getting work done I define my work more. I sit with a pen and paper and write out exactly what my duties entail. Then I get to work."
2020-03-10 19:02,"WFH can be an occasional  stopgap and luxury for people on teams that have worked together and know each other. Working remotely with people you've never worked with and haven't even met will never work. But it will happen because like open floorplans, while totally inefficient, they save money on rent - and that is what shortsighted managers cherish."
2020-03-10 19:02,"good things in moderation -- working from home 1-2 days a week is ideal, and i can get a lot of work done that i otherwise would not get done in an office, and work late at night and at odd hours. But having done it 5 days a week i can start to get stir crazy and not eat lunch until 1:38 pm."
2020-03-10 19:04,"Office working, how I hate thee - let me count the ways.

Wasted time and gas commuting
Being surrounded by distracting chatter
Constant interruptions
No privacy
Too many tempting snacks and sweets

In order to concentrate I need a quiet environment - period.  Balancing several things in my brain at once requires concentration."
2020-03-10 19:04,"Kevin seems to be a victim of his age (and/or location?).  When I first came to California 30 years ago I tried to hire a good number of people to come to an office to accomplish creative work in advertising graphics and copywriting.  The number one reaction was ""I would be happy to work for (or with) you, but no one wants to come to an office. I work from home"".  And so we all did. At one time I had 30 plus ""associates""  producing wonderful, effective, client-winning and award -winning work.  All from home. I found that working from home was a total joy (especially watching my young daughter grow up along side of me)...even when Laura Sankey, the VP of Coors at the time,  showed up at my home office one morning and caught me in my PJ's.  But it was Laguna so we went to breakfast...and I did not bother changing clothes.  No one cared or thought it was odd.  In fact, there were a few others (mostly high schoolers wearing PJ's for a morning coffee).  The  others at the restaurant (Zinc) were wearing board shorts and/or swimming suits or work out clothes.  One woman was wearing a dress.  At least I thought it was a woman.   One guy had his parrot with him. At least I thought it was with him."
2020-03-10 19:06,"If you are, ""writing this from the makeshift quarantine bunker in my (the) dining room — sweatpants on, hand sanitizer nearby, snacking my (your) way through emergency rations"" then you are doing the WFH thing completely wrong. I've been WFH for >18 years and a few things are vitally important: 1) an actual office space in your home with a door that closes and a desk, etc. Or, if you live alone, a dedicated work space that is NOT your coffee table, dining table or otherwise multi-use; 2) you must get up and be to work on time, having showered and dressed, every day -- NO SWEATPANTS, EVER. [shorts, yes. but with a collared shirt for video conferencing]; 3) plenty of internet bandwidth and a work computer with full sized monitor(s) and a VoIP desk phone system, so you can actually work remotely and get work accomplished [no laptop and a cell phone; that's working on vacation stuff]; and finally, the emotional maturity to perform the aforementioned (sorry millennial's). Note: screaming children, spouses, significant others who have access without a door or where no door is available, need not apply."
2020-03-10 19:06,"So is losing some creativity (whatever that means) for a couple weeks is so much worse than helping contain a virus, that is highly severe in older folks?"
2020-03-10 19:08,"Well, for starters, there is no ""silver lining"" to coronavirus.  Mullenweg is completely tone deaf on that one.  And isolation is good for no one.  I once worked remotely when covering a state legislature but purposefully spent my days in offices shared by various papers.  To be creative, people need people."
2020-03-10 19:09,"I've done both, and am now back to spending most of my time at the office.  My bosses are old-school, and I am certain that being on site has helped both my salary and career growth.  I am seen as being more dedicated to my job and the company.  What's strange is that I actually worked harder when I was out of the office, but somehow my contributions are more valued now."
2020-03-10 19:11,"As an IT person the productivity is higher from home on a given task. In any case trying to talk to my coworkers was an interruption to them. We all IMd in the office even sitting next to each other. That way we could include links and screenshots. 
Only reason to be in the office was a project kickoff or sales celebration. And even then most didn’t attend. 
I loved it and I’m a boomer."
2020-03-10 19:11,"I love working at home.  No traffic hassles, dress code requirements and not having to engage in office politics is a win win situation."
2020-03-10 19:11,"Until fairly recently, I had a work-from-home job.  I can relate to much of what this author has experienced: for all of the nice things, I desperately missed the contact with other humans and I believe the lack of that contact affected my work (in exactly the ways identified by Steve Jobs).

That said, it’s great to be able to do it some, and I think the average of 1.5 days per week cited as ideal by one executive in this article is spot on.  There are one or two days per week that I’m working on a big project completely by myself and it would be ideal to eliminate the commute (and wear jeans, etc.) on those days.  I hope that will become the norm: 3-4 days in the office plus 1-2 days working from home."
2020-03-10 19:12,"It's obviously a personality thing. I'd be happy to always work from home. More extroverted, social people feel trapped at home.

But almost everyone has plenty of work that can be done from home very well, so there should be a healthy mix. I'd love to work 3-4 days a week from home and 1-2 days in the office. It would also save a lot of time on the commute, and relieve overburdened streets, subways etc from the avoidable traffic."
2020-03-10 19:13,They are wrong.  Did Einstein have meetings to figure out relativity?  Artists do not collaborate on their art.  Creativity is a personal pursuit.
2020-03-10 19:18,Not everyone thrives in a busy office with lots of other people.  The authors seems to fall into the typical thinking a lot of managers do which is the every employee is an extrovert that thrives busy work places and that being around people increases creativity and problem solving.   When in reality it's the opposite.
2020-03-10 19:18,"Like most things, WFH works for some people and not for others. I've been doing it for 15 years after 20 in typical office settings. My last 7 years have been freelance (I'm a copywriter). I've never met most of my clients; some I've never even spoken to by phone. But I make good money and get a lot done, with more work-life balance than I ever had going into an office. I don't think I could do it if I lived in a suburban or rural community; I would feel more isolated if I didn't see people frequently. I have dogs and walk them at least 2x a day, partly just to get outside and see people. Are there some things I miss? Sure. But on balance, it's been a great life for me and one I hope I can continue."
2020-03-10 19:19,"I'm surprised more was not made of the environmental benefits of WFH. 

My last school was outside of DC; many colleagues had spouses who worked in the city. To get there, you had to traverse Georgetown Pike. Because it's a historic site there are no shoulders. If a car broke down, the traffic jam could last hours. 

A friend who worked for the State Dept stayed home to care for his infant daughter; when he noticed how much more productive he was and eager to be dad, he asked his boss if he might try working a few days from home. Nope. Even though he  had demonstrated that he was doing more work faster, his boss wouldn't okay it. 

Despite overwhelming evidence that productivity goes up, that cars are kept off the road, that parking is therefore easier for those who must commute, etc. businesses will not adopt this model for a simple reason: They don't trust their employees. There is a power imbalance at work in too many places and no one has the honesty to call it out. It's feudal in intent and execution.

Now layer in how abysmal the modern workplace has become. Who are we kidding? The moment I saw open floor plans with many cubicles crammed into a few square feet I knew we'd lost our minds. A recent study demonstrated that every interruption when someone is deeply into ""flow"" takes 25 minutes to recover from. Now do the math for how many times that happens a day. 

WFH is a win win win. It should be actively encouraged whenever possible. We can't even do the easy things."
2020-03-10 19:22,"Simply put, I disagree with Mr. Roose.
I work from home unless I absolutely have to be in the office for an issue which will not resolve remotely.  The time saved is considerable (7 hours/week), my outlook on life is better as I do have to deal with ubiquitous phone involved drivers, and my creativity has not seemed to suffer.
I don't need the external validation that comes from being in an office environment.  I just need to get the job done for which I'm being paid.  That happens more easily when I'm at home."
2020-03-10 19:23,"I find that the collaboration that occurs from working at the office is very beneficial, but I have had some of my most creative moments when working from home; perhaps I think more freely while barefoot, and in the comfort of sweatpants and t-shirt."
2020-03-10 19:23,"The short version: Some years ago, I worked at home for a few years. It made me nuts."
2020-03-10 19:24,Creativity is hardly the issue. Containing this deadly disease is.
2020-03-10 19:24,"Working from home is all very well for those who can. No one appears to be offering a thought for, or assistance to, those who can't, or who don't get paid if they don't work and have no sick days, or are self-employed of have small businesses. The consequences of long-term quarantines will affect millions and may cause many to lose jobs, homes and indeed their lives - not from the virus but from the despair they will be unable to overcome."
2020-03-10 19:30,"Commuting stress to sit in cube next to folks they don't really care about-that's the norm. 
If companies even mandated one day a week as remote work, thats 20 percent reduction in commuting, traffic, stress. Perhaps workers may even start to enjoy working together again."
2020-03-10 19:32,"Why does it have to be an all-or-nothing decision? I've done it all -- full time office, full time home, and a mix. By far, the best arrangement is a mix -- 3 days in/2 days out or vis versa. You get the best of both worlds, enhanced creativity and productivity, and don't feel isolated."
2020-03-10 19:34,"If I hear the word ""collaboration"" one more time, I'll go insane. My job does not lend itself to collaboration. I have to research difficult commercial insurance policies to suss out coverage. It is an intense activity requiring quiet and concentration--not shouting ideas around with co-workers. It's not sales and it's not innovative/creative. I vastly prefer to work from home to do it. At the office, I am constantly interrupted, then have to re-orient to figure out where I was in the process.  I have to make sure to take care of myself by reminding myself to go out and interact with people (it's easy to trap yourself into being isolated). That's a relatively easy fix. In short: just because your job, Mr. Roose, may be enhanced by a ""bullpen"" setting, that doesn't mean that the rest of us need it. (there are also the matters of the hours spent commuting and the spread of disease, but those have been covered)."
2020-03-10 19:36,"I've worked from home for 11 years and previously 17 years in an office environment. I agree with arguments on both sides. For deep thought, isolated type assignments WFH was the best for me but collaborating with others is also very beneficial. Some of my best work came from impromptu meetings in the hallway.  WFH has one major drawback and it is many times you are not kept in the loop when there is new information or changes. I believe the best combination is working from home a few days a week and the rest of the time in the office."
2020-03-10 19:36,"Nonsense. I have been working at home for a decade. Created a company that serves clients all over the world — Singapore to Frankfurt in any given month. We have a senior team. We reach out when we need to collaborate. We work independently at home or in hotels for long Periods of time. 

No creativity sacrificed. 

I still prefer the Big Recommendations meeting to be done live, face-to-face uniting a team from all over the world, but that’s sometimes not possible. In the end, there is very little that you can’t do currently remotely that you can do face-to-face.￼￼

I would never go back to a commute and a fixed office if I could avoid it."
2020-03-10 19:36,"Part of the allure of working at home is the dream “corner office”—your own bathroom, a kitchen, a nice yard, maybe even a “comfort dog” to tend to your anxieties. But these things can provide distractions that can eat into your productivity. So at the end of your “work day” you may have taken the dog for a walk, thrown a few loads of wash in, and “accomplished” a bunch of other non-work things, yet possibly have gotten a discouragingly small amount of actual work done.

In my work-from-home career I hit a crisis where I found I wasn’t cranking out enough billable hours, even though I had the work, and all I needed to do to get paid was to do it. Part of my solution was to faithfully log 100% of my time, not just what was billable. This gave me some “analytics” to get my work day up to almost eight hours, which isn’t as easy as it sounds. This also made me feel OK about taking a well-deserved break.

I agree that in general the traditional office provides a higher quality of badly-needed human interaction. But gathering people into the office only to lock each in their cubicle with their computer kind of defeats the purpose of having them come in. So employers are attacking this problem by redoing the office with more open work spaces and what I would call “coffeeshopification.”

Note also that working at home doesn’t have to be all or nothing. One huge advance in the modern work place is cool employers who give their people the option to say, “I’m working from home today.”"
2020-03-10 19:36,"Self-confessed introvert here.  But I do find that the proximity to others in the workplace makes way for a synergy I can't feel from home.  1-2 days of remote work a week is definitely advantageous for focused work, but I feel that a group of colleagues in a room, or a bump-into in the cafeteria or pantry provides another level of familiarity that allows for a freer flow of ideas."
2020-03-10 19:39,"I started a virtual tech company 25+ years ago betting that the internet and collaboration tools would arrive to bring this bet to life. Fast-forward and now we have a culture of 50 who are very comfortable and productive working from home. 

However, what we've found is that WFH is not for everyone. You have to have the inner fortitude, great (and I mean great) communication skills, self-starters with curiosity, and a team-based attitude to be successful. If you need the water cooler or office 'surroundings' to be productive, then WFH is not for you. Yes, it can be lonely at times and I encourage my staff to take breaks, spend time with their families, go on errands, etc. as long as they meet their objectives. 

They are empowered to define their day. And with great power comes great responsibility."
2020-03-10 19:40,"Different strokes for different folks.  I'm not extroverted, nor particularly introverted either.  When I need to brainstorm Skype is fine, or Teams, whichever, the internet lets us do that now. I get to not drive 43 miles for 90 minutes in my Prius listening to the preternatural ramblings of radio threesomes. I get to sleep an extra 1/2 hour.  I work in my pajamas with my dog sleeping next to me. I like most of my coworkers, but mostly not more than my dog.  The occasional face to face is needed, sure, just like with my coworkers in other states and countries. As the tweet my daughter shared says ""I guess we're about to find out which meetings could've been e-mails after all…"""
2020-03-10 19:40,"I have to absolutely disagree with this. This article put too much emphasis on the creativity boost from working in the same same, but at what cost?

Being a tech worker in the bay area which is the technology center of the states, if not the world. I have to absolutely denounce large campuses and requiring employees to work in the same space.

I am talking about the mental stress of commuting. The traffic here is the bay area is ridiculous and a one-way commute of 2+ hours is not unheard of (the director of my organization does it). I spend 10% of life everyday in a vehicle. By the time I get to work I am already exhausted, let alone being creative.

This comes also at a cost of environment pollution and social problems. The real estate around the few tech centers (like Mountain View) is astronomical and created huge problems for homelessness.

I honestly think the creativity argument is overrated. A lot of work happening in this sector is already highly decentralized. I spend 1/4 of my office time doing video conference with remote offices anyway. Even coworker in a building across the street is going to VC with me.

The reality in my sector is there is a lot of collaborations outside of the organization. A lot of important projects have contributions around the world.

Instead of investing into real estate and big campuses which only benefits land owners, companies should instead invest into making remote work efficient. I think this is much more beneficial for our future."
2020-03-10 19:41,"I've been working from home full-time since 2016, and love it. I'm immunocompromised, so not being sick on a regular basis is great. I don't think it's a big deal to interact face-to-face, particularly when I am interacting daily over email, IM, and Skype.

Maybe it makes a difference if you're not exactly the most popular person around, or not the most attractive, or older...etc. My annual reviews have never been better, and I credit some of that to not being stereotyped by my appearance."
2020-03-10 19:41,"As a very introverted person - I need the office, otherwise I might never see another human being. I've always found working from home highly inconvenient and it blurs the line between home and work. I like to leave it all behind at the end of the day. 

It doesn't have to be all or nothing - blended plans seem to work better than all one way or the other and of course knowing you have the option is nice in case of long term illness, child care issues, etc."
2020-03-10 19:41,"I've now worked longer remotely for my current company than I worked in the office. It was the best decision I ever made.

I would not go back to working in an office environment, under any circumstances."
2020-03-10 19:42,"Face to face time is absolutely important for building relationships, and can certainly foster creativity. It's not the only way. I've worked from home for 20 years - as a creative - and find no lack of sources to fuel that. If you're an extrovert and you need to work in an office in a team, great, do that; but don't try to fit workers into that box. It doesn't fit.

Also: the reason companies have snacks at the office? It ain't to help create those little serendipitous conversations that spark an idea. It's because companies have learned that providing food on-campus means workers are less likely to leave for a lunch break. It's a pure productivity play.

Nice try, tho."
2020-03-10 19:46,"Technology was suppose to allow people to work from home. Increase productivity  reduce our carbon footprint. 

That was the technology mantra years ago , now we have the Coronavirus and everyone is acting that we are not prepared to work from home, we are not prepared for anything we have technology but we have gone backwards

School system were suppose to have curriculum on line per Apple and the innovation of charters and now we find out that we don’t even have internet connectivity in certain zip codes 

 Look we were supposed to have rural hospitals not close them but have doctors work remotely via technology  to address patients well that doesn’t seem to be working very well.
 
As usual Madison Avenue marketing is more fluid than our reality of process and implementation. If we actually did what Madison Avenue said we did there would be no issue with working from home

I don't think I could."
2020-03-10 19:48,"I’ve worked in both remote and non-remote settings and far prefer working remotely. I find that I am much, much more productive as I am interrupted much less throughout the day. I make an effort to spend time with people (friends and coworkers whom I like) outside of the office, but no longer have to spend hours per week on silly small talk like “what are you doing this weekend?” and “how was your weekend?” I also find the flexibility amazing. I love getting up and tackling several hours of work and then doing to do some exercise.

Are the conference calls annoying? Sure. Do I miss going into the office. Absolutely not. Would never go back to going in five days a week."

2020-03-10 19:55,"I have a different experience.  When going the office, for me, it's ""Did you fill out this project sheet"", ""What about that training requirement"", ""Please attend the Town Hall meeting"" - it's pretty close to 100% overhead - friction generated by an overstaffed institution where many requirements are generated by the bureaucracy rather than by the end-product job.  No thanks - at home I can work full time, concentrate, be productive, get things done, finish my projects.  Even before telecommuting was common, I'd have to do my work at home after wasting most of the day in the office.  If you are self-oriented to work accomplishments you might eventually realize that office attendance and its associated make-work is wasting what time you have in life and subtracting from your achievements."
2020-03-10 19:56,"Totally depends on what you do, what your company focuses on, the culture of the company, commutes and what the physical environment of the workplace is. I work from home one or two days a week and it is bliss. The massive company I work for put thousands of us in cruise ship-like dining hall spaces a few years ago and it’s a nightmare. We are shoulder-to-shoulder and contend with ubiquitous noise distractions. I quite literally get twice as much done when working at home. 

I do agree that for collaboration and creativity purposes, meetings and in-person meetings are key. In my industry, 3-4 days in the office is MORE than enough to get what’s needed in those areas done based on what we do/I do."
2020-03-10 19:58,"I could not disagree more strongly - I love the long stretches of uninterrupted thought, where I can spend time to read and pursue idea development in consecutive time.  Working from home does not mean you are on a deserted island.  It means you don't get interrupted unless and until you want to be interrupted.  By reducing the number of interruptions, each of my projects can progress in bigger blocks per day, which in turn generates more thoughtful input from others simply because each idea is fleshed out.   Contrary to the author, I find impromptu meetings tend to generate mindless banter about recent events whereas scheduled meetings usually follow an agenda, so a ton gets done and small talk is minimized.  That can be tough on people who thrive on comparing their favorite professional sports, or whatever entertainment just happened.
We are all so connected anyway that a meeting is as easy as reaching your apps on your phone."

I feel bad for folks who feel compelled to work in a group, although I totally get that these folks are entitled to their own preferences."
2020-03-10 18:50,"Roose states: ""Most people should work in an office""

And what does ""working in an office"" entail in the year 2020?

1. It entails contributing obscene amounts of pollution to the atmosphere via cars, trucks, buses, trains and planes.

2. Due to point #1, ""working in an office"" therefore makes addressing CO2 emissions that much more difficult to achieve.

3. ""Working in an office"" entails ignoring the technology that has taken over office spaces over the last 20 years. Technology like computers, the internet, phones, web-meetings, skype, etc, etc, etc. 

4. ""Working in an office"" entails sitting in front of your office computer...doing the exact same tasks you could be doing from a computer at your home.

5. ""Working in an office"" does however provide those added joys of interacting with annoying, incompetent, mean, irritable, arrogant co-workers.

Conclusion: Roose has no interest in addressing CO2 emissions...and most likely fits one of the descriptors in point #5."

Not.

It's all very lovely, these comments. You all should consider yourselves privileged. Working at home is great as long as there are people manning the shops, delivering the boxes and polishing the infrastructure to keep you happy/unhappy working at home.

No thank you! 

The key to working from home is establishing your office whether it be a room, a space or a desk. Have everything an office needs (printer, fax, paper, supplies, good internet, good computer). Set work limits (get up when you are done for the day). 
Set up lunch and coffee dates with people you WANT to spend time with or people whom you need to meet with.
Read interesting articles. Go to conferences or seminars when you want to learn. Don't shy away from going to a meeting in person if its better to do so and not just because you can stay at your desk.

2020-03-10 19:09,"I spend a fair amount of time in Silicon Beach in LA where many of the tech crowd supposedly work from home on Fridays.

So why are the roads extra busy on Fridays?  Why are all the restaurants so crowded on Fridays?  

Aren't all these people supposed to be hard at work at home?

C'mon, let's be honest here.  The whole Friday work at home thing of the gig economy is really a back-door adoption of a four-day workweek.

During this health crisis, these people aren't working at home.  They're out there at Costco buying up all the toilet paper!"
2020-03-10 19:03,I'm going to bet you aren't nearly as productive as you think at the office though you may enjoy it more if you are really extroverted.

It's a tremendous tackle to computers, internet, AI and everything! You are telling us that we should go back to join together and solve problems together like 50 years ago.
What about if you think that you live just only one time ? I know that it is an old fashioned quote, but maybe more time in reasoning about you, what you are doing, how much is an absolute lost of time to loose your time in not useful meetings just for giving someone that you consider stupid, a sympathetic ""like"", is better."

I tend to think I have the work from home personality where I can balance work with house chores and exercise. And with VC calls and meetings I get the face to face then. My wife on the other hand is the one who works from home but probably shouldn't as she's more social and has trouble pulling herself away from the computer after 6pm (she starts at 8am)."

2020-03-10 20:11,"This seems to be yet another article written by or for the water-cooler people. You know these people. 
They're never at their desk, consistently chattering, and immensely unproductive. I don't go to work to make friends and socialize and sit in meetings all day. I go to work to accomplish things. You can easily have face to face meetings remotely and the creativity flies as it would in-office. I agree that remote work is not for everyone and particularly not for people who have trouble separating work from home life. However this article doesn't seem to be about those people. This article seems to be about the people who crave attention and for whom work is just a necessary evil to get that interaction and attention. If you can't do your work in sweatpants and you can't focus when you're at home I'm willing to bet you also have trouble focusing at the office. The difference is that there's plenty of other people there like you to hide it. Meanwhile the rest of us working remote are busy getting work done."
2020-03-10 20:17,"I’ve been working for home for 15 years and every time I have to go into the home office (approximately once a year) I wonder how they get anything done.

And days missed due to illness in the last year?  Zero."
2020-03-10 20:17,"I've been working at home for the past 6 days and its really getting to me.

2020-03-10 20:22,"""Mr. Bock... said ...balancing office work with remote work is ideal.""
That's been my experience. I can often work from home and do so frequently. I can indeed by more productive that way. But after a few days of that, I get bored and need some direct human interaction. 

The present reality is, however, those of us who can should work from home as much as possible for the sake of everyone's health.

P.S. If you are isolated at home, what the point of hand sanitizer? The only germs around are your own!"
2020-03-10 20:23,"Oh grow up, do!

You don't need to be in an office or a glammed up micro-kitchen to be creative. You need merely to open your mind to possibilities.

What you seem to be missing is social interaction - a valuable thing, but it should not be mistaken for true genius creativity.

True creative geniuses rarely work in environments that ultimately require conformity, teamwork and strict adherence to a narrow set of social behaviors and values.

Generally, the work product of true creatives is hanging in art museums, a object to wonder at in a city (extraordinary architecture or amazing public art such as the Vietnam Memorial) or found on a bookshelf - great literature.

As for social interaction, isn't it tech that virtually eliminated the need for face to face encounters to accomplish great things?"
2020-03-10 20:23,"I have worked from home 2-3 days per week for most of my career.  Sometimes, if I don't have interpersonal contact it gets to me, but mostly I love it, especially since I have on-site time the rest of the week.

The way to make it work is to have a schedule, really.  You can make the structure.  And sometimes--taking yourself to a coffee shop--is just what you need."
2020-03-10 20:24,"Given the opportunity, I'm a fan of a healthy balance of work from home and work in the office. There are pros and cons for both types. While I find I accomplish more at home and work longer hours, I also find some people think working from home means I'm more available. Working in the office certainly provides the work environment but it can be distracting with the casual interactions as well as restlessness that comes with sitting at a desk. I do think for those who can work from home, times like these are where it is best applied."
2020-03-10 20:27,"Having done both, I prefer remote work, but only because getting an actual office these days is so rare.  My preference would be a nice office to myself, which used to be the norm for legal work. Inhouse legal teams are forced into open seating these days like all other departments, even though the work requires intense focus.  I am up for a rare remote position right now with a global company and reading this story helped me realize how much I want that again.  However, I am decades into my career and no doubt reaped a huge benefit from working in firms.  Technology has made remote work a greater opportunity for older employees, ironically, who don't need anymore training.

I worked from home for a year before and found it is best to shower and wear work clothes everyday to keep a separate professional identity from my personal home life.  Most days I attended church at noon or went out to lunch and then ""went back to work"".  I had no problem sitting for 8 hours at my computer and often had to force myself to eat or take a break."
2020-03-10 20:32,"The day I must work in an office again is the day I retire. After years working in variations on cubicle, office, and God-forbid “open” communal spaces, I am blessed to be alone to structure my day for productivity. Email, IM, and occasional calls are all I need to be synergistic, creative, or whatever buzzword you want to apply."
2020-03-10 20:35,"I teleworked full time for the final eight years of my career, and loved it. I'm an introvert whose work involved periods of intense concentration involving technical documents for a national program. My colleagues worked all over the USA; we only met face-to-face a few times a year anyway, conducting our routine duties via conference calls and email. For me, not having to drive downtown to sit in a cube,  and being constantly interrupted by other employees who did not work directly with me, was a godsend.

I'm pretty good at setting physical and temporal work boundaries, but on days when I needed to put in extra time, it was far easier to have everything at home with me than to go in to the office over a weekend or work late and drive home even later.

As for experiencing compassion, a sense of connection to others, etc., I am far more likely to find these human traits within myself when I am not stressed out.  Daily insight meditation facilitates this, too.

I suspect the differences among those who find telework too isolating and those who thrive with it have a lot to do with extroversion v introversion. Like those on the autism spectrum, many introverts are highly sensistive to sound, light, vibration, etc. We probably use up lots more energy trying to screen these stimuli out while trying to get our work done than extroverts do (or maybe extroverts consider mere interaction to be productive?). The controlled environment of my child-free home is perfect for me."
2020-03-10 20:35,"Having the ability to work from home is a godsend for parents to young children like me. I agree, however, that some time in the office is usually helpful. The answer, as always, is balance. I spend two days at home, and three (shortened) days in the office. As a result, I love my work more than ever, and I feel connected to my young daughters. I am loyal to my employer and unless I find a ""better deal"" elsewhere, I will be committed to my company as they give me the flexibility I need."
2020-03-10 20:41,"Did this fellow suggest that people working from home can't be creative? Has he never heard of an artist's home studio, writing desk, composing room? Next to the internet, other people are the biggest distraction from sustained creative work. Sure collaboration is necessary to fit pieces of a puzzle together but for raw creative power, better to be locked away in self-quarantine with caffeine or whatever fuels your engine."
2020-03-10 20:44,"A lot of different opinions in the comments section. I like to WFH when there is a blizzard on the way or if I need to fly that day.
Having an office makes it a lot easier for me to switch from work to home life.
I've been a software developer since the 1980's, and really have only had the option to WFH about once a week (official policy)"
2020-03-10 20:45,"I’ve been working from home for 15 years and have been involved in launching multi million dollar companies with other people (also working from home). There are a myriad of communication channels that enable sharing and co-creativity among people and teams. No wasted commuting time, no high office overheads, flexibility, freedom, self discipline, the benefits are many. As to the myth of the office creative environment and the oh so tired “Steve Jobs said...” justification: so old school, sorry."
2020-03-10 20:45,"I work with people on three continents all of whom are working in home offices. We all get things done and have gotten to know each other but have never met face to face. It is seamless and with mutual respect I never experienced in an office, particularly since I am the only woman in the group. The secret is all have impeccable manners and ability to work without excessive supervision. Offices breed negativity rather than outcome and tend to have a boss with a need for unnecessary demonstrated power."
2020-03-10 20:46,"The key is this:  explaining your idea(s) to someone else, out loud, is itself a creative act that stimulates more brain connections, as does the reaction of the person listening to your explanation, their questions, comments, and facial expressions.  Such face-to-face interaction is essential to creativity (for artists the equivalent is looking at other people's art and for musicians the equivalent is listening to other people's music.)  We all need to balance face to face with the deep internal work time. It is not one or the other."
2020-03-10 20:46,"This is more of an opinion piece, and should be titled ""Working From Home Is Not For Me (Your Mileage May Vary)"" -- I've been working from home for the past 18 months, after years of commuting to office jobs. I don't miss much about being in the office, and I miss nothing about the commute. Yes, there are times when I have the urge to strike up a conversation with a colleague, and I'm sure I miss out on opportunities to learn through casual conversation. But given the peace and calm that is such a huge part of my work-from-home life, it's hard to imagine going back (your mileage may vary)."
2020-03-10 20:48,"It depends on the job. I commuted to work for a corporate job for 7 years and found I had little in-person interaction during that time and communication revolved around messenger and emails. There weren’t really any brainstorms or spontaneous meetings to speak of. 

Now I work remotely for the past year and find I have more verbal interaction through video conferencing. I don’t miss the commute of 45 minutes one way which was soul-crushing and not environmentally friendly. However, I agree that my work life balance has gone out the window."
2020-03-10 20:50,"It doesn't have to be all or nothing. Personally, I like a mix. My ideal is work from home Mondays & Fridays, and be in the office Tuesday through Thursday. At least one day per week of working from home is fantastic for clearing the inbox & doing solo work like writing."
2020-03-10 20:50,"It's funny, as an introvert of 50 years I prefer to be in-office because it's healthier for me. I get to be social and productive in a structured environment. If I worked from home, i'd probably never see anyone but the Amazon delivery person."
2020-03-10 20:51,"For me, and the last 10 years of my 30-year corporate career, working from home was heaven.  I am an introvert and hated the time wasted in small talk in the office, having to avoid certain people I didn't like or respect, and trying to stay focused with constant interruptions or feeling the need to be sociable when I wasn't feeling it.  I am self-directed and essentially created my own position so I knew full well what had to be done each day.  I still attended group meetings and traveled to the team, but at that point I had nothing to prove and was never challenged because I still did what needed doing, without oversight.  The only drawback for me was having the occasional business visitor in and having to make a 'conference room' out of the kitchen table."
2020-03-10 20:52,IMO There is a lack of accountability working from home. Just because your connected to the VPN doesn't mean your working. Collaboration often makes a difference and too many people don't have the ability to effectively communicate. Also the self motivating aspect of the office is a good thing. Very few can really be productive long term working alone.
2020-03-10 20:52,"Whatever, my friend. Most people (including me) are not working at jobs that prioritize creativity. In fact, my job, which requires the application of legal code requirements into fair and impartial documentation, could be said to be the antithesis of creativity for a very good reason. Having worked both at home and in a traditional cubicle setup, I can tell you that quiet, freedom from of interruption and lack of toxic office behaviors contributes enormously to my own productivity and happiness. Unfortunately, most old-time supervisors are still stuck in the ""butts in seats"" mode and think a desire to work from home is equivalent to a desire to goof off at the company's expense."
2020-03-10 20:53,"Wow, the comments here definitely skew towards remote work... but I was offered a remote position last year and turned it down.

Personally, I find there are more distractions at home than the office and I'm more productive there. Even though I'd self-describe as an introvert, I still recognize my need for relationships and couldn't imagine not seeing people on a daily basis.

And, since I handle recruitment for an educational program, I find being on campus helps my outreach efforts so much more-running into our educators and coworkers gives me anecdotes and other info that isn't in our print materials. I feel so much of that would be lost if I were to leave the epicenter of our programs. It's not so much creativity, but a better understanding of the big picture that is essential to my work."
2020-03-10 20:57,"When I have worked remotely in the past, the two-and-a-half hours I don't spend on the subway gives me more time to connect with other people, not less.  Living in an urban neighborhood, I have plenty of opportunities to connect with other people."
2020-03-10 20:59,I don't know about y'all but I am absolutely NOT a homebody and I know I would go completely crazy if I lost that reason to get out of the house. Imagine the psychological damage of never being able to clock out and leave work in a different place than where you go to seek refuge and relax.
2020-03-10 21:04,"I think there's a balance of home office and work office that hits a sweet spot of convenience, productivity, creativity....etc.   In my world, that's 3 days home, 2 days commuting to work.   However, if my commute was less than 1/2 hour, I suspect I would prefer a bit more onsite and a bit less home.     Wasting 1 1/2 hours each way on a commuter train can flavor your opinion here."
2020-03-10 21:05,"This is spot on. Full time working from home is quite an adjustment... it’s a balance... sure there is the greater productivity, no commute, household chore flexibility but there is isolation even with all the virtual conference tools, the ability to constantly snack (I am a consistent 10 lbs heavier WFH over 4 years than before), camaraderie. 

I believe it is a balance of some office time and some WFH."
2020-03-10 21:06,"I've never understood why the ultimate goal of everything was to not leave the house. Amazon, Fresh Direct, Blue Apron, Dominoes, working from home, etc. What is so awful about leaving the house every once in a while? I think the idea situation is to work in an office Mon-Thurs, and WFH on Fridays. I worked for an advertising agency that had this policy and it was great. You got all of the serendipitous creativity that Steve Jobs espoused, and you got an extra day home to go for a run, do some errands etc. in addition to any work that needed to be done."
2020-03-10 21:06,"I teach at an international school in Beijing; we've been online for six weeks now, and still don't know when school will reopen.  As a tech geek with introvert tendencies, I thought I'd love working from home And I did for the first week.  The isolation grows old quickly, however.  Zoom chats help connect, but they're no substitute for the  face to face interactions, the random meet-up-in-the-hallway discussions that spark ideas. Just being in that environment creates motivation.  We've found it gets harder and harder with each week for students and teachers both to stay on track. Teachers and students are spread around the globe, and there's a lot of effort in just keeping track of students and ensuring they're not falling behind--though many of them are.  It's given me quite a bit of insight into the flaws behind all the ""who needs school when you have Khan Academy"" arguments;  believe me--we need schools!"
2020-03-10 21:08,"Not only is working from home much better for the environment (due to fewer miles being driven), it is much more cost-efficient. 

People with young children do not need to pay for childcare, and companies do not need to waste money paying for unneeded office space."
2020-03-10 21:10,"A little over a year ago, my company moved to new open offices, so I lost my own office. And the new building is farther from home, so my commute is now between an hour and 15 mins and two hours each way depending on traffic. That requires over two hours commuting each day. If I couldn’t work from home at least two days a week I don’t think I can cope. On the plus side I do find it I enjoy being in the office and interacting with people more than I did when I went in the five every day. It’s a nice balance."
2020-03-10 21:12,"Did this article actually say anything?

“It’s a very personal decision that works for some and doesn’t work for others. Some people are more productive and happy and find other ways to get social contact if they work from home. And some people aren’t happy working alone.”

Why was anything else needed? It doesn’t really go into any specifics, like the kinds of jobs or companies that do or don’t lend themselves to home offices, the kinds of people, etc. How about some examples of great epiphanies that couldn’t have happened in a home office? I hope this article isn’t an indication of what Mr. Roose’s book will be like.

I had a wonderful home office job for almost 9 years. Everyone in the company was “virtual.” We conferenced a lot—far too much for my taste, in fact. And I’m not anti-social. I am still close friends with many co-workers from past office jobs (I even married one!). But I was in sales, “highly leveraged,” as they say, and thus highly motivated and in a sense pretty much working for myself. So I loved being left alone to get my job done. And I hardly ever wore sweat pants all day."
2020-03-10 21:15,"I've worked from home--at a professional job for a large company, with a six figure income--for over ten years. As an lifelong introvert, it works for me. The tipping point for me was attempting for two years to work in my employer's open-plan office, which, as the author points out, is truly horrific for anyone who actually has to focus on their work.

And 35 years of work experience tells me I've been far more creative on my own than when being surrounded by indifferent co-workers."
2020-03-10 21:15,"I'm an introvert (ISTJ) and unlike some others I absolutely hate working at home. Home is too comfortable to focus and I don't like bringing work-related stress into my house, where I have nowhere to escape from it.

Walt Disney originally designed the Magic Kingdom in Florida to be separated from the main parking lot by a lake so that people left the real world behind and traveled across the lake (or around by monorail) to get to a distant land. For me, going home from the office is like going to a distant land."
2020-03-10 20:24,"If you're seasoned--sure working at home is fantastic if you have all the software, networks you need.

Show some respect for yourself and what you do for a living!"
2020-03-10 21:17,"Buy, beg or borrow a copy of Managing Telework. The principles of success for both employer and remote worker are covered there. 

First, not all, people have jobs, and some do not have personalities, suitable for teleworking. Second, teleworking  is not a full-time option for most; a certain amount of regular face-to-face interaction is needed, commuting trauma notwithstanding. Third, most teleworkers feel more creative as well as more productive as a result of their teleworking; objective measures back this up.

To put it simply, face-to-face (f2f) time is for periods of uncertainty, such as getting a new project organized. Remote working time is for periods when actual work must be done. For most situations the f2f part is the smallest."
2020-03-10 21:19,"I'm on my 12th year working from home for a 300+ person, globally distributed company. Approx 60% of us work from home across 30 countries.

Prior to that I worked in various offices (open concept) for about 11 years and hated it.

I do some training for our new employees on coping with working from home. Once can combat the lonliness by making a plan to do so. After work, many days, I go out and be with people. 
Unlike in an office, I get to choose who they are. 

I will never work in an office (full time) again. The constant noise and distractions, commute, costs associated with commuting and parking, and lunches out... no thanks.

I also think working from home is healthier and gives me better balance. Due to time zone differences and sometiems workload, I can easily break up my day, with some downtime mid day to exercise, take a nap or even read for pleasure. 

I know working from home isn't for everyone but I think its for a lot more people than the author implies."
2020-03-10 21:20,"There are extroverts as introverts and not all working environments are equal or alike. Creativity is not usually associated with teamwork but isolation yet times change of course.

2020-03-10 21:22,"I fought so hard to be able to work from home (1 day per week!) At the time, I was the only mom who did it, and the only employee in my department who did it, so I ensured that I was always available and always producing on that day. I still dealt with so much blowback for it! Now I suppose I wince when I see it described as 'overrated' when it's such a game-changer for folks who need it and work so hard to keep it."

I've managed to make it work and love the flexibility, especially when my children were younger."
2020-03-10 21:28,"Amen. I've worked from home for 19 of my career's 23 years. While I wouldn't trade the flexibility I've enjoyed, it has definitely come at a price. My life has perhaps been better rounded, overall --- in fact, it almost certainly has --- but I do think that my career has suffered. Creativity suffers, indeed. No one person can have all the best insights and ideas, and great and valuable creative ferment comes from regularly bouncing even partial, small ideas off colleagues.

It is true (if surprising) that one tends to waste less time at home. I always noticed how much time (some) folks absolutely send down the drain in (some) offices.

For my part, moreover, I'm gregarious and have just plain old missed being around people. My social skills have probably even been blunted somewhat. On the other hand, I've generally avoided seasonal bugs and the permanent threat of picking up the latest, hideous corporate-speak. (I've managed never to ""utilize"" anything that I can just ""use,"" for example, and have done nothing ""per"" anyone's direction. ;-))

Our Team is close knit, we come together to manage projects and support each other.

I love not having to spend money on:
Daily eat in or out lunches.
Clothes to impress or follow dress code.
Makeup and hair to make others feel comfortable because women and men don't like seeing another women who is not done up.

Working remote allows me to slowly start the day with an hour morning meditation and in a peaceful healthy way."
2020-03-10 21:31,"Speak for yourself, my boss will testify that my production has increased since I started working at home. It removes a dangerous, tiring commute from the start and end of my day, and my cats are happy to have me home. I save money on burning gas (public transit is the pits in the DC area) and still have energy at the end of the day."
2020-03-10 21:32,"This will be an incredible corporate experiment. I live in the mountains outside Silicon Valley. Bay Area traffic is horrendous so working at home is essential IMHO. I do business development so F2F and conferences are essential for networking. I am always ready to meet people as usually I am alone at home (loving it).
I don't have the fatigue of daily commuting.  I don't waste hours of exhaustion with no value.
I believe that once companies see the results of working at home on fatigue and life style, they will more largely adopt it. This will benefit those who stay at home as well as those not having their company in traffic.
Sadly, on the flip side, I am sitting here on Zoom on an all day tech conference where I had hoped to meet clients and can't."
2020-03-10 21:33,"I don't know. This reminds me of all those essays about how how paper-and-pen brought contemplation and creativity that would be lost in the age of the infernal word processor. I've been largely working at home for over a decade and the phone, skype, and the occasional face-to-face have improved my creative video work, not hindered it. Solitude and community are in balance, and more of my time is my own."
2020-03-10 21:39,"I've spent the better part of my working life trying to find a way to work from home. A decade ago that opportunity found its way to me and I have loved every moment since. Working from home saves time, money, and is more productive. I get plenty of stimulation via instant messaging and phone meetings, and have been there when my kids get home from school. If I really need to do a face-to-face (which is rare) we meet at a coffee shop. What's not to like?"
2020-03-10 21:39,"One thing that seems missing from this discussion is breaks. At home, breaks can be productive AND refreshing, like shoveling snow or bringing in a load of wood for the stove. Or even playing a short tune on an instrument. What can a person do at work to take a break and yet also be productive? Socializing can be productive, but not all socializing is productive and many times the participants don't actually enjoy it, so it's not a break."
2020-03-10 21:40,"I used to leave jobs every 2-3 years. I can say with certainty that working from home, and thus, reducing my exposure to certain personality types, has been a godsend to me. I may choose to stay at my current company for 5 or more years (imagine that!) because I can work with much less stress. I am ultra-productive both in the office and at home, but the stress of certain personality types generally leads me to quit perfectly good jobs. It's my Achilles' heel. I am a major contributor to these places and they usually love my work. The issue is admittedly mine. I'm one of those 'highly sensitive people' that are negatively affected by narcissists. I know that many extroverts work around such types with a greater finesse than I have. I'm sure my employer is happy that I won't be quitting this job anytime soon. I produce, and that makes them happy. I work from home, and that makes me happy."
2020-03-10 21:40,"Despite an ever increasingly bad commute, a recently mandatory work from home session made me realize that I hate working from home.

Like all things, not going into the office has it's pluses and minuses.  But if I had my druthers, I would go to the office daily, isolate myself in an enclosed, remote cubicle if I didn't have an office and only interact with my colleagues when necessary (staff & client meetings, in passing during breaks, etc.).  I would make more efficient use of my time even on extended workdays and push the social aspects to the margins since I don't want to eliminate them altogether.  The commute would be (and is) an unfortunate evil.

I find there are too many distractions at home.  I end up spreading my actual work over more hours in the day to make up for those distractions and end up feeling as if I'm still at work if I never left home in the first place."
2020-03-10 21:40,"""And I’ve now come to a very different conclusion: Most people should work in an office, or near other people, and avoid solitary work-from-home arrangements whenever possible.""

While the other does later say that he supports certain groups of people where working from home may be beneficial, this above line is the real problem in the work-force today.  Inevitably, you will at some point face a manager that has decided everyone should be in the office, and he forces that view on his entire group or worse on the entire company.   Reasons may be reasonable, but when applied to an entire large group they are usually arbitrary and unproductive to each situation.  And worse, they don't foster a workforce of respect and trust in the employees that work there."
2020-03-10 21:40,"Yeah, I worked in high tech for 30 years. When you go into an office, the alpha males spend their time (and everyone else's) holding pointless meetings so they can sit with their forearms on their heads bloviating about tasks we are already performing   and already know how to do while most of us are furtively checking our email. They go have two hour lunches or loudly play ping-pong and other children's games while the rest of us (the introverts) are trying to get work done.  Those collaborative meetings? One senior engineer holds the floor while the manager hustles to take credit for it while the rest of us sit in silent resignation over another badly written and untested app gets thrown into the work stream to bollux everything up.

The only times I've seen work from home not work in my profession is when employees don't send their kids to childcare during the workday."
2020-03-10 21:40,"No, it's really not. 
- I roll out of bed at 7:30 and am ""in the office"" by 7:45. 
- I don't have to play Mad Max: Fury Road for the 4.5 mile commute that can take up to an hour easily, to say nothing of the cost and emission savings. 
- I don't need to go sit in an open-office setting where everyone is so focused on not disturbing others that there is nary a peep nevermind any sort of creative collaboration going on. 
- I suppose there are occasional ""peeps"" in the office but it's mostly sneezing and coughing followed by that person using the keyboard/mouse that someone else could very well be using the next day, since there's no assigned seating.
- I can take the dogs for a midday trip to the park, run errands, sign for packages, run a load of laundry, and do whatever other ""life"" things that might come up, within reason of course. 

I finish my workday around 7/7:30 and there's no round 2 of Fury Road, I'm home. Happiest and most productive I've ever been at work and all while I'm working 10-12 hour days, the longest I ever have. Hopefully my employer won't see this but I'd probably take a significant pay cut over having to go into the office given the choice."
2020-03-10 21:44,"I have worked from home quite a bit over the last 25+ years and I love it. Works for me on so many levels. Maybe as a writer that is why. But I also love being to set my own schedule, talk to and spend time with people when I want to, run errands when others are at work (the roads and stores are not packed!), take walks with my dog on my lunch break ... I am so much more relaxed and creative than when I have to be up at a certain time, shower and dress, make sure everything's in my backpack, get the dog to doggie daycare, then navigate the commute (no mass transit available where I am) and spend the next eight hours sitting at a desk under fluorescent lights surrounded by people who do not seem to realize how loud they are when they talk on the phone. I understand that creative interaction is important too, but honestly I get so much more work done (and better quality) when I work from home I will gladly take that tradeoff."
2020-03-10 21:46,Just removing 90-120 minutes of commuting makes working from home a winner.  My last 5 years before retirement were from home and they were the best years of my career.
2020-03-10 21:47,"If you're not having face to face discussions with people because you're working remotely, you're doing it wrong. We have the technology!"
2020-03-10 21:49,"Good article, Kevin, but as with different workers needing different amounts of socializing, I think that the success of the work-from-home strategy also is dependent upon the type of work being done and the workers' relative mastery of their jobs.

I work from home, as a writer for a magazine publisher. After several initial months of working at the office to learn how the company operated and to get a handle on the various magazines (for various industries) produced, I now work entirely from home. As a very mature writer, I don't think I'm missing out on too many ""ah ha"" moments that could occur around the coffee machine or in the company of my colleagues. Staying socialized is important but I think it can be found in extracurricular activities.

So as a mature, experienced worker in an industry that does not require a lot of innovation or Eureka moments to get the job done, I find the at-home environment to be just fine."
2020-03-10 21:50,"The most enjoyable part of workday is the morning drive, while listening to the radio and drinking coffee.

I also enjoy the lunch break and long town-hall type meetings where nothing is expected of me."
2020-03-10 21:50,"Can't wait for this book to come out so I WON'T buy it. Kevin is unable to balance priorities, such as the one may others have mentioned: saving 1 to 2 hours (or more) in commuting time. Trade 2 or 3 hours for the occasional boost in joint problem-solving? What a laugh. Kevin just adopted an idea, and is now trying much too hard to make it work.

You just keep going in to the office every day, Kevin."
2020-03-10 21:56,"I would love to at least have the option to work from home several days a week.  Like others have written, I have a miserable commute that I would gladly give up even if it was just for one or two days a week.  It would be wonderful to be able to sleep in and have a leisurely lunch or go to the gym and then just finish up after with no time limts because of a miserable commute."
2020-03-10 21:57,"Another point (of many) missed. Remote work makes it possible for people to live in lower-cost areas and can aid the housing crunch; and it gives companies access to the best talent regardless of where people live. Win win. Tools like Slack enable ""over the cube"" chatter, and using public channels allows others to ""overhear"" conversations. You need to have best practices, like having everyone be on camera on video meetings, and everyone participating verbally. They are the same best practice that make any meeting effective."
2020-03-10 22:00,"I agree roughly with the remote / in-office balance.  I make the most overall progress when I collaborate in person, but do my ‘lone work’ remotely. Like classes + homework, but for a gen-x."
2020-03-10 22:00,"I was a lead of a distributed technical team of about a dozen people for about 20 years. The team meets up in person every two years or so. We hired people who valued flexibility and good salaries rather than titles, could produce high quality work independently, and were willing to follow the basic rules that enable distributed teams to function.

One person on our team spent years working while living in foreign countries. Several of us ended up working while starting small farms. One home-schooled 5 children. Some of the men as well as the women spent significant time during the week at their kids' school events, and made it up at night.

We had - still have - incredibly low turnover. The team is still going, led by someone that started with us as a grad student. A remote work culture allowed us to lead the kinds of lives that would have been difficult or impossible otherwise. 

Interestingly, for a few years we were studied by a team of social scientists who were determined to prove that face-to-face contact was essential to sustain teams. Our team lasted longer than theirs.

No going back here."
2020-03-10 21:23,"I work from home doing telepractice so I’m interacting with people all day over video, very different from what an office teleworker would do.  My last job I did home visits so sort of similar, just don’t have to drive around."
2020-03-10 21:35,You're confusing creativity with problem solving. Many creative people are introverts.
2020-03-10 21:37,"Yet, two clicks away, Kathryn Hughes writes in her NYT review of Fenton Johnson's At the Center of All Beauty, ""In this lyrical yet finely argued book, Johnson sets out to show that being alone — so different from loneliness, its direct opposite, in fact — is absolutely essential to the creative life."" It is surely a matter of your character, temperament, etc. and what you are doing that will determine what is overrated and what is absolutely essential."
2020-03-10 21:18,"Back when offices were actual offices, or even cubes, going to work made sense.  Now, you're just thrown at an open table with a dozen other workers and you don't even have an assigned seat.  No thanks.  I'll stay home."
2020-03-10 22:09,"The point of remote work should be to spend less time on the job and more time on yourself and your family because you're more productive and get more done than those in the office. In practice, it just enables people to start work from the moment they wake until dinner is delivered in the evening."
2020-03-10 22:13,"This is such a classist argument.  I'm sure most workers in the US (and elsewhere) do not have creative jobs or jobs where where they don't need to be at their place of work.
(Think hospitals, food service, farmers, manufacturing of all sorts, military, postal service)

I, for one have had enough of these articles about working or not working at home."
2020-03-10 22:15,"My management philosophy:
""Life is bigger, its bigger than you, and you are not me""
You can sing the rest of the song if you like, but this is the most important thing to realize when building a team.  We have varied strengths and weaknesses, optimal and sub-optimal ways of working.  I have been working from home for 15 years with a group of other work from home engineers and many other onsite engineers and managers.  We build the in hose eCommerce platform for a large multi brand  multi national multi billion dollar company.  There is no lack of creativity and communication.  Each way of working has its own challenges.  The WFH folks are often surprised how people in the office sometimes don't talk to each other, while the in office people would sometimes like more time to talk.  In the end, a lot of work needs the sort of focus that comes from working independently in order to get things done and let ideas percolate.  From the days of Yahoo Messenger, to the modern days of Slack, we've always made it work.  Work from home or in office are suited to different kinds of people, and we should strive for diversity in all things.  I'd like to see a world where neither is some assumed or pressured default for jobs that can benefit from a mix of approaches.   Headlines like this don't help."
2020-03-10 22:16,I am a ghost writer in the business sector and my stock and trade is creativity. I have worked at home for over 25 years and love it. I realize not everyone does but the point is people should have the option to do what is most productive for them. Too often companies are afraid of letting their employees work remotely which is a shame. Remote work would solve so many problems from climate on up. I  find that this article sets us back when it comes to creatively reimagining the American workforce. There are a lot of ways to interact creatively with colleagues without getting back on the nine to five hamster wheel. The more we explore these options the better for us all.
2020-03-10 22:17,"Like just about everything else in life, moderation is key. I would never consider taking a job at a company that wouldn't allow me to work from home on a regular basis but at the same time I also never want to go back to working from home 100% which I did for several years. 

Whenever possible, companies should adopt policies where employees area allowed and encouraged to work from home one day a week. If just the 5-6 largest tech companies here in Seattle adopted such policies it would mean a noticeable reduction in traffic congestion. This would in turn benefit all the people for whom working from home is not an option. Those companies would also see a reduction in voluntary turnover. I work as a recruiter and one of the most common reasons people tell me they're looking for a new job is because they don't want to deal with long daily commutes. I've talked with several people who have even been willing to take sizable paycuts just to avoid dealing with the commute over the 520 bridge."
2020-03-10 22:20,The problem is people working from home sometimes do not have the best of work ethics. Working from home on company time does not mean one can do side chores while not focused on the tasks at hand. I had this issue having relaxed work from home office culture. People are harder to find and message replies have been delayed compared to working from the office where people can be supervised. This varies on what industry you're in ofcourse.
2020-03-10 22:20,"So, let's see. . . as far as I know, farmers work from home. Millions of others have their businesses in their homes. Just about every woman I know has done some sort of work from home. Day care workers work from home. Private music teacher work from home. Working from home doesn't mean isolation. I read about a Wall Street broker who worked from home and had meetings in his dining room. . Is it an adjustment? Probably, but not a bad oner if you have as good imagination.  How you work at home is your choice. Didn't work for you? Too bad, but please don't generalize. Isolation with an illness is one thing, working at home no matter what is a choice, and a very healthy one."
2020-03-10 22:25,"Working from home is the best decision I ever made.  Not only am I vastly more productive for my company, but I get all the typical perks and am so much happier in life (no comparison).  Further, my relationships with coworkers are absolutely strong via email, phone, screen sharing, and an occasional office visit every couple weeks. 

 All that said, I remember the very first migration into this role and it took 3 months to feel normal.  It requires a dedicated office space and desk...and if people don't have that they will absolutely feel unproductive and unconnected.  This virus scare cannot be the all-revealing litmus test for working at home vs. the office commute, as people are inherently going to feel discombobulated via sudden and total break in routine.  Let's take this for what it is and not draw absolute pro/con conclusions from a temporary and disorderly event."
2020-03-10 22:26,"After an exciting and stressful career at two big marketing agencies, I opted to start my own marketing firm and work from home. One can only image how many hours of Seattle commute time I have saved myself in the past 16 years. At about 8-10 hours per week, it adds up quite fast. People don't ever get those commuting hours back in their lifetimes. And that doesn't even address the utter frustration of being stuck in traffic. 

Do I miss the interactions with colleagues? Sometimes. Maybe 10-20% of the time. And people always assume we sit around in sweatpants. I can't remember the last time I did that when I worked from home (or anywhere). 

They are choices. I personally love the work/life balance I can have now. Walking my yellow Labrador Retriever several blocks at lunchtime generates as many new ideas as any meeting I have ever been in."
2020-03-10 22:27,"Working from home, what a joy.  No office politics, no pretend to enjoy listening to the jokes, no company meetings that accomplish little, no bosses who know everything.  Home, where you can bite into something and stay with it until you are satisfied, no matter how long it takes.  Home where you lunch when you are hungry, noon or 3:00 PM.  Home where time previously spent in the car is now spent working.  Yes, home, the most productive place in the world to work."
2020-03-10 22:28,"I did once have a purely remote job, and after I seven months I jumped at the chance to work in the office. What I did miss about the office is an increased general level of excitement. I am a middling extravert/introvert, and I do find energy from the people around me. Nowadays, I remote in 2 days a week and otherwise have a 15-minute commute walking, a good balance.

As for creativity, although some people might find other people around helpful for them, I find the office's 'mind' oppressive. If I need to think, and think big, or think new, I step out, maybe pen and pad in hand, or take a walk. Getting away from the office is what I find creative. 

Yes, sometimes there is a need to solve collaboratively, but I tend to think that is overrated, as I find assistance from people that are not versed in what I do, software development, more of a distraction or a nuisance than helpful when done directly, and instances of synergy don't necessarily have to be in person. When collaboration is less specific, I find other's sloppiness or lack of enthusiasm troublesome, making more work for me, although I do generally respond positively to feedback from others as customers to make my products better."
2020-03-10 22:29,"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about commuting back and forth to work. It is soul deadening, potentially dangerous, and if you're sitting down most of the time, it's murder on your body. As you get older, the utility of assembling in a conference room w others every 30 minutes becomes more and more meaningless. As do the awkward conversations with colleagues in the office kitchen, and attempts to make others feel comfortable as you pass in the hallway. Leave it all behind and work from home."
2020-03-10 22:30,"As a natural scientist and university professor, I found some degree of isolation helpful to imagination and creativity. But ""home-made lunches"" are very bad: they require not only an  effort to be made, but an effort to be consumed, and then the dishes made. Better to supress the hunger by a good cigar, accompanied by strong coffee."
2020-03-10 22:37,"I went into the office for the first time (its optional at my company) a few days ago.  I walked about a mie to a pretty nice, big, office, with free catered lunches and all the snacks and drinks you can think of.  After a few hours, I missed working from home.  Would rather cook my own meals and not be disturbed.  Immediately there was ""that guy"" that couldn't stop talking and butting into conversations or those people that talk too loud.  Productivity plummeted and yea, so did creativity.  So, I don't agree."
2020-03-10 22:40,"Love working from home. No more bumper to bumper commute, no more work clothes, no more girl cliques, constant interruptions, etc. I do think once a month could be an office day or day with the team but aside from that...."
2020-03-10 22:43,"I've worked from home for several years. I love the flexibility and do not miss the commute. However, I am the only team member in my time zone, so I rarely see my co-workers in person. I agree the flexibility comes at a cost, and I've considered looking for a new job that allows for a couple days of work from home a week."
2020-03-10 22:44,"In my view, Gary Noleds gets it right. His comment is contained within my comment right here & you can see his post somewhere below. ""You're confusing creativity with problem solving. Many creative people are introverts"". I agree & have always felt that many of my jobs that required technical writing were best done in the library or somewhere where there were minimal distractions. Some firms I worked in had their own library, so that was often a suitable place, except that, inevitably, someone important was looking for you like your boss. Writing from home has the best benefits for me, ideally a designated office space [or room] where there will be some semblance of peace & quiet. A lock on the door wouldn't hurt either."
2020-03-10 22:45,I've been working from home for 12 years now. I can't focus in an office. I can't imagine going back into an office having to deal with people. I'd rather join a monastery.
2020-03-10 22:46,"Does it have to be a one or the other option? Could companies save money by providing unassigned ‘hotel’ desks and create happy employees empowered to decide if they want to come in or work from home on a given day? Not all jobs are creative, not all jobs are process-driven, however I would guess that most are not exclusively either. I work from home a few days a week and come in a few days a week. Mixing it up helps me avoid burnout and boredom. But for someone else they might need the ‘real’ person to person interaction. What if we just let people chose for themselves how they work best..."

With time and money saved without a commute, I can now commute to a gym (or Mt Bachelor ski area) and interact with people in that setting, which is like setting a reset button for reviving work enthusiasm and I’m not made to feel guilty about it. Disclaimer: I run my own business now, and have laid a claim to a “trust me to get it done” set of clients. Never looking back to an office environment if I can avoid it!"
2020-03-10 22:51,"The one place that Roose makes a point, one that most here seemed to have glossed over, is that many of us working remotely do work that could be automated and that being in the office, to socialize, empathize, and strategize is going to allow some of us to keep our jobs.

I work as a software developer, and sometimes a lead for teams and projects, and one must realize that anything that can be systematized can be automated, including my type of work. 

Even then, when it comes down to who gets kept in a downturn, it is very likely the ones that have strong social relationships, not necessarily the best skills, although one can see from the comments, there are some successful, creative people working remotely exclusively."
2020-03-10 21:44,"When working from home, it helps me to take breaks and get away from my desk. Maybe Steve Jobs was wrong: It is not the interacting with others that generates the ideas; it's the taking a break.

Work retail from home -- manning registers and check-out points?

How does one to mechanical work from home?

The carbon reduction from eliminating commuting, heating and cooling office buildings and other things that support moving people and from work would be immense.

2020-03-10 23:36,"I think you need both, the interaction at the office and also time to be alone to work in a comfortable place, usually your home but not always, to do your best work.  The solution?  In my ideal world, a short office work day (6 hours, just like school) followed by homework at home (or someplace else).  Works for parents, caregivers, and really everyone who wants a balanced lifestyle.  Creativity doesn’t come from serendipitous encounters in most industries or most companies.  It comes from really knowing your stuff and interacting with others who really know their stuff.  The long, hectic, needlessly unproductive work day I think hampers people’s real understanding is their work and hence creativity."
2020-03-10 23:38,"Hey... not so fast introverts!  

I’m an extrovert and I fully agree with you!  

I hate the tyranny of open office plan. There is no way anyone, introvert or extrovert, can be productive with all the “energy and creativity” raining down on them constantly throughout the day, day in and day out. Anyone who claims otherwise is probably the person who’s sending me emails and documents full of typos and half-baked sentences. 

It’s an N of one, but I split my time between an open office plan and working from home. I estimate I lose at least 1-3 hours of productivity on days when I’m in the office. In order to accomplish everything I set out to do on days when I’m in the office, I end up working longer hours even when I keep my “socializing” to a minimum. Why? Because it takes me longer to do everything.  The noise!  The distractions!  It’s just not worth it."

There will come a time when it will be considered environmentally irresponsible to have millions of people clog roads and trains in the act of getting to work.

2020-03-10 23:43,"I think you misses the most important point. Self isolating isn't about having a great time. Self isolating is about protecting vulnerable people from potential exposure.

2020-03-10 23:52,"If we're talking about the practice of TYPICALLY working remotely... Certain personality types do really suffer from not having face-to-face interactions with others in the hallway, at the water cooler, etc.  

For me, working from home actually IS more productive.  And I don't find it hard to shoot an email to a co-worker who I feel may have good creative input on problems I'm working on... or picking up the phone.. or asking for a Skype session, etc.  

The large majority of the hallway ""water cooler"" discussions have absolutely NOTHING to offer to the projects I'm working on. At the office, people often drop in for really NO purpose, and you can't really say directly that you're working without offending.  Really, it's nice that they like you (really, it IS), but there sometimes is really serious work to be finished. 

Developing valuable ideas via blog/document sharing, email etc ensures that the ideas are recorded, and that is often helpful.  In fact the best ideas from the water cooler discussions have to be written down eventually anyway."
2020-03-10 23:54,"I love working from home when I can. I'm a psychologist and much of my job is talking with patients, families, and in meetings with colleagues. I try to keep my door open when I'm not meeting with others, but then have regular interruptions from others who at times barge in without even asking ""do you have time to talk?"". If I could work from home about 1 day a week I'd be in heaven. Some of us need to disconnect rather than connect more."

2020-03-10 23:58,"If working from home means not connecting with your coworkers and don’t have a creative culture means you (or your company) aren’t doing it right.

Work from home and avoid sick people and annoying conversations from all sides, yes please."
2020-03-11 0:00,"Serendipitous collisions are happening all around us at global scale. Where the interaction is not deep enough to foster creativity, it is individual and group lack of understanding how to work remotely that holds them back, not the nature of remote work itself."

 It is me and the cats, who are great as office mates  because they sleep all day.  Okay, I am a little jealous about that.  Or they come in once in a while and purr while seeking a pet, and if you have not heard, petting an animal to totally relaxing. i  don't need to be in an office to find input or discussion.  It is just a phone call away.  Remember that device?  The phone?  Yeah, It puts me in touch with people who can help me think it through and I can do it while in my pajamas.  Just saying.  I am totally in control of my environment (no arguments about whether it is cold or hot, no issues with noise, no issues with someone cooking fish in the microwave for lunch). I am in control of what I do and when I do it.  Sp long as the work gets done, it really is no ones business."

In the two and a half hours that I had to myself, I could usually accomplish almost a whole day's work...without stress.  Once 8 o'clock rolled around and people were everywhere, work slowed down and stress increased.  Working from home was not possible then, but now it is for a great many people.

Indeed, I have installed applications for entire offices without needing to set foot there. And yes, sometimes there's no substitute for being there, so I go. 

For the most part, it's a VERY efficient way to go. For me.

I guess there were plenty of days when I wasn't the most productive I could have been but my life wasn't always about being productive, it was about living, laughing and having memories worth something.  Yeah, I did some great work in my career, developed some solutions to problems that really did make people lives better.  I am so glad I had the privilege to work with so many great people, even the people that I didn't like taught me me a great deal and helped develope better solutions to the issues we needed to address.

2020-03-11 0:29,"About six months ago I became a remote worker, in part due to the impossible housing prices in the Bay Area, and thanks to my organization's flexibility. As someone who has to do a lot of editing and proofreading, getting out of a noisy room of cubicles held a lot of promise. 

Well, it's taken me almost the whole six months to get accustomed to this. The office noise and activity that used to drive me crazy is now something I miss, or more precisely, the opportunity to do my work in a space that's not my home. When before I could attend a campus exercise class without guilt, now I feel bad going out of the house for a twenty-minute walk. It's getting better overall, but it takes a lot more work than i thought it would.

One note about tech giants like Google and their snacks--please, it's not primarily to “get those moments of serendipity.” The free food, laundry, haircuts, exercise classes...they're to make being at work your default state. Which is more or less what I've achieved by bringing my own work home."
2020-03-11 0:30,There's a happy balance between the two. I've done both. Full time remote is not for me but I'm now in a completely open environment that is too distracting. You can't think and be creative if you can't focus.

2020-03-10 17:24,"To each their own. Working from home allows flexibility and productivity often unavailable in a structured work space. Some people need personal contact for stimulation, while others need uninterrupted time to excel. Losing a couple of hours commuting and the associated expense isn't rational, but being in a workplace that sees ""face time"" with the boss makes one more valued upsets that equation. The best managers value employee satisfaction and get excellent outcomes wherever they work. Finding a culture confident enough to let employees do what works best, whether at home or at the office, can benefit everyone, including the environment."
2020-03-10 22:20,"I've worked from home for nearly two decades.  Going into an office environment is the psychic equivalent to fingernails on a chalkboard.

Most of my work involves writing large, complicated documents.  Every single ""have you got a minute"" interruption means letting go of all the components of the document that I have balanced in my head, watching that ""minute"" turn into minutes, and then having to gather all the threads in the document that I had to put down to deal with the interruption.  So the length of the interruption grows by the amount of time it takes to re-establish my tight focus on the work.

At this point, most of the people I work with are multiple time zones away, so face-to-face isn't even practical anymore.  

And all those extroverts who cheerfully bounce into the break room every morning for coffee and conversation?  Glad you're happy.  Leave me in peace."
2020-03-10 17:28,"I have a different point of view.
I worked remotely for 16 years. I agree it can be lonely, and that's the worst thing about it. That was balanced by the fact that the entire group worked that way too, over two continents and across all of North America. We made sure we took ""water cooler"" breaks--starting  business conversation on Skype that veered off into chitchat. I liked Skype because it wasn't plugged into the company's network, and I made sure that the conversations weren't saved. We had frequent phone meetings, which frankly were just as boring as the ones I attended in person when I was in an office. The time it took me previously to commute to NYC--two hours door to door each way--were spent working. Not to mention the hassle of getting dressed for the office every day. I cherished it. But yes, it's lonely and too quiet sometimes."

Some require the structure of the commute and the office; some thrive with their pooch at their feet and their refrigerator just steps away.  Technology, especially the ease of virtual meetings, has made the at-home warrior just as available as the folks at the water cooler.

My team generally spends half their time in the office or at meetings with project teams throughout our organization, and half the time working at home. The time spent in-person is heavily focused in creative collaboration, socialization, and coordination meetings. Then the remote time is spent implementing all those creative ideas.

I was unnerved that almost every Times-pick comment is from someone who abhors interacting with their coworkers. I'm terrified of a future where offices cease to exist. Humans need interpersonal interaction!"
2020-03-11 1:31,"I worked from home for three years before retiring. I came to think of it as being under house arrest. As an introvert I enjoyed it at first but it negatively reinforced my introversion, even though I was expected to be reachable by phone or text at all hours between 7:00 am and midnight. Working in the office, on the other hand, helped me make decades-long friends and come out of my shell. And the distractions of the office were nothing compared to the dirty dishes, the refrigerator, the spouse, and the television at home."
2020-03-11 1:33,"With the exception of 6 months in NYC on a project, I have been working from home and supporting a family of six for almost 17 years now. During that time, I spent only a few days  in an office setting, and I cannot imagine going back to that way of making a living. 

I have a rich internal life and I find myself to be plenty creative in my chosen profession, which is software architecture. So I just don't buy the thesis of this argument - at least not for myself."
2020-03-11 1:37,"""But research also shows that what remote workers gain in productivity, they often miss in harder-to-measure benefits like creativity and innovative thinking.""

Well that's interesting. My office of 200 people feels more stifling and conformist than creative. It could be that creativity is on a continuum: the not-very creative might get an encouraging idea together with a colleague. But the higher-creativity people (like me) require much much more stimulus generally not found in a suburban corporate office. I'm much better at thinking outside the box, when not stuck inside the box. Working at home allows me the freedom to not repeat safe, dull ideas that are rewarded inside the office."
2020-03-11 1:38,"My personal preference is working from home.  That said, going in to the office for collaboration doesn't mean a whole lot when the people you work with are in other parts of the country.  My boss and her boss are in Charlotte, NC.  The IT folks I work with most closely are in Phoenix and Charlotte.  The business folks I work most closely with are in Minneapolis and San Fran.  So, if I go into the office I'm ""remote"" anyway -- why bother?"
2020-03-11 1:43,"I've done it for five and a half years. You get used to the lack of in-person human interaction and find ways to boost your creativity. Your production goes up, and creativity is more necessary in some positions and a quiet home office with no drama and less stress is better for someone like me, a programmer. So your very limited (days?) of working from home makes you no expert on the subject and hence not qualified to paint this article with a broad stroke deeming all work from home employees somehow less valuable than their in-office counterparts."
2020-03-11 1:43,"Can't people bounce ideas off of each other via computers , they can even see each other.

I admit I don't know what he does, but for me, I am able to focus on my work when there isn't noise around - and the sounds most 'co-workers' make, for me, is noise. If I need to confer with someone I can message, email or go to talk to them. All the others - no thanks. And commuting is a huge waste of time and resources."
2020-03-11 1:46,"I agree with Prof at HBS. Few people have ways to get relevant social interaction. Working from office or away from it is an individual fit. For example, a researcher who has never met a single home loan defaulter and researching on the topic using data, newspaper articles or talking to his colleagues does not have direct experience of the situation, hence may not develop the wholistic view or a consultant incorporating only the views of executives visiting his office while charting out governance policy of the company does not know the employee side of the story whom he may chance upon while doing grocery for his home snacking."
2020-03-11 1:47,"I had a lab job which I commuted to for 16 years.  When I was laid off, I ended up at another lab job but it was so bad I quit after 4 weeks.  I then started my career in sales, which is remote.  It was hard for the first 2-3 years; not seeing my friends each day that I had known for so long.  But over time I’ve come to very much appreciate my life.  I currently get paid quite well, travel about once per month out of my area to meet customers, and get to see my friends for lunch.  The trick is to have enough contact with your home office or boss to keep the ideas flowing (which I do).  Business development and sales jobs are perfect for working remotely (and I’m reasonably extroverted - I like people). But some jobs, especially in the sciences or engineering, certainly thrive off of interpersonal interactions to foster ideas.  It just depends on the job."

2020-03-11 1:53,"The real risk of COVID-19 forcing work from home quarantines is that is will peel back the veneer of those who can produce and those who strap hang. In any organization, the biggest and most entrepreneurial producers tend to be doing their thing regardless of where they work. Indeed, these individuals are often on the road, of on the phone with clients or investors or conceiving new ideas and strategies. Indeed, collaboration can assist in this process, but most offices are top heavy on their core producers. What happens if companies realize who’s producing and who’s not as these quarantines play out? Might we see layoffs for the marginal? Promotions for the exceptional? Technology is already a pernicious factor changing employment and productivity in our modern economy. An exogenous event like a pandemic could accelerate our socio-economic challenges faster than we wish."

It helps if the entire team is remote.  Navigating office politics remotely is often impossible.

It also helps getting together physically now and again if the travel is deemed advantageous to the workforce rather than a drudgery.

My husband is a working actor and if/when his show is no longer allowed to run bc of this pandemic, we will have NO income.  I'm so incredibly tired of those of you with salaries and health care plans telling us in 600 words that it is harder to work from home.  Yes.  We know.  We work three jobs.

I too am far more productive in my home office and if I need or want a change of scenery, I work from Starbucks, the library or my company's actual office. I treasure the cost and time savings, flexibility, minimized environmental impact, and as a single mom with no extended family nearby, it's invaluable to be accessible to my kids after school and during summers and school breaks. As a result, I'm a loyal, high producing employee with a great attitude. A win-win for both me and my employer. Of course it has drawbacks, but nothing in life is perfect and the positives far outweigh the negatives for me. I don't feel any less creative at home. I'm healthier too. Office jobs and long commutes can minimize one's ability to stay physically fit consistently. 

I find the office isn't very social either. People seem afraid or self-conscious about talking and many email or text each other anyway, even the person in the next cubicle over."

2020-03-11 2:21,"If you want to encourage collaboration and seridipidous meetings, maybe have some dedicated social events and stop putting everyone into open office plans where everyone is watching everyone, everyone is trying to appear harder working than everyone else, and any conversation immediately irks 3 people.  It's also pretty obvious these days and maybe years ago that a lot of people either real introverts or just cranky people find any socializing at the office annoying .. which is kind of a sad way to spend a high percentage of your life. 

Right now, we probably have to give it a try, just read some of the terrible news out of Italy's hospitals (I think we were lulled into thinking corona wasn't that bad by the lack of free press out of China).  Let's keep our elders safe and leave hospital beds for those who can't avoid contact or who are just unlucky.  

Also maybe you can support some businesses near your house, not quite the same as those in your work neighborhood, but it is likely safe to get some take out a few times a week."

The creativity/innovation gap happening now is likely cause led by limits to what/where we can improve the human experience.  The throwing about of “AI/ML” is getting tiring.  AI/ML is the next phase of mechanization that can potentially eliminate even more jobs.  Those that say it will help people focus on “higher value” problems is even more nonsense.  We’ve squeezed so much inefficiency out of the “system” that there’s not much left for adding value.  It’s just shifting value to someone else’s corner of the game board.

2020-03-11 2:34,"This is the wrong opinion. I've been working from home for 15 years and, while there it requires structure to avoid isolation, i've never felt more free, more motivated, or more productive. 

I schedule in person meetings with all my clients, make sure to get out for a working coffee break, and love the freedom of being able to get out for exercise whenever the weather is good. 

Working from home is the ultimate expression of an adult relationship with work, where emphasis is not placed on the trivialities of schedule and appearance but the bottom line of getting excellent work done. 

I hope to never work office hours again."

2020-03-11 2:38,"So you're selling a book. I have worked at home part time for over a year doing computer work for a very successful corporation.  I love it.  I don't spend any of my life commuting, I don't have to put a suit on every day, and I can pick my hours.  I can easily communicate with supervisors and coworkers when I need to.  A couple of times a year I go into the corporate offices for a half day of training.  That's it!  It works for my particular job, but of course there are obviously jobs where it's not possible.  I know there are many who would love a legitimate work at home job like I have.  It's not some horrible scourge on the worker, it's just another alternative that I was lucky to find. Let it go."
2020-03-11 2:49,"I don't agree. But then again, perhaps it depends on where home is, etc. I live on a waterfront which is a rustic environment where I can walk around like a huge park (exurban WNY) and I prefer to work from home and I'd put our work as among the most creative humans can do (science, medicine, drug discovery, etc.) which involves traditional creative stuff like excellence in art and writing.

While I agree F2F meetings are also good creativity boosters, my best groundbreaking ideas have come alone while secluded in nature."
2020-03-11 2:49,"I think something else worth considering is how working from home is liberation from microaggressions related to race and gender. I have noticed that now that I work largely from home, I feel a little less on edge because I can focus on the actual work-- not answering a million questions about my hair, not enduring off-color jokes and remarks, not being cursed out in meetings and having no one defend me, not being touched without my permission...yeah. If anything, working remotely has allowed for more bandwidth for creativity because I'm using less energy for dealing with how combative office environments can be."
2020-03-11 2:49,"I worked from home for 6 years as a post retirement necessity due to the Great Recession.  Not good.  I was cloistered from my friends, I drank too much and generally just agitated most of the time. We are social beings and should work in groups not in isolation."
2020-03-11 2:53,"Sorry but working from home is definitely not overrated.

In my 20+ years in engineering  R&D, marketing and sales roles, I have worked in open-plan offices and from home. Working from home works much better for me.

There is no need to be with co-workers 100% of the time to solve problems. Some time with co-workers is very productive, but not 100% of the time. You need to think about the problems on your own, before discussing them with others. Thinking in an open-plan office is not easy. Thinking at home is much easier.

The best way to promote team cohesion is to spend time with work colleagues OUTSIDE of work. Team events away from the office worked great for us, and those working from home were happy to attend. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy or expensive. Another easy way is to have a happy hour at work, for example 3-5 PM on Fridays - this is a good time to have random discussions with co-workers and have those wow-moments that Steve Jobs talked about.

It is definitely easier to balance work and life while working from home. No time wasted in traffic, no costs for commuting, no risk of being in a car crash.

There is no need for companies to try to keep remote employees happy. If you love what you do, you will be happier doing it from home.

I do agree that working from home works for some and doesn’t work for others. Those for whom it works should be allowed to do it more often."

This is socio-cultural learning theory, Vygotsky, and has been around for half a century at least. We need each other.  It takes a crisis like this to recognize what it would be like if we took this format individualized and hyper excluded reality to the extreme. There has to be a balance."

As for creativity, as a introvert, I do my best work from home. I can go out to lunch, meet a friend for coffee mid-day. True, I am not quarantined, but even those who are have space to be creative. And you can skype or do FaceTime if interaction is needed or desired."
2020-03-11 3:05,"I literally just started a fully remote job, and I am in love.

I love this cadence and balance - I get the jolt from others and the deep work time by myself. When I first started I felt isolated during the remote work weeks but I mitigated that by moving all my calls to Zoom video meetings.

It's also helpful to have a dog at home. I get to take a real lunch break and walk him midday. I also go to the neighborhood dog park at 6pm every day. I see the same friendly faces and socialize, just like I did at the proverbial water cooler when I worked from the office daily. 

As an extrovert I generally prefer working from the office but my remote set up has showed me how adaptable I can be, and that I can in fact modify my home work environment to meet my needs."

Birthday lunches, celebratory cakes in the coffee room, happy hour and even the much maligned holiday party are all things I became nostalgic for as  an independent contractor. Having colleagues of different genders, races and ages also expands one's sphere in a way that can't help but enhance the end product. 
I gave up the office to raise my children. No regrets. But occasional onsite gigs energized me in ways that working at home did not. Here's hoping all the siloed workers like the article's author can return to their cubicles and colleagues soon."

Organizations that create work from home policies and take the time to upskill their workforce see the greatest results.

My supervisor is happy with my productivity and we work to complete the tasks not follow the clock. I am fine with working beyond the normal hours to complete projects when allowed comp time. Home internet is fast so work is productive. I still interact with work mates via phone calls and zoom meetings, so it’s improved collaborative work without the downside of a noisy shared work place.

I could be in an office and be with people who also worked for my company, but it did not really impact my performance. Those other folks could have been with a different company.

I’ve worked remotely for most of my 40  years of employment and the home office set-up has served me well. For really young folks who are new to work or in entry level positions, being in an office environment/schmoozing at the water cooler/developing relationships/hashing out ideas can be valuable and pleasurable. But for the rest of us, give me a quiet home office with no commute and no distractions ANY day. If I need to bounce ideas off of someone, I CALL them on the phone. I use slack, TM, email, whatever it takes. I make the effort to reach out. It’s an effort that maybe most people, yourself included, are not willing to do, but absolutely worth the trade-off."

Offices are great for: socializing, inside jokes, fun lunches, gossip, 1 out of 6 meetings sparking an idea.

Home is great for: doing the actual work. 

Even in an office, I often had to wait until people were leaving at the end of the day to get anything creative done, as the constant interruptions, distractions and mind-numbing meetings made concentration impossible. I struck out on my own and also kept doing remote work for key clients at the old job. My work was better and the collaboration with the old team was more efficiently productive. Plus I was much less exhausted. It's the way to go."
2020-03-11 3:43,"I loathe being forced to ""collaborate."" It's something I know extroverts love but I am infinitely more productive alone and believe that creativity is best served by solitude.  You quote Jobs so I counter with Wozniak (though I'm certain someone's already done it, here):

""Most inventors and engineers I’ve met are like me — they’re shy and they live in their heads. They’re almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone — best outside of corporate environments, best where they can control an invention’s design without a lot of other people designing it for marketing or some other committee. I don’t believe anything really revolutionary has ever been invented by committee… I’m going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone… Not on a committee. Not on a team.”"
2020-03-11 3:47,"I've been working from home the last 6 months. It's not as great as I thought, but I am able to focus more and am more productive.  Though I'm an introvert I miss being around others, which came as a surprise. One of the downsides is the only space I can work is in my library, which means I've lost it for personal use because I now associate it with work and avoid it otherwise. I'll certainly take it over an open air office environment, which seems specifically designed to inhibit productivity."
2020-03-11 3:48,"I came to that conclusion years ago after several stints of working at home. I'm a writer and I found being around others lit a fire under my creativity, simply because I was exposed to different ideas, opinions, ways of working.  I was out of my bubble.  AND colleagues help relieve the tedium associated with office work. Plus they give you something to gossip about at home."
2020-03-11 3:49,"Don't agree at all. I'm some kind of a ""hard core from home worker"". I've been freelancing for 20 years plus and happy that I pretty much never have to work in an office filled with other coworkers. I dislike teamwork very much and can easily spend weeks without socializing in an office. I'm working in a so called creative job, I have to come up with new design-ideas on an almost daily basis. I'm way more creative if I don't have to deal with tiresome office politics, forced small talk over awkward lunches and those awful office meetings with endless talking back and forth to little effect. Call me weird but working alone from home is just perfect for me. Sometimes I go to the gym in the middle of the afternoon and then simply work longer at night. Sometimes I'm working out or cooking while listening in on a conference call. I think it's unreal how chill my working situation actually is. No commute, no getting ready in the morning to be presentable, no hassle, no nothing. Straight from my bedroom to the living room, with a short stop for coffee in my kitchen before hitting the desk. Bliss. That said, if I have to I do work harder and longer than full time staff at their offices. But then the next day I can usually take it easier again. Perfect."
2020-03-11 4:05,I’ve worked mostly at home for 25 years with occasional days in the office. There are strong advantages and disadvantages for each. But social distancing could benefit by just reducing the number of people in the office at any one time. A plan where  certain groups each  go into the office one day a week and work from home the rest  could allow for the best of all worlds.
2020-03-11 4:37,"Working at home isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, but I seem to last longer in jobs where I’m off-site most of the time so I don’t have to be personable 40 hours a week, and people don’t have to be around me all the time. I like being around people though also and tend to get agoraphobic, so I’m fortunate that I can be both on site or remote pretty much at will."
2020-03-11 4:43,"Sorry but I loved working from home before I retired! 

The office was too cramped and full of people talking, chit chatting, milling about etc. That was a major stressor for me as I had deadlines and a heavy workload (unlike them). 

I also have always had my own groups of friends outside of the office and do not rely on work for friendship or company. If you have your own friends and like your own company, it's a different world, I think."
2020-03-11 4:49,"I'm considered an extrovert, and yet I am much happier and productive when working from home and keeping phone and email interruptions to a minimum.

That said, I do enjoy going out into the world and meeting up with my colleagues every so often. Conversations about work are more productive when they occur infrequently, and the small talk and complaining are kept to a minimum due to lack of time. 

I return to my solitude energized and eager to get more done. 

Laszlo Bock got it backwards for someone like me: My ideal is 1.5 days at the office and the remainder at home."
2020-03-11 4:53,"The work environment is not only about the individual. While you may not feel you're gaining by sharing an office with people, others may gain by being there with you. We influence each other, often in positive ways that build professional skills - like self-presentation, good judgement, listening and focus ability. Sometimes we even learn jokes."
2020-03-11 5:01,"I've been working from home for almost 6 years now and I'm losing it. I get crazy bored and yes, I feel that my creativity is wearing down (I am a graphic/web designer, so you get the picture). I'm seriously considering moving to a WeWork. I need to see people."
2020-03-11 5:07,I wonder if some companies could stagger the days at home so 20% or 30% some come in everyday.  That way you would still make contact with some of your fellow workers.
2020-03-11 5:13,"I spent the week with a 20 year old, dying cat. Today I voted at 7:12 a.m., continued a 121 day crossword puzzle streak and shopped online, spending about $600 on tools (work related - kind of). I've been working from home for six years and worry more about cabin fever than coronavirus. I also cleaned the house because my wife is one of those millions of teachers who have to show up.
My advise - make a work list and try to stick to it. I hated the open office and found it stifling."
2020-03-11 5:17,This is all quite whiney and self centered in the face of a pandemic. During this upheaval we stay at home not only to keep ourselves safe but also consider the safety of others. People who are truly creative find work arounds in most any situation. Try harder.
2020-03-11 5:20,"I work form home most of the time....I feel far more creative surrounded by my books, my references, listening to music and the feeling the sunlight than I ever would in an office, or slammed on a  train every morning. 

Best of all, I can wear comfy clothes!"

The savings are great esp for the environment - no containers or cups and my waistline is thankful. I'd be hard-pressed to get back into the real world...thank god my boss is amazing ;) (it's me!)
2020-03-11 3:47,"I was telecommuting decades ago. 

There are problems being a renter.  A landlord's preferred tenant is a tenant who does not actually occupy and live in his or her rental unit. 

You work seven days a week, but after the critical deadline stuff is completed, you can take time off to have a wonderful cappucino in the early afternoon.  

But. 

It does transform you into a person who does everything in work and when you find yourself employed under everyone's thumb again, you have to deal with their incredible ignorance about what you can do.  Most workers are really not very bright people."
2020-03-11 4:37,"If you don't like working from home, go to the office. No-one is forcing you to stay home."
2020-03-11 5:26,"I've been working from home for weeks on end. Not sure if I'll ever go back to office. My whole team is remote anyway. Now I can walk my dog  3 times a day and get some fresh air. Though it is hard after so many years of commuting to escape the feeling of ""playing hookie""."
2020-03-11 5:26,"I agree. Have been working from home for several years now, and I'm thoroughly convinced that what you really want is the *option* to work from home when needed or desired. I'm very much looking forward to getting an office outside the house again sometime over the next year."
2020-03-11 5:29,"540  comments and counting, and my read of over 200 strongly supports the advantages and preferences of working remotely. Even considering the (dubious?) benefits of ‘hallway conversations’ and other serendipitous ‘collaboration’ that in-office meetings might encourage, the reality of (each way) 1-1.5 hour commutes completely negates any benefit of being in-office. Remote work is here to stay!"
2020-03-11 5:31,"""best work came from accidentally bumping into other people""

Bumping into people, accidentally or otherwise, is of no benefit to me.

Building up a good library at home, decent internet-academic connections and subscriptions, quiet, but being able to work while listening to my music, with no need for earphones, that will produce my best work.

People? Telephone and email and Skype are sufficient.

I will grant though that teaching is best not when done remotely but in a classroom, but not all my colleagues will agree. 

In the old days, I had to work from a library and got sidetracked and interrupted and wasted time.

Now I can do research and every now and again take a newspaper break. I waste less time.

Working from home is just fine. Even when healthy."
2020-03-11 5:34,"Two things I’ve found about working from home (I’m a commercial photographer who frequently spends long hours in front of the computer between shoots):  First, it takes discipline to work from home. No playing with the cat, doing the dishes, laundry, constant snack trips to the kitchen, Facebook checking, eBay shopping etc.  You’re working from home, and that’s what you should be doing, not everything else (and particularly if your livelihood depends on that discipline).  Second, I find that I can be extremely productive at 2am thru 6am — why?  Nobody is emailing me, calling me, texting or FB messaging me during that time, so I can just put on the BBC and stick my head into my work. 

Actually there is a third thing, and sometimes it can be a bit of a conflict.  As the writer points out, working from home can be socially isolating, and I can sometimes go days without talking to or seeing another person during the course of my working hours.  Consequently when my wife comes home from her 8-4 office job, I am craving conversation.  My wife, on the other hand, has just spent 8 hours in an office surrounded by coworkers, so oftentimes the last thing she wants to do when she walks through the door at 4:30 is to engage in a lot of conversation, so there can be a bit of push-pull trying to appreciate what each other goes through during our respective work days.  But in general we’ve struck a good balance and it’s worked for us for the last 20  years."
2020-03-11 6:09,"Working at home after working in an office (and vice versa!) requires three to four months to get accustomed to. I've done both more than once, but wound up working at home for about 25 years! Yes, your daily interaction with others is reduced, but perhaps it is because I grew up as an only child that my need for such constant interactions is less. I was certainly no hermit, and found many ways to socialize way before the advent of social media -- going out for lunch, going to the gym, going to concerts, meeting up with others who shared my lifestyle (while others toiled away in offices). But this all takes time, months, to adjust to and reorganize your social life."
2020-03-11 6:14,"I’m going to throw my hat in with the WFH crowd. Instead of a commute, I get time for yoga on my back porch.  Instead of a coffee break, I get a brief walk with my dog through the trees.  Instead of distractions, noise, and chatter, I get the peaceful din of my office.  For a change of pace, I’ll go downstairs with my laptop and throw on a vinyl record.  

All of that feeds my creativity, because my mind is rested and at ease."
2020-03-11 6:29,"Wuhan ren have been locked up inside since January 23. My friend has two young children. He is the only one he allowed to shop for his family of four, only when he is in full protective gear, with a mask and goggles covering his face, disposable raincoat and shoe cover. The two young children haven't stepped over the threshold for the entire time. Today, Wuhan has 0 new case. It's supposed to be clearing up now, still, my friend is still skeptical about letting his kids out.

No matter what you think, whether you like it or not, social distancing and self-quarantine are the only options we have, with dwindling supplies of masks, without proper diagnostic capacity, hardly enough medical facilities, without vaccines, without cure, and with too much love for others and our home."
2020-03-11 6:39,Working from home exacerbates the appalling work-creep we are already experiencing in our late-capitalist lives. And we are social beings! Shortening the work week - to 4 days or 5-hour days - is what gives me hope.
2020-03-11 6:48,"I’ve worked semi-remotely for 33 years, gradually getting further distance from people. It worked beautifully when I was a single parent and made my own schedule. Finally, I decided to quit the last portion of my job that kept me in actual human contact three years ago to get off the road. It’s been the most hellish three years of my life. I live in a vacuum: I have no idea what my co-workers look like, let alone think or feel; how I rank in quality or production within the group; I speak to no one all day, but get plenty of unavoidable negativity onscreen 8/hrs a day. There’s no one to turn to for immediate help, no mentor,  no friend, although I reach out. I’ve also developed anxiety, insomnia, cancer and fairly severe heart disease which I did not have before then. Yeah, I’m a production machine. And that’s just what I feel like: a cog in a wheel that would never be missed."
2020-03-11 7:02,"You mentioned commuting, badly designed workspaces and the upside is being around others? 

What about introverts who do best alone? Or self-motivated, hard workers, eager to be productive, but brought down by office politics and worse. 

Ha ha, I'm so grateful I can work from home. I could write a book about working with others. Hostility, insecurity, disorganized, noisy, competitive, not productive are a few words which come to mind. 

I won't detail more because it causes me too much stress to even think about  it. Glad you enjoy it. But wow, I'm betting there are many with similar stories as mine. To each their own."
2020-03-11 7:13,"I’m an introvert, but I’m motivated by external pressures. The office provides the necessary structure and social conformity for me to do my best. Working at home I fall apart, eating too much and slacking off. 

I get along well with my coworkers. If I didn’t, working at home would be a welcome respite."
2020-03-11 7:22,"There are many ways to ""bump"" into people electronically.  We have Whatsapp, twitter, slack, other instant messaging applications, email, facetime, webex and even something called a phone that you can actually talk into and hear another person's voice!  When I want to collaborate and talk with people, sometimes it's planned - but many times it isn't and I can have an imprompu, quick conversation easily - whether typed, video, or voice."
2020-03-11 7:23,"There's no question that, working from home, you lose the energy and creativity of others that surrounds you in the workplace and contributes to your own energy and creativity. There's a reason aspiring screenwriters in LA and NYC like to congregate in certain coffee shops. They're probably not talking to each other much, but they're feeding off the shared energy of belonging and creativity."
2020-03-11 7:26,"Unlike the author I cherish cabin fever.
I can transform my commute into more sleep and I can have a 1h nap at noon which is invaluable given my health pb. The commute alone can eat away between 1 and 2h daily, just think about it.
Interaction with others is easy, I’m already used to work asynchronously and this is a strength.
Sure, social helps once in a while but not all the time."
2020-03-11 7:38,"I suppose I have the best of both worlds. On average I work from home 2-3 days per week. Although I find myself more productive and better able to concentrate from my home office (and my dogs like the company), I have staff and meetings to attend to and feel strongly  that certain creative and collaborative functions are, for the reasons mentioned in the column, better performed or enhanced through direct personal contact.
Any sense of social isolation I experience can be easily offset by working from my local library or favourite coffee shop. 
As a company, we feel that offerring flexible, home working arrangements is critical to continuing to attract an age diverse and talented workforce. I can no envision ever returning to an office based environment. Hopefully, as I will retire in 6-7 years, I’ll never have to."
2020-03-11 7:43,"I'm an extroverted writer who, aside from university teaching, has worked from home for two-and-a-half decades.  Working solo has felt a bit lonely, true, but I do take walks and run errands each day, which allows me to impress my wife with the store clerks, bakers, security guards, sanitation workers, car salesmen, landscapers, firemen, cable technicians, Amazon deliverers, bus drivers, and golden retrievers I know by name. I wouldn't trade it, couldn't trade it. There's something about going to an office that always felt like being back in 6th grade to me. And there's something about waking up each morning and making my own schedule, free to come and go as I please, that has always felt like playing hooky from 6th grade.  A life that has felt like playing hooky has been a good life indeed."
2020-03-11 7:59,"Working from home works great for lots of us. I've done it for 20 years, and never missed the ""spontaneity"" that came from having to be in a space that was not my own, a chair and desk I didn't choose, a lousy or nonexistent view, having to dress up, no place to lie down, constant scrutiny and interruption.... There are lots of entirely remote workplaces that function just fine. At my current job, I feel like we communicate more rapidly on Slack than we every could in person. I agree it's not for everyone, but blanket declarations that it's not viable are inaccurate and unhelpful."
2020-03-11 8:21,"My 13 and 14 year old daughters have absolutely no trouble being creative and spontaneous with their friends through Facechat, Roblox, Minecraft, and other digital social networks. While I think there is still value in face-to-face work, I suspect that some of the issues with work at home today are due to the fact that older workers didn't grow up with the tech that our teens have grown up with. In some ways, this may be similar to the way that it took children to convert an artificial language (American Sign Language) into a full-fledged natural language."
2020-03-11 8:26,"Sorry, I strongly disagree. I worked in an office for 6 years before going freelance. Now I've been working from home for the past 5 years and I couldn't do otherwise. My job - translation - is a creative one, and I find it way more stimulating and more inspiring to sit at my desk, with no office workers making noise around or being able to go out for a walk or a run if my mind is blank without asking my boss if I can take 30 mins off in the middle of the afternoon. And when I come back from that walk, I find inspiration from my own resources. Yes, working from home has its downsides - very little to no interaction with coworkers (but not all coworkers are nice!), you may end up working more than 8 hours, your breaks are sometimes the laundry or other small chores, to name a few. But you don't commute (this is priceless!), nobody will ever shout at you if you start work half an hour later and you can start at 7am if you want/need, you have no dress code to follow, you have basically more freedom, you can walk the dog in the middle of the morning, sometimes you can do things (shopping/doctors/errands) during the day rather than after 6pm like everyone else.
The bottom line is: it's a matter of personality and strong discipline."
2020-03-11 8:39,"What unnerves me about the ""work from home"" gospel is that some bosses then promote an unwritten rule or impression that with the ability to work remotely, you are to be available 24/7, since they are.  Salaried staff, who do not get overtime, are then caught in a bind.  Sure, no one can force you to be online 24/7, but if the majority of your remote colleagues are (or logging in multiple times per day beyond their stated work hours), the impression you then give promoting sanity and work/life balance is that you are not a ""team player."""
2020-03-11 8:46,"Creative people don’t need to show in the office to create. Most artists, musicians, painters, writers, etc. etc. did their magnificent works, not in the office, but at home or any space they could find. Let’s not blame lack of creativity on working from home."
2020-03-11 8:54,"The best thing companies can do is to offer both! I work for a company that says its totally fine to work from home but encourages people to come into the office for the social bonding aspect.

So if I want to really grind with 0 distractions I might choose to work from home but most days I go into the office"
2020-03-11 9:00,"Been working out of my home office for more than 20 years now and have no interest in traveling to a work place, especially when I have my 7 year-old Irish Terrier Suzie to entertain (and protect) me. She protected one day a few years back when she was barking like a cat had invaded the house. When I got out of bed to investigate I found a stranger roaming my house. I got my 38 caliber revolver and escorted the unwanted visitor off the property. Meanwhile Suzie discovered a mouse hiding in my TV couch. Finally I had to overturn the bulky couch so that she could get at the little rat. She killed it and then left it on the floor for my inspection. So I think I will stay home until they come and get me. Blissful solitude with Suzie works for me."
2020-03-11 9:12,"If you work in a happy (or at least respectful) workplace then this op-ed has a fair point.  But if, like many, you work in a stressful (or even toxic workplace), then it will be a silver lining on the current cloud to get away from that environment for a while.  Hardly cause for celebration, when contemplated more deeply, but for now perhaps a welcome respite and relief."
2020-03-11 9:13,"I work from home and love it. As for collaboration, chat applications like Teams and Slack work great."
2020-03-11 9:20,"Group creativity is overrated, unless everyone in the group is creative. The most powerful people in the group can tend to tamp down creativity for the sake of their own more conventional thinking. And ultimately, most of the ""creatives"" in a work environment—writers and artists—do their work alone. That's when they can bring their creativity to bear on a project, even if the ""idea"" (think advertising) has been imposed on them. Between that idea and the finished product is the necessary mediation of a creative mind."
2020-03-11 9:20,Working from home your carbon footprint is way lower.  Seen the satellite images of clean skies over China recently?  Imagine all those freeways around the world not clogged with emission-spewing vehicles twice daily during commute hours.
2020-03-11 9:23,"For a place where a nebulous quantity like ""creativity"" is highly valued, consider the typical university department. 

More and more academics are splitting time between offices and home these days because all the articles are online, and it is efficient and more organized to have an ongoing shared dropbox account and google drive folder with your co-authors. 

Academics have also taken to videoconferencing like ducks to water, given the proliferation of international collaboration that sometimes means you need to skype your co-author at 10pm. 

Furthermore, many university campuses are placed rather far from high density population centers, meaning we either decide between living in a tiny locale or commuting around an hour for work. If it weren't for classes, meetings, and (for some of us) lab work, many of us wouldn't come in but once or twice a week. This feeling has been particularly acute lately since many face-to-face classes and meetings have been cancelled this semester due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

So are we missing some sort of spark of collaborative genius that comes only from spontaneous face-to-face encounters with colleagues? I can't speak for my compadres, but in my case I can safely say no. This happens already at conferences."
2020-03-11 9:27,"Not everyone needs human interaction or external stimulation to get creative. Some, maybe a minority, but people exist who do their best work away from people and in the comfort of their own sanctuary."
2020-03-11 9:33,"The point is that if you and the business are set up to do both, you get the best of both worlds. 100% of one or the other have significant downsides for most jobs."
2020-03-11 9:36,"Very interesting article and a number of points have been covered. I have read a few comments even. However I have my own opinion about it.

Not everyone can work from home that’s for sure. Professionals like Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, Pharmacists, Quality Control Chemists, Nurses, Chefs etc simply can’t work from home and so are blue collar workers.

Even those, who are eligible for working from home simply can’t do it if their children distract them from working. 

As rightly mentioned in this article and by the readers, there are a number of advantages in working at home and also few disadvantages like lack of personal interaction with colleagues and loneliness. 

Working environment and even home environment matters most. If the environment is bad at both places, then which one is better ? May be a million dollars question.

If the working environment is better, working in office will surely compensate for the stress and strain involved in commuting and also will be providing relief from day to day tension at home if any."
2020-03-11 9:45,"I loathe working on-site with a passion. I was self-employed for a number of years as a Computer Consultant and worked remotely about 80% of that time. At a “normal” job, I used to spend over an hour each way to work and back. Not so with telecommuting. I would simply get dressed (in comfortable clothing!), go to my home office, and fire up my workstation. If I needed to clear my head, I would contact a coworker, do some exercise, or run to the store. Then, refreshed, I’d get back to work. 

Contrast with my job today: I’m in an office building downtown. Fortunately I no longer have to commute so far, I can be to work in 20 minutes on a good day. I have my own office in a mostly (shudder) open plan building. Nevertheless, it is loud, sound carries. This has a detrimental effect on my productivity as I easily lose my concentration. The lights are either on or off in my office, there is no attenuating their intensity for personal comfort. It’s either too hot or too cold as coworkers fight over the HVAC controls. No quick 20 minute runs to clear my head any more. I must look presentable. If I need a break, I trudge to the water cooler, endure the stale smell of coffee and cigarette smoke on my coworkers’ breath and socialize. Then trudge back to my office. I’m one of those introverted people who can find too much interaction exhausting. 

Ideally, I’d work one day once a week or two on-site and the rest of the time work from home."
2020-03-11 10:04,"In many ways, we still live in an atavistic society where the employer must keep an eye on the employee by requiring wasted time in long commutes, nonproductive meetings, and the physical presence of workers in a sterile office setting. 

 I believe this demonstrates the time tested McGregor's theory of X vs. Y style of management.  The X style of management is characterized by distrust of the employee and requires close supervision by an autocratic management. The Y style views the employee in a positive way with an emphasis on employee self-direction that is conducive to working at home. 

In my experience, I witnessed more of the X autocratic management style that in the end did not lend itself to creativity or collaboration as everyone was more or less siloed in their race to compete and please the boss."
2020-03-11 10:09,"This article assumes that our co-workers are in our local office with us, and that its an ""all or none"" approach to working from home.  The reality of it is that large corporations have members of the same team assigned to different offices, so whether you are in the office or at home you are still ""remote"" working from your immediate team members.  And as with all things in life, its more about finding the balance of home vs work than all or none."
2020-03-11 10:16,"It depends on the job and the person.  In my experience, writing and supporting software systems for a global corporation, working from home was far and away the better choice. Here are a few reasons why working at home was a good choice for me.

1. my commute was over two hours round trip, on most days, but when there was an accident or road work, it could be over three or even four hours. I had to leave the house at 5:30 am to be at my cubical by 7 am. Working from home gave me time for more human activities, like getting some exercise or watching the sun come up.  I did not have the stress of a commute added to every single day. And I made more money without the long list of expenses of driving and wearing out cars.

2. working odd hours to meet deadlines and meeting with people on the other side of the world presents logistical challenges when doing it at the office, in a big city.  So it quickly devolves into more stress when you have to keep hours at the office and at home.  

3. my work required focus when solving difficult problems. I am a morning person so for me that is when I have the most brain energy.  See no. 1.  I was able to rely on the quiet and solitude of my home office to think through problems, carefully and methodically, which typically resulted in better results. This added to my happiness.  No surprise here.

Looking back, the most creative, productive, and satisfying work I did in my career was in my home office."
2020-03-11 11:05,"I think the big take away is, there is no clear cut winner in the work from home debate.  Bottom line it works for some and not for others.  I don't think you cam claim the loss of innovation and creativity for everyone.  I have worked on remote teams my entire professional career.  Even if I were to go into my assigned office no one on my, very large team, is also assigned to it.  Furthermore, my team are WFH veterans who aren't scared of a quick ping or hoping on a video chat if we need to talk through something.  And we interact about none work stuff all the time during meetings,  who doesn't want to know what the weather is like everywhere else? Or how everyone's weekend was?  We had a virtual baby shower last month full of team baby pictures and family memories last month. I go to the gym 5 days a week for over an hour and interact with countless people there while working in my physical well being instead of a traditional lunch.  I and the majority of my team excel at working from home.  But I have worked with numerous people who needed to be in an office and did not make it in a remote environment.  I just don't think this need to qualify which is better is useful.  I don't think making everyone do it would be beneficial or taking it away/ limiting it would be either. So why must we always discuss it? I guess a wishy washy article wouldn't be a story but come on time to let this go."
2020-03-11 11:21,"As it happens, I have no choice in the matter.  Two jobs that take me out of the house are lecturer at the University of Latvia, which is twice a week during the first half of each semester.  I had my last lecture of this semester this past Monday.  And then the TV show that I do every evening, which requires me to go to the TV station.  Luckily, the TV station is literally three doors down from where I live.  I will be moving house soon, and then that will no longer be true, but that's not the point.  I make most of my living as a translator, and that requires only me and my computer.  I don't always manage to focus on work as much as I should, because lord, there are temptations on the Internet, including the New York Times homepage.  But generally speaking, I am all good with this.  Today I fixed myself some fish sticks and French fries with a green salad (the two former because I'm an unreconstructed teenage boy and the latter because I do try to eat well despite that fact).  Now I am hour away from going to the TV station, after which I will be coming home, doing some more work, and then going downstairs to watch TV and drink some wine.  All good, all good, all good."
2020-03-11 11:25,"I have been a full-time writer working from a home office since before I sold my first book in December 1993. My youngest child was 3. Working from home and being a mother of school-aged children made me a target for all volunteer vampires from here to eternity. “She’s home with the kids. Let’s ask her.” One of the biggest issues women with children face while working from home is other demands. It takes a great deal of discipline to demand office time and—barring emergencies—stick to it. The beauty of this life allowed me to have a career while still being available for snow days, sick days, etc. for my 3 children. And when my husband was dying from cancer, I was able to put him first. No one told me I had to be at my cubicle anywhere at a certain time. There are pros and cons to working from home, but I would not trade the proximity of my coffee pot and the memories for anything."
2020-03-11 11:44,"Thanks Kevin! Your article describes my experience well. I have a long commute to work, so I appreciate days when I can save time and work from home. However, those days are most productive used to bang out work on a project where I already have a plan. For tasks that do not have a clear solution, being at the office and talking to my team and other experts throughout the company is a huge benefit, despite being an introvert who needs quiet space and time to think things through.

I am a scientist and I find that most scientific problems can't be solved by one person, it takes input from multiple experts to get to creative and useful solutions. Perhaps that's not true in other fields, but it is certainly the case for me!"
2020-03-11 11:47,"I think working from home is wonderful, but special training is needed (eg, block some sites).

There is HD video camera and microphone for interactions as well."
2020-03-11 11:53,"I totally disagree.  Remote workers are as creative and innovative as office workers when they use apps to connect with their colleagues.  Meetings are more focused and productive.  I've developed genuine friendships with people I've never met face-to-face, connected with colleagues all over the world, and received citations for my creative and innovative solutions."
2020-03-11 12:01,"Sorry, no. Anyone working from home because of the outbreak is not suddenly an expert on remote work. Working from your kitchen is super uncommon for an actual remote employee, most of us, myself included, have actual dedicated spaces for our work that allow us to detach at the end of the day. We’ve also learned routines and set boundaries and schedules so that we aren’t trapped at our desks day and night alone. I’m sorry that had been your (brief) experience but it is not the norm. I’m a remote employee and frequently have lively conversation with my team remotely, my manager and I have adhoc brainstorming sessions via zoom whenever we start to see that Slack isn’t cutting it. I have random conversations with people also working when I’m at coffee shops and also working. I am active on LinkedIn and in my professional network and organization locally. It’s your job as a professional to stay at the top of your game, and you definitely don’t need an office with free snacks to do it. Plus, the coffee at home and the dog napping at my feet and way better."
2020-03-11 12:04,"I've been working from home for over 12 years. So, so thankful that I quit my 'tied-to-the-office' job to accept the challenge of self-employment. I keep my own hours; work in my own way; engage with folk I want to engage with; and, most of all, get to enjoy my dogs all day long, and not just for a half hour walk prior to collapse in the evening.

Solitude is not for everyone, and the right combination of folk in a workplace can make it highly enjoyable and dynamic. But it is difficult to guarantee that the right group will come together; and open plan offices are a disaster in terms of productivity and creativity, even when people in the groups might gel in the right circumstances."
2020-03-11 12:08,"I have been working from home since 2000, the past 20 years.  I have had jobs where I had to travel 20-40% at times but I would not trade my situation for anything.  I put 5000 miles a year on my car.  I am not adding to the carbon footprint in a big way.  I save money on gas, eating out, buying work clothes and I have two extra hours a day to run, do hobbies that I love and work around my house.  I am well paid, work for a world class firm. I have plenty of friends, acquaintances, etc.  And I rarely ever get the flu.  And now I don't have to worry about being exposed to the new threat in a huge way."
2020-03-11 12:18,"Many of the premises may be correct that surface level. Because I'm a full time remote employee, and I'm someone for whom remote employment is suited, I have a clear bias. But I question the research and the conclusions you draw from it - namel the overarching ""we should go into an office."" Given the vast benefits of transitioning more people to remote work, including how we use the finite space of the planet's surface area more thoughtfully and how we reduce emissions that are largely created by transportation, I also find the conclusions a little dangerous and off base. The presuppositions that bother me most are 1) that we need to be in an office to create the spontaneous interactions with co-workers that drive creativity, and 2) that we need to interact face to face with colleagues at our current companies to help be creative in approaching work problems. Adam Grant of ""Originals"" suggests people in our general field but those further from the specific problem or context are the best evaluators of original ideas. In person or virtual salons with people from your field could foster the same results.  So while the office looks like the best solution, it's really just a convenient one that prefers the status quo over what could be profound and beneficial change. Though at least this conclusion proves one assertion of the piece: in your case, working from home has seemed to limit creative problem solving."
2020-03-11 12:21,"Before I retired I felt that I had the best of both worlds working from home about 1/3 of the time spread over a year.

I had an office to myself both at home & also at work, so no distractions.

I found it helpful when at home to dress as if I was going in to work.

If I had my time again I would try for a 50/50 split, again spread over a year.

In the current circumstances I would be in the fortunate position of being able to work from home full time (I am at high risk, asthma, scarring on my lungs & compromised immune system). Unfortunately my staff wouldn't be able to work from home regardless of underlying health issues. That would have made me, at best, very uncomfortable."
2020-03-11 12:32,"I was a self-employed occupational health & safety consultant who worked from home for 10 years. That was 20 years ago before the internet technology was established. It was more productive and less expensive than working in an office environment. Unfortunately, I have that option no longer & am forced to work in an office. In the new normal office there is: no privacy (open office configuration), construction noise, poor ventilation, constant interruptions from co-workers, micromanaging supervillains (supervisors), and plethora of of other negative externalities.  So in my opinion, home-office (non-communal work environment) is preferable."
2020-03-11 12:39,"I live an hour from Grand Central.  I’ve been working from home for over 6 years.  I have saved  over 5400 hours of time not having to get to MetroNorth, ride it round trip and get home   $21,600 on train fare (not including gas, mileage and parking to get to Metro North)   dog sitting cost of about $30,000 (that’s a conservative estimate as I used $100/week x 50 weeks x 6) during that time.  I am in the executive recruiting biz so not working in an open loft space that my company provides and working in a quiet suburban home is preferable.  I will not be on a MetroNorth train for a while if I can help it."
2020-03-11 12:40,"It's sort of laughable to compare working-from-home with a quarantine-type situation. Nor can one wfh for a week or two here and there while researching a newspaper article, and really get a feel for it.  If your office is in your office, when you get home your focus necessarily shifts to everything else in your life. Working from home in that case is sort like having two work days instead of one.  When you get your head around the flow of having your office at home, your work day is truly transformed.  It's not an accident that companies invest a lot in creating work environments that make workers feel at home - a campus they would say, of course, and at times collegial interaction can lead to 'aha' moments. But if you think back to your college days most of the time, that interaction was mostly just distraction. With Skype or Zoom and whatnot you can be reached quickly and reach out quickly when you need to.  I've done all three: a near-decade at the office, a near-decade with two offices, one at work and one at home, and a near-decade completely at-home work, and there are pros and cons to each situation.  But in my humble opinion, in 2020 wfh is without question and by far the best of the three options."
2020-03-11 12:40,"Many people don't know how to communicate well outside of face to face conversations, especially when there is considerable lag time between communications.  Some people cannot even communicate well in phone conversations with more immediate responses.  

On the other hand, many communicate better in writing (or designed and edited videos) than in extemporaneous speech because they prefer to gather and refine their thoughts before expressing them to others; and they prefer others to do the same.  

There is an art to corresponding in different ways without meeting in person, and the art needs to be cultivated.  Also, there seems to me to be far more chance of finding good, helpful random ideas online as in person, since there are far more ideas available online.  The trick in both places is separating the wheat from the chaff -- finding the more likely stimulating sources rather than the ones that waste your time."
2020-03-11 12:48,"I’ve worked from home on and off for the past 10 years, including college. In my personal experience, I’m much happier and do much better in a work from home setting. No commute is the largest benefit for me, followed by the ability to ignore distracting coworkers.

My boss sets up optional video conferences for our department about once a month, sometimes two, and I find these are just as good, if not more productive than our mandatory, in-office, start-of-the-morning pointless pep talk.

I’m less aware of employee attrition which can be depressing when you see employees changing day-to-day while in the office. I don’t have to work put on my corporate fake smile nor have to do the superficial good mornings to coworkers I pass while heading for my office.

I’m not viewed as someone who isn’t a team player because I always declined lunch invites by coworkers in the office. It’s not that I was opposed to getting to know my coworkers, I just find dining out for lunch is waste of money. Maybe it’s my personality, or my love for my pets and plants more than people [slight sarcasm], but working from home is literally the best work option I’ve ever had!"
2020-03-11 12:48,"If you feel isolated then you’re doing it wrong. Remote work does not mean isolation, I run a company that is fully distributed and our team happiness (anonymously measured) is through the roof.

The gap of working from home has to be made up with a LOT of video chats. Spend 4 hours on video calls and then tell me you feel isolated."
2020-03-11 13:02,"One of the side issues in the debate about working from home vs in an office:
 
We are a notoriously NON-diverse nation. On the whole people from different races, however defined;  ethnic backgrounds; and socio-economic groups just to not socialize. 

Work is one of the areas where we do come into contact with people we might not ever have seen otherwise, and from that contact, there more social interaction.  One gets to be more aware of different political views and what's behind them, and of the shared struggles.

As little isolated islands, people do not get that."
2020-03-11 13:09,"The best option is a combination of working from home and in an office in my experience.

Being in the office 5 days/week for me would be unproductive and exhausting, but 5 days at home is too isolating.

I personally like being in 1-3 days (depending on the week) for collaboration with colleagues and brainstorming, followed by being able to put my head down and just work at home.

I have co-workers who live 2-3 hours from the office and come in 1-2 days a week but need the stimulation of people, but they’ve found renting a co-working space or desk outside of their home but in the same town works great for them.

The key is finding what works best for you and your team and hoping you have a job / boss who agrees."
2020-03-11 9:03,"There are myriad comments here from folks who laud the ability to work at home.  All those other, supposed poor sucker slaves sequestered in the office maybe don't have the time and leisure or leeway to take up the banner on behalf of working in the office because, well, they are working in the office under somebody's thumb.

It's worth remembering that those who work from home are paying for their own electricity and heating, buying the upgrades to their computers and shelling out for the most bandwidth available in order to match up with what the company or client expects.   You paid for those office supplies and that desk and ergonomic chair and that LED lamp and whatever else you might need to be a decked out worker in the spare room.

If we know anything about American business, it's about how lucrative it is for them to classify folks as independent contractors and offload costs on anyone who will bear them.  Apps and the internet have given us the gig economy where people are expected to work for a pittance round the clock with no safety net or benefits to buttress their for-wages-only situation.

Beware the double edged sword of a company that's looking to downsize its capital costs and extraneous expenses onto you.  Do a cost benefit analysis.  If you gain from working at home, good on you.  Maybe you are being exploited for all your luxuriating in yoga pants--and many Americans are exploited at the lower echelons,  and then maybe the trade off isn't fair."
2020-03-11 13:15,"""Most people should work in an office..."" except ""...others who aren’t well served by a traditional office setup."" Your argument is dizzying. You can't make sweeping declarations how WFH should be (or not be) for all people. It's ridiculous.

Some people will love it (me), some people won't (you). Some people's offices are sterile boring environments where people don't talk, while others are bustling beehives. Some people use a ton of online interactivity to chat all day, while others haven't—cannot—or don't. Some people live in a stimulating household with outdoor space, while others live in an urban closet. Some people have a 2+ hour round-trip commute in horrendous traffic, while others can walk to the office in 2 minutes.

There is no magical right answer. It's whatever works for you and your company."
2020-03-11 7:53,"I worked from home doing medical reports for the last 10 years of my work career. I think the secret is to have dedicated office space. Check into the office each morning just like any other office. Maintain a business atmosphere. No stupid chitter-chatter from other workers to waste my time. No excess noise issues. And a boss who left me alone because my work got done timely. And at the end of the year, a tax break for costs related to the home office. What's not to like?"
2020-03-11 11:31,I’ll pass. Love working from home.
2020-03-11 2:35,"If your colleagues are clever, yeah work near or with them can be fun, but not everyone gets to work at the Times or at Apple. Doh.

2020-03-11 6:51,"The number of comments seem to heavily favor working from home. It's almost as if everyone who commented is an introvert. What's missing is what are you people all doing that allow you to work from home? What are your jobs? What are typical jobs that allow for this?

You're all living my dream. Please help a fellow introvert out in figuring out their options for working at home! Maybe then I will no longer have to use my weekends to hide from family and friends."
2020-03-11 2:24,"I don't feel sorry for you at all, I am FORCED to take the germ ridden NYC SUBWAY to work daily as well as a germ ridden commuter bus from NJ to NYC. God forbid I catch this virus, I will probably die from it. I am wearing a mask on the bus and the train starting tomorrow. I finally got a hold of some N95 masks to wear.  I really wonder if Gov. Cuomo will shut down the city the way Italy has shut down that country."

We wash our hands, use elbows, rejoice in existence of handicap buttons, walk around with wipes. If you get sick, your FMLA is to keep your job but you must use all your sparse leave then go FMLA leave without pay.   Maybe you get lucky with the sick leave pool, doubtful if there is a big sick out.  And I’m a professional."
2020-03-11 11:39,"This is an incredibly irresponsible article to write. Epidemiologists and public health experts are urging more offices to do this, and yet some (like mine) have resisted for the sake of ""productivity.""

You should be lucky that you work for a company that cares about your health and the public and stop giving fodder to those who don't. Shame!"

2020-03-11 13:22,"Like many commenters, I, too, have worked from home for a number of years.  I think, however, that the editorial misses the point.  Whether we like working at home or not, are productive or not, are innovative or not, are beside the point. The point is we have a public health crisis, and those that can work from home should.  The timing of this editorial is completely tone-deaf.  We should concentrate on the issues and offer advice on how to make working at home more successful."
2020-03-11 13:29,"As a self identified ambivert and marketing professional I can attest that working from home exclusively doesn't work for me or my team. Sometimes, yes. It's about balance and the type of work that needs to be done, not a one size fits all. Unless you are self-employed it's also about trust and accountability. My employees have the option of working at home, but not exclusively. There is magic that happens when we're in a room together - even the introverts contribute, and things get done."
2020-03-11 13:30,"Maybe those who hate working from home were never creative or innovative enough to begin with. There are plenty of online means to connect, network and collaborate these days. Working from home not only offers the freedom to find more creative ways to make those connections, if you want them, but also to get to know yourself."
2020-03-11 13:30,"Working from home is what you make of it. I have a space dedicated to it. But, it is also the same space where I do creative tasks like paint. So, it is a space designed to get the creative juices flowing. 

I take a few 10 minute breaks to walk around my garden, snack on freshly pulled snap peas or arugula and get back to work. Being in California, I have the luxury of being able to work outside at a table in March (70 degrees yesterday!).

My house is clean because I organize or do laundry while on conference calls. I am eating healthier and save $100-200 this week.

I am going in on Thursday to break up the routine. But, it will be hard to go into the office every day once this over."
2020-03-11 13:52,"I've worked from home for years and I would never go back to the office. My teams are spread globally. Our meetings are video based and it is excellent for creativity. I have a dedicated space in my home, which is also my studio. I'm an extrovert and I don't feel depri ed of social interaction. We have in person team meetings about once a quarter. I get to take my son to school, pick him up, and handle my daily life. It's a great work life balance. As a computer-geek/creative, I've worked in open bays and shared offices. Those environments don't guarantee productivity or creativity, but they do guarantee a myriad of distractions I can't control or turn off. There are worse problems to have in the world. Remote work is the way to go."

2020-03-11 14:01,"I find it much more difficult to work through team problems remotely. There's something that's just missed trying to solve problems on a phone call versus in person. You can't hear people as well over the phone, you can't see their faces, you can't take turns properly, and you naturally speak less, I find. I, too, prefer working in an office rather than at home. What I don't like is the commute.

The office space and culture also make a big difference. I currently work in two very different office spaces. In one, I have an office, as do most people. If you need quite time, you can close the door and put do not disturb on your IM. If you don't, you can leave the door open. There are pods in the middle of offices to allow people to casually sit together and chat, and a whiteboard in front of each of them to write out your ideas. In the other work space, there are no casual communal chat areas like pods, no casual white board spaces. Everyone is in a cubicle. It's cheaper for the employer to have that set up, but it's so much less pleasant and leaves the worker feeling exposed and unable to get focus time if they need it. And people actually talk to each other less, I find, in such environments. I still prefer it to working at home, though, and I classify myself as an introvert. Introverts are not people who don't need any social interaction, we just have to keep it within limits. And sitting by myself for hours on end is too much for me."

I've often worked on projects that require meetings in person and when I feel ""couped-up"" I step outside for a breath of fresh air.   I also use good lighting and make sure that my work area is used for work (mostly).   Now working as a freelancer I appreciate not being involved in office politics and other stupid human behaviors.   Personality types do matter in terms of whether or not working at home can be successful.  One has to be self-motivated with an awareness of deadlines and a desire to do their best work, and, for heaven's sake, answer emails promptly."
2020-03-11 14:21,"In 2020 spending two hours a day sitting in a shiny metal box that's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere and clogging shared infrastructure thus necessitating the laying-down of even more asphalt is frankly a ridiculous way of spending 250 days of each and every year.  In the seventies my parents used to call it ""the rat race"".  Sting wrote a song about it in the 80's.   We've been collectively bashing our heads on dashboards for too long - the technology has finally arrived and I'm really hoping that this is finally the year that we can take a pause from that,  give our heads a shake and move on."
2020-03-11 14:30,"All discussions of working at home seem to assume that it is either good or bad.  For someone with a recently emptied nest and limited social group, it is lonely and stultifying to work at home, and I seek reasons to head to the office.

When I was recently out of the hospital after being hit by a car, it was the only road back to work and I'm so happy I can.

In this time of contagion, offices prepared for widespread working at home will be far more functional.  But individuals should think hard about how they can best cope."
2020-03-11 14:23,It is very amusing that the arguments you use to push working in an office are the exact arguments used to promote the open office plan which you correctly deride as horrible.
2020-03-11 14:40,5 day- 40 hour work weeks are overrated. Nothing like watching your life fly by while making someone else richer.
2020-03-11 14:51,"I couldn't disagree with this more! Since I started working at home, I have never been happier or more productive.  I get to work with my dogs sleeping at my feet.  I can open a window to get natural light and smell the fresh air.  Make a doctor's appointment or another personal phone call without everyone around me overhearing.  I willingly attend late meetings knowing that dinner is already in the oven. I get a head start on the day by answering emails first thing in the morning...in my pajamas.     I fear ever having to go back to an office. Telecommuting should be available and supported by all companies that have the means to offer it."
2020-03-11 15:03,"I'm glad to see so many comments here from folks who know the pleasures, and the productivity, of working from home. The writer of this Op-Ed obviously is ill-suited for such a thing, as he regards his co-workers' presence in an office setting as ""stimulating,"" but I think he's wrong to infer from his personal outlook that this is a ""truth"" we should all accept. Doubtless the coronavirus outbreak will, in the near term, lead to a vast increase in working from home -- and who knows, for those who enjoy it, a vast increase in worker satisfaction -- something that this article completely ignores."

2020-03-11 15:20,"Perhaps I'm unique.  I work primarily from home doing research.  However, I still meet with colleagues, both in person and on the phone so we can toss around ideas.  I also teach in college, requiring work from home on lesson plans and grading, but going in once a week for each class to teach.  In both situations, I work at home but also have interactions with people, the best of both worlds.  To save money, many offices have changed traditional office seating, substituting the latter with work stations.  This is an arrangement that my son is intimately familiar.  Although it might be fun when workers are young, this arrangement is less than ideal for older workers, or workers who do a lot of writing.  In fact, for my friends who are in a similar office arrangement, they find their efficiency is reduced.  Everyone sits around a table, earplugs in, sending texts and emails to people sitting nearby rather than getting up and interacting.  As for what Steve Jobs thought, he also thought he could beat pancreatic cancer by diet.  Clearly, his judgement is far from perfect."
2020-03-11 15:36,"I'd love a hybrid - work from home on certain days, and work at the office on certain days. Some of my work is better done without interruption, and I can easily do that work at home. When I'm at the office, I'm constantly interrupted by noise, social interaction, impromptu meetings...  I recently had to work into the night because I was interrupted during the day by an unnecessarily long meeting. The next day, I was tired and unable to be creative with coworkers like the author."
2020-03-11 15:46,"I've been working from home for over a decade.  I loathed going into an office every day.  I don't miss the commute, office politics, people wasting my time, committees and pointless meetings.  The thought of ever having to return to that life makes me a little nauseous."
2020-03-11 15:52,"With all the serendipitous creative ideas coming out of office mini kitchens, there must be tens of thousands of examples of great ideas that led to profitable business. I would love to read about some...... Problem is, nobody ever cites these examples. I'm not sure they exist and suspect it's a myth."
2020-03-11 15:58,"I believe the key is “flexibility”. Flexibility to have an option to chose when I want to work from home and when to travel few hours a day to office. I take this call based on what I want to achieve on a particular day. There are days when I just want to focus, create content, or finish my tasks. I prefer to work from home to achieve it. On other days when I am looking for ideas, interact with people to know what everyone is doing, and share ideas, I drive 2 hours to work. This also helps me socialize and keep my work network.  I have been following this practice for last 3 years and it has worked well for me. And I am thankful to my boss & the organization for providing the option to do that."
2020-03-11 16:17,"I work from home one day a week. It allows me to focus on demanding technical tasks. For me, it's the perfect balance."
2020-03-11 16:36,"It sounds like you're just an extrovert assuming that what you don't enjoy, no one should enjoy. Working from home is not for everyone. When I work from home, I am less anxious, happier, more productive and the deep focus time is where I get my best ideas. Many remote workers will tell you the same thing. Go back to the office and stop trying to ruin remote work for the people who thrive in it."
2020-03-11 16:56,"For me, the best option is a combination - work from home when you can, come in to the office when face-to-face meetings are more efficient (or enjoyable) than virtual meetings."
2020-03-11 16:58,"This article makes a lot of good points about the benefits of working at home, being focused and not being interrupted. It also makes great points about the value of face to face interaction. As someone who worked for 35 years in the business of connecting people using technology, I've seen many studies and heard many opinions on the subject. The good news is that with shared work spaces and tools like Slack, Zoom, WebEx and MS Teams we can create our own mix - interacting live (with video is my personal favorite) when remote and going to a shared space when it's beneficial. I've even seen teams set up permanent video connections so that they can ""walk by"" the work spaces of others and have impromptu conversations when remote. We'll never get this exactly right but the tools that are available today - and will be made ever more capable in the future - give us options to mix and match our personal/alone time with our face to face time in ways that meet our needs and allow us to react to special situations like the COVID-19 outbreak. Keep experimenting everyone until you find that mix that works for you."
2020-03-11 17:01,"I am sitting at home with pink eye right now wishing that I had the opportunity to not miss time at work! I’ve also had snow days or child illnesses where the kids are home unexpectedly. I had a few days where my back went out... and if I’m honest, days where my more introverted nature would prefer to work quietly, focused  and alone. Also women take a fair amount of time and energy “getting ready for work” that could be spent on actually working. Add in a commute on top of that? And all in all, sweatpants are one of man’s kindest inventions. So there is not one argument that could persuade me at this point, that life wouldn’t be exponentially easier and more productive (not to mention more comfortable) if I had the option of working from home."
2020-03-11 17:01,"I agree with the belief that 1-2 days working from home is ideal.  People would be more inclined to work at their office if their office space was a place that engendered creativity and collaboration.  Workplace culture in America is just awful, and people don't enjoy working at offices because of it.  Lack of open communication, and poorly designed spaces are among the many factors that contribute to the widespread gravitation towards remote work."
2020-03-11 17:02,"It is clearly not one size fits all. Jobs was a great visionary, perhaps, lacking skill in interpersonal relations. He was not a multidimensional expert which is true of most of us. I would need to see the studies the author quotes, before accepting their paraphrased validity.  Extroverts feed off the contact. Introverts feed off the alone time. It would not be complex to evaluate the temperament of one's employees and respond accordingly. I am a retired introvert who relished working at home enhancing the peace I need to be creative and productive. Ambiverts would be problematic in such a system. Malcolm Gladwell has revealed that he likes to work in noisy restaurants. Many of us don't. Those of us that don't relish ""noise"" can opt to call other employees from home at breaks. The viability of that option seems unaddressed in the essay. Perhaps it will be addressed in the author's book."
2020-03-10 19:56,There is no reason to have spectators at any sporting event while we have a potential (or actual) pandemic. Television coverage should be sufficient.
2020-03-10 21:03,"Meanwhile we are doing almost nothing to cancel one of the biggest disease vectors: public schools. While children may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, they are silently infecting many older adults who work in those schools. A number of my coworkers are in their 60s and have weakened immune systems. Do the lives of us adults not matter?"
2020-03-11 0:21,"I wonder why they couldn't hold the tournament without audiences? I've already seen a couple of winter sports events held with no audiences - just the competitors, officials, and TV crews.  If, as others have said, the crowd can be a major influence on the match, well, all players will suffer the same lack, so conditions will be equal. (The same way some players benefit and others suffer when the weather is hot, for example)

The town would still take a hit from all the cancelled hotel bookings, restaurant meals, etc, but the tournament would still collect its broadcast fees, and players would still earn points in the standings and so on."
2020-03-10 20:42,"A crisis brings out the best and worst in people. Professional sports in general have failed the test - MLB, NBA, NHL are the worst. They have put greed and the safety of their players over the lives of their fans. Sad. So good for Tennis! They at least show concern for their players and fans alike."
2020-03-10 22:37,"No, ""anxiety"" didn't force this; prudent, basic public health measures to try to slow down the still mostly ""silent"" spread (given testing disaster).

I thought that the Corona Virus would not affect us in the US so soon and at such a magnitude but if you are right, then that would explain why most of my friends are not going to Indian Wells this spring to watch the Tennis Masters in person."

I’m sure you know this

The tournament sent an email to ticket holders 10 days ago and offered a refund if you were nervous about attending 

You probably know the average age of this tournament’s ticket holders in the lower bowl.  Has to be the oldest group in all of tennis.

Lots of them took the refund offer.

The tournament realized they may be playing to half full venues at best.

Then, the Volunteers.  Mostly local of course. Mostly vintage folks.  Well you know their position on working the tournament in the face of the current hysteria.

I’m sure your research confirmed what I summarized here.....

2020-03-10 13:07,"Rome was not built in one day.  So was the stock market crashing to near the bear market level.  It will take effort and time by the Trump administration to make it right.  And his future of presidency depends on his performance.

Trump needs a victory tour before November after the Covid-19 crisis and stock market recovery if there is one.  Xi Jinping just did that with a visit yesterday to the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of Covid-19.  It instantly enhanced his credibility and trustworthiness.  Trump badly needs one like that.  

We will see how good Trump really is as the leader of this country. We will find out who is naked during low tide."
2020-03-10 13:30,"The Emperor has no clothes.  His ""base"" may or may not finally come to grips with the fact that he used them to get elected and cares none about them in reality.  The markets are showing us that leadership counts, even if it means being honest, humble and empathetic, but mostly being engaged and taking ownership.  Trump clearly has had no practice at any of this.
What is even more basic in the concerns is that we are all so smart, the internet gives us everything we need, technology has solved all of our problems and made our lives so simple, and yet here we are spreading germs around the globe that might kill us.  And all the internet and our government can do is spread misinformation.  It is almost shocking that this interruption of our lives can't be avoided...we are powerless and our mortality is now quite evident.
Us ""Okay Boomers"" are not the ones spreading the virus, we survived polio, smallpox, measles and the cold war, and we know humans aren't as smart as we think.  Except for our Boomer President of course...he makes us all look bad."

2020-03-10 13:44,When this virus causes millions to be hospitalized at the same time  will that tilt the major health insurers toward bankruptcy?
2020-03-10 13:50,"Panics are the reciprocal of bubbles. In a bubble, no one wants to be the first to sell; in  panic, no one want to be the first to buy. But when they deflate, things return to normal. 

If this virus behaves like the flu, and takes the Spring and Summer off, there will a lot of money to be made in the next few months. And the best economic policy for government to follow is likely the same as that which is generally the best for government to follow: do nothing. Certainly, this is no time whatsoever for ratcheting up spending, especially on handouts, freebies, and giveaways, which never go away. 

On the upside, this virus demonstrates that government policy can create the conditions for prosperity -- freedom -- but cannot guarantee it. (Whereas leftist policy can, and does, guarantee catastrophe) Hopefully, it will reinforce the difference between causation and coincidence. W didn't cause the 2008 meltdown; leftist ""affordable housing"" policies did. BHO had nothing to do with the improving economy; quite the contrary: he did everything he could to prevent it.

And nothing DT, or anyone, could have done, would have ameliorated the effects of a virus-born panic.

The economy will fix itself, like it always does, and the less government tries to ""help"", the faster the recovery will  occur."

There is not one single person who knows where all these terrible cross currents are taking us, most especially this president.  He's grasping at straws, and if history if prologue, seeking the easiest and flashiest short-term solution to the current problem.

A payroll tax cut?  That only postpones the inevitable, and leads to less revenue, something this country can ill afford given the huge deficits his administration has already run up since the Tax Cut of 1017.

Quite frankly, he should roll that one back effective immediately.   Then those who can afford to reduce our growing deficit will finally be paying their fair share."
2020-03-10 14:01,The crash of 1929 took four days for the market to fully collapse. Until it did there were rallies and lots of brave talk about certain recovery.

And that's because the fracking industry is economically viable only if oil prices hover around $85/barrel, or higher?

A drop in oil prices is a net positive for the economy. It lowers the cost of transportation.

What about this coronavirus thing? Are we still concerned about the human cost of this epidemic, or are people just collateral damage at this point.

We should be laser-focused on the stock market and oil prices instead. We must pump before we dump. On Monday, there was a lot of dumping without much pumping, and that was not part of our regularly scheduled programming."

Instead of investing in himself and the richest of the rich, Trump could use those savings to invest in the healthcare system writ large.  The American people are at risk here, not just the stock market.

Sadly, he appears to be only interested in saving his reelection; he should be more focused on saving lives."

2020-03-10 14:27,"The concept of a rational market, in which investors have access to all relevant data and use that information to price appropriately has been rendered ridiculous, if it was ever true (look up the Dutch tulip farce).  So we coast along through all the idiotic and dangerous actions of the Trump Administration without a care in the markets since, after all, money is nearly free and we know Trump will stimulate in any way possible.  But, egad, perhaps there is something within the government's portfolio of concerns, like an epidemic, that cannot be solved by tax cuts - so the market drops because it knows no one is serious about risk planning and mitigation (though corporations sure talk a good game).

But all it takes is the mention of another type of tax cut by the imbecile in chief for the markets to express relief.  We have no plan for dealing with the volume of cases, we do not report the numbers of total tests and the results, we have nothing but a one-page handout for schools, businesses and individuals in terms of concrete information, but ah, perhaps there will be another tax cut....all is well on Wall Street."

2020-03-10 15:43,"Stock markets are rebounding because there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Several factors contributed to yesterday's crash. None of those hold any water today and those scaredy profit taking fat cats would not like to be left out after their panic selling are filing back stealthily to the flock they left a couple of weeks ago. Yes there is extreme volatility but those holding on to what they are left with have nothing to lose if they don't sell at a loss. Time is the best healer of pain and losses from the stock market. 

I think that the the stable rise of the stock market will return after the panic pandemic disappears into thin air and China's worst export, the Corona virus is dispatched to history books. China should bear the brunt of the blame for this deadly blame and one of the consequence should be that it no longer is recognized as a permanent member of the UN, it should volunteer to step down if not the rest should strip China from the big 5 permanent member of the UN club."

How is that not offering something that we don't have any idea how we will pay for it without reducing benefits which the Republicans promise not to do.

That they can get away with promising these mutually exclusive things just indicates how ignorant many Americans are about the tax system."
2020-03-10 12:44,"Trump's proposal to cut ""payroll taxes"" is  nonsense. What that means is that the government would take less to apply to Social Security. Big Deal! 

What we should do is lift the $10,000 cap on the deduction of state and local taxes. That would provide tax relief and ease an injustice. The injustice is that under the tax reform legislation which recently went into effect we cannot now deduct those state and local taxes which exceed $10,000.

Again the market volatility is not a result of a lack of cash. Trump's continued harping on the Fed to lower rates is still missing the big picture and just proves that Trump does not have a true business understanding. Manufacturing is nothing like real estate. In addition, propping up Wall Street doesn't do anything to deliver products. Wall Street can deliver the funds, but if the supply chain is down because factories overseas are closed, money means nothing. Our factories and product suppliers cannot ship what they don't have. Companies cannot forecast gains if there aren't any and if there's not real understanding when this crisis will end. The markets will eventually recover, but possibly not before the election no matter how much pressure Trump puts on the Fed or blames others for his inaction and lack of understanding. The whole world is not in on a hoax. It's real and it has to be dealt with with real action not false claims."

Once we have a full blown outbreak, then the economy is really going to suffer. No stimulus package is going to work then when lock-downs will need to be longer if a lot of people are infected and the economy comes to a halt.  So Trump, governors and mayors start acting now if you want to help the economy in the long term, and in the process save some lives as a collateral benefit of caring for the economy and sending people home before contagion is out of hand."

But we are not out of options.  1) mandate free healthcare for all with flu like systems and position going to the doctor as a patriotic duty, 2) expand availability of testing to get accurate data on scope of the problem 3) nightly news conferences that focus on facts 4) depoliticize rhetoric and use words of sympathy and empathy for those affected 5) halt or curtail market trading for the rest of the week.

But without some unity the way forward will be a lot more bumpy. 

About economic stimuli -- payroll tax cuts only serve those who are not hourly wage workers and they will be the one most affected by this current downturn.  What would be nice is a one to one government match to small companies/businesses who keep their hourly workers employed as the economy heads downward in the next few months.

I would buy more stock if I could, but all my money is already in there.  I have only enough cash to last about 3 months.  If you have money to invest, I would do it now.  This is a chance to buy in at the level I got over 2 years ago.  I don't think it's going to last long."

It sounds as if this proposed tax cut applies only to people currently working (receiving a paycheck),am I correct?  The idea being that it will give them more money to spend and therefore stimulate the economy.  What about people whose income consists of SS benefits and (hopefully) some personal savings - do they get a tax break as well?  If not, why?  Their money is just as good when it comes to purchasing power, no?

And BTW, is an economic stimulus the only concern on this president's *mind in the middle of a national/global health emergency?  Simply disgraceful."

Wall.St./Banking caused this regardless of Bloomberg assertions for the crash and blaming the government. Hope today's meeting goes well for you Bankers/Wall St.'rs, at least you get an audience.

Some of these stocks are way over valued.  His slow response to the virus, gave his buddies enough time to dump their shares, before the inevitable panic.  The only people being hurt by this are  retirees and mutual funds.

At the first sign of a pullback in this stimulative largesse, the markets go into full-blown tantrum mode (witness the stock market rout in December 2018 after the Fed's multi-month attempt at normalizing rates and reducing its balance sheet - the Fed of course quickly and totally reversed course to soothe the recalcitrant market).

The proposal mentioned by Speaker Pelosi would guarantee 14 days sick leave for those workers who aren't already covered, expand the unemployment insurance timeline, and insure that free testing and treatment for the Coronavirus is available to all Americans.   This makes far more sense then stimulating an economy that is not in recession and a stock market that may still be overvalued.

I don't, however, want my tax money going to the owners of cruise companies. If cruise companies want protection from financial downturns, they should either (1) accumulate case as a buffer against bad times or (2) buy private insurance to protect themselves from these losses. Cruise ship owners are a lot wealthier than I am.

I'd say the same thing about the bailouts of AIG and Goldman-Sachs in 2008. Financial institutions should protect themselves by having sufficient reserves. Taxpayers should NOT be bailing them out, with outright payments, or with loans. And the same was true of the automaker bailouts. Our government is enabling bad financial behavior

Throw all the money you want at it but it’s not gonna get people on planes, into hotels, or movie theaters, or basketball games, restaurants and college classrooms! 

Money is not the “cure” for everything!

The problem is that this is a new virus whose characteristics are not fully known. Read “uncertainty!”  That makes it scary. In the long run it may turn out to be no better or no worse than seasonal flu. But that’s not known now. So caution (rightly) has gripped everyone. No amount of money will change that!"

In essence he's trying to force Powell to cooperate with his scheme to win reelection even if it means pushing the country into depression, a possibility if the Fed pushes rates too low and runs out of ammunition to stimulate the economy in the next recession. 

Trump only cares about reelection NOT what his policies could do to harm American's. Anyone who overlooks his COVID-19 response and fails to apply that to his economic policy making is an utter fool likely to be rewarded with significant loss of wealth."

Of course, nothing like a face-saving gesture as more money for the 1% who hold 60% of the nation's wealth.  What I’m missing is the familiar hue & cry from Republicans as we encumber our progeny. That’s right!  The Democrats were “saving” the economy then.  Prediction:  Just as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, this supposed stimulus…No alms in the basket for the Middle Class.

Republicans have to fight their traditions like Clint Eastwood is and get Liddle Donny back into bankruptcy court, very familiar ground for him.

Voting can be a tradition in families. Some have voted only republican way back to Eisenhower and beyond. It's a custom, it's just what a family does regardless of facts, changes in party doctrine and bias. 

For example: The house just approved a bill, banning candy flavored tobacco products used in vaping and e-cigarettes. Now one would think that this is a good bill, one that prohibits Big Tobacco from treating our children like swine to be rendered for profit regardless of the cost to our children, their families and tax payers, who have to cover the cost of the health consequences. Right?

However, the 'Big Business' supporting Trump gang and the traitorous republican senate, will not pass this bill. Like Oxytocin's release by the Shackler family's Purdue Pharma and others like them, republicans continue to allow Big Business to prey upon the citizenry. 

Most republican voting families will not have the capacity to evaluate this. The will do what they're told and vote republican because to do otherwise would challenge their minds in ways that are discomforting. Wake up republicans!"

Well they are critical all right- critical of him.
I wonder what he means by the critical role of women- having dinner ready? Tic tac testing? Furniture shopping?
Road testing his germaphobia by having coitus without a condom with a porn actress?
His universal acumen as I said, extends to economics- particularly debt and bankruptcy, massive borrowing from Deutsche Bank, attempting to build towers in Moscow and Azerbaijan. The universality of his knowledge is a national treasure. Most presidents don't know everything the way Trump does.
The stock market has never been so strong. No president has ever been so great, women never been so protected from stewardship off their own bodies. There is method in his friendship with the Saudis even after the Khashoggi incident. He was economically protecting the USA by  maintaining ties. that is why they stand by America now that petroleum is important."

No mass looting. Well done!

I know that this comment will be enraging to many. But before more tired rants about the barbarity of wet markets, etc. please compare and contrast what was done in China with what is being done here in the US. We don't have to agree with or support China's government overall to be able to learn from what they have accomplished in dealing with COVID. We don't have to be supporters of the CCP to acknowledge our own failings.

The Chinese lack of action on this matter, has led to the export of this virus throughout the world. Whilst the Chinese Government did take action to attempt to prevent the spread of this virus in Wuhan and throughout China, if they had listened to the late Dr Li many lives could have been saved."

Three journalists lay out the timeline and report details such as City of Wuhan going ahead with it “traditional” Chinese New Year celebration of a “potluck” dinner for 40,000 (this should not permitted ever), even though reports about the virus has already circulated.  Heaven forbid that the government spoil the people’s holiday.  Numerous medical experts were shushed and statistics ignored.  Then action was finally taken for total lockdown,  now things look somewhat better, but the cost was allowing the virus to circulate throughout China and bow the rest of the world."

The result of the Great Recession was skepticism amongst the Chinese population about the effectiveness of American democracy. Why can’t Americans be skeptical of Chinese authoritarianism and it’s ability to prevent strange diseases from turning the world upside down? How America handles this outbreak is beside the point.

On the other hand, despite the obvious, major faults with tackling the onset of the disease, and incomprehensibly lack health and safety standards of that 'meat market' (especially in light of SARS crisis), one has to admit they did an excellent job in containing the spread.  Without the drastic and dictatorial decrees, we would have had another 'black death' across the world, sort of.  There is some bizarre but not unfounded reason for satisfaction of the communist rulers there."

It's interesting that many readers lauded China's efforts in their comments. If the communist party did not impose harsh censorship and information control, the epidemic wouldn't have gotten out of control. Why is it that we have had two such epidemics in China in the last 17 years? They could have happened anywhere, but would not have turned into a global health crisis if the Chinese communist party had not detained doctors and citizen journalists and had been more transparent."

American style politics at such time reduces the role of the president down to a public relation figure. 

It's all about two distinctly political systems. American democracy based on the voting booth is always a popularity contest. Kissing babies is part of the job. 

Chinese leaders don't need to spend time on perpetual campaigns and fund raising. In a natural disaster Chinese leader can delegate to a team to take care of business without losing sight of other important matters like meeting with foreign leaders and discuss trade treaties. China is wise not to go down the American route."
2020-03-10 21:22,"As a reader, why most commenters here are so negative toward China's Xi?

Practice social distancing but when there is a spike in cases (NY) there must be swift and strong calls for people who can stay home do so.

It sounds harsh, but a two week breather may significantly slow the spread and help minimize greater physical and fiscal loss. Kudos to Columbia, Yeshiva and Hofstra for making the tough call early."
2020-03-09 14:16,"First and foremost, the goal of accurately containing and treating cannot be attained without widespread reliable testing of the population for the virus.  I believe our numbers of those infected is actually much higher than current numbers indicate because of the low number of individuals tested.  We cannot reasonably react if we don't know the level of infection within the community.  I seriously wonder how many have sought treatment for symptoms, has a flu test, told it was negative and treated for a cold or unnamed viral infection and sent home."
2020-03-09 14:17,"""Seventy of the center’s 180 staff members were out sick, but there weren’t enough test kits yet for them.""  

That is a terrifying piece of information.  If these folks at Life Care can't get tested, even though they are sick and even after 16 deaths, then it's hard to have confidence that the numbers we see from  the CDC mean anything at all."
2020-03-09 14:25,"The first thing that should be done is lock Trump and Pence away and don't let Trump have a cell phone.

Then real adults and doctors need to step up and tell us what really to do to slow this virus down and finally the most important thing to remember is what FDR said, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

Lack of education and false information about this virus will be the real down fall and not the virus itself."
2020-03-09 14:25,"We must have adequate tests to determine spread, contact tracing and the right containment procedures."
2020-03-09 14:32,"It makes no sense that we should be advised, ""for goodness sake don't go on any cruises,"" while we're only told to ""think twice"" before flying. If anything, flying forces people into even closer contact.

Is it just that a cruise is always discretionary, but that a lot of flying is for business? 

This pandemic has already been made worse by putting business interests and the health of the stock market ahead of the health of people."
2020-03-09 14:36,"I have been a physician for more than 45 years.  That's only one reason I am almost alarmed that I have been unable to get ANY response to an important question -- and I have communicated my query to various experts, to the Feds, and to my state health department:

Where exactly did the number of days in the corona virus-19 quarantine (14) come from? In other words, is 14 days some back-of-the-envelope guess-timate made by a concealed group of experts based on their collective gut feelings?  Or is 14 days an Evidence-Based quarantine span deduced from research-grade, actual patient data?   Where Are The Data? How was 14 days chosen?

How can any of us be assured that each person ""graduating from quarantine on day 14"" is extremely unlikely to be shedding live virus after he/she returns to the real world? The most important word here is the adverb ""extremely"".

Graduating from quarantine ideally should require that every person deemed ""safe to go"" must not only be symptom-free but  ALSO must have had a negative laboratory test for the presence of corona virus-19 on, say, day 12 or 13.   Unfortunately, we can all seriously doubt that this application of the lab test will be realizable now.  It appears that we are stuck with the clinical impression of some examiner as the decisive criterion."
2020-03-09 14:37,"May be wise to be proactive and start the social distancing process everywhere in the US, despite it seeming Draconian.  Maybe we should urge the cancellation of large events outside of work and school for the next few weeks.  Would probably sink our local economies, but may be a safer alternative to eradicate or slow it at a faster pace."
2020-03-09 14:41,"Trump had two options in front of him when Covid-19 surfaced in China last year and was recognized as a potential global threat:

This kind of fear-mongering (and it is, plain and simple) does not invite the reader to delve deeper into the article to find out that the people in whom this has been observed were nursing home residents, elderly - and I am guessing elderly and not in the best of health. 
 This is sickening. It's a new virus on the loose and people we have to hear from are the media, magnifying tbe dangers. Really. I already see that the play I want to see will not be performed next week. I can't imagine why anyone would want to show up for class at the university. The businesses on the campus will have to close and possibly lay off their employees. Can you see what anyone would think of a disease that shows no symptoms and you die within hours?

2020-03-09 14:40,"Hmm.  On a day when markets are freaking out, just read an article by a specialist in viral dynamics in Washington State that suggests the virus doubles every 6.1 days.  If you note that on Jan 23 there were about 800 cases and extrapolate to 111,000 cases today, that 6.1 seems to hold globally as well.  If this finding IS globally correct and mitigation/containment efforts (improved or otherwise - tested or not) aren't effective or other things don't emerge that impact the virus' spread, this finding suggests that by early June, we could be looking at 3.3B infected globally.

2020-03-09 14:32,"We are so behind and likewise delusional to the reality of this virus.  The virus has likely been here for a while, its just diluted with this years influenza.  The lack of widespread testing has further helped spreading the virus.  Its not all negative news though, people should not panic, just be smart, have a plan and do what we should always be doing, wash your hands, cover your mouth and stop touching everything.  This has been a nice reminder of what we should always be doing.
The system is failing us by not reassuring the public that is not vulnerable that they are at very low risk and STOP calling 911 and going to emergency rooms further spreading either Covid19 or the flu.  Healthy folks need to be better informed that there is no cure for the flu, just like Coronavirus, so going to the hospital is just facilitating others getting sick.  
What we need to do is protect the vulnerable, those with impaired immune systems and the elderly.  I honestly think people just need to be a bit smarter and not panic."
2020-03-09 14:48,"At this point, should there not be community wide efforts to set up stations at each hospital and Dr.s offices for receiving and testing people who make emergency visits who are exhibiting symptoms? There should be signs and a number to call for information. Where is the implementation of plans and organized preparedness/response? This has all be reactionary."
2020-03-09 14:27,"We have an opportunity right now to be inventive and solve interesting problems. Where are those creative discussions happening right now? I do not see any in the NYTimes today. Brand new businesses could grow out of this crisis providing in-home support for those who are ill. Innovations could be applied to all aging baby boomers after this crisis is over.   Delivery systems of all kinds would be one area. Amazon is the prototype but on a neighborhood scale. No one in the cities need leave home for sure. Rural areas are in need of better support for staying home. And the financial institutions could benefit from incentives to go conservative and pause. If there is a vaccine in a year, have a year long crisis management slow down. Putting our whole world in financial jeopardy for the sake of free markets and capitalism is unnecessary and a mistake. There is an opportunity here, right now, to think with a very different set of goals."

With this administration it would be tempting to think that this is deliberate to ""keep the numbers where they are"" to make Trump happy.  But I don't see Trump and his administration are able to think that far ahead to suppress the availability of testing.  

If anything, it's the opposite:  an administration so lacking in foresight and so greedy that they cut the offices and experts who would have been prepared to deal with this in real time.  All the tax cuts in the world can't keep your family safe from this disease. 

So the country suffers while the president plays golf."

Unfortunately, our adult son who also has diabetes now has cancer. We take him regularly to the hospital for treatments. We follow all the advice about personal hygiene but we are terrified to be in the hospital crowds. We try to sit far away from everyone. Our government needs to be much more proactive in controlling coronavirus less more deaths occur."
2020-03-09 15:00,"It is clear that when they instituted strict travel restrictions and social controls in Wuhan and Hubei province, the SARS CoV-2 rate started to drop.  The time to implement voluntary social distancing is before there is widespread circulation.  That the government is not publicly advocating this is a failure almost as bad as the continued lack of testing. Do not go to the movies and avoid any large meetings or concerts etc.  that are still being scheduled.  Avoid buffets and think about rescheduling that party.  Stop shaking hands. Use self check out at the grocery store. Avoid ATMs and pin pads used by everyone. Limit food venues where they serve a lot of people, and cancel any conferences or non-essential travel.  Think about everything public you touch and how you can disinfect your hands.  Insist that your school make plans for closing and tele-schooling if needed.  If you are over 60, you are definitely at higher risk and your risk goes up significantly with every decade after that. If you have asthma, chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, any type of immunosuppression, you are definitely at higher risk and should be particularly motivated to practice social distancing."
2020-03-09 15:05,"About 200 people were involved with the nursing home, in the Seattle area, staff and residents and 19 have died beginning two weeks ago and continuing. At the same time, there were 5000 people on that cruise ship held up in Japan, staff and tourists, and maybe there have been 6 deaths so far (none reported in the last 10 days). 

So are we going to see 500 deaths from the Japanese cruise ship this week or is something else going on in Seattle? Whatever, it has to be something relatively straightforward that could help all of us. What is someone hiding... in which situation?"

Places where there are large crowds, standing in line close to others, and touching common surfaces.  Granted, the common spaces are sometimes outdoors, but so are many of the places in Italy where gatherings are now banned.

2020-03-09 15:14,"A reliable public health source said the US cases are doubling each week. Given 500, that would mean 2 million in 3 months -- long before a vaccine.  

Americans are bad at containment and the messages from our leaders are mixed at best, deceptive at worse. I always respected Dr Fauci but he made a significant error during the DC anthrax episode by saying it could not escape sealed envelopes, which of course it did (I lived in DC then and remember those deaths well.) Now I worry Fauci might also error on the side of preventing panic, especially given the added pressure from Mr Trump to do so."

The crew deserve the same treatment as the passengers. Get them off the boat. Segregate the sick from the well. Quarantine them until they are proven to be virus free. The fact that most of the crew are not American nationals is irrelevant. Keeping them on the boat and sailing off to sea seems like a very cruel and morally indefensible solution to me. 

Princess Cruise Lines is an American company. It's headquarters are in Santa Clarita, California. It is owned by Carnival Cruise Lines, which is an American/UK owned company with headquarters in Florida. Just because the ships are operating under flags of convenience from other countries and hiring foreign nationals to do their work for them doesn't mean that basic standards of decency and fair play shouldn't apply. 

I would hope that the news media will look into this and do what they can to insure that the crew members on the ship are not forgotten."

If I saw a patient with a STD I was required to tell the patient his or her contacts have to go in for testing or the public health departments will contact the contacts.
If there not readily available and accurate tests for contacts their is no way to stop the spread of the Coronavirus.
This failure to provide tests in addition to the the Dear Leader not wanting any news of the virus to be spoken of, written about or  preparations made in the whole executive branch.
This is exactly how Communist China's leadership failed in the early days of the virus infecting its citizens.

As far as the passengers on the cruise liner they can spend more time getting fresh renewable air on the deck and the balcony and maybe in the life boats. Please don't bring them on the shore until they are infection free. The cruise owner can make mutually agreeable middle of the Ganges agreements with the passengers."

Why not save the economy and avoid alot of unnecessary anxiety by letting the coronavirus spread naturally and instead of quarantining those who have the virus, just quarantine those for whom the virus is likely to cause serious illness or worse?  Let's just get this whole thing over with and move on with our lives."

I would also like to see what the government can do to aid in ramping up inventories of masks, disinfectants, and other supplies. We may be paying a price for offshoring manufacturing. We need a coherent, candid, and bold federal response. 
Depressing to see presidential surrogates downplaying, and even ridiculing public alarm and local responses to the pandemic. In an era where nothing ever goes away, one  should be careful when writing their epitaph."
2020-03-09 15:33,"I think the time for adequate testing to make any difference in outcomes is probably over. By this I mean that the time for any kind of coordinated and meaningful “containment” response to the results of testing has passed. Fauci says - and honestly I’m pretty much only listening to the Gospel of Fauci at this point - that the vulnerable need to start distancing now no matter where you live. When he starts talking “mitigation” it feels like we’ve passed a threshold from which there’s no coming back “until there’s a vaccine or treatment”  This is the significant part of this article to me. What difference can it make how many test positive at this point, for a virus that has no symptoms as often as not, and people are encouraged to travel freely within the US? The coming months are gonna be scary enough."

Last week at the bank, there was a man on line in front of me, who wore scrubs.  This shows he works in the health field in some capacity.  He kept coughing without covering his mouth.  All I could do was move away from him as I shook my head in disbelief.

These are adults, but they do not know enough at this stage in their lives to cover their mouths when coughing.  People have to be told to wash their hands.  Seriously.  Yet, people wonder why the Coronavirus is spreading."
2020-03-09 15:44,"I truly believe it's to late for containment, the only way we could had done that was with mass testing like in South Korea or with draconian measures like China did in Wuhan and Italy is doing now.

The coronavirus presents the same problem in reverse: coordination is required to confine people rather than to disperse them.  The article suggests that this can be accomplished in some top down fashion, with presumably the federal government in the lead role.  I doubt it.  This has to be done ""bottom up,"" and the appropriate officials need to be talking now."
2020-03-09 16:02,"My wife and I are in our 70’s and have taken seriously the US government’s new advice for the elderly to avoid cruises because of the coronavirus epidemic.

However, when I called Regent cruise line this morning to cancel our upcoming cruise to the Baltic I was informed that our several thousand dollar deposit would not be refunded but instead placed in a “Reassurance Account” to be applied to a future cruise that must be booked within a year.

No one knows if the coronavirus will be gone or conquered in a year, my wife and I are getting older and less mobile every year, and based on recent events we have zero confidence in the ability of Regent and all the other cruise lines to prevent their ships from turning into floating Petri dishes.

Indeed, based on my conversation with Regent today I can confirm that cruisers (and especially the elderly) are at heightened risk of contracting coronavirus and totally likely to lose their deposits.

Exposure to coronavirus is frightening and disruptive no matter what one’s age, so think twice—or three or four times—before booking with Regent or any other cruise line; they do not refund deposits even when their trips are scheduled to stop in countries with confirmed coronavirus cases and when government agencies  recommend not taking cruises."
2020-03-09 16:03,"Although the article states ""acknowledging that the tried-and-true public health measures of isolating the sick and quarantining their contacts are no longer enough,"" the problem is that we simply did not follow the tried-and-true public health measures, and instead chose to ignore/minimize the risks.  If you look at the CDC National Pandemic Response Strategy (look specifically at the 2017 update), you can plainly see that we are not even attempting to follow what we recommend as best practices - and what we are doing is being done far too late according to our own timelines."
2020-03-09 16:05,"I listened to Governor Newsom yesterday as he was informing the public of the measures and logistics necessary to prevent and contain the spread of this particular coronavirus as we await the docking and subsequent disembarking of the Grand Princess cruise ship.  I was once again proud of not only my governor but also of our state's health professionals re the lengths and breadths to protect us.  Simultaneously, I could not help but think of the ""if only"" when applied to the federal government's response to this lethal disease.  We are now sprinting to catch up with an epidemic which is showing signs of possible running amok.  Just imagine if we had a president who took science and in this case medical science seriously.  Just imagine if we had a president who anticipated and for that matter listened from the get-go to experts in the field of infectious diseases.  This virus was inevitable.  Yet its spread could have been assuaged if only this administration were able to separate politics from science."

as with other commenters, i am a little pessimistic about the containment efforts and curious to know just what we are getting by halting so much economic activity. the costs seem enormous to me, and the benefits are not all completely obvious. it would be nice for leaders to give us some ""big picture"" perspective.

on the subject of ""big picture"" thinking i am also wondering what the prognosis is for society. is this like a hurricane that comes through and we clean up after it is gone, or will this virus be with us for awhile? will we see it diminish over summer and come back? will we all be in this same boat 9 months from now on the rebound? how long will we be shutting the world down when someone coughs?

2020-03-09 16:17,"Advising only the elderly to restrict travel misses the point entirely.  The likelihood for infection is the same for the young and the old.  The young will bring back their infection to their homes, communities and schools.  They will infect the elderly - parents, grandparents, teachers. The public and policy makers deserve to understand that although the personal consequences of becoming infected differ, the public health consequences are the same."

2020-03-09 16:26,"We are a nation of about 330, 394,146 million people according to the latest estimates, and yet we are at the bottom of the list for CoronaVirus testing. Duh, how can that be?
We have to move along on this and start testing so we can see how we can control the transmission of the virus.

My wife and I are old people; we remember when Buddy Holly was still singing, and we know all about the Beatles. We are also at risk of dying from this CoronaVirus. We need to know where it is, how many people have it, and all steps necessary to put the Kibosh on the problem. 

We need leaders who can lead us in the right direction, not politicians. Where are they?"
2020-03-09 16:27,"The spread of the virus cannot be halted but it can be slowed.This is important because new pandemic viruses generally lose their virulence after about six months (i.e. 2-3 months from now) simply because the less severe variants do not disable their hosts and spread more rapidly than the more severe strains. The most important countermeasure remains self-quarantine, i.e. if you are sick stay home. While mild infections may go unnoticed, people with symptoms are the most likely to spread the illness. This was essentially how Toronto stopped SARS."
2020-03-09 16:28,"A major problem is the lack of information on viral spread-- due to the lack of testing, caused by the profound lack of preparation in the US hoping this was just SARS or MERS redux despite China (belatedly) shutting down an entire city. 

So here we are.  Only a few thousand tests so far?  Really? Each death implies hundreds infected in the community, wandering around infecting still more people.  Of course the market panics, the presumption is always worst case and there is no information implying otherwise;  indeed, based on other countries disaster is just around the corner.  Look at Italy. 

Free widespread testing (that is, millions of tests), get data to find out how good or bad things are, and what kind of response to make based on information.  I know, science based, an anathema to the current ""critical thinking and science is a Democrat plot to take over the country"" mentality.  As for the cost, the Fed has already lost tens of billions in tax revenue from arbitrage and panic.  The tax arbitrage losses will never be recovered... so good show administration.

When the coronavirus hits these populations, they are going to be hit hard. Whatever your stance on incarceration or immigration issues, we cannot leave these human beings to die.

Also a reminder that the Trump administration in 2018 cut 80% of the CDC's worldwide anti-epidemic programs, and is more concerned with making the number of cases appear low rather than test as widely as possible. Trump is now reaping what he has sown. This short-sightedness and self-interest is a moral abomination that will literally cost hundreds if not thousands of American lives. If there is any justice at all, the American people will make Trump pay dearly for it in November."

2020-03-09 16:43,"Want to slow the spread without quarantining entire communities, even if people don't have the virus or symptoms? Here are some solutions:

Severely curtail all flights to Europe, Asia, the Middle East and beyond.

Severely curtail domestic flights. Especially from regions where there are active outbreaks.

Force the airlines to refund customers who can't take their trips, even if they purchased non-refundable tickets. 

Push pause on the cruise industry and make them refund passengers. How many of these current outbreaks started from someone on a cruise ship.

Beyond that, implement social distancing by banning large gatherings.

Dramatically expand testing so we know who's positive and can selectively quarantine people. 

Cancel all non-urgent surgeries and medical procedures.

Close schools as need be -- but with the provision that time will be made up during the summer, when the disease spread will likely slow.

If we can do all of this, we could dramatically slow the outbreak, allowing us to effectively treat those who need help."
2020-03-09 16:43,"Well how about even this late in the game, this Administration simply starts showing any degree of willingness to lead from the front of the curve, rather then from behind it. And what about starting with common sense actions like offering sick leave to the many thousands of low income service and health care workers who the general populace comes in contact everyday ( like clerks, custodians,fast food workers, security personnel, secretaries and health care aides) who can not afford to stay home when ill, because they have few if no benefits. And what about taking the next logical step, and making sure that these low income workers will not have to feel like they would have to go into debt if they sought medical treatment or testing for the virus? Hello, ACA?

 And finally, what if Trump announces that in order to help pay for the common sense actions like sick leave and medical care for the low income workers during this Crisis, Trump Inc also announces that they will seek to impose a surtax on the large corporations and the wealthy whose income are in the top 3 percentile, for the next 2 years.

2020-03-09 16:06,"Why are the experts worrying instead of enforcing a trict quarantine - the ONLY way to slow down the coronna virus epidemic!  There is no way of stopping it - probably - but i we at least slow it down, perhaps it willl ""burn out"" and infact a smaller number of people than at present.

People should immediately cancel all social events - STAY AT HOME. Order in food, medicine, whatever you need. Put off any thing which is optional.

Use your common sense. Don't lt you kids go to school. If you work outside your home, stay at home. If you must work in public, wash hands frequently, wer goggles and rubber gloves, and change the gloves frequently.

Slow down the spread and perhaps we will at least have time to develop a vaccine which reduces the impact of the disease on older people who appear to have the highest death rate. But the amount of exposure must also be a factor - witness the death of Dr. Li, our Guardian Angel in China who warned us of the coming pandemic before he died of it himself.

All school districts should be closed by now. Teach your kids some self-reliance. Speed up their at-home learning. Devise art projects with materials at home.

Keep your pets inside your own yard or house.

Don't go anywhere. If you feel you have to go to church/synagugue to stay right with God or whatever, rethink how you can create a religious experience at your computer at home - e.g. go to an internet site or watch a nature/science program. Those are a form of religion."

2020-03-09 15:54,"Stricter measures are paramount to containing viral spread.  The situation requires not only stricter measures but intelligent measures.

""Measures"" taken so far by trump's guess-as-you-go team have done the opposite - they made the pandemic worse. His decision to restrict 3500 people to the Pacific Princess cruise ship has almost certainly condemned them all to the illness. There will be, soon if not already, 3000 infections on that ship alone. trump's decision HAS put 3500 people at risk of death.

His blind obfuscation of the severity has allowed the virus to enter each state. However, the official numbers hide the real infections-count because many infections are unconfirmed due to insufficient test kits in most states. Without test kits, we cannot confirm with certainty who is and is not infected. This means people truly infected but not yet confirmed are moving around society, infecting others. The community spread continues, while trump acts to keep the official count inaccurately low. The 500 known cases is inaccurately low because the gov't has not facilitated testing for enough people -- due to trump-led failures.

Epidemiologists know the exponential growth all pandemics follow, and they can reliably predict how this SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading in America. They understand that in America we likely have thousands of people infected (but untested), and spreading the infection daily. Deaths will rise.

We need a leader with a clue, one with a non-infeKted mind."

About 3450 people not tested.

Early tests can give false negatives. 
Likely many undiscovered cases, possibly among kitchen staff.

2020-03-09 15:45,"I cannot understand the hesitation in closing schools in areas where there are known coronavirus cases. Let the kids stay home. It is time this government made it easier on the poorer kids by giving an allowance for the economically poor to enable them to stay home. If they don’t have computers, nothing wrong with paper homework. It’s been done through many centuries. It’s ridiculous to keep schools open when universities are shutting down. Why would we want to expose older teachers and administrators to this virus? Why would we want to expose older parents and grandparents at home to a possible infection. And most importantly are we comfortable giving this virus a bigger arena to infect so as to be able to mutate into perhaps a more lethal strain? 

Maybe it’s fake news or not, but it becomes exceedingly disturbing when you read about developing countries testing tens of thousands of people and here we can’t seem to cough up a thousand testing units. Is the reality, that, we are so behind in science, technology and strategy? Is America the super nation a myth?"
2020-03-09 16:46,"I live in one of the states that has it's primary election the end of April. For the past 12 years I have volunteered at the polling station where I also vote. Because of the Coronavirus, I am seriously thinking about calling Voter Registration at our country court house and telling them I can not work the polls this time, out of concern for coming in contact with the Corona virus in large part because of how people now check in: on an iPad. 

When people check in, I [and other polling volunteers] ask the person's  name, look it up on the iPad, then flip the screen over so the voter can sign the screen with his/her finger or the one stylus for every iPad. The voter either flips the screen back so I can see it or I flip it back to finish registering them, with the same stylus, then hand him/her an activated card to take into the adjacent room to stick in a machine and vote. The used card is collected and reactivated for other voters: we stick it in a card reader and push buttons to activate it either Democrat or Republican.

The side of the iPad, stylus, and cards put a poll volunteer--and voters--in contact with other peoples' germs. Until I call Voter Registration, I am assuming people there have not considered polling stations and the way people now have to vote as less than safe as Coronavirus spreads. Sani-wipe the iPad, stylus, and cards voter to voter? They probably could not buy enough if they wanted, in part due to hording."

The long incubation period means when a case pops up, that person has already likely infected a dozen. That dozen will infect 144 before showing symptoms, and so on.  Younger people have a very low death rate...maybe under 1%.  People over 45 or so may have a death rate that is very much higher, we just don't know how high.  That smokers and so on are more vulnerable seems true, but this just makes the risk more clear. You don't see smokers dropping dead from the flu that often.  

As far as containment, it is clear already that people in this country do not have the collective will to do what it takes to slow the spread.  Arguably we no longer have the collective will to do anything...but that's another discussion.  Slowing the spread has only one purpose...to allow time for test kits to be manufactured, for the summer to get here and for the development of a vaccine, or more effective anti-viral drugs.

Why are we in this position?  Technology and population growth have outpaced social development...as so often stated by the great science fiction writers. The live animal markets in China are a perfect example. A primitive practice that exists side-by-side modern technological marvels.

Without Corona testing, we are blind, unable to make the critical decisions to protect our patients, our community and critically, our own staff.  The South Koreans and the governor of Rhode Island have an answer that changes everything: ill patients are driven to a testing center where they are swabbed while remaining in their cars waiting for test results.

Could it be that Trump's thinking of ""do nothing"" shows his  willingness to sacrifice a few hundred-thousand lives in order to try to keep the economy of this country less drastically affected as long as possible by misinformation, and not imposing restrictions on travel, large gatherings and inter-city/town movement?
 
The kinds of major restrictions this country has needed for the past month could well impact the ability of this virus to proliferate further. As it is, we don't have a clear message of taking charge from the Trump administration. 

 It wouldn't surprise me at all if the sources of active governmental response so sorely needed right now weren't intentionally being held back from being disseminated or put into operation because of Trump's obsession with his looking to be good for the economy."

To hear the leader of our country call the governor of beleaguered state of Washington, a snake, is so very sad and deplorable.  It does nothing to bring hope to the rest of the nation that help is on the way from the federal government if he or she is not in favor with those in power.

Preparations were not made, although the disease ravaged China and other nations for months before the first cases were reported in the U.S.  The nation would have been much better prepared had Trump not destroyed the infrastructure already in place to address issues associated with pandemics.  

By all means, Trump should not be allowed to appear on national television to say anything about the government response to dealing with the virus.

2020-03-09 17:38,"I'm in the New Rochelle area and am pretty sure I had the virus this week. It was four days of some fever (about 101), body aches, cough, congestion and headaches. 

I looked on the CDC website and it said to call the doctor if you know you've been exposed to an infected person or if you've traveled abroad. But we seem past that point in this area. It's everywhere.

Then I called my doctor, they said to only come in if I'd normally come in. I wouldn't normally come in for this. I called back a day later and they'd changed the policy. Do not come in. If you have a severe temp or shortness of breath, go to the ER. 

Well, I didn't have a severe temp or shortness of breath so I did not go to the ER. (Nor did I have any desire to go) 

But it's left me not knowing if I'm positive and if I'm contagious. And many local friends and family are in the same boat. How long do we quarantine for and do we quarantine without a test? I'm currently at home and feeling okay. 

My guess is the reported numbers are about 1/4 of the actual cases."

What's needed is massive, free healthcare coverage for everyone in every community—including distribution of food and a total moratorium on evictions and debt repayment for the duration of the epidemic—with no accumulated debt to be repaid. And, most of all, if this is really a deadly epidemic, all our resources—worldwide—should be devoted to finding a cure and vaccinations against it, instead of spending  trillions of dollars on war and weapons of mass destruction.

Set aside the happy talk about vaccines: we still do not have a proven vaccine for HIV. The antiviral drugs for HIV are so effective that they can meet our current needs to control this disease. 
Let the states figure out how they will role out the testing kits. Rhode Island, following the example of South Korea has come up with an excellent procedure.

According to a comment I read today from our 401k advisor, the WHO has stated that the severity of the illnesses began decreasing on February 22, and the growth of new cases worldwide has decreased over the last week. It seems that prudent measures such as social distancing, and thorough cleaning of surfaces such as in restaurants and health care facilities may well address most aspects of the spread.

But alarmingly little of this is reported. Five hundred or even a thousand cases, and a few dozen deaths of people with compromised health status should not be news. It is not news when this happens in every flu season in every town worldwide. I am not suggesting the media ignore the story, but some balance is in order, rather than stoking hysteria, making it all about Trump, and causing personal and economic damage for no good reason."

Rather than put this is any context, the media, like great lakes meteorologists, are making the most dire forecasts, when nothing anywhere supports these predictions. Yes, a small number of a subset of population is vulnerable, however, the mortality rate of those infected creeps closer and closer to 1% as new information becomes available.

Quite a bit of the information was false, unless they were unaware of what is really taking place. I spent the day going from one medical facility to another to be tested and cleared for the benefit of family with health issues, and the story kept changing. NJ has a site to call and they tell you to stay at home for 14 days. Where are all the tests that were supposed to be available?  The labs and doctors now do not want any individual with any symptom, you are to go to the er. The hospitals have enough going on.  If someone is tested and confirmed there is no candid information shared of places the individual may have been. Without tests and open communication of known cases what is the sense in all the verbiage?"

This is not Ebola, Smallpox, or the plague. So please, do not contribute to the panic by over reporting on the Coronavirus without also offering a balanced comparison of the ill and death rate nationally with other common illnesses."

If this is like the flu, it will ebb in the summer and resurface just as we hit fall.  The most dense/highly populated areas lean democratic.  Is it too much to imagine that this administration, which uses the authoritarian playbook as its bible, would use this virus to impose mass quarantines in these areas right as we are set to go to the polls?  This is something we need to start considering and planning for now."

But Republicans are famous for cheating. Witness the long lines in Texas where Democrats stood in line for 6 hours while Republican machines stood unused. Witness North Carolina re-drawing its maps to eliminate black votes with ""surgical precision."" Etc, etc, etc. The truth is, Republicans can't win without cheating, they know it, and they are happy as Trump mobsters to do it.

We must watch them like hawks and sue them to prevent cheating if at all possible."
2020-03-09 16:05,"I am an Illinois voter. Because I’m currently out of state, I will use a mail-in ballot. Illinois allows all voters to vote by mail. This should be the rule, rather than the exception. Our primary is on the 17th. Whether in town or not in November I will, most likely, vote by mail again. That way I can have my vote in, no matter what happens on Election Day. Voting is too important to skip.
It would be nice if all voters could vote online, but I understand that could create election security concerns."
2020-03-09 16:20,"The only ""fair"" change to voting rules it no change. The major problems can be anticipated and mitigated by state election authorities without changing any rules. For example:

-- Start now ensuring that all nursing home patients and assisted living residents have absentee ballots.

-- Start now to ensure that every elderly person (say, over 60) who might be home bound in November has an absentee ballot.

-- Ramp up public information campaigns urging people to use mail in ballots in states where that is an option.

-- Recruit younger people as poll workers (eg, college students, people collecting unemployment compensation). Poll workers tend to be elderly because local officials want to patronize them.

-- Start now to expand the number of polling places. No one should ever have to wait in line for hours to vote anyway. This is more reason to eliminate that problem.

-- Train poll workers to take appropriate steps to mitigate possible transmission within polling places (eg, wear gloves, clean surfaces frequently throughout the day, etc.)

There are probably other steps without changing any rules. Of all the things that should not be disrupted by the outbreak, the election is Number One."
2020-03-09 16:46,"The same situation here in France with local elections on 15 and 22 march. The IFOP pollster said today the 28 % of voters might drop-out due to the corona virus. Two different polls from other institutes showed comparable levels . The oldest, most exposed to the illness, feel the least concerned as they value their civic duty to vote more important. The exact contrary is true for the youngest voters. But with 64%  in 2014 participation in local elections is not really impressive. 

So, the question is: does the fear to get contaminated really change the abstention level ? 
I guess fearing the coronavirus is just another good (and socially accepted) reason to abstain. 

The pollster thinks that rumours and strife on social networks will influence those that are the most exposed, i.e. the younger. So, with a higher abstention rate in this age group the social networks might weight less than what we got accustomed during the Yellow Vest movement. And we'll get an advantage for the more conservative politicians who get elected by an older electorate.

Another tombstone for the yellow vest movement."

For them and their children I would vote for Democrats no matter what the risk."

2020-03-09 16:05,Many of us have already voted in Washington State as we received our ballots a couple of weeks ago. Actually that was a problem as I voted for a candidate who is no longer running.  The virus did not affect voting  - only raised the risk fo the people working for the Secretary of State in Olympia. Actually the virus is unlikely to be transmitted from those envelopes which have spent a while waiting for the count to begin.

Regarding our November elections, the most important thing is to ensure that they take place as scheduled. that no one is denied their right to vote, that everyone who needs transportation and identification has them, and that no tampering takes place during vote recording and counting.
   
By the way, if that bears a resemblance to the way every election should go, that's not a coincidence."

We don't have to worry about voter intimidation or suppression. And if you don't trust the USPS you can take your ballot to an official drop box. I think every state should do this. Nobody has to take time off work, or go to the polls sick, or make snap decisions on down ballot candidates. We sit down with our ballots, the voter guides, and any trusted news sources, and we make informed decisions on who to vote for. We can do this over the course of days if we want to. And there is an unambiguous paper ballot should any questiona arise. I  think this should be required by law in every state."

2020-03-09 16:28,"I am sitting here at work in downtown Seattle (taking a break).  I and none of my co-workers are ill, but we are getting set up to work from home.  All the news says that novel Coronavirus can be wiped away with disinfectant wipes--so offer them at the upcoming polling stations and vote count locations.  I bring one with me to the library and before I use the computer I clean the keyboard and the mouse, and the table, and let them dry before I begin typing, and I wash my hands on my way out.  I never touch door knobs with my fingers. Sick people (coughers and sneezers) going to vote or attend a convention should assume they might have the virus and wear a mask as a precaution for the rest of us.  Everyone should wash their hands upon leaving the polling location or be given hand-wipes or hand sanitizing solution when they exit.  For the convention, have gloved and masked volunteers offer the hand-sanitizing lotion at the exits, to ensure empty bottles are replenished immediately.  The Seattle Public library has set up some hand sanitizing gel stations but, they ran out of solution and were empty when I pressed the dispenser.  This can't happen at these large public places, if we're being serious about stopping the spread of coronavirus.  We need to focus our attention on protecting our elderly population.  If we could get that under control, the numbers of deaths would go way down.  People who have underlying disease will have to stay out of circulation as best they can."

It's just unsanitary. And yes, many volunteers to open them are the most st risk in my community and others I'd imagine."

Perhaps in the future return envelopes for ballots could use self-sealing closures to avoid the problem of licking envelopes. Voting by mail is the answer to a lot of problems with elections: a secure, paper ballot that can’t be hacked, no lines, no crowds,  no need for taking off work or getting child care. It would take a lot of work, but could possibly be put in place in more states around the country by November if there were sufficient  will and resources to do so."

One thing we do not seem to know yet, is whether a recovered person is still able to transmit the disease. 
However, it may be  that recovered people would be best positioned to help others less able to cope with the illness and take on some of those riskier rolls.

In the meantime, hats off to the healthcare workers on the front lines doing the work on behalf of all of us."

•	There is an entire time period to vote, likely leading to better informed and more thoughtful responses
•	It is convenient – no hand wringing about late shift workers, elderly home-bound, homemakers with infants or small children, etc.
•	It is cost effective. Far less expensive than organizing, staffing, individual polling place stocking with machines and other support materials
•	There are no nefarious shenanigans such as eliminating all but a few, scattered polling places, reducing poll hours of operation, and so forth
•	No one, including disabled and elderly persons, has to wait hours in the hot sun or frozen north to vote.
•	No one has the expense of travel to (or even finding in some areas) polling places.  No one has expense period, as returns are postage-free"

Coronavirus has not yet been detected in my county, but is inevitably creeping closer.  I am a pessimist by nature.  And I believe that taking preparation for having to quarantine in my home for 2 weeks is simple common sense.

I am disgusted by the Fox News hosts who accuse a level headed Dem like me of sowing panic.  But even I think the tone of this article sounds like a sensationalist doomsday scenario.  ""The effects of a socially transmitted respiratory virus, if it were to spread unabated through campaign season, would be almost endless.""

2020-03-09 17:32,Mail in ballots - works great in OR and WA and better for democracy too - no need for a postage stamp and no worries about long lines at polling places (or polling places being closed/reduced in minority neighborhoods)
2020-03-09 17:56,An additional question-- how will this effect census taking?
2020-03-09 17:14,"We need IMMEDIATE measures to take place to guarantee the November election.  Every single registered voter in every single state and overseas should be be mailed a Postage-Paid, Mail-IN, Absentee Ballot by no later than October 15th at which time early voting should begin.  This should ""trump"" (Oh, the irony!!) all current state laws and procedures for elections therefore providing universal access to the right to vote for all registered voters.

With this much lead time before November, there will be absolutely NO excuse for Trump to postpone or usurp the election.  I've written my representatives about this twice.  It would be helpful if responsible media outlets would demand answers to this crucial question--NOW."
2020-03-09 17:58,"I already voted for Bernie by mail, but now I am thinking Biden is the more sensible person. So, now I won't be so heartbroken when Bernie loses. That stubbornness is sometimes not a good trait. He should know better."
2020-03-09 18:10,"I live in King County, the epicenter of the epidemic in the US and l’ll be dropping off my ballot to an official dropbox today. 

Here in Washington state we have only voting by mail or dropbox. There are no polling places. I’m surprised that the article didn’t mention that fact. 

It’s a good system. There’s a paper trail, we have weeks to vote, and there’s no standing in line. And now, no concern for spreading disease."
2020-03-09 18:18,"Glad to see this is being discussed. A few weeks ago I thought what if one of these almost 80 year old candidates gets it in July, or any time. (FWIW - I think Sanders’ prospects would be much better than mine, and he’s got 30 years on me."
2020-03-09 18:22,"Early voting is important. Avoid crowds but vote because we have the insane running the shop now and many can be hurt when the wrong people are in charge. Although we keep hearing coronavirus is like the flu, there are two key differences: (1) we have a flu vaccine (2) we have a flu treatment."
2020-03-09 18:23,"The obvious thing to do would be a 50-state compact to promote voting-by-mail, with every registered voter getting a vote-by-mail ballot at their registration address. That gives voters a safe option, should they choose to take it. Since those ballots are returned in a signed, sealed envelope, it would be easy to check for potential voter fraud, too. Under no circumstances should an election be canceled or postponed, and there'd be no need with this option."
2020-03-09 18:30,"I've been wondering about the voting issue for awhile now. Makes you question why more states don't have mail-in voting with polling stations and drop-offs as a supplement only. We can supply ballot counters with emergency gear much more easily than an entire voting population. The risk  to voters obviously suppresses turn out which obviously favors Republicans. I fully expect Republicans are already planning a host of last minute voter suppression tactics based around the virus.

As a more indirect consequence though, the virus also suppresses activism BEFORE the election. I'm sure organizers are struggling to recruit anything but phone volunteers right now. There's a political consequence that extends beyond election day. The introversion most likely favors Biden right now. A rush to absentee ballots could inadvertently swing voters in Sanders direction. However, the deadlines have mostly passed already.

On the other hand though, young voters are more likely to show up to polls anyway. The virus is supposedly lower-risk for younger voters. Maybe Sanders will catch an unexpected break."

Also, mail in ballots have been available at least a week longer. In 2018, I think 33 to 40% of the ballots cast were cast before the traditional Tuesday voting day in the county where I live.

I suspect the dramatic decline in candidates still running will have a bigger effect than fears of the virus because here, the virus is not so widespread. If case numbers rise dramatically in the next week, fear may keep more people from the polls than now seems likely.

2020-03-09 19:00,"Washington State is a vote-by-mail state, which guarantees a paper ballot record, as well as the avoidance of absurdly long lines at polling stations.  Not sure how Corona will impact this system, but guessing MUCH LESS than were we forced to line up and share booths/machines.  Every state should follow suit.   Whenever I see photos of the hours-long lines in other states and read about vulnerable and error-prone electronic voting kiosks, it baffles me."
2020-03-09 19:08,"Surely this is an opportunity to take a huge leap forward and implement a highly secured, smart phone based voting mechanism?  There are many tech companies that are ready, willing and able to do this in the timeframe.  It might also actually help Encourage young people to vote!

There is no excuse, especially now with Coronavirus to not change the voting protocol nationally."
2020-03-09 19:07,What a perfect storm of circumstances. We have three elderly candidates. A virus that hits the elderly the hardest. A flu season that peaks in the fall. An election season that will peak in November. A need to reduce the spread of the virus by limiting social interactions. And an insane president who would just love to call the whole election off and remain in office by his own national security decree. Perfect! What could possibly go wrong?
2020-03-09 18:38,"Absentee ballots.  We have good reason - coronvirus.   Masks are useful.   Gloves are useful.   This is not panic but reasonable protection.    But, unless one is ill, get out your vote."
2020-03-09 18:17,"We're all mail-in voting in Washington State.  Furthermore, in my county, they used self-sealing envelopes (you remove the strip, and close the envelope).  Good thinking."
2020-03-09 18:23,"Why not develop some way to vote online? Don't all eligible voters have a unique Social Security number (or couldn't they get one before November)? That would solve many of the problems outlined in this article, imo."

2020-03-09 18:08,"If anyone believes that the suffering this country is experiencing will help us get Trump out of the White House, think again. All this pandemic will do is give Trump an excuse to declare martial law. Remember, we have a literally insane man sitting in the White House, surrounded by fawning sycophants as willfully ignorant as he.

Actions Trump may take? He may well cancel the November presidential election. The coronavirus, which he has so far denounced as a hoax, will suddenly become so serious that he must suspend our citizens' civil rights. 

A president's Constitutional power to declare martial law exists, but it is far from well-defined. There is little precedential case law defining its scope. And so far, this Supreme Court has bent over backwards to provide the expansive definitions of ""executive powers"" Trump seeks. The Roberts court granted him ""emergency powers"" for his Wall and the Muslim ban, on a claim wholly devoid of any facts. Trump simply said he needed to take those actions, and this Court took him at his word. 

And Trump will have the continued support of his base. Trump voters will continue to deny reality and say the virus doesn't exist. They have a ""president"" who tells them that as whites they are the only ""real"" Americans, and for this, they'll sacrifice the health and safety of their own family members. 

This pandemic has given Trump the excuse he needs, as his poll numbers decline these next few months, to seize absolute power. And he will."

2020-03-09 19:10,"A BIG SHOUT out to Andrea Cuomo, @NYGovCuomo.

""We’re hearing from local governments that acquiring hand sanitizer has been a real problem. 
   NYS will immediately begin producing hand sanitizer ourselves — 100,000 gallons per week. We'll provide it to government agencies, schools, the MTA, prisons, & others. 

What matters most is what they get done in between elections.

Cuomo or his staff just did something insanely great in response to this pandemic that eludes the Trumpers.
I wondered a day or so ago what would happen if a visitor, prison staff member or CO passes the virus on to an inmate?
Like nursing homes, prisons are Petrie dishes.

So Gov Cuomo's prompt initiative succeeds in covering many bases. Prisons will be fastidiously cleaned and they will also have abundant access to personal sanitizer.

""We'll provide it to government agencies, schools, the MTA, prisons, & others.""  Those were magic words. I expect all other governors to follow suit and to make sure that the immigrant detention centers get supplies. In our care/detention, they are vulnerable and we are responsible for them.

PS. Grocery stores and pharmacies need front door sanitizer stations. I asked at my local small market yesterday and he said yes they would do it—when they got a shipment of sanitizer in again. Their shelves were empty of several products. I got the last tub of Clorox wipes. I couldn't find any Hydrogen Peroxide wipes online."
2020-03-09 18:06,"THIS is one of the best reasons for mail-in Ballots, everywhere. Also, a real Paper trail, so protection from Computer “ glitches “.
   Just saying."
2020-03-09 18:12,"Licking envelopes has a simple solution: just don't do it. Use a damp cloth or paper towel and wet the envelope flap and stick it. In my humble opinion, we should all do mail in ballots. It is simple, can be done in the quiet of your own home and is relatively bug free. Just remember not to lick the flap. The counting/verification can also be done by using automation instead of using people. Standing in line to vote is really for the birds and should be eliminated."
2020-03-09 18:56,"It's really quite astonishing.  Within the last few months, Biden has publicly:

-got wrong when he was VP;
-got wrong what office he's running for right now;
-got wrong what state he was in;
-got the name of world leaders wrong;
-got his own name wrong.

Meanwhile - and predictably - Corey Booker has endorsed Biden.  Everybody is vying for the #2 spot as it becomes increasingly obvious that Biden, if elected, would quickly be removed from office under the 25th Amendment.  But of course the reasoning is flawed, because if Biden is nominated the #2 spot is already decided:  Mike Pence.

The endorsers of Biden are wearing invisible signs on their backs saying, ""Don't vote for Me!""  Tim Kane, I see yours plain as day.

Sanders is our only hope!"

While I applaud their efforts in creating the new voting system and making it accessible, disinfection is needed on the machines."
2020-03-09 18:47,There has never been a priority at the federal level to ensure the voting process.  Why?  Because this in power do no care about ensuring that everyone gets a voice. The result is a patchwork of incompetent officials each having their own outdated and often convoluted system for voting.  Can this be fixed?  Of course.  Will it be fixed? No - as no one in power has any incentive to do so.

 You can mail it from anywhere with no postage, or drop it off at one of several drop boxes locally.
There's no extremely hack-able voting machines, no lines, no voter intimidation at the polling place.
I have no idea why other states don't use this model.

Well, just kidding. I do know why. It's the voter suppression."
2020-03-09 19:47,"Not to downplay the situation, but virus spread by saliva when licking envelopes is not the biggest problem. Actual voting is. What if people feel reluctant to go to the polls because of coronavirus risk? That's the biggest problem.
State legislatures should now be considering robust vote-by-mail systems or other alternatives, and Congress should be ready to send federal funds to help states build up these systems."
2020-03-09 19:48,"It seems to me that the most logical thing to do, is to encourage  States change to a mail-in election.  Oregon already does this, and many States give the voter the option.  Arizona gives us the option, I’ve been doing it for years."
2020-03-09 20:11,I recommend highly vetted blockchain technology with global transparency and highly transparent accounting. Available to all eligible voters. Otherwise profound voter suppression opportunities will be the hallmark of GOP corruptive enterprises. It will be their only assured opportunity for success.
2020-03-09 20:02,"Obviously, mail-in ballots are a perfect choice during the time of the corona virus. As we head to what can only be expected to be highly rancorous elections next fall, our voting opportunities and availability will be critical.  If there are confusions, missed voting days, and any other myriad of unfortunate mishaps, I can imagine the current occupant of the white house, if the vote does not go his way, resisting the change of leadership. It could throw the country into even more turmoil than we are already in.  Every State should make this switch immediately. There is no excuse not to do so."
2020-03-09 19:39,"We here in WA state vote by mail. The primary being held ""today"" will hardly be affected by çorvid 19. Why this voting method is not adopted by every state is a mystery. Oh, right.  It would put a damper on many Republican voter suppression techniques."

Expect Republicans to block sensible democratic 2020 voter methods. I read the CPAC conference agenda. Voter suppression is a major agenda item. Anti-social medicine, more wealth tax cuts, more crafty ""opportunity zones"", how to corporate socialism prowess, stealing from social programs pre-paid for by recipients, and methods of gaslighting and social media warfare make up the rest.

With regard to the question “How long does Corona virus last in saliva that is on an envelope?” Assume that at temperature below 100 deg. C it could last for an indefinite length of time. Therefore gloves should be used for handling mail and all machines used for sorting should be wiped down with an antiviral disinfectant. As far as opening mail, if a self adhesive envelope is used then there is no need for saliva to be used. I never use saliva any way. I use clean water if the glue is already there. But steam could be used to open mail. I am not aware of any virus that can remain viable or infectious  at 100 deg C temperature."

We vote at home, in our underwear, while researching each ballot or candidate at our leisure.  Then we mail the ballots back in.  We don't have to worry about having time to go to the ballots, don't have to worry about long lines, weather, diseases.  Every member of the state has equal open access and there is no clever tricks used to suppress certain polling locations.  I have no idea why this is not the way everyone in the country votes."

I can vote early. I get a voters' guide for every election that has information about the candidates and ballot measures. This allows me to take my time considering how I want to vote. It gives the US Postal Service business. There is very low risk of hacking.  Hand recounts can be done if necessary. It makes it much easier for disabled and elderly people to vote. It avoids the lack of fairness that results from voting being managed variably across the state.  Voter eligibility can be easily verified. Voter intimidation cannot occur at polling places. 

It is just so easy and fair."

2020-03-09 21:13,"Several thoughts come to mind immediately. The Democratic presidential candidates are all at considerable risk. In Seattle for the older Americans the gap in time between having no symptoms and death was sometimes just several hours. The present administration will have thoughts only for itself. They will not put the wellbeing of the citizens first. Because they have already done so in other ways, we know they might very well even seek to deprioritize or even penalize the residents of blue states. This administration with its Russian election saboteurs will exploit this as much as they can--even as it continues to demonstrate, time and again, for those of us who can still think on our own, that they lack the competence and leadership to manage this emergency. To scientists and other citizens alike, Dr. Fauci's defense of the president yesterday was an embarrassment. I suppose he had to get Pence's approval before commenting. Fauci addressed the shortcomings of this administration's response as if he were writing a scientific paper about them. Well, that isn't what we are doing now and it isn't what the nation needed or expected from him. What he should have given us was the simple likelihood, based on his own experience, that such misteps as these were detrimental: firing most of the CDC's pandemics staffing, spreading conspiracy theories about vaccination, grossly inadequate testing and other capabilities, appointing ridiculously unqualified people."

2020-03-09 20:13,I believe that the possibility of getting Coronavirus pales in comparison to the odds that Donald Trump and a Republican Congress will cut the CDC. Go vote for Democrats who will actually spend our tax money wisely on things like the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. We need experts who can tell local doctors what these new viruses are doing and how they spread. We also need a Fish and Wildlife Service and Customs agents who will crack down on the global wildlife trade that started this and diplomats who will encourage offenders like China to do the same.

Even if the rate of new infections falls, that means ""the disease"" is still spreading, possibly killing some newly infected.

Furthermore, the more dire this new catastrophic disease becomes, the possibility remains of bad mutations of the debilitating virus menacing more people.

Furthermore, as the disease spreads around the world, more people could die due to limited life-saving resources. Furthermore, the stock market, a leading indicator of economic downturns, has been cratering, an indication of declining future growth.

A smaller world GDP means more poverty, with some living on the edge of existence being pushed off a cliff to their doom.

I hate to see elderly people on here fretting about getting a ballot in the mail, because it may be unsafe to touch!  

Viruses are picky about their environment.  For example, hand washing is now considered preferable to hand sanitizer, if it is done correctly.  Scientific studies show people don't contaminate each other if they use the same bar of soap when washing hands, even if they use the same bar one right after the other.

Those lysol/ chlorox brand disinfectant wipes won't kill some viruses, but they are effective against corona viruses.   That is because they have fatty membranes.    Same story with alcohol.   However, I question if it kills quickly.

There won't be one single solution. Each state must come up with several options: (1) extend early voting (2) mail in ballots made available to those who have never used them before (3) decrease polling place wait times by increasing polling place availability. 
This election is too important. We must devise alternative voting options ASAP."

No changing gloves etc.  Then I required a pat down and had to request a change of gloves, which they did, upon request. JFC! This is how contagion spreads. Nice to know this administration is on it. Not. 
I told the tsa agent and their supervisor, who will kick it up the chain. I had a bag for my infected Id, and I have alcohol to disinfect it.

Our region has many travelers to China and other hot regions in Asia for both business and family reasons. It's no wonder that testing shows the presence of the virus which, unfortunately, killed vulnerable patients.

All that said, please get a grip people. With the exception of some cancelled large gatherings and disruption of global markets due to the bumbling administration, life pretty much goes on normally. A boost in cleanliness is not necessarily a bad thing.

Trump has spoken:

11/7/17: ""Stock market hit yet another all-time record high yesterday. There is great confidence in the moves that my Administration is making”

2/24/20: the ""stock market is starting to look very good to me""

2/26/20: “I really think the stock market is something I know a lot about”

2020-03-09 12:38,"Buried somewhere among my possessions is an old brokerage statement from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Beane dating back to 1956 that records for posterity the fact that I purchased 20 shares of Royal Dutch -- the oil company that is now Royal Dutch Shell -- for $600. I was 16 years old at the time, and my father was already counseling me to lay some money aside for my old age. 

I don't recall where the money came from -- my only job until that time was as an assistant summer camp counselor for which I received the grand total of $50 -- but some of it was probably bar mitzvah gifts, and I’m guessing that my father just gave me the rest.

Here I am today smack dab in the middle of a worldwide health and financial crisis highlighted by plunging oil prices, so the question naturally arises, whatever became of those 20 shares.

And the short answer is, I still have them. Or did until I had to turn the actual stock certificate in a few years ago, when it became much more convenient to hold the shares electronically.

How much those 20 shares are worth today I couldn’t tell you, but counting a few share splits along the way and dividends that were frequently reinvested to purchase additional shares, it is surely a tidy sum, notwithstanding the deeply corrosive effects of 64 years of inflation and the recent steep fall of the share price.

The moral of this story being that if you still have some loose cash available to you, buy a few stocks.

While a lot of the market turmoil is due to the virus and oil issues, the re-pricing of risk is now also under way. American leadership - present in the past is obviously missing. Worst yet, communications and measures which do appear are harmful and create an impression of chaos. 

Markets are not ""all knowing"" or ""rational"". Over the last 4 years we have seen the worst risk assessment by markets in history. The re-evaluation of risk is now in full effect."
2020-03-09 13:04,"Normally, a drop in oil prices is a _good_ thing for the economy (unless you are Saudi Arabia or other OPEC country). Lower oil prices are good for businesses that depend on discretionary spending, businesses (such as airlines) for which fuel is a major cost input, etc. So I'm really not getting how a trade war between Saudi Arabia and Russia is somehow bad for any advanced, diversified economy.

Or is it just a sign of underlying irrational market fear? If there is actually an economic argument for why this should be a negative for the US economy overall, please feel free to enlighten me!"
2020-03-09 12:55,I think it is obvious. Markets are falling. Oil is collapsing. Gold is soring. Credit is freezing. Layoffs are surely coming. Bankruptcies and Foreclosures are then inevitable. All we need is a good name for it. Virusgeddon? Coronacession? Trumpruptcy?

2020-03-09 13:09,Why are falling oil prices not seen as a giant tax cut for the world?
2020-03-09 13:12,"America has needed a 12 trillion dollar infrastructure investment fiscal stimulus since 2008, with reforms so that the money is spent as wages going to people with the marginal propensity to consume (normal folks).  Instead, we have had massive monetary stimulus inflating asset prices and provide stimulus for the real (not merely monetary) economy along the way.

In short, we have had massive inflationary support of asset prices by printing money for the rich, but little actual fiscal (or monetary) stimulus of the sort that we would have normal price-inflationary pressures of expanding output as anti-inflationary (innovation lowering prices) competed with high consumer -- wage and income-based -- demand (tending to raise prices).  Because we have not had consumer-price inflation, apparently people lost their marbles and thought massive monetary stimulus was not inflationary.  The long ""bull run"" in the stock market is the natural result of printing money for the rich.  (More money needs to be printed for working folks.)

We need a fiscal policy that re-directs money into the pockets of the average consumer with a high marginal propensity to consume (a) to ease the pain that brought us Bernie and Trump and (b) to restore some normal and healthy inflationary pressure to prices.

NOTE TO DOLTS IN POWER:  Please do not mistake price increases due to temporary shortages because of disease disrupting China-linked supply lines with actual consumer price-inflation."

2020-03-09 13:33,"The falling oil prices are caused by the ""Coronavisus uncertainty"", and they in turn now cause further uncertainty in equity markets. 

The best way to disrupt this uncertainty, in my opinion, would be to have everyone take a coronavirus test, which of course must be free and easily available. The results should be connected to a database with basic personal information such as name, birthdate, and perhaps zip code. Then, for example, when making an airline reservation, the airline would only confirm the reservation if a match with this database finds that the person has a negative test result. This would make air travel safe again. The same system, perhaps with some modifications, could be adopted for schools, events of all kinds, etc."

People are afraid to fly, book cruises and go to public events with large crowds. This is all understandable. There is only one way to mitigate this financial crisis and that is to get a handle and finally get ahead of this corona virus. Test kits in the US must get out this week in significant volume to test the required number of people. Trump needs to stop lying and forcing his administration to hold back negative facts as the point of calming the population is long past. Results are the only way now to calm the public.

They haven’t distributed tests because they bungled them,” he tweeted. “They bungled the tests because there’s no competent management.

Oh but I forgot republicans made things better by de-regulation which removed the controls that would have prevented exactly this kind of rash action based on emotionalism not facts.

If these ""market"" people were thinking rationally the virus should only have required a slow down for the period of a couple incubation periods. But who wants to be rational and think ahead when it is so profitable to be able to take advantage of emotions? 

I'm guessing the Russian/Saudi oil thing is really an effort by either or both party's to slow sown the US oil industry. Another good example of why regulation was good. Oil or gasoline prices should not be able to be changed so fast. The oil that is out of the ground should have a fixed price on it already. Who is shipping oil without first having been paid the price for it in hand? Who is buying oil whose price is not known until it actually gets to the point of delivery? No sane people anyway."

3). Big Pharma has such a predatory hold on corporate media to scare easy money out of the Congress that they don’t care if the whole economy collapses as long as they get those hard earned tax dollars so they can pocket the majority, spend a fraction of it buying Congress and promoting Biden and Trump to keep them from losing to health care for all or EPA regs that would prevent pandemics from spreading so fast in the first place, much less exacerbate the problem by shutting down the economy just to siphon and scare money from us all.

Russia's 'breakeven' point is about 35 dollars a barrel; the Saudis need 70-80 dollars a barrel.  With the Covid-19 shock reducing demand even more, this oil shock is reverberating in the world economies everywhere. This shock will reverberate into the banks, cause bankruptcies, create deep problems with banks' capacity to lend.

The virus is shuttering business activity.  

Add it all up and it spells deflation.  Once a deflationary spiral sets in, they are very hard to dig out of.  Japan has been struggling with deflation for over 20 years now.

That's what the bond market is telling us.  The markets set that rate, not the Fed.  The bond market is anticipating reducing growth and reduction in commodity prices.

The scary part is that we have already used up our ammunition.  The only remedy is fiscal spending.  Trump created an enormous deficit with his irresponsible tax cuts for the rich.  Added more debt for the defense industry which mostly goes toward high end weapons, not salaries.  The Republicans are trying to cut spending on everything else.

Trump has succeeded in increasing debt without generating any long term benefit from investment.  He created a financial sugar high that boosted stock prices without an underlying industrial base to support them.  Then came the virus.

Every company needs to give their employees the green light to do that to avoid deaths.  Since most people recover without a problem, most people have nothing to worry about.  It's those who have underlying conditions that need to stay home to avoid it and we need to support and help them to do that until this passes and we get a vaccine.

How much farther down will it go this calendar year?  Who knows.  I think that most of us believe it's going significantly lower than it is now.

Part of it is due to the coronavirus pandemic.  

A separate part of it is due to Trump's botched response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Come on now, there's no denying that he has botched it and is still in the act of botching it.

A sequence of events has been triggered by the coronavirus pandemic that has now achieved a life of its own, much like an avalanche can begin with just a few pebbles.

Although Trump didn't start the coronavirus pandemic, his botched response made matters worse.  We elect presidents in part to stop things like this, not make matters worse.

He continues to make matters worse.

As a result, we now have a situation to deal with that shouldn't have happened, but is now happening because of Donald Trump.

Where it might end up, nobody knows, and that is the problem.

We can't stop Trump from making matters worse until January at the earliest.

So calm down folks. Wait a few weeks and get ready to pull out your wallets. There's no underlying reason for a recession, so it seems likely that once the correction stabilizes, we'll start to see gains again.

Right now, capital controls will be the next step to stop the bleed and have exchange rate move within a govt ""comfort' level but we know that's a fallacy but they are gonna try it anyway. 

So we expect the the drain on stock market valuation to affect real world valuation on assets and that will force a credit crunch which will not be addressed and it in turn will spiral into unemployment, deflation and social unrest. The Corona seek to catalyze this by injecting fear and magnifying the situation. The death rate at least is real enough for certain type of the population. we are talking 10-50% for someone with a pre existing condition and those in a weaken healthcare system.

The upside is nature will force efficiency in markets and industry. The poor, the old, the weakened as per all history will be eliminated to make way for a leaner, stronger populace.

I'm sure that people's faith in Donald Trump's leadership skills and deft mastery of difficult situations will assuage all financial fear to come.

2020-03-09 16:09,"The more I read comments in newspapers about the economy, the more I realise that many young people have no idea what sound economics is. We have had extremely low interest rates for more than a decade now and the authorities have been engaging in quantitative easing for just as long. As a result, young people have been raised to think that banks not paying interest to savers and just conjuring up money out of thin air in the form of QE to shore up asset prices is normal. It is not! The sooner we get back to running our Western economies based on sound economic principles, the better. Ultimately, we all gain when the growth in our economies is real, not illusory. The Germans can show the world a thing or two on how to run an economy based on sound economic principles. That’s probably because of the German experience in years past with hyperinflation and a collapsed economy. We need to heed the lessons of history."

2020-03-09 16:12,"in my opinion, index and exchange traded funds (ETFs) combined with the lack of a specialist system charged with maintaining orderly markets are largely responsible for the volatility behind the  recent and continuing large swings in the markets.

there is no research and no emotion except for the buyer and seller. when the orders are executed, a button is pushed and the trades take place with good stocks pulling bad ones up on buys and bad ones pulling good ones down on sells. 

ETFs, in particular, are constructed to bring fees to the sponsor but the small holders are at the mercy of the others. does there really need to be a vehicle to trade a basket of stocks with exposure to space? the internet of things? marijuana? does having a basket of these risky companies really provide anything to the investor?  ETFs are registered as investment companies, but there is really nobody to suggest that the operators know anything about the companies in the funds they have constructed. 

leveraged ETFs are even worse. holders can profit handsomely when the components go up, but they get chopped up when things are headed down.

i wonder if a dartboard method ETF would outperform the others. hmmm.
maybe i should set one up. i'm sure there are some juicy fees just waiting for me to collect from the suckers that are born every minute."

2020-03-09 16:18,First (and only) thing the GOP has passed is the tax cut.  It served to funnel extraordinarily large sums to the 1% and corporations.  Corporations and the 1% used this government money to buy back stock rather than increase worker benefits both in paychecks and medical insurance copays.  The absconded tax funds went primarily into corporation stock buybacks that increased stock prices without increasing profits.  The wealth gap grew but that was the plan.  Now that those stockholders are being asked by the market to take the fall (lets remember they own most of the US stocks) they are again asking for government pump priming to save their ill gotten gains.  Perhaps its time they think of using some of their ill gotten gains to set up testing sites at the workplace and granting employees paid sick leave.  Thats what a normal society would do but it's the farthest thing from their minds.  And for the rest of us RIP.

The stock market has in recent years become decoupled from underlying corporate earnings growth (in 2019, overall corporate earnings growth was close to zero but the S&P 500 still clocked in with a 30% gain for that year). The Federal Reserve's monetary policy appears to solely revolve around the stock market barometer not the actual economy. Their recent emergency 50 basis point cut occurred despite their assertion that the ""economy is strong."" Alrighty then, I guess you can have it both ways: the economy can be strong AND you can apply more stimulative monetary policy at the same time. Makes perfect sense. We've been in a giant ""everything bubble"" for a very long time now. That's why retirees are getting next to no interest on their savings. House prices in nearly all large urban centers have rocketed into the stratosphere. The stock market was, until very recently, a one-way ride upward. These grossly distorted markets were eventually going to get monkey hammered back down. The hammer should have been sensible fiscal and monetary policy. Instead, we had to rely on a black swan event: the Coronavirus. Welcome to America in the 21st century. We don't have rational planning here.

As an autocrat Putin has the power to do this, with his grip on the oligarchs and his own henchmen who control the Russian economy. What’s a free market economic system to do?

In this paper and elsewhere, we've been advised to lay in a 30-day supply of essentials. This is fine advice if you live in a suburb where there's only one grocery store and one pharmacy nearby. But it's inane advice to promote to people living in New York City. 

A friend told me last week that the store in her block was out of toilet paper because apparently people are hording it. But it makes no sense to fill up your apartment with excess supplies because there are so many stores in New York that people need only shop as they normally do and there won't be any shortages. The only thing that creates shortages is stupid panic-buying. And if someone gets sick and has to self-quarantine, practically every store in the city will deliver.

I honestly expected a significant downturn around now 1.5-2 yrs post  another idiotic deficit driving Trump/republican tax cut.  I assumed it would be because of the economic reality of the 10% increase in the national debt and the lack of economy improving policies like infrastructure spending etc. I was wrong-- it is simply because  of Trump's failed leadership in a real crisis and there are surely more to come over the next 5 yrs.

If we wind up seeing over 40 million Americans contracting the coronavirus, the current death rate of about 4% would translate into 1.6 million deaths and it would be the single greatest cause of death, more than a third of all deaths.  This is not the common cold, folks.  Quarantines are not going to work forever.  There will likely be a period when quarantines become worthless - when community spread swallows up their boundaries - before there is a vaccine with which to treat people.

From there, Russia & OPEC will work out the supply-equation, and then expect $2 upside gain for every $1 downside-risk til ~$55 per barrel.

4.Calling for stimulus is a pathetic, weak & misguided panic. The American economy, global-economy, equities, bonds & oil are all in long-term secular upside pattern, as fundamentals justify. There’s already more ample liquidity & cash searching for investment. When the dust settles where’s it going to go? It’ll rush back into U.S. equities, which remain the most sought-after, most secure, and highest returning ‘safe’ asset class in the world. Bond-yields < 1% won’t last very long. Sell bonds buy stocks.

Here’s the scoop:

There’s 4 forces interacting:

1.Global over-reaction to coronavirus
2.U.S. equities market-cap to gdp-ratio hit ~150% @ DJIA 29K
3.Oil prices tanking (coronavirus-slowdown + market-glut + pricewar + no consensus yet on prodcution-cutbacks)
4.Misguided ‘pundits’ / ‘experts’ requesting massive new stimulus.

Analysis / solutions: 

1.The media must take greater-responsibility and in an immediate,  concerted, globalized-campaign: communicate:
A)Coronavirus / covid-19 is NOT as severe as influenza, or many other common viruses, and the indcident-rate and mortality-rate is actually lower than common flu. People die daily from viruses, influenza, common flu, but it’s not widely reported
B)In perspective: within a week or so it’ll no longer be an issue on, comparable to the Y2K-computer scare, and the incident-rate in China has already decreased.

2.While it is true the last time U.S. equities market-cap = ~ 150% of GDP, it was March 2000 (just prior to the dot.com bubble-burst) the ‘froth’ in the March 2000 stock-market was due to no-revenue / no-earning ‘high-flying’ stocks. The March 2020 stock-market is NOT similarly over-priced: share-prices of companies are backed by real revenue & earnings, AND company balance-sheets & assets & growth-rates justify their multiples. Also, the March 2020 market-prices of total quantified-assets reflected in U.S. equities correctly-equate to share-prices (at DJIA 29K.)  DJIA 24K = extraordinary buying-opportunity"

Most commentators praise China for its heavy-handed crackdown, because at least it did ""something"" and it ""defeated"" the virus. Even with China's draconian, surveillance-state-enabled quarantines of tens of millions, thousands still died. There is no reason to believe that we would fare any better.

To me, the most frightening thing about this whole COVID-19 issue, combined with the pending presidential election, is that there is a significant minority of people in this country who view the answer to all problems as ""more government,"" and are willing to sacrifice any and all personal freedom or privacy for another handout or phantom security from mother nature.

And now he is looking for more economic stimulus for one reason only, the November elections. To save his own skin. I would love to see Trump's tax returns. We must see them."

Second, of those who get it and many already have and fully recovered they just don't know it, only a tiny segment are at risk. The very same population who are at risk every year from the flu. And of this last group, only a small percentage will have symptoms severe enough to warrant hospitalization and yes some will die just as many do each year from the flu. 

You would think this is the plague the way some are reacting or should I say overreacting. I'm not suggesting in any way that this should not be taken seriously, but lets get a grip on the reality of what we're dealing with. Of those who get Corona, 98% will fully recover and I think the percentage is actually higher because this number is based on the cases that have been identified. There are many who have had Corona, thought it was the flu, never sought treatment and have recovered. 

Today in Georgia, a single school employee in a single school tested positive, so they shut down all schools in the largest county of the state. Every school was shut down affecting thousands of students. Total lunacy.

On NPR this morning I listened to an administrator from the Los Angeles County health services.  She was sorta honest.  She said that the local labs -- Quest and Labcorp, I think -- are in the process of getting ready to do the testing.  She also said that it is not certain how many places can collect samples.  She pointed out that ""soon"" is not ""now"".

I am nauseated with the  pablum we have been fed by the Trump Administration.  Hide behind Mike Pence and tell us that ""soon"" there will be millions of tests.  Soon never comes.

Big Retirement Losses If The Market Crashes Tomorrow [Forbes]

It might not be a stock market crash  -- conventionally crash mode is a 10% drop or more -- but it might feel like one. On Tuesday Dec. 4, the S&P 500 fell -3.24%. Based on estimates from Monique Morrissey of the Economic Policy Institute when one considers stock holding of $5.2T in 401(k)-type accounts and IRAs, the retirement savings for all Americans fell by $155 billion yesterday. About 55% of the 24 million older American workers, age 50-64, who had, generously, $100,000, their account balances fell by $1,620 in one day. That kind of hurts. If that goes on it can hurt more.

If the market falls like it did in 2008-2009, these 13 or so million older workers would lose over $20,000. And, they simply won’t have time to recover especially if a family member loses their job and they have to take Social Security early.  As I have written before  the morbid joke about the Great Recession was that it turned Americans’ 401(k)s into 201(k)s. Indeed, the nation’s 401(k)s and IRAs lost about $2.4 trillion in the final two quarters of 2008. In 2008, those aged 30-50 had a median return of -30%. Over half of people over age 60 with 401(k) and IRAs lost more than 20%, according to Hewlett."

The market is anticipating disruptions in global supply chains and defaults on debts. It also expects that consumers are going to stop going to malls, restaurants, movie theaters, concerts and gyms. People may not just have to cancel vacations, but may be forced to stay home from work and school. 

The stimulus will at best address firms' near-term liquidity problems so that they can pay their upcoming debts. Perhaps renewed trade negotiations will help goods flow across borders (fingers crossed - safely). But if no one feels safe to leave their homes, that spending, in weeks or months, will have been a waste. The same firms and banks will be back begging for more. With this expectation, markets may react hardly at all, believing rightly that the action is a bandaid on a geyser. 

What we need first is a comprehensive public health solution. We need a national testing and containment strategy. We need quick and transparent flows of information. And we need a plan for medical facilities to get requisite materials for treatment.

And each political leaning seems to have its own strain.

Trump is not the cause of everything good.  Trump is not the cause of everything bad.  If you take away his social media hype, he's a more corrupt that usual president that has a less than mediocre record--that's why he has to rely on the hype.  He's nothing more than a skilled con man who figured out that some people on the Left love nothing more than  ""performing outrage"" and some people on the Right love nothing more than seeing the Left ""perform outrage"".  And so the wheel turns and turns again...

Meanwhile, many of us are able to see past this nonsense.  One of the main reason that Biden is surging is that many people see past this nonsense.  These people see Donald J. Trump for the Silvio Burlesconi type clown that he is.  These people see Bernie Sanders as a force that will like leave a legacy similar to Juan Peron.  And they reject both paths of instability.

--Fed up with clients only interested in getting the maximum tax break for themselves while doing as little as possible for their employees, he began to feel he could either remain a workplace benefits consultant or a Christian, but not both. 

Instead Benna, helped turn a little-noticed new subsection of the tax code into the least likely of household names: the 401(k).

Benna wasn’t the only one to see potential in section 401(k), but there were far more naysayers. ""Many of the big consulting firms still came out and said it was all a scam,” Wright said. In fact, the original purpose of section 401(k) was to limit the use of executive cash-deferred plans.  

--The 401(k)’s big regulatory hurdle, and perhaps its big marketing hurdle, was that administrators technically needed the IRS’s blessing to reduce employee wages in order to put money into the tax-deferred accounts. They were originally (and ominously) dubbed “salary-reduction plans.” ...

--But like many critics, in recent years Benna began to think 401(k)s might not be the right thing. He’d created “a monster” that should be “blown up,”

--The plans had grown so overcomplicated and so fraught with hidden fees and opportunities for bad decisions that they were better at enriching the financial industry than the actual savers — precisely the abuses that nearly drove him out of the business and to the Christian college back in 1980, he said."

Oh, and Trump has already promised his big donors there will be another big tax cut when he is re-elected.

Not to worry, and just ignore all that misinformation our dear president has been supplying about the epidemic and that the surging economy he took full credit for is not tanking, which, of course, is the fault of the media.

It is also evident that they are doing everything they can to hide the numbers of the infected, which is the WORST thing they could be doing in every conceivable way.

Until today, the risk was that a companies and countries carrying too much debt could be come insolvent as the pandemic grows and economies slump.  If the losses to bondholders and lenders were high enough, I suspect we would see markets grind to a halt as banks stop dealing with each other.  Since 2008 ,when this last happened, little has changed in terms of policing the derivatives banks create to insure lenders against loss.   Nobody knows who is insuring whose lending and for how much.  So fear will govern.

Now it looks like market volatility itself could precipitate a crisis for very similar reasons.  Banks trade on their own account, but they also issue derivatives that are effectively bets on positions taken by other market participants.  It may take a wobble from just one firm to cause trading and lending between banks to seize up again.

The difference this time will be that, whatever steps governments take to save the global economy, will happen in the midst of a a huge slump in demand and supply caused by the pandemic."

I don't think I need to explain the population density/city dwelling coloration to democratic voters. 

Anyone that's seen the turnouts at Trump rallies compared to Biden's ""town halls"" would be wise to further tone down their optimism.  Trump has more support now than he did in 2016.  Even if we factor in the higher percentage of people afraid to admit their support back then in fear of being verbally accosted.

A Biden/Warren or Biden/Clinton ticket they have planned will not be enough to overcome the moral/ideological fracture in the democratic party.

Afterwards, we all started down the stairwell and eventually got outside. And as all the people from all the various buildings filed out into the street, almost in slow motion, something amazing happened.

And what happened was that we all realized that we were still alive. That we were incredibly grateful for that fact. And that we were all, all of us, thinking exactly the same thing.

I have never felt so incredibly close to so many people on such a deeply moving and emotional level ever before, or since. And that connection lasted for sometime afterwards. For a few days at least. Maybe a week. And then, eventually, we all returned to out usual routines, and comparatively petty concerns.

In times of uncertainty, we look to those things that have provided us with consistency over the years to anchors us until the storm passes. And what are those things? Those things that will see us through?

It's not the stock market. Or our everyday business concerns. Or the myriad distractions we face everyday. It's our love, understanding, and compassion for one another that will. Commodities which have been far too scarce for far too long. But will become absolutely essential if we are going to weather this storm.

There's a war on. And if we don't all pull together, there's very little chance we will live to see another."

Redirect those funds into an account that can act in concert with a FEMA-like mission to evaluate losses from individuals with either direct infection or loss of income due to business slowdowns.  

If they direct the remedy to individuals, it should minimize the loss of income and increased debt as a result (e.g., home and car foreclosures, bankruptcies, etc.).  A payroll tax cut or deferment is great for those who have financial buffer in place but I don't think an extra $50-100 will cover the mortgage or food costs.

There should be a separate cost accounting by hospitals and health care facilities of expenses associated with COVID-19 treatments or impacts and an ability to be recoup those costs.  It could be handled by a parallel type FEMA funding or handled distinctly through HHS and CMMS.  Ditto for the VA.

As for corporate businesses, they should be able to offset some of the losses through their tax write offs but the losses that are beyond that need to be recouped through a different mechanism (suggestions anyone?)

If we are looking at a global COVID-19 exposure that could last 12-24 months, then there were need to be long-term alternative revenues for diminished business and lost worked wages.  An infrastructure bill would help too."

The balance in the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund is currently projected to reach zero in 2026.  The balance in the much larger Social Security trust fund (which pays retirement and disability benefits) is projected to be exhausted around 2033.  Lower interest rates on Treasury instruments in which these funds are invested will also put pressure on them.  The benefit of cutting these taxes will go to workers and their employees and help the economy to bounce back from any future recession, but if this is truly necessary, why not borrow money at near-zero interest rates to fund it?"

of 2007. President Barack Obama cleaned up that economic disaster and handed off to President Donald Trump a healthy recovery and the longest economic growth period in U.S. history. Then President Trump idiotically repeated the mistakes of past Republican presidents and cut taxes for the wealthy and then went even further and imposed tariffs on China, India and other trading partners. Trump's incompetent handling of the U.S. economy -- similar to the incompetent way he handled his businesses -- ensured that we would descend into yet another recession. We expect a few bumps in the economy, but Trump's mishandling of it will make it worse and possibly another disaster a little over a decade from the last Republican economic disaster. 

From the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, Republican presidents have overseen the worst economies, and Democratic presidents have had to bail the country out of catastrophe after catastrophe. We need to understand the history of our country to avoid repeating mistakes. Mistakes like electing Republicans.

By further cutting payroll taxes now it will add to the stress on the trust funds bringing further forward the depletion date.

However, the Korean politicians amplifying the populist sentiment of hatred and anger towards the Shincheonji church is a manipulation. And yes, this is happening everywhere(even in the US with Trump gaslighting the public).  Manipulating, creating, and drawing the public’s attention to unnecessary distractions. 

If we dial down the distractions and noise propaganda, the root of all these cults (young and old people in Korea) seeking “salvation” from these shamanistic religions shows how unhappy the majority of the population are. The movie Parasite clearly shows the income inequality that is prevalent in Korean society due to the “chaebols” controlling all facets of the economy. 

I hope the Korean government will be able to focus their attention to help their youth (whom are mostly all college graduates) get job opportunities and have the liberty to create their own start ups or small businesses without being crushed by conglomerates who infiltrate every industry from making cell phones to a local chicken store. 

The discontent with income inequality is causing protests in Hong Kong, Argentina and even the hatred of refugees or immigrants(all of Europe and the US)."

Whatever you think of this church, it's members are not guilty of propagating the virus. The science is in on this one. They are victims of an epidemic — show some mercy, or at the very least leave them alone.

2020-03-10 15:20,"The Shincheonji Church of Jesus, like the Unification Church before it, uses sophisticated psychological techniques to lure and control their members.  For those who study religious cults, their techniques come right out of Lifton (1961), a psychological study of the brainwashing techniques used during and after the Korean War.

Perhaps its no coincidence that these churches coexist with the ROK Armed Forces: a military with one of the finest psychological operations in the world.  After all, the army constantly discharges military personnel directly into the civilian sector, and psyops are perfectly suited to the formation of religious cults.  Like here in the U.S., the military probably has a 'release and forget' policy towards their people.

I was surprised to find out in this article that the Shincheonji Church uses light sticks during their spectacular graduation ceremony.  These are similar to those used by the Korean K-pop group BTS during their (Asian) concerts.  These devices seem to perform the same function as a television 'laugh track', by centrally controlling applause.  Their psychological function is probably to instill a similar central control in the audience.

How about NYT write about how South Korea is handling this outbreak instead? For example, how thoroughly they are tracking and testing possible cases and how efficiently and swiftly they are responding to the whole situation? They have very effective public awareness campaigns, they have drive-through testing centers (genius!!), they have websites like www.wuhanvirus.kr where you can literally check every single case of over 7000 people (without compromising any of patients’ privacy) and very accurate statistics of almost everything related to this pandemic and in a very transparent way. They have tested over 100,000 people, over 7500 people confirmed and only 58 death so far. I think they way South Korea is dealing with this coronavirus should be the model for all countries. Their data will become a great source for studying this virus when this is over and dust is settled. Go check out the website I mentioned above, you can get a translated version."
2020-03-11 1:41,"It is understandable that people are criticizing Shincheonji's mass even after some believers are confirmed Wuhan corona virus. However, they should not be harassed or scourged just because of their religion. This outbreak is mainly due to Moon government's failure in containing the virus. Many experts strongly recommended the travel ban from China must be imposed at the initial stage of Wuhan virus outbreak, however Moon did not listen, and even now completely open. Last January over 1,000 Chinese travelers visited Daegu, where the biggest outbreak started. Shincheonji are just one of the victims. Moon is using Shincheonji to cover their fatal mistakes.

There is not sufficient evidence to show that treatment in a hospital improves the survival chances of those elderly with other health problems. If this is true then it may be that those elderly should not be admitted to beds that might better be reserved for persons whose chances are better.

Trump ignores the experts, spins his own ideas and alternate facts and gets angry when the experts paint a more realistic picture. Suddenly, Trump seems to be taking the coronavirus more seriously because the economy is being impacted.  Adding more insult to injury, Matt Gaetz, one of Trump’s staunch supporters, wore a face mask on the House Floor mocking the coronavirus while voting for funding. People are getting sick and dying all over the world and this guy decides to make fun of the virus, I wonder what these elected officials are really saying behind closed doors or if they even care.…..so, how serious is the administration’s effort in dealing with the virus?"

In the US, who profits from wellness, from sickness?

The U.S. is a palace built upon a dung heap, closer to being like the Philippines or Brazil than to Sweden or Canada in terms of socioeconomic structure. Shareholder capitalism means that companies in the transportation and hospitality industries will fire their entire workforces if necessary. Huge numbers of people will no longer be able to pay their rent/mortgage and will end up on the streets. The social safety net is totally inadequate and health insurance is treated as a commodity.

This translates to the following odds: 10.8% of the total population will get infected; 1.38% of those who become sick will be hospitalized; 0.1% of those who get infected will die; odds of dying from influenza for general population is 0.01%.

My job will have me in the presence of 10,000+ US citizens over the next 8 months. I have two young sons and a wife depending on me to bring home the bacon. Simultaneously, I would be considered high risk with asthma, an autoimmune disease, and I am on immunosuppressant drugs every day. 

To say that I feel disappointed in our leadership is not nearly enough. It feels a lot more like rage. There are less than 100,000 ventilators in the entirety of America, and my personal experience with three different hospitals is that they are full to the brim, disorganized and understaffed in a world before Covid. 

The new American dream is to go to bed at night and not be thrusted in existential crisis knowing there are lunatics at the reigns. It’s a far cry from what this country used to represent.

The federal government was slow to react to COVID-19. They could have started using the WHO test weeks ago. Instead the CDC created a faulty test (later fixed) and it took too long before institutions other than the CDC were allowed to use their own tests.

The region is rife with people who have been exposed to the virus, who have suffered mind-boggling barriers to getting tested. 

According to the UW lab, the problem is getting a doctor to approve the test. Evidently, doctors are not approving the test, according to a nurse who did not want to be named, because they do not want infected people to come to their hospitals. They do not have the capacity to treat people who are infected. They do not have enough masks. (NPR/KUOW report this morning)

Sounds like Seattle is destined for 1) people spreading the virus unknowingly wider and wider, and 2) people dying at home, evidently, because hospitals don't wan't/can't treat them.

Version S' (ancestral) can be, and has been, detected throughout the world. Though relatively benign as far as viruses go, coincidentally a couple of the strains blew through (and are blowing through) the U.S. during this past flu season: influenza A and influenza B ---both are types of coronaviruses (cf. CDC's or NIH's web sites) from which there have been some 30,000 mortalities in North America alone. Naturally, the evolving 'version L' strain of this particular SARS-CoV-2 would show-up FIRST in the world's largest Petri-dish: China and the Asian continent...and then people move, and it shows up elsewhere. And yes, as usual, the elderly, people with underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure, COPD, heart problems etc. are susceptible. The somewhat asymptomatic 'Evolving version L' may be piggybacking (actually living-off of) its host: 'ancestral version S,' and thus has been 'slippery' and rather undetectable. But it soon will be detected in the U.S. and North America more-and-more, as it was in China (the U.S. CDC bungled its first testing equipment after blowing off  and not importing both So.

This could explain the severe response in China, the origin of SARS and SARSCov2. The lesser response elsewhere, where SARS made it's round.....follow the Chinese tourists around the world. It might explain Italy. So the high mortality due to SARS in 2003 might have been in people exposed to yet another previous virus from this family. It might explain why children who were not exposed to SARS are not falling as sick. It might explain why elderly people who have seen viruses for a long time might be more affected (long term immune memory). And it explains why pregnant women with suppressed immune systems are not hijacked by this virus. The lower extent of women being affected....I don't even believe China or Asia where women are treated shabbily with regards to hospital care. Let's wait for more data. For those students of medicine and virology please look up Antibody dependent enhancement, where a virus hijacks the immune system via long term immune memory.

My wife and I are in our 70’s so yesterday I called Regent cruise line to cancel our upcoming cruise to the Baltic. I was informed that our $4,000 deposit would not be refunded but instead put in a “Reassurance Account” to be applied to a future cruise that must be booked within a year.

No one knows if the coronavirus will be gone in a year, my wife and I are getting older and less mobile, and based on recent events we have zero confidence in the ability of Regent and other cruise lines to keep their ships from becoming floating Petri dishes.

Indeed, based on my conversation with Regent I can confirm that cruise lines are not likely ever to give deposit refunds—bookers beware!

Exposure to coronavirus is frightening, disruptive and dangerous whatever one’s age, so think twice—or 3 or 4 times—before booking with Regent or any other cruise line; they do not refund deposits even when their trips are scheduled to stop in countries with confirmed coronavirus cases and the US government recommends not taking cruises.

Contact your Senators and Congresspersons to let them know the other dirty secret of Regent and other cruise lines."

Another big statistic to look at is mortality rate. China outside Wuhan, Korea, other parts of Asia it is so much better than the rest of the world. It seems that if you can control the virus for it not to exceed the capabilities of your medical system, the effects can be mitigated. So you need a good medical system and a good response.

I never type in caps, but this is an urgent matter.  Teachers and students are receiving emails from College presidents containing cleaning info and hygiene tips.  People over 60 with underlying conditions are told to contact their chairs about online teaching, but are not being encouraged to teach online.  Moreover, many of our students are older, have underlying conditions, or live  - it’s a commuter university - with older or other vulnerable people.

CUNY must be closed, or courses must move online.  The technology is in place for online teaching; CUNY can move online in a day or two.

Fordham, Columbia, Barnard and NYU are going on line, and CUNY has the technology for online teaching available and in place. 

Please - help us.  The CUNY administration has offered Clorox, soap and Mr. Clean, not common sense.  The CDC, NIH and our state and local governments have advised older people and those with underlying conditions to stay home.  Yet the policy at CUNY remains that those of us who believe we qualify can ask - apparently, must document - their need.  That is ridiculous, particularly given that EVERYONE COMMUTES, the virus is highly contagious, there is airborne transmission,  and people have older relatives at home. 

PLEASE.  HELP.  NOW."

To do these in reverse is a fatal flaw and will cost many lives and create chaos. It will also prove ineffective for the financial markets/economy and we will see continued volatility and declines.

Some highlights:

""White House efforts included reducing $15 billion in national health spending and cutting the global disease-fighting operational budgets of the CDC, NSC, DHS, and HHS. And the government’s $30 million Complex Crises Fund was eliminated.""

""In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC’s entire global health security unit shut down… The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer’s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10."" 

""Klain [epidemic 'czar' under President Obama] has been warning for two years that the United States was in grave danger should a pandemic emerge. In 2017 and 2018, the philanthropist billionaire Bill Gates met repeatedly with Bolton and H.R. McMaster, warning that ongoing cuts to the global health disease infrastructure would render the United States vulnerable to, as he put it, the “significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes.”"

2020-03-10 15:42,"I think the press needs to be careful how they present the increase in the number of cases.  I checked March 1 data for the US -- at that time we had 87 cases.  So we've gone up a factor of 10  or close to it.  But, what does that mean about the virus?  Of all the people who have tested positive for the virus since then -- how many were already exposed on March 1?  How many people became exposed after March 1 by contact with people who were asymptomatic or thought they just had a cold.  I don't think we'll continue to see this level of growth in cases going forward.

If you look at the global numbers we had 87k on March 1 -- now we have 114k.  So clearly the growth rate in the number of cases globally is slowing globally.  

I also think everyone needs to recognize that most of the cases still occurred in China, in a highly densely populated area where it spread before anyone knew what was happening and the initial responses weren't adequate.  

Certainly, we'll see more cases.  But the number of new cases we see globally and the US should slow and many of those will be the artifact of delays in testing or people becoming exposed before we really had any handle on the virus.

What is true is that fear and anxiety have spread much faster than the disease -- thanks to the MSM.  While caution is advised, I wonder what the MSM will do (who've used corona to hammer Trump) will say when it turns out that Trump is right and this is pretty much like the flu."
2020-03-10 15:45,"Worth noting the known caseload is suppressed in the US. The administration’s public statement is that anyone who wants to get tested can, and all you need is a doctor’s orders.

(The government is acting incompetently. If Democrats point this out, Republicans say they are trying to bring down Trump. Their refusal to deal with the outbreak in favor of propping up Trump is a dereliction of duty, to say the least. Democrats need to speak up more. Trump seems to have cowed them too.)"
2020-03-10 15:27,"I was at my doctor's office the other day to discuss a recent health issue I have encountered.  He asked me a ton of questions and took a bunch of tests.  He will monitor my symptoms but is fairly sure the grief I am experiencing from the sudden passing of a very close friend is at the root of my situation.

The sense of relief and trust I have for my doctor (whom I have known for many, many years) is similar to how I feel towards the incredible folks at the NYTimes.  I've said this before, but I feel it warrants repeating - I would be lost without their continual and dogged reporting and investigative efforts and stories.  Heck, there is not a lot of truth or facts emanating from the White House or their supposed ""Communications"" Division.  And the information given out is either half-truths or bold face lies.

It's one thing to feel confident in one's personal physician.  But to have more faith and trust in the NYTimes than I could ever feel with THIS president and administration - well that indeed is a very sad, deplorable and scary scenario.  It was bad enough to not trust the Nixon administration.  But in all honesty, what those folks did and what is presently going on seems like small spuds to this farm girl.

Thank you NYTimes for keeping us afloat with the news stories and updates on a daily, if not hourly basis.  Yet another solid reason why I am a subscriber to this news source."
2020-03-10 15:24,"The powers that be are doing us all a big disservice.

The only reason numbers of infected people aren't higher in the US is because we are not testing.

In Italy they're testing like crazy and providing daily updates on their website (infected, critical, cured, total).  Full transparency.

In the US, the most medically advanced nation in the world, we're bungling things.  

We cannot measure what we don't count!"

2020-03-10 15:35,"I remember the New York Times ran a story every three days since late January criticizing the Chinese government and nitpicking every little thing from people that can't get a bed in a hospital to insufficient testing kits and supplies in supermarkets. One highlight was of course saying in a democracy this disease would not have progressed to the extent it did because of transparency. 

So the democratic west had about a month's notice of this epidemic when it started in late January in China. Since the New York Times said democracy and transparency is superior in dealing with epidemics, then surely with this much time to prepare its not possible for there to be community spread in the west. After all, the United States even went against WHO guidelines at the time and banned Chinese entry to the US in late January. 

What do we see today? US supermarkets rationing toilet paper, insufficient testing kits, and a government that keeps playing down the epidemic despite mounting cases and deaths. 

Ironically, part of the reason the American response has been so tepid is because its body politic and media companies spared no effort in its earlier messaging blaming China, Chinese habits, and the communist government. So if it starts to enact the same measures as China it would be a tremendous humiliation."
2020-03-10 15:38,"How do we really know how many coronavirus cases there are in the country, since the reported numbers have been kept artificially low because of the scarcity of available tests.

Despite the President's blather about having the virus ""under control"", he would have absolutely no way of knowing that that's true without an active nationwide testing program, and that simply does not exist.  More Trump-generated fake news.

We would need the availability of literally several millions pf tests spread throughout the nation, trained medical staff who know how to administer it and a careful tracking system to find contacts of victims of the virus to have a basic idea of how extensive the pandemic is in the US, and because of Trump stalling none of that has happened.  There's not even solid, truthful information about how many test kits are being produced every day, and where they're going.

You have to wonder how bad it will get before the administration gives us real numbers and real information about what they're doing to stop the spread of what may well be an epidemic."
2020-03-10 15:35,"Michigan doesn't have cases because we have tested merely 63 people - we only have testing capabilities for 375-400 people. More than 400 people are being monitored but have not been tested because we don't have enough tests.

We have numbers of deaths, age and sex, how many people who have been tested, and how many tested people have/had the virus.  Doctors are saying older people, people with high blood pressure, people with diabetes, people with weak immune systems, and people with respiratory problems are more likely to die from the virus.  That describes most people that die.  If you had a million people of all ages and known illnesses be exposed to the virus, and documented types of treatments and outcomes, you could start a statistical analysis.  Then sub groups would be would be studied again and again.  That is what delays pharmaceutical companies from rushing for cures to known diseases.

Trump deserved more than impeachment over his Ukrainian shakedown for campaign dirt, but he needs to forget his ego and remember he works for all the people. Trying to freeze Democrats out is childish pique and demonstrates both his immaturity and his incompetence.

Meanwhile, his current stunt is another self centered PR move that will delay real congressional action. Whatever he and Republicans are planning will almost certainly be more limited and business centric. Instead, it needs a strong focus where the harm is most severe, namely the homeless, the working poor, and those uninsured or poorly insured.

The government just announced a number of significant measures, including the closure of all universities beginning on Monday, restrictions and checks on the Austrian-Italian border, a prohibition on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people as well as a prohibition on outdoor gatherings with more than 500 people. There has also been an appeal for social distancing and companies have been urged to allow workers to work from home. 

Almost from the very beginning of the outbreak, anyone with symptoms was advised to stay home (in order to avoid infecting others) and ring a dedicated hotline (1450) at which point a determination would be made regarding the best course of action. Here in Vienna, if the person's condition was deemed to be serious, then a dedicated team would transfer the person to a special section of a city hospital trained in treating epidemics. 

At this point, over 5,000 people have been tested across the country, and the present restrictions are meant to safeguard hospitals from being overwhelmed by an overlap between flu cases (high at the moment) and COVID-19 cases (rising).  

Aside from a few missteps, this seems to be a proactive, rational, and effective approach with some success (for now)."
2020-03-10 16:57,"I have my doubts about Gov. Cuomo's ""containment"" efforts.  My own view is that we should assume it's already spread everywhere (despite the lack of diagnoses) and work backwards.

The steps he was talking about yesterday are right out of the “Socialist” playbook the right have been against for years. And considering the right have been pushing the idea that the flu is worse, one has to ask: if Covid-19 deserves this response, then wouldn’t that mean these policies should be adopted more permanently?"

This new coronavirus will almost certainly continue circulating for at least another year. A vaccine and effective antivirals will hopefully come online by next year. But before this epidemic subsides a lot of people will probably get sick, and a not insignificant number will die. Buckle up. This is probably going to be a long and bumpy ride."

They haven’t noticed that most of the places are high risk or will be soon!I am tired of local health institutions not making enough effort to be prepared for outbreak.Most of all I am tired of lack of cohesive, uniform strategy on all levels in this country to mitigate dangers of rapidly spreading pandemic.
I am not giving up though.On my local levels, I am trying to stir things up a bit, demand answers and action.I work in a hospital and surely administration is trying to prepare for spread of Covid-19 here.Are they doing enough? In my opinion not, especially when instead of being proactive, they mostly rely on local Department of Public Health.

I listened to Bill Deblasio today and I think his decision to keep the New York City kids in school could really backfire. Luckily individuals under 20 are not getting impacted as much as older people or people with extenuating medical conditions. 

If NYC kids become carriers of the virus the healthy kids may not suffer too bad. Kids with complicating factors could have a much tougher time fighting the virus. The biggest problem I see is that parents, grand parents, care givers, and others are infected by the kids who are carrying the virus."

Since the nature and prophylaxis of the two infections is virtually identical but our response to them is so different than something other than best medical practices must be at work.

That ""something"" is really two things. One is sensationalist journalism and the other is the politicalization of Covid in order to attack Trump.

Such a vastly disparate response to nearly identical situations leaves little room for anything other than cynicism."

Korea got a handle on its situation by taking aggressive action and testing. Italy has now shut down.  Just shut everything down now, before we have more cases.  Doing it a week later only means more cases and we're behind the ball already because the very stable genius that runs this country had a hunch that the US wouldn't get it."

To understand the background of the Trump administration's response to Covid-19 I suggest people read Michael Lewis' 'The Fifth Risk'.

Never seen so many people out on a Tuesday afternoon, enjoying sporting outdoor life in the sun in the main city park along the river. Certainly, the lockdown of schools and offices helped. Not a single cop around. People were (mostly) keeping safe distance but didn't give up social life. Dogs, in particular, are always an excellent excuse to socialize. But what really surprised me was everyone's great composure. Data shows that we are still in the exponential phase of the epidemic curve, but my country seems to face it with unexpected calm. I don't think it's recklessness. I think it's just patiently waiting for better days without being brought overly down by a situation you have little control of.

2020-03-10 18:30,""" So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!
7:47 AM - Mar 9, 2020 ""

This is what the President tweeted this morning. He is unable to comprehend the danger of a surge of any contagious disease in the absence of a vaccine or treatment.

The outbreak unfolds in northern Italy is almost a mirror image of Wuhan. The population in northern Italy is 16 millions, Wuhan 11 millions. Italy has a population of 60 millions and so is Hubei province. For the past week, the number of confirmed cases in Italy surged over 9,000 with over 500 deaths. Overnight, PM Conte announced lock down whole country to limit travel and congregation.

We need more testing to be done urgently to identify infected patients for isolation or treatment and to quarantine the contacts. Hopefully, this can prevent the surge of an outbreak to minimize the inevitable morbidity and mortality. 

Trump in an night interview with Hannity at Fox News said, "" Patients with mild symptoms can go to work and many never seen by a doctor "".

If we listen to the president contrary to health official recommendations, five congressmen may not be required self quarantine after close contact with a confirmed covid-19 attendee in CAPC. Ironically, Matt Gaetz wore a gas mask in the House Chamber few days before his self quarantine."
2020-03-10 18:26,More faux concerns and false platitudes from Republicans that do not care.  Remember conservationism does not include compassion.  It is every person for himself.  Sharing and helping others is socialism that should be immediately snuffed out.  All the better so no one can see that it actually works.
2020-03-10 18:32,I see many reasons particularly during a world pandemic to criticize Trump. His denial about the significance of the outbreak on our population and his out and out lies to the public are astonishing. However this morning I see CNN hosts and others locking in on the notion that Trump is somehow being derelict to not be tested for Coronavirus. His known exposure to second hand PUI is fairly remote. His need for testing is not indicated. I prefer that my news sources be driven by political hacks. That's why I don't listen to FOX news. But it is embarrassing to see the partisanship ramping up over this issue when it is blatantly not science driven. Trump politicizes everything and this attack plays into his factless narratives of fake news.
2020-03-10 17:57,"So now we know what it takes for the GOP to offer a tax cut to the working class.

If you’re rich, you get a trillion dollars as soon as they take charge. If you’re not, you get a payroll tax cut when there’s a once-in-a-century pandemic.

My fellow Americans, please remember this when they’re promising the moon and stars come election season."
2020-03-10 18:03,"It’s not just that Trump has gutted social services. He gave the rich a massive tax cut producing a massive deficit. Now with no money to deal with this crisis. He wants to fund it by cutting payroll taxes, which will further weaken Social Security and Medicare. What a cynical ploy. I have a better idea. How about rescinding the tax cut for the rich? They’re going to be victims too."
2020-03-10 18:04,"Curious why Trump is only talking to Republican lawmakers about Covid 19 strategies. I pay taxes that cover salaries and expenses for elected officials and staff bureaucrats. If I happen to be a Democrat  does that mean representation for me is null? Is Trump only the president for Republicans? If  that is the case, may I please have a refund for the past 3 yrs of taxes?"
2020-03-10 18:12,"Good evening from a country lost in a dystopian nightmare. All the people are walking around in surgical masks. If one person with a mask meets another person with a mask, the trajectory of both people changes. Schools are closed, courts are closed, homes are closed to friends. The only disease that seems to exist is the coronavirus. All the other sick people don't seem to count. My father (82 years old) has cancer, he does not move from his bed, but all the doctors seem busy fighting (and fearing) this new enemy. And our government tells us every day that things are going to get worse. It's all surreal."
2020-03-10 18:03,"SO why does Don the Con only want to meet with Repubs about a tax cut? If he doesn't have the whole of congress on board, it will go nowhere. Is this just another ploy to his base so he can say he tried to help the little guy? It would have been better if they had not used the tax cut a couple years ago so they would still have some ammunition for the upcoming recession. And none of this does anything to contain the spread of the coronavirus."
2020-03-10 18:08,"The worst time could begin next week, when spring break ends and numerous students who travel around the US or overseas bring the virus back to their universities. All universities should change to remote education or online courses, at least for the next 2 weeks to avoid the potential infection."
2020-03-10 18:37,"One does not need an advanced degree in public health to know how insufficient this measure is. Tests to determine who already has the disease are in short supply. Covid-19 virus is notoriously difficult to detect, even if tests were readily available. Many patients experience no symptoms at all and don’t seek medical attention. Asymptomatic hosts of the virus may not know that they have been exposed to it—in the subway, say.  Their unawareness, however, doesn’t make them less contagious. They are vectors freely spreading the virus everywhere. Isolation and quarantine are effective measures sometime, but with Covid-19, a much more Draconian approach is needed. It is questionable if it’s even too late for the “shelter-in-place” option."
2020-03-10 18:44,"There are many people like myself, who can reasonably follow a regimen of social distancing that relies on careful management  of contacts with other people.  But there are many more people who cannot.

I don't understand how a school can close for disinfection, and then immediately allow pupils to return without testing the pupils.  Children are ideal carriers of the virus, whether or not they become infected.  By carrying it unknowingly to their homes or their neighborhoods,  they open a 2-way street to virus-bearing people, and re-infect the school-building itself.  

The only way to limit the hazard at the school is to test every single pupil, and to quarantine any pupil who is positive.  If multiple cleanings and tests are required,  so be it.

In the meantime,  closing the school seems like a crude but obvious step during this period when evidence of effectiveness of mitigation is not  available because of the non-availability of tests,  not to mention quick-turnaround processing capability for tests. 

Telling people to remain calm seems like a very effective way of inducing panic."
2020-03-10 18:46,"Responsible news outlets have a responsibility to explain the ""stimulus"" payroll tax cut they put in their stories will actually weaken Social Security and Medicare funding.  That's what Trump has long wanted.  So the MSM are doing his work for him. The news should be about Trump promoting a stealth way to diminish the safety net for millions.  Many of us believe the MSM has ill-served us during Trump's presidency.  This is an example."
2020-03-10 18:51,"Interesting how the GOP has claimed for years that people who pay payroll taxes aren't ""paying taxes"".  (Thus the claim that 47% of Americans don't pay ""taxes"".)

So exactly how is this a ""tax cut"", GOP?  Does the definition simply change one week to the next?"
2020-03-10 18:59,"Watch what happens with any ""payroll taxcut"" Trump and Republicans cook up.  They'll suspend collection of FICA and call it a successful stimulus.

But, first of all, it won't be a stimulus because, although people may use the little extra money in their paychecks to pay off debts, they won't be making new (stimulating) expenditure on restaurants or trips because fear of the novel coronavirus.

And, second, UNLIKE Obama, who also suspended FICA tax collection during the Great Recession, they will NOT use the General Fund to pay back the Social Security Fund once the ""stimulus"" is over.  This will be another backhanded way to gut Social Security while pretending to be heroes."
2020-03-10 19:03,The payroll tax relief is merely an effort by Trump to buy votes. If we didn't have an election at hand there would be no such proposal. After the big tax revenue giveaway the debt has skyrocketed.
2020-03-10 19:06,"As a Democrat, I’ve never been a huge fan of Cuomo.  However, I have to say he is exerting leadership in the absence of any from the federal government."
2020-03-10 19:08,"Isn't a payroll tax cut another way of asking the workers to pay for this crises. Reduce their tax now but then Social Security is underfunded by that amount in the future. On top of that, this is a progressive tax. One that is skewed towards providing progressively more relief to the higher earners who will be the least affected by a ""Trump Recession"". This must be stopped. A recession is not a reason to give money to Trump's friends who are not hurt and do not need relief.

The best way to help out those who are economically hurt is to provide a higher level and longer duration of unemployment insurance. Put a moratorium on bank interest payments on home mortgages below a certain cutoff. Increase funding to the food stamp program and medicaid. Then have the Federal Government make up the difference to the states who pay the bill currently. Just give money to those who need it. 

The problem is, Trump has already given away so much money to fund corporate and billionaire tax relief and increase military spending. God forbid, he might have to cancel some of those programs and/ or tax cuts and spend the money where it is needed to help hard hit Americans!"
2020-03-10 19:09,"If the best way to stop a pandemic is to avoid crowding, then why CUNY, the largest university in NYC, hasn't taken the preventive measures that most private universities in the city have taken? Columbia, NYU, and Manhattan College in the Bronx have already closed and switching to online instruction. Why haven't public schools taken any measure as well? Oh, they are just waiting for a confirmed case to pop up so that they can do something about it when it is already too late."
2020-03-10 19:16,"While the media has gone into near panic over Covid-19 we have quickly forgotten that we do know how to deal with this.

The average number of deaths world wide from annual flu viruses in about 500,000.

The swine flu killed about 530,000 people and the the H1N1 virus claimed about 800,000 people world wide.

These are tragic figures, but none where declared to be a world wide pandemic and each were eventually contained without major economic disruptions.

Convid-19 is more contagious than the average seasonal flu and so special precautions are warranted. 

But we should be facing this virus with a measure of caution but an equal measure confidence that a truly coordinated international effort will lead to a solution."
2020-03-10 19:19,"In Italy the government tried everything to fence in the spread of the virus with even soldiers patrolling on the streets and sending individuals back to their homes.

Even with these drastic measures it was not possible to cut down infection rates dramatically.
In some hospitals in Northern Italy they triage the incoming patients - those with an ample chance for survival are allowed for ventilationt, the others doomed to fight for their lives. A doctor said 'It is like war'.

This just to give you Americans an idea what may lay ahead of you and you seem unfortunately to be vastly unprepared for this."
2020-03-10 19:26,"After reading the article of the 50 year old lawyer in NY who went to the hospital with pneumonia symptoms, ended up infecting a plethora of people before he was even diagnosed with the disease, it seems to me *ALL* hospitals should treat any patient with ""cold like"" symptoms as a potential coronavirus carrier.  For the hospital staff's own safety, they must protect everyone by being hyper-vigilant.

This disease is much more pervasive than the numbers show because people are *not* being tested for the virus.  It's like if you pretend it isn't there, it can't be there.  This is a terrible way to approach the disease.  I fear Canada is no better.

Seattle now with four senior care centers with the virus demonstrates how pervasive the virus already is in ""community"".  Of course, the death rate for those in the care facilities is trending at about 15% for those over 80 based on the numbers being published.  That is high.

As a person with with a somewhat compromised immune system, I take the Coronavirus seriously. It scares me and I don't want to get it. Even my work has been laid-back in their approach to the disease. I wrote corporate on 3 March, and on 3 March they finally sent out a ""standard procedure"", but it is just posted on a bulletin board.  

Everyone needs to be hyper-vigilant."
2020-03-10 18:49,"The story about the New Rochelle man who went undiagnosed for four days, and so spread the disease widely at the hospital and in his community, is disturbing. 

The day the man went to the hospital, on February 28th, the virus had already spread to 48 countries; worldwide there were over 80,000 cases. The US had 65 cases, and the news in the previous days was that it was spreading throughout the community on the west coast without travel to hot spots.

Two days before that, a study out of China showed that CT scans were actually better at diagnosing the virus than tests.

One more detail to lay the setting: the CEO of the hospital where the man was admitted is one of the highest paid people in New York making $7.3 million a year.

Hindsight is 20/20; but if New York Presbyterian was not prepared for the virus, and marveled at man's spider-web lung scans without suspecting it, you do start to wonder why the heck not? What are we paying CEOs mega-millions for? And what other hospitals around the country are similarly inept? And tell me again what makes ours the best healthcare system in the world?"
2020-03-10 18:43,"A payroll tax cut is not going to stop the Coronavirus ... BUT,  you know what will ...FUND THE HEALTH LABS ... so they can do their jobs protecting America. Trump is dangerously clueless and putting our country on the trajectory of Italy, no doubt about it."

2020-03-10 18:51,"“...the bloc’s member states to contain the virus varied widely from country to country, often with little relation to the actual size of the outbreaks, reflecting the lack of international coordination.”

That from the article is false. Evidently the NYTimes missed one of the most recent reports written by infectious virus experts worldwide.  From: ‘Inferring high-resolution human mixing patterns for disease modeling, March 4, 2020, database at <a href=""https://github.com/mobs-lab/mixing-patterns"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/mobs-lab/mixing-patterns</a>, arXiv.2003.01214v1 [q-bio.PE] 25 Feb 2020, Article at: <a href=""https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html</a>
The article clearly states that virus disease transmission patterns vary from country to country, region to region, and subregion to subregion; thus international responses will vary also.  I observe this article in the NYTimes contains a serious mistake by asserting responses to the virus vary country to country, inferring thus, there appears to be no international cooperation.  The sentence from the NYTimes article is false and needs to be modified to reflect the facts, immediately."

China is close to getting it under control. South Korea is testing like mad. Italy is going to be fine after the lockdown. Iran is a big problem, they don't test enough. But compared to that your American CDC doesn't even know how many tests there are done, or how many are positive!

President Xi's visit to Wuhan certainly may demonstrate success, against the virus to some reporters but what kind of success is it when the responsibility of spreading the virus to the rest of the world is not accepted? Countries of the world including the USA which currently have 700 cases positively identified predominantly in Washington state, holding its primary today, California, NY and Florida. 

Historically, China should take total responsibility for creating this panic pandemic and the UN should pass a resolution condemning China for its negligence, hiding of the truth initially, persecuting whistle blowers like the brave Dr. Li WenLiang, the true hero of the Chinese people, that resulted in the origin of the Corona virus and for the spread of the disease that devastated several countries and resulted in deaths due to a nano sized virus spread across our planet that did not see this coming. So I say what success is demonstrated when the monster of the panic has become a pandemic set free to the rest of the world. This apparent alleged success is a crime against humanity and nothing less. If this is success, bask in it. History will record the president of China, Xi, who presided over one of the worst crisis since 911 and the reign opf terror that followed."

First things first. Good for the Democrats for wanting to aim any cuts to people who really need them."

When Americans begin to understand that this system has swung too far for the interest of the few at their own expense things might really change. Look at the airlines. They got a break as a result of 911 and they still charge us extra even for a seat even though your fare should guarantee you a seat and free luggage space. Now they barely provide water. How much money will Trump get for himself and his family out of these incentives? But don’t worry about coronavirus. It’s just a cold that will sneeze a bunch of money into the ‘struggling’ rich."

But the idea of a payroll tax reduction is running into bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill, where Democrats are openly hostile to the idea and some Republicans are skeptical, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader.""

In case anybody is wondering what the ""payroll tax"" is, it is the amount of each paycheck that goes to fund Social Security and Medicare.  In other words, Trump's seemingly big-hearted proposal is a stealth attack on Social Security and Medicare, and that's why (in case you're wondering) Democrats are openly opposed to this  ""cut,"" which, as always with Trump and Republicans, is aimed at sticking it to the little guy in the long run. It would be the camel's nose under the tent, and Democrats aren't falling for it."

The consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now. So a lot of good things are going to happen.'""

2020-03-10 20:12,"First, a payroll tax cut only provides benefits to those who remain employed and PAID by their employer. If people take uncompensated sick leave, or get laid off, they get NOTHING. If their hours are reduced, they get less.

Second, the payroll tax cut mainly benefits the RICH. It is a 7.65% tax cut for earnings up to $137,700. The more you make, the bigger the tax cut. Anyone earning more than $137,700 will get a tax cut of $10,534, even billionaires. If you earn $40,000, you would get $3,060. So the rich will once again make out like bandits. They truly NEED a bigger piece of the pie. This is just one example of the obscure nuances in the tax code manipulated for the benefit of the wealthy.

Third, if you are retired, disabled, unable to work, or unemployed, you don't get a tax cut at all. ZERO!

Finally, a payroll tax cut is not free. It will all be funded by EVEN MORE federal borrowing, on top of the already $1 trillion annual deficit, which is artificially boosting GDP and the economy by almost 5%. On top of record corporate borrowing (much of it junk-rated) and credit card debt. The economy is increasingly being built on a house of cards. It won't take much of storm to demolish it.

I think that, as in China, once the tests are available, there will be a huge spike in the number of cases. Part of that comes from tests becoming available. It’s not that there are so many new cases. It’s confirmation that people actually have been infected for some time already. 

Just the same, a spike will probably drive more fear.

And it’s very different living in such a building as a tenant than as a homeowner (condo) or coop member; the former having precious little control over the common areas (from elevator buttons to laundry facilities to shared venting ducts), fellow tenants and their guests, and landlords.

So if the CDC's budget has been SLASHED as being claimed by so many people who don't know how to use Google, then what needs to happen is for people to blame the politicians who voted for the budget - which so happens to include both Republicans & DEMOCRATS.

Seeing as how South Korea's health ministry, with a much smaller budget than the CDC's, is able to offer thousands upon thousands of Covid-19 test kits free of charge, one has to wonder what the heck is going on at the CDC?

What group or person is causing the delay of approval for the Covid-19 test kits at the CDC?

If the CDC can't come up with a accurate Covid-19 test kit with their current multi-billion dollar budget (which is larger than South Korea's), then something is seriously wrong with that agency which has nothing to do with money!

Does anybody actually read the Live Updates NYT has on this subject?

Why is so much foreign money being spent in China over the Covid-19 virus?  Doesn't China have enough cash reserves from other countries to deal with this issue?  Why do they need help from the Red Cross - when they have refused to work with the CDC?

A few of things about the data are disturbing, and run counter to the current ""community understanding"" about the seriousness and mortality rates of this virus.

1)  about 1/3 of patients detected positive, and aged 60 or under required hospitalization.  The common understanding is this would have been expected to be about 20%.

2)  Of those that had to be hospitalized, one patient was 20.  So much for it being very mild for the very young.  

3) small data set in my county so far, but the death rate is 1 in 43, which puts it a little over 2%.  Note the person who died, was a woman in her 60s, who had been in the hospital for almost 3 weeks before death.  This tells me that so far, there are absolutely no treatment protocols, other than putting the patient on a ventilator and IV. 

4) About half of the detected cases now are believed to be community transmission locally.  As such.. the county health commissioner ordered a 3 week ban on large public gatherings of 1000 or more people, and strongly encouraged the cessation of public group gatherings under 1000 people. 

This is NOT media hype folks, this is official data and response from a county health department that in fact has been dealing with this beginning with patient number 2 in the US."

We are testing as few as possible because Trump wants numbers down for as long as possible.

He ultimately died of stress, trying to desperately have the opposition come to the table as we wanted to form a republic. 

Trump is a 3rd grade hood, born into riches and spat at a military school commander who was later fired after complaining to his superiors.  Trump somehow graduated Wharton without anyone ever remembering him there and became a shadow for his father who prided himself on owning poverty projects so he could either sue or benefit from the government.

False. Contrary to Trump's rosy pronouncements, Americans are hurting, badly, especially when it comes to paying for healthcare, and now we have an epidemic.

Most Americans don't have $400 in the bank. Even if tests are free, patient consumers will be on the hook for trips to the ER or urgent care. One Miami resident was charged $3,270 for treatment and owed $1,400 out-of-pocket. 

The average deductible is nearing $2,000 but most workers have not hit their deductibles yet.

If an in-network facility is full and diverts someone to an out-of-network one, a patient could be stuck with a bill exceeding $10,000.

More than 25 percent of U.S. adults have delayed getting medical care for financial reasons. There is no reason to think people will be running to the hospital to go bankrupt now.

The stimulus needed in an epidemic is not money for banks, or cruise ships, or tax cuts, or Trump hotels. The money we need is for people to get healthcare and then get back on the job.

2020-03-10 22:45,"As a data scientist, I would give the NYT (well, all media really - sorry to sound like Trump) very poor feedback for the lack of useful analytics in reporting this outbreak.

Did you know that the average fatality rate in China outside of Hubei province is < 0.8%. And that of those fatalities, the average age is 82. Same in South Korea. Italy's average fatality rate is around 85!

Now did you know that the average fatality rate for those under 50 is < 0.2%! And that includes the most unprepared regions such as Iran and Wuhan in China. That also EXCLUDES the thousands under 50 who thought they had a cold and did not report it. Actual figures might be lower.

Covid 19 is a VERY serious disease. But only for the most fragile among us. We should do all we can to protect them. We should NOT create a massive worldwide panic. 

The NYT can do much better analytics than I can. Please do it, and issue recommendations based on it. Stop fear mongering."

2020-03-10 22:47,"So much idiocy to disgust here. From the untethered lies and stupidity spewing from Dear Leader's lips to the meetings with Republicans only to discuss possible financial stimulus to certain industries (trump properties included, of course), to halting FDA inspections. It's impossible to choose which crazy-town topic to address. So I shall just comment two points:

1) By excluding Dem leaders from meetings, Dear Leader is further destroying our constitutional democracy. The Democrats hold the majority in the House. Pelosi is 2nd in line to the presidency. Yet she is not invited to be involved in discussions with wide ranging health and economic repercussions. I don't understand why Pelosi or others in Dem leadership are not in front of the public demanding a seat at the table. (A table they are heads of, as voted by citizens).

2) ""FDA halts overseas inspections..."". What is the rationale behind this decision? Why no explanation or follow up here? It's as if they (DL & minions) purposely want components of medical equipment, medications and food to be tainted. 

Daily, my beliefs that DL and Republicans are sadistic, power-hungry, greedy subhumans are solidified. My father (RIP) used to say ""you can't be both a good person and a Republican"". His words have never been truer."

2020-03-10 22:27,"Intuitively a payroll tax cut will have minimal economic benefits for employment, infra-structure, or investment or similar; such a cut is more likely to boost the fondness that some voters have towards their perceived benefactor. That would seem to be more for ‘To the first man, first’.

As for a chief cause of the need for economic stimulation, the President may well right about covid-19 going away. In that regard, check the daily numbers on Coronavirus Cases. Today, another big jump: 4,400. Could that be exponential growth?

Or parabolic growth? Compare Iran and South Korea. Cases in South Korea started by the middle of February; Iran, as week later. Each has a larger population (over50 million), so much room to run; South Korea though has a denser population distribution. Today, South Korea has 7500 cases and 150 new cases; Iran has 8050 cases and 600 new. So, South Korea’s curve is lower and slower; mathematics is not the driving factor.

The telling set of number against ‘Oh my gawd! Exponential growth here’ comes from China. There a huge population in which to grow; the largest base of known infection (80,800) and a longer period for growth. New cases yesterday, 19. The curve is falling down.

The correct public policy response is not tax cuts. (Such as the 0% FICA tax Mr. Trump is proposing.) The correct answer is public policy that arrests the spread of this contagious disease. And that is not a question of fiscal or monetary stimulus.

Donald Trump does not care about people. He only cares about money, and the stock market. Because that is the only metric he thinks could get him reelected.

Trump could issue a $50,000 check to every American right now, and that would not move the needle on the economic impact of this disease. If people are not going out and spending money (in order to avoid crowds and contagion), having more money in their bank accounts will not cause them to do so.

People are out, eating at restaurants, staying at hotels, attending museums, while our health department keeps such narrow criteria to be tested, such as travel to Italy and Japan, that there is no way they know if people are really infected. I know we are a poor state but come on. Every state around us has cases--and we don't? Start testing more people, NM, so we can really know if the virus is here or not. We have a large population of older people and their lives are more important than tourism dollars."

2020-03-11 1:14,"As a physician, I am very surprised that the governments and media are still delivering a significantly misleading information about the novel coronavirus: only the elder are the risk group, otherwise it's just like a flu.

This is absolutely WRONG! 

One of the clinical features of the novel coronavirus infection is a sudden collapse in respiratory system. In early phase, many young patients are asymptomatic or just show mild discomfort like cough and fever. But days after, many patients show sudden deterioration of respiratory functions: shortness of breath, low blood oxygen level, and characteristic CAT scan pattern, which need ventilator or ECMO support. Cardiomyopathy can appear as well. These critical symptoms can persist for weeks, and after that  even patients are gradually recovered, they still suffer from chronic lung fibrosis and limited respiratory functions.

So far, no officials in federal governments or news media emphasize these dangers to young people, so unfortunately many people just believe the novel coronavirus is a disease for the elderly. 

I do hope NYT reporters can seriously view the danger of the virus to not only old but also whole general population."

They cut taxes on Corporations and the Wealthy and we are now running $1 Trillion annual deficits.

Worse yet, we have been running these defecits while the ECONOMY WAS STRONG.  So Donald Trump's efforts to give away a lot of stimulus cash right now, in order to buy an election, seem more desperate than any kind of sound fiscal policy.

The federal government's negligence in this matter is criminal. Perhaps it's not surprising that markets matter more than lives. Here in NYC, the haphazard response I have seen in medical centers in the last few days is only matched by the cautious yet often insufficiently grounded speculations shared by ""experts"" in the media.

2020-03-11 3:54,"Several universities in our area are now moving, hopefully only in the short term, to online classes in the wake of this virus and its rapid spread across the country. Even if there hasn’t been a diagnosed case or single positive test in the student body, these decisions are being made, presumably  to avoid potential risks. To lower the risk of transmission  among students and their larger  community. 

I think this is wise.

 Unfortunately, these university decisions in our state  are not uniform or coordinated. 

I live with a partner  who loves teaching at a large university. And my stomach knots up whenever I think of the fact that her university, about to have students return from spring break, has taken a wait and see attitude. Wait and see if any student tests positive in the next few weeks. Wait and see if any of those students or their teachers ( a fair number in their 50s and even 60s) become  ill. Wait and see if sitting a few feet away from your classmate is  risk that should have been avoided. Wait and see if a class which could have been taught online gets cancelled because a teacher taught on campus, facing groups of students,  and  is now ill. 

And, of course that leaves me wondering if - in spite of having several weeks worth of food and other basics in our home- if my partner will become dangerously sick  because some administrator decided this virus was “ just a other flu” and took  that wait and see attitude."

2020-03-11 3:49,"I do not expect the Republican controlled federal government to do anything that will aim at keeping us safe. But what is the Democratic government in California doing by sitting quietly and not shutting down schools? They obviously do not have enough test kits in our area, considering some family on our neighborhood Nextdoor was very upset that though they were all sick, were not being allowed to be tested for the Corona virus. I am going to presume that they are intelligent, competent people with a reasonable justification for this suspicion of having been exposed to Corona. It almost seems like officials are wishing this virus away. A very scary situation to be in. 

How can shutting everything down for a month not be a good decision in the long term? It will reduce community transmissions by keeping mildly sick and potential carriers at home till they overcome the disease, reduce confusion amongst the medical professionals, who all seem pretty confused and have no clear mandate to follow. And will give a chance for families to feel less stressed about the chance of acquiring the disease. It is galling that Universities, companies and individual schools are having to make decisions that should have been uniformly coming from the highest level, from Gavin Newsom. People, make your own decisions, write to your schools and please let your children work from home. This is not a silly little disease."
2020-03-11 3:50,"A nano sized virus wearing a crown has changed the world forever. While it is bad news, it is not the end of the world. Luckily over 95% cases, will not result in fatalities. So 50 of these 1,000 cases could be the number dying, mostly those that are immunocompromised. The uncertainty brings up 3 important questions I get asked.

1) Is Corona virus (CoV) seasonal or with the coming of summer and hotter temperatures the virus will disappear?

My answer is that as long as there is one infected animal or human alive incubating the virus anywhere in the world, there is a potential for spread and eradication cannot be declared. The reason WHO said smallpox is eradicated is because there is no human alive with smallpox and there never was an animal host for smallpox. But the virus stocks of variola, the causative agent of smallpox are in 2 secure locations in the CDC in Atlanta, USA and Novosibirisk, Russia. 

2) Assuming that CoV is eradicated optimistically in 2 months, due to herd immunity acquired by the entire world from exposure to small numbers of the virus, could another strain of the CoV emerge? 

Highly likely in another 10-15 years there is a possibility that another corona virus could emerge just like 16 years ago there was SARS CoV and now we have the COVID-19 CoV. Both originated in China and emerged over significant period due to the handling of wild animals for consumption. Only if wild animals are left alone in the wild there may not be another pandemic."

Businesses, schools, conferences, sporting events, airline flights—all of it.  And all U.S. residents voluntarily self-isolate, going only places they can maintain a distance of 6 feet apart.  Make it a patriotic call to arms, a unifying strategy.  By the end of that time, I would think that disease burden would be reduced dramatically and cases could be more easily diagnosed because of that.

It would be expensive but perhaps less so, and less frightening and chaotic, than using an uncoordinated Whack-a-Mole strategy on this thing for the next several months.

It explains how early on doctors and researchers were stopped by the CDC and the FDA from testing for Coronavirus.

They realized that the virus was spreading by hundreds even thousands for weeks and they needed to test to understand where it was.

2020-03-09 10:15,"NYT, please stop referring to Milan as our country’s “cultural capital.” That would be Rome, the center of the modern film, TV and music industries as well as home to the largest concentration of museums and Western cultural treasures in the world. 

Yes Milan is the center of Italy’s furniture design. And every year it has “fashion shows” of clothing that no normal person will ever wear. (Real Italian style is still centered in Naples, and Florence hosts the most important menswear events.)

Milan is many fine things, but cultural capital is not one of them."
2020-03-09 10:32,"Something remarkable that has not been addressed anywhere in the NYT. Germany has more than 1000 cases, but no deaths. Given a fatality rate of even 1%, that would suggest there should be around 10 deaths. To not have any is an extreme statistical anomaly. Here are the odds with various fatality rates assumed:

rate = 2%, odds of 0 deaths in 1000 cases = 2 in a trillion
rate = 1%, odds of 0 deaths in 1000 cases = 0.000043
rate = 0.5%, odds of 0 deaths in 1000 cases = 0.0067

There is clearly something going on here. Either the Germans are doing something very right or their reporting is very wrong."
2020-03-09 10:10,"Time to act.

From other NYT article today:
“In Washington State, the nursing home that has faced the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak thus far in the United States said on Sunday that it had seen some residents go from no symptoms to death in just a matter of a few hours.”

Asymptomatic to death. Hours. First time I have read this about COVID. The Chinese were not crazy in their draconian approach. It’s bad. We cannot afford our “don’t test don’t tell just pray “ approach."
2020-03-09 10:39,"“China, where the outbreak began, looks to counter criticism by distributing international aid.”

There are other reasons. I know that NYT could never accept the possibility of genuine altruism. But on a practical level, beyond countering criticism, it’s no good for China, or any global power for that matter, if the world goes up in flames. Something the US has increasing difficulty grasping of late."

What is going on? (Both countries have been aggressive in trying to contain the virus. Italy, moreover, had small towns in lockdown from early on, while Korea never did lockdown anywhere. Koreans only used phone apps alerting people of locations with confirmed cases...on the other hand, Korea tested a lot more aggressively, testing all contacts of known contacts whether symptomatic or not.)"
2020-03-09 11:55,"The United States has bungled the response to the coronavirus, in particular with delays in testing.
     How many people have actually been tested for the coronavirus in the USA? As of March 5, 2020, 1,583 patients had been tested at CDC. This does not include testing being done at state and local public health laboratories, which began only last week
   And while the American capacity to test for the coronavirus has ramped up significantly over the past few days, local officials can still test only several thousand people a day, not the tens or hundreds of thousands indicated by the White House’s promises. 
   In South Korea, more than 66,650 people were tested within a week of its first case of community transmission, and it quickly became able to test 10,000 people a day. The United Kingdom, which has only 115 positive cases, has so far tested 18,083 people for the virus. Why the delay in testing in the USA?
  There is no excuse for this delayed testing, the COVID-19 cases appeared in China in the month of January and we had two months to prepare enough testing kits  Millions of testing kits could have been made during the last two months. But our health care experts including our president were minimizing the scope of this epidemic by comparing this new virus to the seasonal flu and no significant efforts were made to make enough testing kits during the last two months
  Other than hand washing we have nothing to prevent this illness and not even enough testing kits."

While all is well, the country can function with any fool in the White House, but when we have a crisis, to have a leader who can’t make a decision based on anything other than what is best for him personally, is a serious problem.

We know that a worldwide flu pandemic can have have 3-5 million severe cases but might infect 10-20 times that number (we can also quibble here). Whatever else will happen the coronavirus will spread much further.

It is likely best to avoid congested train and bus stations and most airplane and cruise-ship travel for now--as much as we can. We have to wait for any vaccine: we have no choice. We know Dr. Fauci is a much more reliable source of public information than our president.

As for China, we will (most likely) have very little say in what they do. I do hope, as will others, that the worst of their pandemic is past and they do not face another wave. As for the market, a bear market run in this situation would be no shock and world impact is almost a certainty (would be nice if it lasted only a short while, but who knows).

As for the best thing here and now, in terms of accurate information: listen to health experts who work to carefully adjust existing figures, understand the case total in the USA is already much larger than we hear from media reports, and do not rely on the president or his close allies for too much sensible information."
2020-03-09 13:10,"The government’s strategy to prevent the spread of the virus is to isolate the sick and quarantine people they came in contact with.

They need to do more now, not wait until it gets worse."
2020-03-09 13:12,"My thoughts for those who think Covid-19 is just another influenza:
I have been trying to educate myself about Covid-19 for several weeks now, reading  articles, medical papers, watching news. The more I read, the more worried I am. I am in a higher risk group due to my age, coexisting medical condition and my profession, I am medical practitioner, which soon may be at the frontlines. My odds of dying from Covid-19 are about 6%, probability that I will get infected is high. However, I am not really worried about myself. As a physician I am mentally prepared for sacrifices for my patients.
I am worried though about my family,my close friend’s mother, who is on chemotherapy for cancer. I am worried about immunocompromised patients, who have leukemia or other malignancies or respiratory problems. I am worried about thousands of nurses on the frontlines, who will soon take care of Covid-19 patients, without proper PPE and training. I am worried how some of my physician friends, who think that Covid-19 is another influenza, will treat their patients. Is it irrational to have such feelings? Not when you realize that we are failing on all levels with fight against Covid-19. Our Federal Government is failing us, CDC is failing us, local hospitals and health authorities seem to be poorly prepared for coming fight. Is there any hope? The only solution would be to shout loud, voice your concerns and demand action from those responsible."
2020-03-09 13:34,"I think it is time for public health officials to encourage us all to take steps to mitigate our own exposure to the virus as a means of helping the most vulnerable among us.  Let’s have done with the arrogant “I’m going to live my life” approach.  

Let’s recognize that 1. there are many elderly and immuno-compromised people who will be seriously hurt if they get ill 2. vulnerable, poorer, rural people will be more affected by economic downturns if many, many of us get sick 3. there’s a lot we still don’t know about the virus.  So, public officials, please start telling people specifically what gatherings should not take place in our communities, and citizens, please listen and change behaviors for the good of those who most need our help."
2020-03-09 13:39,"What the government and states need to do is have a 14 day break from work and school. Test people and if they’re negative they go back to work and to school. Pay people to be off work if they don’t have sick time. This may be mild for the young but older people especially with co-morbid conditions, are much more likely to get very sick and die. If they can stave off the worse for a year to a year and a half they’ll have the vaccine hopefully."

In China, the chance of catching the virus has been less than 1-in-10,000. Actually, make that: the chance of catching the virus and needing treatment is 1-in-10,000; and the chance of a harmless case is 9-in-10,000.

Italy cannot be spreading infection. For the longest time the African continent was free of the Coronavirus. A single Italian took it to Nigeria. Several Italian tourists took the virus to the second most populated country in the world, India. Each nation has to do what it has to do and not be afraid to get help and collaborate against a common enemy of humanity, the Coronavirus. I am sure Italy will do a better job at stemming the spread of infection than Iran. Iran has refused help extended by the USA. I talked to an Iranian American who said they don't trust Americans. I have no idea what that has to do with helping their own people. He then said Iran can get help from China.

2020-03-09 13:09,"Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch wrote in the New York Times (June 29, 2014) “A new H1N1 flu strain appeared unexpectedly in 1977 and spread globally for over three decades, infecting people until the 2009 pandemic strain replaced it. Genetic and other evidence leads most experts to believe it escaped from a lab in China or the Soviet Union.”  Please read his op-Ed online.

China has 813 cities of various sizes, all of them have at least one traditional wet market.  They’re neighborhood hubs, a feature of the urban/rural Sino socio-cultural landscape. So the probability is 1/813 or .00123 that Covid-19 would select Wuhan as its birthplace. You’re more likely to draw a red king and a black seven from a deck of cards, blindfolded.

What makes it more likely is perhaps the Wuhan Institute of Virology research laboratory (WIV) a few blocks from the wet market.

I cannot believe that Covid-19 choosing Wuhan was random, an Act of God or in Chinese mythology, plague-spreading umbrellas. This lab has been engineering chimeric coronaviruses for at least 5 years in ‘gain-of-function’ research — making deadlier and more contagious viruses. Given China’s history of lab accidents (SARS), is it possible this new virus escaped the Wuhan lab unnoticed?"
2020-03-09 13:43,"The biggest problem is that too many cases will overwhelm the health care sector.  There are not enough ICU units, ventilators, and hospital beds.  Social distancing can reduce the rate of increase of infection and prevent this problem.  

It's a sad commentary on our society that young healthy people will not pitch in and prevent themselves from becoming carriers.  Remember also that if hospitals are overwhelmed, if you are young but need a hospital for some other reason--say, a car accident--you will be out of luck.  

Trump needs to be leading on this.  But due to his vanity he pretends that things are fine, and for some reason his base follows him like sheep."

The NYC schools refusing to close, as reported in these pages, is creating a health hazard for me and my colleagues. I am strongly advocating for temporarily cancelling these visits. In every sector, leaders need to move quickly, boldly and in ways that are unprecedented if we are to stop this or even somewhat limit its impacts."
2020-03-09 13:54,"As an American who has lived in Italy for over three decades, I have two hypotheses as to why Italy has been hit so hard.
First, Italy has the largest elderly population in the world only after Japan.  The average age of the people who have died from COVID-19 here is 81 years old.
Second, the Italians are a 'high-contact' people by nature.  They love kissing, hugging, and shaking hands.  They get physically close to you, even if you're not a friend or relative.

My strongest advice right now to my fellow Americans:  Distance yourself from other people.  I realize that may be difficult for people who must use mass transit, but it's really the only way to avoid getting COVID-19 and, by consequence, to prevent the overall transmission of the virus."
2020-03-09 13:57,"I work to make people healthier by helping them exercise. We need to take steps to prevent the spread of this disease, which could result in early death for some small percentage of us. More important, though, we need to take steps to address heart attacks, stroke, diabetes and other far more lethal ailments that result from a lack of exercise and poor diet. I do that every working day, but now we are talking about avoiding contact with one another and cooping people up and curtailing their movement even further. No more dance schools, no more sports, no more weight training, no more cardio classes. Is that so? It won't help the many, many more of us on track to die from cardiovascular diseases and other ailments resulting from a lack of movement in daily life. Heart attacks may not cause sudden market crashes, but they kill far more people than COVID-19 ever will. If we really cared about public health we'd have been doing more to address these far more prevalent killers all along."

Why is N95 mask production inadequate? Because selfish American companies like 3M invested in production facilities in China and other non-ally countries instead of building more plants in the US....to save a few pennies per mask. Now, instead of that production being available to Americans, the masks are staying in China for the Chinese people.

I travelled throughout Spanish cities by train surrounded by Chinese tourists on New Year Holiday: Barcelona, Seville, Cordoba, Granada. Then hopped two planes to get to Marrakesh. On January 29th I began to feel ill. Intense headache. Breathing problems. Fever. It was the day I flew to Lisbon for my last few days in Europe. By the time i arrived at my hotel I was very ill and stayed in bed for four rainy, cold days. Voice disappeared. Then flew sick to Madrid and Madrid to NYC and then a train to DC and finally home to Maryland. Symptoms worsened and went to the VA hospital to present symptoms and advised them of my global travel. First time was given two flu swabs and a chest X Ray and sent home to bed rest and fluids. I returned 9 days later feeling worse. No voice. Throat feeling dry and my usual strep. 9 vials of blood taken. CDC was called. Explained I’d heard from MD friend dromedary (MERS) infection possible as I’d visited a country warning of MERS and contact with camels which I’d experienced. CDC said I was not a candidate or carrier. Sent home with strong antibiotics and told their “educated guess” was Whooping Cough. Ten days later all negative. HIV, Whopping, and nothing was ever diagnosed. Meantime I went to teach in a local high school. There were no cases in Maryland then. Now only three. But I was amazed at how cavalierly I was dismissed and dispatched back into the community."

Why would the city spread such misinformation? Do they understand from the data trickling in, that, asymptomatic carriers could aid in community spread? And what is the point in cleaning the school every morning, if kids and teachers who are as yet asymptomatic or mildly infected carriers come to school, sneeze and spread the virus? What kind of educators do we have in this nation."

Far more people are untouched by restrictions than touched, so most people in Seattle are not taking the outbreak seriously and are not taking precautions in public.  The current measures are slowly damaging the economy, but appear to not yet be abating the disease’s spread.

As it stands, I’m forbidden from going in to work till the end of the month, but I wonder what will really be different in April.  It feels like this will go on indefinitely.  I think none of us are really prepared for the kind of changes this will impose on us all.

2020-03-09 10:04,"Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said on “Face the Nation” Sunday that the federal government needed to step in quickly:

“There’s no systematic plan of when a city should close school, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. We leave these decisions to local officials, but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities and in some support from the federal government for cities that make that step.”

I'm not super-worried about actually catching this bug in that I'm in very good health and I'm confident I'd come through it fine but it seems ridiculous to still be forced to take the chance given that with just a little bit of preparation and organization we could all easily work from home."

I would have preferred the Chinese Government touting the implementation and enforcement of laws against their wildlife animal markets and illegal trafficking in protected species, attention to scientists without waving censure and incarceration at them, reward and respect for the selfless Chinese medical workers, and freedom of speech. After SARS, there is no excuse. It is not the case that this virus could have emerged just anywhere.

Meanwhile, China's vast governmental deficiencies serve to remind us of our own governmental problems wrought by the Trump Administration and its elimination of safeguard agencies and evisceration of the CDC budget, denigration of science, and denial of its ad hoc scrambling and fecklessness."

Last night I talked to my nephew who has degrees in ecomomics and foreign relations.  He spoke of the situation in Italy, which is as dire as it comes, and talked about the ""doubling"" rate of cases and deaths hitting Italy just now.

The same scenario could occur here because of the huge delay in testing, largely allowed by an administration who wanted to bury its head in the sand.  If you extrapolate Italy to the US, because of its head start, I doubt you've seen anything as dire as things will eventually get."
2020-03-09 14:50,"Now is the time for decisive action from the White House to mitigate the damage from CV-19. The airports, and train stations must be closed in affected areas. All public gatherings must stop. Theaters and restaurants must close. Stores may only have a few shoppers at a time. This should also be done in cities where there are few or no infections in order to get ahead of the contagion. If we do not take drastic measures we will see what has happened in Italy happen here. This is for real."

So many people seem to shrug and dismiss all of this because it is most deadly to people other than themselves.  Have we so easily written off those who are not young and hale?  Take notes, folks, for this category will include most of us before we know it.

I am an average low-risk American. While my personal risk is low I am capable of transmitting the disease to several high-risk people including my spouse (compromised immune system), my sister-in-law and a coworker (both have lung diseases), and a mother-in-law in the high-risk elderly demographic. 

These connections make me a high risk by association. That is where we may fail in slowing the spread of this disease — by disregarding the risk that we carry to those around us."
2020-03-09 15:32,"We need from the federal government:

1) More tests kits. Lots more. Orders of magnitude more. We don’t know how widespread the disease is because only a tiny fraction of the population has been tested. We are wholly unprepared if there is an explosion in people showing symptoms. 

2) Guidance and plans for how public and private businesses and institutions and governments of all sizes should respond. 

3) Guarantees and plans to pay for the economic impact, from guaranteed paid time off for ALL workers (especially the poor/those without health insurance) to grants or loans to businesses.

4) Someone to tell President Trump to put a sock in it.

Italy is now the source of spread world wide and Germany and France both have over 1000 cases now and they aren’t doing anything. This thing doubles twice in a week so by next Monday we’d be looking at 4000 cases each.

This refusal to lock down borders and tackle matters during the refugee crisis and now COVID-19 is going to have more countries leave EU.

BTW, how did prisoners get out? This type of things almost never happen in 1st tier nations."
2020-03-09 15:07,"Even in a series of articles about the spread of a deadly virus, you have to malign my work, and by extension in this ultra-competitive society, me.  Some children forced to stay home from school do not have the “luxury” of a stay-at-home parent, you say.

My life of taking responsibility and raising my own children is not one of luxury. It’s hard work, it’s important work, and it involves a whole lot of not making money and not having any perceived value in our culture.

In the article about keeping NYC schools do you say that many students do not have the “luxury”’ of homes? You do not.  Why is a parent who does parenting, not just birthing and financing, a “luxury”?  This is how we get super wealthy people and astronomically high housing prices—families who believe they need to make money above all."

He described his symptoms as coming on suddenly and rapidly. Within 2 hours of feeling ill, his temperature was over 103. The fever subsided after several hours and was followed by a dry, nagging cough.

He is still quarantined in his hospital room a month after becoming ill. The reason is he's still testing positive for the virus. Before they'll release him, he must show negative on 3 consecutive tests. Good times."

2020-03-09 15:19,"I just saw (about an hour ago) New York Mayor De Blasio on CNN dispensing medical advice on the coronavirus.  While I realize that a lot of what he is trying to do is stem the panic, and I realize that unlike my city, New Yorkers panic in a heartbeat, there are a few things he should not be saying:

1)  He said that the coronavirus does not live on any surface ""more than a few minutes"".  The WHO says hours to days, and if it could not be transmitted by touch, people would not be saying to wash your hands and not touch your face.

2) He said that if you are younger than 50 and healthy, if you get coronavirus you probably won't know you had it.  This is only statistically true, if that.  For instance, Li Wenxiang the doctor who blew the whistle on this disease in Wuhan, is dead of it at the age of 34 and was quite healthy.

I do understand mitigating panic, Mr. De Blasio.  But it's just as wrong for you to make stuff up as for President Trump to do so. Politicians should hand the mic over before spewing medical facts that they don't really understand."

Could smokers and drug addicts be at a higher risk of death from Corona virus? Could immuno compromised persons have a higher fatality rate? None of these important questions can be answered with shoddy data or inadequate testing. The CDC and the rest of the authorities need to be transparent in sharing information  without sharing the identity of the infected or deceased person infected with Coronavirus."
2020-03-09 15:29,"Dear Mr President;
It is time for you and your administration to step up to the plate and started taking positive action concerning the corona virus. This is not a time for finger pointing and blaming your political opponents, or blaming anyone else for that matter. It is not a time for rude name-calling.  One of the duties of a president is to take the lead in a national emergency and steer the country safely through it.

2020-03-09 16:41,"It would be surprising if there is an epidemiologist or infectious disease professional anywhere in the world who disputes the notion that a major pandemic is a matter of “not if, but when.” This is not a new concept. So why is the world so unprepared for this? We’re seeing multiple failures, on every continent, country, and city. All the math on the COVID-19 points to broader reach and more deaths for months ahead. At the risk of sounding glib, COVID-19 doesn’t appear to be the “big one.” As such, if we look at this as a test or drill for the “big one” then the world gets a failing grade. And the U.S. gets a failing grade too. 

MAGA is brand marketing for American Exceptionalism, which is nothing more than a weak facade of arrogance, hubris, insecurity, and plain stupidity. Nature doesn’t care how many guns you have, how big your bank account is, or how many big, beautiful, Olympic gold medals you win. Nature always finds a way and it will bring you to your knees no matter who you are. For whatever twisted reasons Trump thinks he can s@*t talk his way through a pandemic virus, he is dead wrong. It is astounding that he had 7 WEEKS to prepare for this moment and yet did next to nothing. The news media needs to keep hammering on Trumps failures herein until every American finally wakes up to the truth of Trump’s folly. 

For the humble and the willing, there are important lessons to learn from this moment in history. Here's to hoping we do not squander this opportunity."

Right now it appears that the risk of very serious illness and death is less than it was for SARS and MERS. In terms of total deaths in the United States, influenza overwhelmingly causes more deaths today than COVID-19.”

So far, COVID-19 has killed  22 Americans. The United States has been experiencing a normal flue season this year. According to the CDC, “so far this season there have been at least 34 million flu illnesses, 350,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths from flu.

Numbers? Fault?  People are sick, dying, scared, and being devastated by the cascading economic fallout of this pandemic.

Soon some one who goes to a larger community will bring COVID-19 to our little town. 
Even though we are all washing our hands and sanitizing surfaces it is easy to see how a virus that lasts for so many days on surfaces will naturally infect several people for each infected person.

There are people here who believe that the media is contributing to an abnormal fear, fueled by politics.

Once the test becomes more widely available (but not to everyone, contrary to this administration’s words) we will be in for a very rude awakening that there are thousands of infected  people across the US.

Nowhere is this more important that the millions of frightened children getting mixed messages from news and parents and schools.

2020-03-09 18:53,"So, here’s my anecdotal two cents:

My daughter, a high school teacher, is missing work today. She’s running a fever, has a sore throat, is lethargic.

She contacted her GP. They said come in at 11:30. Upon examination she was told she has the flu. Rest, drink fluids, return to work after 24 hours without fever. 

To confirm diagnosis of seasonal flu, GP’s office stated she would have to go to the health clinic for flu swab and test. They don’t do it there.

She came home and went to bed. She’s got children, babies, a teen, a husband, and her mother here temporarily helping. No concern about verification of seasonal flu, let alone Coronavirus. How does CDC compile statistics on seasonal flu?

Seriously? After paying for a doctor’s office visit, you’re asking a sick woman to drive to another facility for a test and whatever that financially entails?

She’s probably not at high risk for Coronavirus, however she does come in contact with a lot of people throughout the day - students, colleagues, day care provider, family members. 

Zero concern. (And she has pretty good insurance.)"

We haven't even closed down places of assembly, or supplied enough testing kits.

This entire fiasco has been a case of too little, too late. Only China has so far succeeded in reversing the progress of the epidemic.

Sure, there will be economic costs, but the longer we delay, the more extreme and costly the inevitable measures will be.

The sad thing is that this could have been prevented entirely by barring travel from other countries as Israel has done, and using the test kits from the WHO to follow contacts from any case that did slip through.

2020-03-09 19:33,"I am puzzled by comments/commentary suggesting US responses similar to what China imposed in Hubei province. 
In China there were approx 80,000 confirmed cases of the virus resulting in 3000 deaths - a mortality rate of a little less than 4% and again the majority of the deaths occurred within an older population/compromised immune system group. The real mortality rate is very far from being defined and will likely be much much less than that. 
To me I better prescription would be to follow some advice recently given by Dr. Fauci (paraphrasing) - if you are older and in ill health stay home and do not go out unless absolutely necessary. If you are older and even if in good health avoid travel/large gatherings and unfortunately for my friends at Royal Caribbean and other cruise lines - avoid taking a cruise. By default that seems to me to also say that if you are younger than 65 and in good health - follow recommended guidelines for social interactions - washing hands at least 5 to 6 times per day, refrain from touching your hands to your face, stay home if you do not feel well, avoid shaking hands, and for now limit or forego visits to older family members or friends who are ill. 
Collectively we need to focus our resources to protecting those most at risk while at the same time avoiding panic and shutting down the country. There may come a time when that is necessary but I don't think we are anywhere near that point."

The death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the United States. So being diagnosed with seasonal flu may turn out to be no worse or not much worse than being diagnosed with COVID-19. The United States has been experiencing a normal flue seasons this year.

Also of course there's heart disease, which kills thousands of times more, and to avoid that we should be trying not to worry so much, as that leads to hypertension.

At any rate, there is no possibility of containing the virus at this point.  It's spread too far, too many people don't show any symptoms, since over 100,000 have been diagnosed as having it, probably at least twice that many have had it without showing signs, and have spread it.

But there's really no reason to panic.  If it affected everyone on earth, and there's no possibility of that, it'd kill at most about 2% of humanity.  That's nowhere near as many as we'd need to pass away, to avoid the extinction of a million species, and climate change threatening our own extinction as well.  It's also not the sort of percentage drop that would do anything to society, or even offer the survivors more resources.

Trump imposed his travel ban about 10 days too late.  But it would have been of low value even if done earlier due to the complete refusal of other nations to also impose a similar travel ban (especially Canada and European nations).

The failure of those other nations made necessary a US travel ban of ALL non-US citizens coming from anywhere in the world, and quarantine of ALL returning Americans regardless where they are returning from.  But Trump failed us, probably because he was more concerned about the economic loss that such a total travel ban would cause.  However, that economic loss will pale compared to the economic loss that will occur when this China virus rages here.  And, much more important, the economic loss means nothing compared to the great many Americans who will die from this disease and the suffering of even more who survive the affliction.

The sad fact is that the one positive thing you can say about Trump's travel ban is that no other politician, Democrat or Republican, would have imposed any travel ban at all.  They all would be just like the Europeans and Canada.  And the result would have been that the US would be as far along in spread of the the China virus as Italy now is.

No. However

When we eat a plant based diet, we are improving our immune system 

And

Helping the environment.

Trump lacks the ability to understand that an infectious disease cannot be controlled through Fox News, lying, displaying false bravado by absurdly going ahead with holding rallies, suppressing information, or obfuscation.  The virus will continue to spread and deaths will continue to occur, and people will take note that at the time we needed wise leadership we could trust in, we had a con man only concerned about himself and how this crisis would affect him personally."

For the most part, the authorities have been engaged, concerned and perhaps a bit draconian in their approach. I'm not sure what more they could have, or can do at this time. 

Contrast this with my former country, the U.S.A., a place where the authorities (government) have been effectively de-fanged by the current administration. Worse yet, I believe Americans think they're somehow immune from the contagion, that it can't possibly happen in the States. It's mind boggling that Americans can accept the inept, incompetent useless proclamations of the president, FOX News, Rush Limbaugh and countless other know-nothings.

From a medical point of view, the worst problem is the current lack of a vaccine, thus the risk especially for weaker patients with other complications. From an economic point of view, the danger is much more widespread, touching practically everyone, and a cure may actually be even more difficult to bring about. While Italy is greatly at risk from the possible economic effects, at least its national health service, which covers every citizen completely at no direct charge, is a precious backstop.

Think about parents, grandparents and aunts & uncles if you need to visualize this, but it is about transmission. It's not about any one particular individual getting sick.
If you listen to the two extremes saying ""buy out all the t.p."" on one hand, or ""It's just the flu.

2. Younger people struggling in the gig economy may only experience mild symptoms, so they won't seek treatment and cannot afford to miss a day of work.

3. Millions of immigrants living here illegally won't get treated or tested because they fear deportation.

4. The spectre of being quarantined for 2 weeks or more (like being in jail) will keep people from reporting they're sick or they've had contact with someone who is.

5. This isn't China, Iran or Italy. With the freedom of movement we have here, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to lockdown cities or extended areas of the country.

""Self quarantine"" doesn't work. People who need that weekly paycheck to survive to the next week will do what they have to do to make sure they get that paycheck.

Unfortunately, I live in a country where instead of providing funding and resources that would be there in just such a situation as this coronavirus, its President has CUT funding to science-based organizations meant to deal with these kinds of situations, and has placed ignorant, untrained political hacks in place to run the departments responsible for dealing with them or left them run by acting or acting acting directors.

As the outbreak spread to Europe and US, people are brainwashed into thinking proper public health procedures are a Chinese thing and therefore wrong. We have people insisting it’s not serious, it’s just flu, quarantine is a choice, masks aren’t necessary, etc. to the point that all the time China’s lockdown bought is wasted.

We’ve known about this virus since December—so there is absolutely no excuse for this incompetence—unless the incompetence is Donald Trump.

Donald Trump, in his own words, said he only concerned with how the Coronavirus numbers affect his re-election. It is not much of a stretch to believe that the dearth of test kits in this country is intentional—to keep those numbers down.

The focus should not be economic first with payroll tax cuts and talking up the hotel and cruise industries. The focus should be on public health and safety. If we get public health and safety correct, then the economics will resolve themselves over the long term. Healing the stock market will not heal sick Americans and does very little to mitigate propagation of the virus."

3. If you're older, stay put. You've been told a million times now to do this. Any needless illness stresses healthcare.

4. Be smart about your habits. Wash, wash, wash hands. You cannot do this too much. Don't wash, then grab your filthy phone, then hug someone.

5. Work from home if possible. This isn't just about you. It's a community issue.

6. Be prudent, not panicked. Remember, you're really the one who is in charge. Get the news once, then shut it off and watch basketball or a soap opera."
2020-03-09 23:08,"Very simple. In Italy we have a population of 60M people plus about 70M tourist a year in a land that is city to city distance within the same State in US. It's in italian culture to stay together, talk, walk around, use train, move within the Country very frequently. And it's in Italian culture to react in the beginning with a smile and a hope and finally with massive solutions. It's in our history. Italian social healthcare is a masterpiece of our style of life. Especially in north and center Italy hospitals and care are commonly evaluated as excellent. And of course for free. Everybody (including me) owning a private insurance would prefer by far to be managed by public hospital instead private.
Then living in the Country I can ensure everybody that the situation has been taken very seriously here and all the contacts of the affected people have been tested. And there is a full transparency of the situation with the population.
Times are getting hard but we all hope that with 2 or more weeks of isolation we might be able to stop the spread.

Thank you for performing such an important service to Americans as this public health crisis unfolds."
2020-03-09 23:13,"Payroll tax cuts are a good idea — as an alternative to tax cuts for the wealthy they always have been a good idea.  Now Trump — who has hinted that he is ready to suggest cuts to entitlement programs if he is reelected — is searching for a solution for which he can claim credit with middle class Americans, and dare the Democrats to oppose it.  The Democrats should embrace the idea — provided that it is revenue neutral.  Every dollar of tax relief to middle Americans must be offset by  a corresponding increase in the tax burden on corporations and the rich.  A national catastrophe should not become just another convenient opportunity for more Republican ""starve the beast"" nonsense."
2020-03-09 23:08,"I hope everybody who is able, (and I realize some people are not), will basically quarantine themselves at home. If you don't absolutely have to go out, don't.

I'd really like to see my father, but he's 78 years old with cardiopulmonary problems. He's staying in his house, and so we just talk over the phone. 

Even if you're not too worried about getting sick yourself (because you're young and healthy like me), please think about all of the other people around who are older, or who have an autoimmune disease, or who have diabetes, cancer, asthma, etc. All those people need our collective help--Unless you live under a bridge, you have some of these bvulnerable people in your life too, whom you love and want to survive. 

Please, let's all do our part to slow the spread of this disease. We can do it if everybody pitches in-- I truly think that this is an amazing and big-hearted country, and that we can tackle anything thrown at us. Let's show ourselves and the world that we can do this. Let's Make America Healthy Again!!"
2020-03-09 23:10,"The payroll tax is highly regressive, so Democrats may well agree to a cut.  But such a cut is utterly useless to those of us who are not employed, or retired, and living off our (now dwindling) savings.  And I doubt it would have a significant effect on the stock market. 

If Trump wants the stock market to stabilize or recover, he can’t control Coronavirus, but he could talk to his buddies Putin and  Crown Prince MBS and try to get them to stop their oil spat that is roiling markets."
2020-03-09 23:13,"My SoCal supermarket is rationing bottled water to four gallons per customer. Its entrance is partially blocked by pallets of bottled water. Do people think their faucets will run dry because of a virus from China? And, why the panic-buying when supplies are demonstrably ample?

Serious effects from this virus are limited almost entirely to people over sixty, most of whom had underlying health problems. The much-touted 2% death rate is a statistical fluke, not a reliable number.

This business is mostly just panic. The virus is not especially deadly and can be contained/treated like other outbreaks.BUT, the worldwide economic impact of quarantining entire.national populations to the point of forbidding internal movement has the potential to bring-on a worldwide depression.

We may yet be the first people to drive to the poorhouse wearing face masks.

2020-03-09 23:22,"A payroll tax cut is a useless idea - unless all Trump wants to do is play to potential lower and middle income voters.  It will not help with the spread of the Coronavirus. Money in the economy is not the problem.  There is lots of money out there.  The fall of stock markets will not significantly impact the amount of money most individuals have to spend in the short term.  I watched the pres conference.  Most of the talking was gobbledegook - gibber-jabber, if you prefer.  I don;t want to hear about the economic impact from Donald Trump or Mike Pence.  I want to hear a plan to protect people."
2020-03-09 23:19,"We spent at least six weeks mocking The Chinese response to COVID 19 and expressing contempt for the eating habits of a small minority of their population. Well, schadenfraude isn’t a good strategy for dealing with the virus once it arrives. 

The Chinese have over 80,000 cases detected, i do not see their incentive for faking numbers at all. If anything, our numbers are vastly understated because of our inability to conduct basic testing over a meaningful segment of the population. 

My point is simple, we’ve gotten so politically dogmatic, we’d rather seize life threatening situations as opportunities to score political points than solve an issue. The Chinese lockdown was effective, democratic Italy is doing the same but we’d rather focus on how authoritarian The Chinese government is and how incompetent Trump may be. Since we have absolutely nothing to learn from a Communist Chinese lockdown, let’s follow the freedom loving, democratic Italians instead."
2020-03-09 23:20,Not sure how a payroll tax cut will stem the spread of coronavirus. But Trump will never see that become law unless he talks to Democrats in Congress. He said today he would only be meeting Tuesday with Senate and House Republicans. Perhaps he's still in denial that the Democrats control the House. He's just playing politics again.
2020-03-09 23:24,"Whatever we are trying to do here, in our reactive, rather than proactive way, will underscore and emphasize the weaknesses of a country that has basically no reply to any national crisis. 
Somehow, we are supposed to manage these based on local and state rules, regulations and support.  There must be a national response, but our system is not there.  
This same crisis will also open the lack of safety-nets that could avoid the more serious spread of the virus.  Here, we have no protection for people with no sick/family leave.  They are the financially most vulnerable among us, and they will always go to work when sick, because they cannot afford not to. 
I assume that they will also be blamed for doing just that, because in the US, we always blame the poor for being poor."
2020-03-09 23:25,"It's sadly characteristic of this President that he sounds willing to lower taxes (thus cutting the very funds we need to build up federal agencies capable of managing health issues like this), while at the same time working deliberately and diligently to eliminate federal support for health insurance, which will precisely hurt those low wage earners he says he's concerned about, when they will need health coverage the most. 

This is what happens when you put a bankrupt casino operator and reality TV actor in charge of a real, functioning government."
2020-03-09 23:24,"The best Q so far during the COVID-19 presscon — has the president been tested?

The Reverend Mike Pence said that he will have an answer tonight.

Allow me to guess the result:

“Donald J. Trump has no COVID-19 virus. Also test results show that he is the most intelligent and most handsome man to ever walk this green earth. Also, his fat to muscle ratio is lower than that of Christiano Ronaldo. He is going to live to be 450 years old.”"

An essential commodity, that everyone uses, and that is largely controlled by foreign countries, goes down in price, and the response is mass panic? I wonder what would happen if rent suddenly became affordable? Would it mean the end is nigh?

The problem with the stock market going down, is not that a bunch of rich people will lose money. It's that we all know from experience that they will simply pass all that loss on down to everyone else.

Billionaires will remain billionaires. It's just that they'll have to bribe more politicians in order get laws passed that will allow them to remain so with little to no affect on their bottom line.

The attempt by the President to mitigate concerns by essentially saying it is only old people that need to worry about the virus is patently ridiculous. All Americans are at risk. Older Americans are clearly at much greater risk; however, every person is at risk from a virus such as this. A government that does not take the risk seriously across all age groups is cynically reckless."
2020-03-09 23:29,"The announcement of a possible payroll tax cut has made the futures market jump. What that illustrates is the naive world view extant in the financial world.
The notion that a payroll tax cut will make a meaningful difference to those who actually stop getting paychecks is ludicrous. Those who continue to get paychecks will have a few more dollars in their pocket that will be dwarfed by the savings they realize from their savings on getting fewer fill ups of cheap gas. Very little of which will redound to the economy because the implosion of consumer confidence, coupled with voluntary reductions in forays to restaurants, theaters, amusement parks etc. will snap wallets shut across the planet.
Other measures such as bridge loans are dreamed up in worlds where small businesses that cannot get credit do not exist. Moreover, even if the government loans money to small businesses, they have to still pay it back. An impossible task for thinly profitable entities as it stands.
All the solutions are bad. Loans to companies that can't pay them back. Tax cuts that mean nothing to the recipient but blows a larger hole in the deficit while interest rate cuts are meaningless to those who are uninterested in borrowing and investing in this environment. Retirees and pension plans meanwhile get skinned."

Fatality rates varied dramatically depending on the age of the individual. No deaths occurred in those 9 and younger, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 carried an 8% fatality rate, and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8%.

There is no end in sight to how bad this coronavirus pandemic is going to get.  Trump seems to have given up on the idea of containing this disease.  Containment measures will save lives and keep some people from getting the coronavirus.

The economic impact is going to get worse when compounded with the effects of Saudi Arabia and Russia either in an oil supply war or colluding to corner the world's oil market.

While this may be draconian to some - it is the only way to control the spread of the CoronaVirus. - And once the spread is slowed and/or contained, the proper determination can be made as to who has been affected ? and who is at greater risk ? and the necessary treatment can be instituted."

To say that I feel disappointed in our leadership is not nearly enough. It feels a lot more like rage. There are less than 100,000 ventilators in the entirety of America, and my personal experience with three different hospitals is that they are full to the brim, disorganized and understaffed in a world before Covid.

This talk of leaving it to city or county or state officials to make arbitrary decisions as to whether or not to keep people apart is foolhardy and dangerous. Officials have a way being contacted behind the scenes by businesses who encourage policies that protect them from loss of revenue--protect yourself and those you care about or care for. 

Any pathogen that travels through the air (either indoors or outdoors) and which is infected and then unknowingly inhaled by someone else needs to be stopped from infecting; any surface that might be touched by someone who is not even showing symptoms but is carrying the virus can infect someone else who touches it shortly afterwards; anybody you kiss, hug, shake hands with, or stand close to can unintentionally make you sick: Be safe by eliminating that possible contact, period.

Save someone from illness or even death: find a way to enjoy yourself by staying away from crowds until new U.S. cases have been counted at zero!

I am not scared of Covid-19. I am rightly concerned for the welfare of those who are elderly, in frail health or disenfranchised who stand to suffer mostly, and disproportionately, at the hands of this new scourge. But I am not scared of Covid-19.

What I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world.

I am scared that travel restrictions will become so far reaching that weddings will be canceled, graduations missed and family reunions will not materialize. And well, even that big party called the Olympic Games...that could be kyboshed too. Can you even 
imagine?

I'm scared those same epidemic fears will limit trade, harm partnerships in multiple sectors, business and otherwise and ultimately culminate in a global recession.

I implore you all. Temper fear with reason, panic with patience and uncertainty with education."

One of the attendees, a teenage boy, sitting next to his parents, ate cheetos then methodically licked his fingers, and then, I think, his palm - I had to see him if I looked at the stage. We went out before he did, but at some point he had to touch stuff, including doir handles. Today, an employee in a shop blew her nose, touched a shared computer keyboard, then handled my credit card and gave me back papers and credit card. What's one supposed to do? I took them, did not touch my face, washed my hands when I got back home. A massive campaign of information would really help. We need to be constantly reminded to adopt good habits."

Go out to dinner.  Go to your favorite specialty store.   Go bowling.  Go out for a drink.  Or (gasp) consider planning a weekend road trip inclusive of a hotel stay.

If you're scared or a member of a high risk group, consider ordering delivery or takeout, or use a drive-thru.

Caution is warranted, but let's put the risk in perspective.  I do think this thing is being overhyped by a sensationalistic media and assorted scaremongers.  It is time to stop cowering in fear behind stockpiled rolls of toilet paper and go out and live life and do your part to stop the economy from needlessly tanking."

2020-03-10 2:31,"President Trump has to act while iron is hot. The biggest drop in the stock market since 2008 sends jitters around the world and Trump has to act pronto. Tax cuts to those earning below 100,00 and aid for the idled hourly workers will be a good start. The popular WEALTH TAX a favorite of the Democrats would be a great idea to implement. We just saw how filthy rich the billionaires Bloomberg and Styer are. They have more money than the combined wealth of millions of Americans in the words of millionaire Bernie and Warren. It is disgusting how much money was wasted on the primaries especially by Bloomberg who spent half a billion dollars just on ad for a pathetic and humiliating loss on super Tuesday in every state except the American Samoan territory. What a colossal waste of wealth that the nation could have done a lot from. Easily all the billionaires in the country could cough up close to half a trillion dollars to not only build the nations infrastructure to wipe out Coronavirus but also prepare for future threats. I can say that without a doubt there will be another deadly virus that will find us off guard and miserably unprepared and could cause similar havoc and devastation of the economy within next 10 years. Spending cuts on some useless federal programs that do not serve the interests of the tax payers will free up considerable money towards paying down the national debt."

The above information should be prominently displayed on the front page of the New York Times, and should accompany every item and sidebar piece on the coronavirus.  Information like this might offer clarity and perspective to people who are otherwise alarmed and confused.

On the other hand, Trump’s erratic bloviating and painfully obvious incompetence and willful ignorance in the face of a genuine crisis has sure as heck been responsible for the panic selloff of the past week. 

The world can no longer avoid what’s staring us all in the face: the Emperor of the White House hasn’t got any clothes on. It’s not a pretty sight; and it’s not one we’ll be able to ‘unsee’ any time soon."

Impeachment for criminal and treasonous behavior could not remove Trump.
Plan C , fear created by media, Trumps record of lies, gutting government and tanking the stock market/ recession should do it. This is nothing new, historically, in the transfer of power.
Remember raising interests rates on credit cards to 25 per cent and  refusing to  “ allow” Iran to release hostages until Reagan was elected, removed Carter.
If Trump calls the pandemic a hoax as the most compromised among us die, he loses the election. If he continues to lie, as is his nature, he loses the election. 
He gutted the federal agencies in place to help us, that should cost him the election. The script is beautifully written and Biden continues to build momentum to bring us back to the center. 
I now understand why Pelosi did not wish to impeach Trump. 
Crystal ball sez small recession, Biden elected, serum available for the compromised, economy moves out of recession with Democrat domestic initiatives, to include healthcare, clean energy, infrastructure passed by Democrat controlled Congress. Coronavirus becomes buried in news cycle.
Brilliant.

- his failed airline operation,
- multitude of failed construction projects,
- his educational guarantees to his defunct “university” students,
- his border wall construction on Day 1,
- his love affairs with China and North Korea,
- his hubris with NATO and other European nations, 
- his exposed ignorance of how the economy works,
- the distribution of federal tax cuts to the wealthy,
- his imaginary church attendance, and
- his three year failed attempts to derail Obamacare.
Since it was reported today that Congressmen Gaetz of FL, Collins of GA, and new WH Chief of Staff are in self-imposed isolation for exposure to coronavirus and spent time recently with Trump, maybe it should be called the Sycophantic Virus. 

Folks need to be careful who and where they kiss. Maybe CPAC should be more selective of attendees. There may be something really biblical happening in this country."
2020-03-10 2:46,"A payroll tax cut will do nothing if people cannot remain employed.  If they have no sick leave, many will still go to work and could spread the virus.  Along with the payroll tax cut, the legislation should mandate 14 days of paid leave for people who need to be quarantined.  Frankly legislation should be passed that requires businesses to provide for at least 7 days of paid sick leave regardless - this includes the infamous""contract workers"" that many in the hospitality industry use to get around offering benefits.  This mandate for sick leave should become permanent.   As for the nursing home over in Kirkland - not testing everyone until now is unconscionable.  The staff still haven't been tested.  Keeping all these people in there is basically a death sentence for many of the elderly living there.  Basically they they have been written off in my opinion.  It's horrific."

The sad reality is that some of these folks are also dying because of our incompetent government. 

I am an atheist, but I am starting to believe in higher power. Maybe corona virus is godsend to make this country think again as this will (hopefully) expose this conman who became the president with the help of Russians and Fox News.

2020-03-10 3:22,A payroll tax cut is something that Republicans have been pushing for years. It is a backdoor way of getting rid of Social Security and Medicare. Trump is obviously using the coronavirus as an political opportunity to push right wing conservative agendas. Congress should say absolutely not!
2020-03-10 3:27,"From reading posts here, a major challenge becomes even more evident:

Many healthcare workers are not adequately protected and thus become possible vectors for illness in anyone they treat or anyone with whom they live. 

There's nothing to be done. But ER patients with other illnesses become vulnerable by sharing space with those who may be sick or carrying. So, how many people who need ER help will just stay home out of fear of contagion? Or not want to ride in a rescue full of flu?

It's very frightening to think about this."
2020-03-10 3:28,"The fact is the only way to get rid of the Corona virus is to let it do what it’s going to do. Any country that builds a wall to keep the virus out actually becomes a danger to the world, as after the virus has died away and a majority of the population recovered and now having the antibodies that will safely protect the community from another Corona epidemic. Any county or state that has not dealt with the virus will have a major epidemic eventually, which can lead to another wave of Corona sweeping the world. Until a vaccine is created the only real vaccine is the virus itself."

On top of that, cruise ships dump raw sewage into the ocean, and create a massive amount of other environmental harms.
If Corona can cripple the cruise ship industry, the virus has done at least one good thing."

2020-03-10 3:35,"Thanks to pubmed being accessible to everyone, it is possible to read research papers on this family of bat viruses. I happened upon a disturbing paper where they found on injecting certain peptides (protein sequences) from SARS (2003 infection) virus into mice and then challenging it with an actual SARS infection, one in particular, instead of invoking a vaccine like immunity in the mice actually caused the SARS infection to be even more severe. A kind of antibody dependent enhancement. Apparently the peptide initially introduced, caused a long term B cell memory to form and this was used by the actual SARS virus to hijack the immune system.  In short if this scenario of one virus helping another virus to become more nasty, through your own immune system, is true, we are in many levels of trouble. Now to make any vaccine will be like walking through a minefield. So now that China has exposed the world to this mild virus, the next time we encounter a cousin virus from the bats, perhaps we will suffer a whole load more. The 1918 Spanish flu suddenly looms into view. We lost 50 million people world wide and half a million in the USA.

Sigh I don’t have any background in virology, but I feel the need to help in anyway I can. Maybe more folks can read and throw their thoughts in. Who knows, together we may figure out how to tweak this strategy used by this horrible virus family. ( Dengue does a similar act between the two strains)."

It is also worrying that the people around me think on completely opposite ends of the spectrum: some think this is no big deal, and others are so anxious to the point where they can’t focus on their academics. Many of my classmates are still traveling for the upcoming spring break, and I don’t want to think about how much of a disaster this will be when everyone comes back to finish up classes."
2020-03-10 4:07,"I actually wish I'm in China right now. Outside of Wuhan, the Chinese have gotten things completely under control with just double digit cases in a country of 1.3 billion. 

Our approach of barebones testing and tracking have completely and utterly failed. We have completely lost control of this virus. There are community spread in Seattle, NYC, and SF Bay area. The Kirkland nursing home where so many deaths have occurred have finally JUST gotten around to testing its residents...and of course they're nearly all positive. 

My local county just confirmed its first case of the virus - days after the patient recovered and has been spreading it in the meantime. And they recommend no changes at all other than ""wash your hands."" 

My dad is in his 70s. The 8% fatality rate for his age group mortifies me. We cannot just let about one tenth of our elderly citizens take this hit. We need to learn from the Chinese and take draconian measures now to save lives.

And yet, I expect almost nothing to happen. The US will probably experience a worse pandemic than the rest of the world."
2020-03-10 4:10,"The positive that can come out of this is that it will highlight the inequity, unethical issues with our current healthcare. Many people won't get tested even when it is available because of cost. They won't go or have access to a doctor to order a test because of cost. They won't or can't afford to stay home because of lack of or no insurance or paid leave of fear of being fired. Yes that is virtually every cashier at every store that you and I frequent. 
It takes stressors like this more often than not force a change of a broken system. History repeats itself."

- Ports are in remote areas away from large population.

- Ports to have quarantine and testing and other medical facilities for large number of passengers. 

- once cleared, they can proceed to where they want to go.

- Federal pandemic response personnel and infrastructure for diagnostic testing, treatment and management. 

- Other personnel with good training for pandemic scenarios. 

- Single portal (web portal, and paper publication, automated phone instruction number) to allow federal govt. to provide regular, substantive official updates and reliable advisory information.

- Make it part of federal defence strategy to mandate diversification of supply chain (spread across multiple continents) for Businesses and also mandate a certain percentage to be manufactured within shores to retain talent and infrastructure.

Likely the virus will burn out as summer comes. How many will die before then is near pure speculation.  

If casting blame is what motivates you to comment, I pity your worldview. This virus is just a nasty flavor of a modern reality. It is not surprising, nor is it the outcome of a pernicious few. This is what we produce, in our over ripe world of consumption.  The good news is we will persevere. The bad news is there is another outbreak coming. Can we better face this reality?

Proud of the state & the hospitals for already figuring it out and implementing it, everyone everywhere needs to learn from wise decisions, old & newfangled both, from anywhere around the globe. Too bad the trump administration  & the CDC are mired in  really bad decisions and unwise sluggish leadership, not taking tips from other countries where this has already broken wide open. Learn from South Korea, from Italy, from China...what worked, and what decidedly did not. Be sharp, we are many steps behind this virus, this pandemic, not at all in front of it, no matter what authorities might want you to hear."

2020-03-10 19:42,"This is pandering of the highest order. So, less money goes into the Social Security trust fund. And who do you think will be hurt most when Social Security gets cut? Why not lower the rate AND raise the cap on what can be taxed so you get something revenue neutral? Because that might affect that mythical middle class everyone is so worried about."

Pathetic!!!"

Given the global spread of the virus and the difficulty of spotting mild cases, they say, it is unlikely that it will ever be completely eliminated — even in China.'

These are probably not the same experts that appreciated the time these draconian lockdowns bought to come up with vaccine.
Unless the vaccine won't be available to people with no/limited health care - in which case we should probably listen to Joe-it's-pointless-Sixpack - I applaud the action, whatever the motives there may be."
2020-03-07 23:53,"A strange article. It quotes criticism but offers no alternative to China's approach. 
According to the Prof. Marc Lipsitch quoted in the article: ""40% to 70% of people world-wide are likely to be infected in the coming year"" with the Covid-19 coronavirus. 
As it is new, nobody has built up any resistance to the virus. 
The current mortality rate in Italy is 3.5%. British experts think the global mortality rate will be around 1%.
This is a doomsday scenario of collapsing societies and millions of (mainly old) people dying.
Yet China seems to have stopped or at least delayed the spread of the virus. 
It may have used ""incredible"" methods, but nobody has any better ideas."

Add to that flying drones with cameras that scream at people to go back home and real threats of prison and sure, it might slow the virus. I'm not so sure that would work so well in most free societies though. The government also doesn't have a great history for honesty, even in this current crisis, so the chances that they are truly controlling this situation is doubtful. And not to cry over split milk but this pandemic should never have happened in the first place given the history of SARS."
2020-03-08 0:56,"“The ruling Communist Party hails the slowdown of the outbreak as a sign of the superiority of its authoritarian, top-down political system that gives officials nearly unchecked power.”

Assuming China has truly contained the outbreak in their country, it is indeed impressive, but personally, I am not willing to cede control to an authoritarian government to handle this crisis, because of the dangerous precedent it would set (with this administration in particular). 

From discussions I’ve had with physicians, the general consensus is that this outbreak is going to get worse before it gets better, and COVID-19 may end up becoming as endemic as the common cold, albeit more deadly. If that’s the case, are we all to stay on lock down each year throughout COVID-19/cold & flu season??

I feel for the elderly and immune compromised who are at grave risk with this outbreak, and steps must be taken to ensure the health of those at highest risk. But in my opinion, the lesson we learn from this should be the importance and benefits to humanity of universal healthcare, not the virtues of ceding our freedom to an authoritarian government (that as we know, generally acts in its own interest, not humanity’s)."
2020-03-08 1:25,"China is doing what it does best, which is controlling the narrative and the news. Nobody has the foggiest idea what actually goes on in China. It is well known that the economic numbers coming out of China are all made up, it reports what it wants the international media to believe and what suits the communist party regime. Why should anybody think that it would be anything different with this epidemic when the stakes are so high? During Mao's great leap forward in the 50's, 25 million Chinese died of starvation in the rural areas, the international media did not come to know of the crisis until years later. Same thing happened during the cultural revolution, when millions were murdered by Mao and the communist party purges. For a few weeks during this epidemic, the facade came off the media control and the news quickly came out about the epidemic. The news was likely seen as a threat to Xi Jinping and the Communist party ruling elite. The officials are probably responding with a combination of enforced quarantines, driving the infected underground, quietly cremating the dead and controlling the media. In the US now, Trump is almost sure to lose the November election because of this crisis. If the Chinese government is responding to the crisis with its usual bag of tricks, it may not last long either."
2020-03-08 1:26,"The Chinese have put the full power of their surveillance state behind stopping the thread of this virus.  I’m called frequently by someone in my “neighborhood committee” asking about my movements and health.  I’m required to input my temperature into an app twice a day.  If I leave the apartment I must show a government QR code that shows I’m considered healthy to get into many establishments or office buildings.  Anyone coming from anywhere outside Shanghai (domestic or international) is being asked to stay away from work for 14 days once they are back in shanghai. 

The local citizens have done a great job heeding the government’s call to self isolate, even when healthy, and the streets are pretty empty and even restaurants and shops that have reopened are mostly serving one or two customers.  

If the goal is to completely eradicate the virus then the approach of the CCP seems most effective.  Unfortunately it comes at a huge economic cost.  Nobody will ever know if the eventual economic repercussions will be worse than the virus hit if they hadn’t put in the restrictions here in China.  We may, however, get a view on how putting the economy first and virus control second will fare with the current reaction in the United States where I don’t think there is the will to take measures the Chinese have taken due to fear of disrupting the economy.  

I really don’t know what’s the right choice but my chance of catching COVID here in Shanghai is now less than in California."
2020-03-08 1:36,"We really can't afford to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Everyone who's job allows it should work from home, and any social social gatherings of more than a few people should be banned. And (and I know this is going to set people off) all bars should be closed and liquor sales suspended. Anyone who is drunk is literally not capable of making good decisions regarding personal hygiene and physical contact with others.

Yes, this is going to cost jobs. Is it a violation of personal liberty? I'm not so sure. The cost of not getting this under control is beyond what most of us can imagine, and even fewer can really understand. We can't stop this, and the actions of the Chinese government in Wuhan probably went too far, but we can slow the spread of this virus down significantly if we stop prioritizing business and profits over people's lives. Our government must step in - assuring all of us adequate food, protection from evictions and utility shut offs, and the ability to seek and receive medical care without being driven into bankruptcy."
2020-03-08 1:47,"What China's experience shows is what happens when this epidemic is allowed to get out of control, and desperate measures are needed to contain it.

The problem is, we too are failing to act, and as a consequence, the novel coronavirus will soon be out of control here -- if it isn't already.

Then, we'll face the unhappy choice of upending our entire society as China has, or watching one out of every 50 Americans die.

To avoid these twin catastrophes, we desperately need more stringent measures and more federal support than we currently have. And that will require strong leadership, rather than a leader who pretends that he is strong."
2020-03-08 1:48,"Let's not forget that, when China initiated the aggressive response to the outbreak, people had very limited knowledge about the virus: how it spreads, how deadly it is, how much resource is needed... Most cases were from Wuhan at that time, where the situations appeared to be much worse than elsewhere, painting a grim outlook. Facing a novel virus, huge uncertainty, and a big stake, what China did is very responsible and not short-sighted."
2020-03-08 1:52,"In all stories covering the reporting on the pandemic, there is not one that cites or speaks to prevention of the disease in the first place. Containment is important in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality statistics and any draconian measures taken by a government to protect its citizens and economy can be argued in hindsight after the treat has subsided. Where is the discussion about behaviors to prevent the scourge in the first place? Bats harbor the Coronavirus and infect Civets, a wild feline, that is butchered and consumed by humans. Animal husbandry does not include the abattoir of feral creatures but the practice of farming in relatively controlled conditions. The Covid-19 outbreak will be followed by others lest changes in human dietary and belief systems change. Stop eating wild animals. We are sick of it!"

I know in recent weeks Chinese local officials have received pressure from above to totally contain the virus to the point of ""zero new case"", which is of course impossible, and naturally their only choice is to fabricate the numbers. Official statistics in China has always been political, keep that in mind."

2020-03-07 22:19,I don’t understand how the author can remotely reasonably suggest that the cure may be worse than the disease. Yes liberties and human rights have been compromised (more than usual) with China’s heavy handed approach in suppressing the spread of the virus. You know what is worse than not having all the liberties and rights? Being dead because the government didn’t clamp down hard enough on the virus.
2020-03-08 1:50,That photo of “light traffic” in Beijing during is absolute nonsense. There are ZERO cars on that road. They are obviously not returning to normal and we’re going to start see the massively negative side effects of people being held out of work soon enough.

To answer that question we must know how bad the disease is, which we do not at this point, and if we wait to find out and it turns out to be as bad as it could be, the window for the hard cure may have closed.

And of course the ""hard cure"" is really not a cure at all, it is just a shut down to isolate the cases and prevent the spread in the general population. If you are diagnosed you are isolated, quarantined, severe cases go on oxygen, critical cases go on respirators, you either die or you survive it, no-one is cured."

2020-03-08 1:32,"There may be no way to bend media reporting toward objectivity – although that is their declared justification. Let’s start with “hid the scale of the outbreak and silenced whistle-blowers.”

Dr. Li Wanliang (I have a picture of him with wife and boy taken by a friend in Wuhan) posted his concern about a SARS-like development to his former class mates and was picked off spreading rumors --- standard criticism in many social network setting (?) – Much beefed up over here.

Meanwhile medical personnel were becoming concerned about a new threat – communicated with their ‘superiors’ and soon enough local political authorities notified. 

Now what? The mayor decides to lock down town on the eve of the New Year celebration when most of China “goes home”?

2020-03-08 2:12,"CCP elite appears to know, as usual, more than what has been widely reported.  This time it is about the timing of the epidemic's start, especially.  Test kits were relatively scarce in the beginning but the supply sky rocketed in January perhaps (I say perhaps as I have not  seen any reports on this matter specifically) before CCP admitted person-to-person infection model.  The recent story about former patients showing new positive test results is problematic especially in the context of China chasing ""Zero"".  That could possibly be because of the mass production of test kits and mass production of instant test kits administrators - both facing the obvious risks of declining average quality.  Otherwise, yes, China did slow down the spread of the virus globally.  That fact does not erase the other more fundamental fact that their initial cover up produced a very large number of Chinese tourists with the virus globally."
2020-03-08 2:18,"China should have never let coronavirus start, but it did ultimately combat it very commendably. At the end of the day. fewer people died in China than in the US in a normal flu season. The ALTERNATIVE would have been a lot more ""painful"", to borrow a word from the headline."
2020-03-08 2:47,"Forget China.  Focus on why there are so few test kits available in the United States.  Why were CDC's standards for testing so stringent that many people who were infected were allowed to go into the general population?  Was it because they knew they had insufficient test kits and need to cover themselves?  Why is the public told that masks are ineffective in preventing infection for the average citizen and that we should hold off securing them for ourselves in order that health workers have them available to protect health workers from the virus -- in short, if the masks are effective for health workers, why is the public told they are ineffective for the rest of us?  This is not paranoia - it's an Orwellian oxymoron.  Why was the CDC's budget cut by the Administration and what effect has that had on its ability to properly respond?  And why is Congress failing in its duty to find answers to these and other questions?"

In industry as elsewhere people are asked to work from home – but how practical is that. The government has wave out utility payments and some other fixed cost ‘until latter.’

It’s working: no reported illnesses posted locally and we have 50 students who returned from Wuhan universities and private schools here for Autumn Festival -- here yet.

2020-03-08 3:15,"This epidemic can be pushed back,” Dr. Tedros said, “but only with a collective, coordinated and comprehensive approach that engages the entire machinery of government.”

Coronavirus is like a fire, and it doesn’t matter whether the kindling is Chinese or America. But China appears to have effectively constructed breaks in the conflagration by imposing stringent measures that have effectively prevented or at least suppressed transmission.

The US has made it clear thus far that it doesn’t intend to do that. Large-scale deployment of a vaccine is at best several months away. So we’re left to fend for ourselves. 

No amount of hand-washing, mouth covering and self-isolation will have anywhere near the impact of the measures taken by the Chinese. Without a concerted federal effort, the US will suffer the full effects of the virus on a scale we can’t begin to comprehend. This isn’t an alarmist perspective; just look at the numbers and our current resources and do the math."
2020-03-08 3:22,If anything the Chinese government gave the rest of the world time to prepare for a pandemic. Other countries in Asia used that advantage and have seen low case numbers as a result. I don’t think the US used that time efficiently.
2020-03-08 3:40,The cure is NOT worse than the disease. The disease will take out up to 10% of us if we dont stop it.
2020-03-08 3:43,"Can we really trust the reports from the Chinese government about the number of new cases that have been detected?   The very low number of new cases fits in with the narrative that the Chinese government propaganda machine has been trying to sell to the rest of the world.   It also fits with the long game of the Chinese government to get the country's economy back and running, even if it means sacrificing its own people to do so.   We need data we can trust before we can say that the Chinese efforts have been effective."

And the country that stopped it is China and the containment policy came from the Communist Party under Xi. 
Great news if you are concerned about people's health. Bad news if you are using the epidemic as an opportunity to bash China.
Countries now have two models to copy on Covid 19. China and a policy that drives down infections.  Or the US where the numbers have rapidly risen from a handful to hundreds over the same time period."

No war or disaster in the history of civilization has ever killed that many people."
2020-03-08 3:27,"The ancient country of China masquerading as the modern communist state has a lot to teach the world. Great consequential lessons are costly and should not be ignored. So what did we learn from most recent Corona virus, COVID-19. 
1) Don't hide such a potentially devastating problem from its own people and the rest of the world. Whistle blower like Dr. Wenliang should never have been silenced or ignored. Sooner the world found out about the growing menace of COVID-19, lurking in Wuhan, the WHO and the world should have been alerted and the spread of the virus rapidly contained. 
2) Viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged in China and was linked to the human consumption of wild animals like the sivet cats from wild life markets. Although no one is sure what the natural reservoir for the COVID-19 is, there are fingers being pointed at bats and pangolins sold in wild life markets. The lesson learned here is what scourge and panic has been brought to our world can result in emergence or reemergence of another virulent strain in the not so distant future and therefore it will be best to leave the wild animals in the wild. 
3) Rapidly building well equipped new hospitals to specifically quarantine and treat infected persons arrests the spread of the virus.
4) Restricting travel and strictly enforcing travel restrictions to and from the epicenter can restrict spread of the virus.
5) Mild corona virus infection is CURABLE in immunocompetent younger non smokers."
2020-03-08 4:09,"Though the Chinese government could take the extreme measures to contain the coronavirus, it is not easy for democratic countries to restrict economic and social activities in their countries. The leaders of democratic countries have been worrying about the balance between the containment of the disease and human rights. In such a situation why did WHO praise the Chinese government?

But I’m still appreciate to the doctors and nurses who volunteer to fight the virus at the front line, also appreciate our government for taking those strong measures to protect us. It is theses actions that kept the rest of us safe. 
So just don’t only focus on the one side of the coin, ok?"

But the American Republican idea that government exerting its power is always wrong is also fatuous. China has been dominating the global economic marketplace for years now despite an economy with massive Socialist features (Government ownership or control of huge economic sectors.) This is anathema to the free market fairytales of Republicans. The Chinese government is not afraid to exert its might for what it perceives to be the common good. In a pandemic public health crisis such as we are facing now, I’d much prefer a coordinated public policy and a strong centralized government response.  Rather than ceding the field to a Balkanized, overtaxed patchwork of health care providers, perhaps with weak regional oversight, but who ultimately have to answer to profit driven corporate overlords."

China didn't contain the disease, but they bought the world valuable time to prepare for it.  That said, I'm deeply troubled to hear that some outspoken journalists disappeared after speaking out against the Chinese government over suppression of information about the outbreak.  It brings to mind the disappearance of Tank Man after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.  It's like nothing has changed much in China in over 30 years, except that China has become a major exporter of goods to the U.S..  We should be deeply troubled by this."

In addition I have asthma, high blood pressure and other health issues. 
 I really appreciate everything you healthy younger people are doing to protect people like me.  And maybe, that isn't what is best for the country.
Regardless of what ya'll do this virus is coming. 
 I was thinking, since US seniors don't live with our kids to the same degree as other countries, we are already isolated.  If we take this existing isolation of vulnerable people to the next step: quarantine, then the rest of the country could just get sick with the virus and develop the community immunity the nation needs to bring the vulnerable back into the world. 
 If we don't create this community immunity. but let the virus just gradually flood the community over many months then those of us who are vulnerable won't know when it will be safe to come back out.
If we plan this right we could all be back on track in four weeks.  And the plan would give stability to nation.
We could wait two weeks for community immunity to form, then another week for all surface viruses to die. Then maybe one more week just to be sure, then let us vulnerable folks out.  Better, yes!"

I can't have visitors in my apartment complex and can't visit friends, but we have been meeting for dinners out. 

I restrict my comings and goings to 'as needed' though some colleagues are riding bikes for exercise.  The air quality has been much better with fewer cars out and factories largely shut. 

I had walking pneumonia in 1999 and even when I catch a cold my lungs still hurt a bit more than they should.  One upside to this crisis is that I've not been sick once this winter.  

I do worry that my colleagues who are still abroad won't be able to come back.  The Corona virus peaked as many of us were away for the Chinese NY holiday (I was able to get back though rerouted).  And I doubt we'll be able to return to campus in April as the Chinese gov't has asked.  Most of our students are only children, largely coddled and protected, and their parents won't want them in public.

2020-03-08 7:33,"It's questionable what China's unprecedented nationwide lock-down has achieved. Yes, it has slowed down the spread of the virus, but coronavirus still found its way to many other countries. Now China is afraid that people from other countries to bring back the virus. What's the solution? Continue the isolation for another year until a vaccine is found? Vast majority of people who are infected have only mild symptoms. This looks like a severe version of flu. It could be deadly but probably should not keep you stay at home."
2020-03-08 7:48,"The argument here is that it is a choice between controlling the virus while trashing the economy, or allowing the virus to spread and presumably the economy will hum along as usual.  But is this realistic ?  Do you think when hospitals are overwhelmed, and thousands of people are dying, that life will still go on as usual ?  Would people still go shopping in malls, go to cinemas, restaurant, or even go to work as usual ?  I would argue that if the virus is not brought under control with measures that are painful in the short term, the epidemic will still lead to the same economic impact, but probably even more severe and prolonged."
2020-03-08 8:12,"The author made a mistake by comparing Hong Kong and Singapore with Wuhan, the hardest hit epicenter of this new deadly infectious disease. Both cities have only limited imported cases to begin with and community transmission was detected early and case numbers were small. They should be more appropriately compared with cities in China outside of Hubei province. Those cities pretty much have eradicated the bug completely. Just today, Italian government announced locking down of 11 provinces in the north to contain the endemic, Wuhan style. Like it or not, the explosive exponential growth of the COVID19 would force any government down to this path unless a government chooses to surrender 2% of the population without any serious effort. Just wait and see this happens again and again when it ravages through the rest of the world. It's not by anyone's choice but the nasty nature of this once a century plague. 

Also, the author's assumes the economy would run as usual when an endemic is ongoing. Such assumption is obviously flawed."
2020-03-08 8:24,"The biggest problem is DELAY.  Public health  officers and governments by taking a softly, softly, wait and see approach have been pussyfooting around.  If they were really serious about stopping this virus, they should have had immediate travel bans in place to China and every country as soon as the virus was discovered. No exceptions.  Taking a half-hearted approach is going to result in the worst of all worlds - the virus will still spread around the world over months killing thousands - while ineffective quarantine measures cause massive economic damage.  Also, surely there needs to be some sort of suspension or alteration of financial obligations which cannot be met due to the effects of the coronavirus - as a kind of unforeseeable superseding event - like a natural disaster or act of god. I think what this virus does show is just how artificial the economy is and how vulnerable it is to external events (of which we’ll be seeing more due to climate change).  Maybe there is something to be said for a more simple life.  Do we really need to travel as much and release all that carbon?  Can we do more using technology to work remotely and communicate on Skype?  Is there something nice about being at home and staying local? It can certainly save you money."
2020-03-08 10:05,Would it be possible to obtain aside from statistics on coronavirus those on ordinary flu cases this year and the number of deaths so far? it would help us to put things in perspective.
2020-03-08 11:27,"The problem is less the virus and more its ""spread.""  Containment is critical to stop the spread.  That should be the first priority of any government.

Trump took the right steps given the information we had at the time.  He declared an emergency and limited travel for those who had been near Ground Zero in the past two weeks.  He ordered the first quarantine in 50 years.

Like most countries, the US was unaware how easily transmitted this virus is.  Now we know.  More travel restrictions are necessary."
2020-03-08 11:31,Did I miss something in this article that said China found a cure or vaccination for the virus? It seems to me that until that part has been solved the virus will continue to spread.
2020-03-08 11:44,"If China hadn't applied drastic measures (even draconian), the U.S. or EU could be looking at 10 times or more confirmed cases as compared to now. That fact is sadly ignored by this report.

Ideology should not triumph over humanity. Especially when we all face this challenge together. Put aside the petty concerns and join forces. That is how we win as a race."
2020-03-08 11:44,"Of course lockdowns are needed to contain any fast spreading virus. Let's admit certain methods are most effective in certain scenarios and situations, and this is no different. China did not invent medical 'lockdown', yes it works most here, because of communism, which is 'lockdown' in itself of personal freedom. 

In the US, people choosing to be vigilant about their own going-ons helps, but otherwise, we are seeing a bit of panic and the impact as toilet paper, hand sanitizers etc. vanishing :-D. But this virus will not stop, it will require the entire world to come together and act together. Now if we could say the same about climate change."
2020-03-08 11:50,"Conceal and mismanage could even be understandable in the country where the virus, totally unknown, firstly hit, certainly it is not understandable now in the USA. In the end, in the planetary game it will be another goal for China."
2020-03-08 11:52,"On one hand, I am finding it fascinating the degree to which this has brought our world to a near halt and the media is obsessed with coverage while kids are getting gunned own in their schools, at concerts, etc. And climate change is poised to do far more damage and destruction yet countries, especially ours, are more concerned with other things. I hate to sound crude but the people who have died are very nearly at death's door already. Maybe the (fewer) vulnerable ones should be quarantined as opposed to everyone else and rethink this mania, expense, and environmental issues over testing."
2020-03-08 7:35,"Many recent COVIT-19 outbreaks worldwide are not traceable to known sources. May be China is not the only source of this virus, which may have originated in USA. Japanese media questions whether some of the 15,000 deaths in the US in the last season were in fact caused by COVIT-19 (2500  deaths worldwide). For example, A japanese women with no known suspicious contact, was tested positive having just come back from holidaying in Haweii.  Italian news also reports its ground-zero COVIT-19 patient had no known suspicious contact history except for recent holidaying in Hawaii. While present assumptions are that the virus originated in Wuhan, China, new research suggests that it did not originate there - though clearly it entered the Huanan wet market there and aggressively bred between persons in it, starting an epidemic. Chinese scientists are still trying to identify the ground-zero source of infection. Interestingly recent research shows the virus's genetic variations in COVIT-19 patients can be grouped as five distinct clusters labeled as A, B, C, D and E. If A clusters are regarded as parents, B's would be children, and C's grand-children. Thus B can only manifest, or be borne, after A and not vise-versa. Genetic tests show that all COVIT-19 viruses in Chinese patients belong only to group C, those in Hong Kong show A and C, those in the US (only a handful tested) present all the classes of ABCDE. This points to USA as more likely to be the virus's place of origin."
2020-03-08 4:16,"As the article says, the party boss of Wuhan is asking the residents there to be grateful to Xi Jinping and the communist party. For what should they be grateful? For turning this into a pandemic? The situation got out of control because of the coverups and doctored numbers by the CCP. We should not trust them!"
2020-03-08 5:15,"The Western Media keep harping on human right and the economic costs, but did they consider the cost if it's not under control? For 1.4 billion Chinese, if half got infected, that's 700 million, 20% are serious syndromes, that's 140 million, death rate say is not 3.4%, but 1%, that's 1.4 million. No society and health care system and maintain itself without collapsing. Then complete chaos and anarchy. U.S. have trouble finding landing spot for that cruise ship of 3,000 people. The man in Westchester infected over a dozen people in less than 1 week, that's only we know of, not the secondary or tertiary chains. The taxi driver tested positive in Rockaways and caused 40 medical professional to be quarantined. I worry that the healthcare system in U.S. will collapse if the virus spread to the homeless population."
2020-03-08 6:17,Which is more important between saving lives and inconvenience economic cost?
2020-03-08 6:29,"This is not a zombie movie, or even one of those average evil-virus/super-duper-contagion movies where EVERYONE GETS SICK AND DIES!  Pass the popcorn!

Rather, coronavirus is ostensibly nothing more than a ramped-up version of your average-year flu.  Even the mortality rate is a more 3.5 percent overall---not something I wish to minimize, but only hope people will put into helpful larger context.  It may interest those under 60 to note that their specific mortality numbers are even a mere fraction of the overall numbers.  Hey, Boomer, this one's for you.  Those over 60 are most susceptible to the 3.5 percent mortality rate, especially but not solely limited to men, plus those with lung and heart issue or compromised immune systems.

And even if you get the virus, your experience will likely be no worse than the average cold or flu.  A few sniffles, a cough perhaps, and that's it.  Most folks won't even know they had it.  Should make everyone breathe a little easier.

As far as putting a moat around COVID-19, squeezing 'til it's gone, this is where it gets tricky.  Should we employ draconian measures that may only dampen, not eliminate, the virus, or let society run per usual, putting the fires out when and where they appear?

It's a serious question each of us needs to ponder.  Soon, it may become personal.  And if it does, which matters more, killing the virus short-term, or civil liberties longterm? 

Are we are our brother's keeper? Or is it everybody for his/herself?"
2020-03-08 8:56,"The disruption of freedoms and livelihoods to contain a virus, the spread of which is directly related to human population density and modern lifestyle, is a pre-sequel of the times to come, if and when we are unable to change our way of living.

It is ironic that atmospheric CO2 rise will halt during the first half of 2020 because covid-19 did what governments could not.

And this is not a one-timer. Within 20 years this is the third serious new epidemic. Seven good and seven bad years, in repeat.

Do we learn? If not, we cry and learn."
2020-03-08 10:12,Posting from Germany - which currently has 847 cases of infection but not one death - and we had dinner last night at a Steak Restaurant with a Chinese friend who studies sociology here - and we all wondered what is the difference about the handling of the Virus in Germany compared to China and the US?
2020-03-08 6:09,"How about China truly banning the exotic meat markets, for eating and medicinal purposes?

I have been to China many times. The people are wonderful and are very hospitable. The hotels are beautiful and the food is delicious. They do not need to be selling and butchering animals like bats in close quarters, or at all for that matter."
2020-03-08 6:39,No matter what Most Americans are always critical about China and how undemocratic way Chinese leaders are damaging to her innocent citizens. But the Chinese dictators are now slowly winning the war against Coronavirus invasion in China. But America will never interested to learn from the Chinese experience. Not even for life saving reasons. Democracy and transparency are more important than human  lives in America.
2020-03-08 8:10,"Amy Qin is picking up nicely where Li Yuan, the other reporter on the China beat, left off. Translated: tell readers China is not trustworthy, draconian Chinese leaders can't do anything right, despite what WHO observers in China and other health professionals said in praise of China's effort to slow down a new and unknown pathogen, which human populations have not developed defense mechanism yet.

Like all natural calamities, of course people suffer losses. It's only human to complain. But Chinese people have shown remarkable restraint, cooperation and patience. No riots and burnt down stores."
2020-03-08 3:42,"I didn’t learn much. What are the short or longer term affects for those who survive? What about the reported lung scarring? What about relapse? 
Please report the effect to humans and if there are cross species infections and more on reported mutations?"
2020-03-08 4:39,"Numbers coming out of China fit the narrative that China has been doing the right thing and is victorious in containing the outbreak.
But of course, China lies.
So why would reporters buy these numbers?
Experts and scientists are using these underreported numbers and applying them to formulas to tell people whether or not this virus has a high mortality. Fake numbers yield fake results.
Neither the WHO nor the CDC have all the facts. No one is keeping track of the hundreds of thousands who have been infected, confirmed or not."
2020-03-08 6:37,so the author thinks that the numbers from china might be flawed and incomplete. it is obvious that the numbers of the u s are incomplete given the low number of tests being made and it would not be surprising if they were also flawed and manipulated (with a sharpie).
2020-03-08 6:45,"Unless you are elderly or immunocompromised, your “coronavirus journey” - if you were to catch it- would basically be a cold/URI. So, I’d say at risk folks should definitely take extra personal precautions, and others should simply go about their usual business, with some extra hand-washing for good measure."
2020-03-08 9:52,At a painful cost? What’s more important: the economy or people?
2020-03-08 10:21,"China is a planned economy. Results matter more than civil liberties to its political elite. Within this context, a massive response to coronavirus could be anticipated once governmental leaders got the message. Is their public health response sustainable? Will it decisively contain this highly infectious decease over time? Who knows.

By comparison, we value civil liberties in the US, while grotesquely underfunding public health. The slash and burn funding practices of the Trump Administration has rendered the CDC incapable of an effective response. Many state governments have also neglected public health. VP Pence is the veritable frog in a freeway as he ineffectually leads a public relations campaign against a health crisis. Trump pretends that his tweets will kill this bug. Indeed, if his fake news were an antidote to coronavirus then this virus has no future here. 

Whomever wins the Democratic primary must commit to funding a public health system that inspires confidence. Coronavirus offers a timely reminder that all Americans need access to affordable health care when facing life threatening illness. Debating whether the tab is ultimately paid for by the federal government, or by private health insurance is a secondary concern."
2020-03-08 11:27,"The Chinese government is simply not to be believed, anymore than their treatment of the """"one country, two systems"" promise, in light of recent events in Hong Kong, is to be believed.

China is a completely authoritarian country. Virtually all information coming out of, as well as into, China is controlled by a regime which will not countenance bad news for fear of appearing illegitimate and ineffective. 

Of course, we have a ham-fisted imitation of Chinese leadership in our own White House. Luckily, a free press still exists and the truth usually gets out in spite of Trump's attempts to stifle it."
2020-03-08 4:37,"What is interesting is the rest of the world had ample time available to get ready while China was dealing with covid19 - testing kits, masks, sanitizers, airport screening and such.  But it appears that nobody outside of Australia did anything.

Seems like most are happy to pay the lip service and are hoping that the advent of spring will help contain it.

Good luck, World!"
2020-03-08 9:06,"A simple question: how can a cure be worse that a disease, no matter the measures. As an Italian scientist, working in infectious disease field (in Germany) it’s very painful to see what’s happening now in my own country - the debates over media and especially the real fight doctors are fighting to contain or control the outbreak. At this point, I can only admire what the Chinese have done - they did give us us time, an alert to realize what is happening, but we seemed to think it’s only happening to them and won’t happen to us. Whether the measures our governments are taking are right or not, is debatable. However, people need to understand that this is extremely serious, a lot of cases are around us and are not being detected- see the measures taken by South Corea, that’s a way to go...and there are certainly going to be enormous consequences on all levels- social, behavioral, economic, you name it. But first of all we need to STOP THE VIRUS!!!!"
2020-03-08 3:48,"I am now more concerned with the kind of response the governments in the US facing the threat of the epidemic. We have blamed China for not making the initial outbreak information publicly known. But the Chinese government has since done a much better job in reporting, on a daily basis and in a coordinated manner, data of the outbreak including new cases, possible cases, deaths, recovered. There are national figures and figures by provinces. These data are reported by all news media outlet including online ones. Here in the US, it is state by state, and news media only report total number of new cases. Frankly, I think we should take a page from China's playbook in tracking, reporting the cronavirus cases and alerting the general public."
2020-03-08 5:06,China has a state policy based on lies. Communism cannot last five minutes if the government tells the truth. The real numbers of deaths caused by the virus outbreak-caused by unsanitary customs-may not be known for a very long while. Democracies should have a trading agreement and disengage from relying in the manufacturing of goods in China and this for multiple reasons among others the protection of intellectual property and safeguarding the labor force at home. The world will be different after this outbreak.
2020-03-08 8:55,"How could Dr Schaffner possibly say China bought us more time? China is at fault for the initial spread by not having accepted the virus’ existence and by allowing it to spread to the rest of the world. Totally at blame for this. 

Btw you and your fellow reporters have been doing a tremendous job on the frontlines in China reporting on this. Thank you. Outstanding."
2020-03-08 8:59,"None of this matters anymore. With the Trump administration sitting on its hands, the virus will infect between 60-180 million Americans over the next few weeks, which means that there will be another wave of infections sweeping the world.

As of today, the US has only tested just over 5000 potential cases, whereas South Korea is testing 10.000 a day. As a result, the US infection numbers do not reflect the severity of the crisis - as a matter of fact no other country has suffered as many fatalities with such a low number of known infections. Take Germany, which has twice as many confirmed cases as the US but no fatalities, whereas the US already had 19 patients dying of Covid-19. Anyone with basic numeracy will understand that this means that there are probably thousands infected in the US, who are spreading the virus unhindered."
2020-03-08 11:26,Some perspective would be helpful if also mentioning the in the article the 9.7 million flu cases and 12000 to 30000 deaths caused by the flu in the US this year.
2020-03-08 3:56,"There is no country in the world capable of coming remotely close to what the government of China has accomplished.  I have been based in Shanghai since the outbreak and they have been utterly focused on containment.   Personally I consider it all a huge waste but once MUST respect the sheer focus and determination ""at any cost"" of the effort involved.     Why? why do I consider it a waste ? because it became clear almost immediately that people with zero symptoms were carriers.  Reality leads us to easily conclude that what is contained is truthfully only suppressed and a new wave can hit at any time.   For China to truly contain COVID, it will need to contain and simultaneously lock down all borders with the outside world.   No travelers in or out. No risk of a resurgence.   Now that would be impressive.   I have been advocating for the sake of the world economy and the livelihood of billions that we let this virus spread. spread everywhere. Let death happen at home among loved ones, as the hospitals simply will not be able to cope.  People should go to work.  We should pick ourselves up and realize that we cannot cope when a carrier has no symptoms.   Panic & Hysteria should not be the driving force.  But perhaps it is already too late.    China tried very very effectively to contain.  What happens now in the West will be an absolute circus of errors.   Make no mistake CHINA IS THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD CURRENTLY"
2020-03-08 9:43,"China is now the leading example of containment and the world must model their behavior.  6 Chinese families in the US that are involved with a business of ours are leaving the US to reluctantly return to China because the US is not taking the virus seriously.  It is conceivable that China will move from borders closed by others to borders closed to others if they fully contain the virus.  While US white collar companies are rapidly following suit and group events are being canceled, too much of the US economy is small business and service and can't work from home or cannot afford to proactively stop operating.  It is essential that Trump stop fiddling as Rome burns"
2020-03-08 4:09,"U.S. officials are certainly in no position to criticize China for a lack of candor in reporting cases.  It is not clear why the U.S. has no idea how many people are infected.  But unreasonable restrictions on who could be tested have played a role.  

Until recently only people with symptoms who had traveled to China or who had contact with a person confirmed to have the virus could be tested.  As a practical matter, few others can be tested now.  With the president openly admitting that he would like to leave the passengers and crew on a ship known to be struck by the virus, it is not hard to imagine that his sycophants are ensuring infections cannot be verified by lab tests in order to 'keep the numbers' where Trump likes them.

If the authorities really want to see more people tested soon, they could certainly set up a system to send samples to Germany or China for testing while we sort out our own system.

Perhaps China has gone too far in locking down Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province.  But their error may well prove to be less grave than allowing people to still board cruise ships, go to theme parks, attend political rallies and sporting events, etc when there is no doubt that the virus is here and spreading.

We can look at the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. (350-400) and shrug.  But how about the number of people who have been instructed to self quarantine or isolate themselves.  That is a far more worrisome number that is getting very little attention."
2020-03-08 5:31,"I don’t trust their numbers but if those numbers are somewhat accurate, I honestly think they took the only action that made sense. 

I have a bigger concern.  I think the media is going overboard in reporting on this virus.  Every single new infection is reported in blazing headlines.  We are a nation of about 350 million people.  Is it really necessary to report every single new infection?  We don’t do it with the flu.  I don’t think we do daily headcount with the Ebola virus in Africa.  We did not do when the AIDS epidemic took so many of our loved ones.  

Don’t get me wrong. I am a staunch 70-year old liberal with underlying health conditions.  I love the NYT.  It along with the AP, WAPO and PBS are my primary news sources.  But we are seeing a level of panic rise in this country.  And that panic might just do more harm to us and the economy that the virus itself."
2020-03-08 5:34,"China's response has been flawed but it's been a barrier.
We're learning from this.
the epidemic could've started anywhere
and it highlights the importance of bolstering international cooperation and the free exchange of ideas. 
Today it's the coronavirus
tomorrow it will be something else.
no one has a monopoly on effective measures.
They will come as they always have, from anywhere in the world,
and ought to find a way to serve humanity.
For anyone to claim that the stemming of the tide of infection
is a political win for China is pure nonsense.
the scanners, medical expertise, shared knowledge and the massive effort of so many workers is part of the world's heritage.
Not something Xi and company can take credit for."
2020-03-08 5:37,"Actually, this article shows me another side of coin. 

Although there are still some shortcomings of them, CCP took a lot of effectively measure to anti the virus spreading."
2020-03-08 6:04,"This is the second time a dangerous virus from China has gone global.  More people would have die if not for the brave efforts of Dr. Jaing, during the SARS epidemic, and Dr. Li Wenliang, during the CoVID-19 epidemic. Their memory should be promote so that a future epidenics are caught first hand. The International community needs inspectors on the ground in China, making sure these wildlife markets are safe. We can't trust the Party; they are in a battle against corruption."
2020-03-08 6:29,"A lot of Senior WHO doctors from various countries, who risked their health/lives to visit China,  have repeatedly told the public the proved experience from China, but people just keep challenging, including the reporters of this article, China’s experiences. There are so much distrust for chinese government and Chinese people. We are just wasting so much time and precious experience bought by their huge sacrifices and efforts. That’s sad as whole humankind, we continue to pay the heavy price due to our own distrust!"
2020-03-08 7:19,"Pause.

Why are we believing the numbers China is claiming? Why does this article not even mention this possibility, despite acknowledging that the government is known to have ""concealed and mismanaged"" the initial stages?

Why is it ""staggering"" that there are 80,000 people in China who are infected? I have been essentially led to believe that half of Americans are going to get this virus at some point in the next 4 months. 

This article raises more questions than it answers."
2020-03-08 11:40,"Rightfully stay sceptical. This is the authoritarian government that established the conditions producing the outbreak, then covered up right at the point when transparency would have resulted in quicker containment. 

This is the authoritarian government that two weeks ago encouraged workers to return to work so no economic impact would be felt, and the dictatorship would not be threatened. This is the authoritarian government that is trying to spin global disaster into a nationalistic Chinese triumph story. And Trump apparently is taking notes.

A model for the worst of the world. Stay sceptical."
2020-03-08 3:57,"It seems to me that this success in China can only be temporary.  As soon as the restrictions are lifted, I don't see how the virus can be contained in the rest of the country.  Of course the same draconian measures can be applied elsewhere, but if the closure of one city has caused this much economic turmoil, engaging the rest of China is sure to be a catastrophe.  Instead, this looks more like a dike - able to hold the inexorable waters back for a time, but ultimately to fail in a big way.  Sooner or later the people must be allowed to go about their business and the virus will appear, resurgent."
2020-03-08 4:06,"Quarantine doesn't prevent the spread of the disease, it slows it down so it will not overwhelm healthcare resources. Everyone will be exposed to the virus eventually, because all the populations are interconnected."
2020-03-08 4:11,"They can't eliminate it. It will always get reintroduced from abroad. World wide quarantine is not possible. They can go to extremes and tamp it down but never eliminate it. So every time they think they can let up, as soon as they do, it will reemerge. The only people who won't get it are those that have already had it, and maybe even some of those will.  

Some times the news is bad and there is nothing our fearless leaders can do. Not that we didn't know that already. I don't know about you but I have no confidence in most national leaders, the dictators Xi and Trump the least of all. Seems like they really are just working opinion rather than acting functionally.

Technically I would expect China not to tell the truth about the numbers. Here in the US the numbers are down because Trump suppresses test availability. All dictators act like that."
2020-03-08 4:38,"The lockdown in China is unprecedented and fact of the matter is, if people are isolated, the disease cannot spread. You can doubt the numbers all you want, but science does not lie.

The real question is if the cases will increase again when the lockdown is eased."
2020-03-08 7:56,"When we talk about lives saved, we also need to think about at whose cost? People in Wuhan die because of the lockdown due to their lack of access to medical help. Had the city remained open, could more people be saved? Why mortality rate in Wuhan is so much higher than that in other cities is because there’s not enough hospital beds and doctors to treat the sick in Wuhan. Of course there’s the risk of people getting infected by those who leave Wuhan, but how many? I guess these are the questions we need to ask and think about. It’s easy for those who are not in lockdown to say that the government did the right thing. Don’t people in forced lockdown have a right to live too?"
2020-03-08 4:50,"This is all absurd hysteria.  Essentially, this coronavirus is the equivalent of a moderate or slightly more severe strain of flu, and certainly not a virulent flu like the 1918 Spanish flu.  Flu kills millions each year, and what is happening now is that the world has added another relatively mild disease to the burden.  This is not ebola, it is a disease that may be fatal (but seldom is) only for the elderly or those already in extremely bad health--just like influenza.  The chances of this duplicating the same death toll as caused by common influenza annually are slim, and even if that happens it should hardly present dire consequences.  A rational government policy would be for healthy people to avoid contact the elderly and the infirm as they are the only ones really in danger.  Otherwise, continue pretty much as normal.

The truly infectious disease here is hysteria, and that is spreading out of control."
2020-03-08 12:27,"This epidemic, being a once in one hundred year occurrence, is an extraordinary challenge to epidemiologists, economists, and policy makers alike.    In the present global context there is virtually no precedent in modern times.  The global economy and fluid movements of people across the globe didn’t exist to the same extent one hundred years ago as today.

On the one extreme end of response (China, e.g.) a lockdown could so cripple an economy that the ability to continue to respond to the outbreak could be hampered. Consequent declining economic circumstances has its own adverse health and social effects.  On the other hand, it’s relatively certain that doing nothing would be a health disaster with certain but “unknown known” long-term consequences.

The public health community along with economists and other social scientists need to closely look at how different countries are responding and assess the relative beneficial/adverse effects of different policy actions.

With the population of the world that is 6 times that at the time of the 1918 flu pandemic, and growing rapidly, it is almost certain that more zoonotic infections that reach epidemic proportions will occur in the coming years.  Each outbreak will involve viruses with unique patterns of infectivity and virulence.

We must take this moment to learn as much as we can about the dynamics of this epidemic so we don’t bungle future responses.  It will happen again."
2020-03-08 12:30,"China's strategy may be taking the notion of 'cutting off one's nose to spite one's face' maybe a bit too far as it implements the notion of 'cutting off one's head' to achieve a much broader result, though this broader result has seemingly been achieved by implementing the extreme initiatives of  population containment by locking down whole populations within some provinces 'in place' and implementing measures to restrict travel to hundreds of millions of its citizens and foriegners. 

With the results they've seen thus far are so convincing they appear to warrant their implementing such extreme measures, especially in light of them publicly admitting they were initially guilty of a rather lackadaisical response when first confronted with the burgeoning virus."
2020-03-08 12:35,"Ms Qin asks a very important question that may be answerable using available data: ""Will the virus flare again when children return to classrooms and workers to factories, and commuters start taking buses and subways.""  The answer depends on how long an infected person remains contagious, and how long do they remain contagious after they test negative. I assume that as testing becomes more extensive and routine, the answers will emerge out of data on large populations which is more reliable than control tests performed in ICUs and labs. I expect that an infected person will retain a viral load until he/she has been treated with an antiviral. It is reasonable to expect that a person will become non contagious once the person tests negative.  So, the Chinese approach to control the spread of the disease seems to be effective, since both the antiviral and test kits are expected to be available over the next few months."
2020-03-08 12:47,"Of course quarantines work to contain the spread of contagious diseases, if properly implemented.  Which partly relates to government action, but also compliance of individuals.  It is the society working together, not only the government.

Anyway, the Chinese government shouldn't be too eager to claim credit for containment.  The contagion began in the first place due to the poor food sanitation practices in their markets, plus suppression of information in the early days of the plague."
2020-03-08 12:53,"This disease is not containable, it’s wishful thinking to think otherwise. Maybe it could have been right at the start but not now and the measures being taken to contain it are having a catastrophic affect on local, national and the global economy and that is going to wreak far more havoc than the disease ever could. Time to rethink our approach, too late to build fences."
2020-03-08 12:57,"Their response to the virus is draconian by all accounts yes, but necessary. What good is civil liberties if half the population is infected? In times of war and social unrest, democracies will impose martial law, curfews, and incarcerate citizens who look like the enemy to protect the country. The Chinese leadership is treating COV-19 as a threat to the lives of its people and to the social order and pulling all stops to contain it.  It's draconian to us because our leaders aren't taking this threat seriously and treating it as another case of the season flu."
2020-03-08 13:01,"It's a trade off.  You could quarantine a country  -- and stop a communicable disease that spreads human to human -- that action could shut it down entirely, at least until it returns.

But the economic cost would be huge.  In a huge capitalist state like US, damage would be huge.  Let's say we quarantined for 1 month, that would inflict damage of greater than 8% of the economy.  Why?  Well, during one month many large tech companies may be able to continue doing whatever they do, but many small businesses would go bankrupt and millions might lose jobs.  Those businesses and jobs wouldn't come back immediately.  The travel industry - already reeling -- would crater.  Even an a high tech giant like apple would be battered if no one could go to their stores and they couldn't get components from overseas.

So, then the question becomes -- would less draconian measures work almost as well?  That takes some analysis, but,  if the transmission and mortality rates are not much worse than a bad flu season and if the virus isn't an aerosol but one that requires close exposure to an infected person, then self quarantining of sick, people, social distancing, travel restrictions, handwashing might prove as effective as a quarantine -- and both approaches would face the possibility of the return of the virus.  Obviously, we don't have the answers to most of these key questions, but I think we need to think things through before we take panicky actions."
2020-03-08 13:09,"For decades, the CDC, UN, and WHO have warned repeatedly that one of the great challenges facing us is pandemics. They've urged us to practice a higher level of preparedness, invest in healthcare,and take preventative measures like eradicating poverty and hunger, two potent vectors when it comes to spreading disease. 

With malice --grounded in greed-- aforethought, we've done none of those things. What? Did people really think we were going to get away with it? I was one of many to raise the alarm when DJT savaged the funding for all of the organizations I listed. This was a disaster in the making but it's akin to the image I've invoked repeatedly in this presidency: If we are the damsel in distress on the tracks, the train bearing down on us is going one mile an hour and we aren't even tied. Move.

We've lost all sense of self-preservation. Having refused to do the logical things in the moment, we will, like China, now have to pay an enormous, catastrophic price to clean up and contain. Pandemics always wreak economic havoc because 
 quarantine is the only sure way to contain them. You cannot do a ""little"" quarantine here and there; that's not how it works. And if in doubt, do it earlier rather than later. The point is to contain spread *before it starts* not when it's raging. Ultimately, it was the only thing that helped stop the spread in 1918. China did the right thing. Will we?

We are an obstinate species that refuses to learn. That stubbornness is becoming deadly."
2020-03-08 13:26,"The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Chinese approach seems to be working in a huge society that was particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus. If the WHO estimate of the fatality rate of 3.5% proves correct (and it's being borne out in China and Italy) then China was facing a death rate running into the millions had the virus spread uncontrolled across their population of 1.4 billion. All the petty carping and hair splitting collapses in the face of this potential exposure. 

The Italian government now seem to be following the same route and inevitably it's producing the same grumbling but their extreme actions are justified in order to protect the physical safety of their citizens. It's very much a case of history repeating itself. A few months ago I read a book titled Florence under siege; surviving the plague in an early modern city about the isolation of Florence and other Italian cities during a 17th century plague. 

And it's not as if we are not using the same isolation tactics on a much smaller scale here in the US which we have the luxury of doing because our outbreaks are much smaller. Let's hope it stays that way and despite the blundering and mixed messaging of the administration the American healthcare structure and medical bureaucracy at federal and state level is probably robust enough to deal with this."
2020-03-08 13:38,"When SARS was contained, the foundation work to continue research into this type of corona virus all but ceased. When there is no sense of emergency, more current""deadly"" diseases take center stage. Given that this is a zoonotic and novel virus, I think it will continue to be aggressive and may eventually just become another seasonal pathogen in our lives. Efforts for containment will help prevent a percentage of the population from getting it, but until a decent vaccine can be proved to work, it very well may be the ""great equalizer""-the elderly who are kept artificially alive by modern medicine will be more prone to fatalities. The possible antibody dependent enhancement aspect of the virus may be its MO, and it may be that past exposure to similar viruses could be a severity factor.  

No one wants to get a bad cold, yet there are always bugs floating around, everywhere we go. Yes, this one is different, and part of the fear is that it is just that. The vulnerable are continually at risk, and this one adds yet another element. But eventually we have to realize that it may be here to stay. The darn thing probably doesn't even know what direction it will take, but it's showing signs of wanting to co-exist, big time.

We should be vigilant, but to be overly so can bite us. We have to remember that in order to be scientifically proactive, we need to have a decent economy. A hard scale to balance indeed. 

If you want to protect the vulnerable, do what you feel is necessary."
2020-03-08 13:52,The effort will fail because a virus is invisible unless it is placed under microscope. It is already too late.Protect the vulnerable and move on.
2020-03-08 13:53,"What is yet to be answered is what happens when China and other countries attempt to return to normalcy. When do you make that call? Do you have to go at least 2 weeks without a new confirmed case? Since they suspect that many cases are going undetected with most being mild or asymptomatic what happens if there are new flareups? At some point we are going to have to let this thing run its course without extreme measures. There is so much still not known about it. There are experts contending  that summer will not cause the end of it like with the flu.

I know people do not like to hear this and I certainly am not advocating for death but we keep trying to beat nature and if we have proven anything is that we are horrible at it. We want to have everything, change everything, have massive population growth and expect that the planet will simply keep on operating as it has for hundreds of thousands of years. Amazing that it has only taken us a little under 200 years to completely prove that hypothesis wrong.

Nature has it's own way of cleaning things up and it always wins. Instead of functioning with nature we keep trying to beat it. Ultimately we will lose. The question is if by losing we become extinct as a species."
2020-03-08 14:09,"Treat it like the common flu. IF you are elderly or have an underlying condition then yes as hard as it may sound you may need take more extreme precautions to avoid this thing. If you are young  and fit go about your daily lives but know this is in the community and take additional measure (washing and sanitizing) that you might anyway do after riding the subway and know that if you contract this you'll almost certainly recover. 

Panicking and Locking communities down might stay on top of it for a while but it will flare back up the minute one person brings it back. 

Let it run its course. There is no other sensible option. Hopefully it will go away of its own volition with the changing seasons."
2020-03-08 14:17,"I was very impressed when China quickly built new hospitals to quarantine patients, within just a few days. But then last week the building collapsed. So who knows how well they’re doing."
2020-03-08 14:43,"It seems that following China’s example for fighting the spread of this virus has for the most part been dismissed by Americans. Must people believe the fact that Chinese mishandled their response to the virus in the first few weeks is enough to entirely disregard their current containment protocol—but this is now a global emergency—and like it or not, who has more experience with this Coronavirus than the Chinese?Another argument I’ve heard is that since viruses are invisible the Chinese can’t possibly claim they have contained Covid-19—but data based on millions—not a few hundred—test results (if reliable) indicates that viral transmission in China has indeed slowed. What America needs right now is time—time to respond more effectively to what is certain to become a devastating health emergency. If following China’s protocol only buys us a few weeks and several hundred lives, it is worth implementing. The lukewarm response Americans are now witnessing is unforgivable when a more aggressive—even Draconian approach—has shown to be successful in China."
2020-03-08 14:49,"After reading numerous comments I keep wondering about the statistics of the emerging epidemic. 

I understand there is still some discussion of what the death rate is for people that are treated in the hospital. The reported range is about 0.5 - 3 percent.

Moreover, for most of those that become ill, the illness is mild. This concerns about 80% of those affected.

Because of the high survival, the disease would according to some be mild.

The other 20% becomes seriously ill and requires hospitalization. How much care (time in hospital, money) is required so that a patient survives?

Many people (40%?) cannot afford health care insurance or a few days off from work. Medical bills are the major cause of bankruptcy. So even if people recover, they may still be seriously affected moneywise. Moreover, many businesses, large and small, with many workers, may also be affected.

Note that the government could help with financial assistance, such as loans and credits. How much would that cost?"
2020-03-08 14:49,"Have we lost all sense of proportion? The mortality rate for Covid-19 may or may not end up being higher than the seasonal flu. More time is needed to calculate the final statistics.

In the meantime, the seasonal flu infects tens of millions of humans every year and at least 1% of them die. That's a lot of people dying from the flu. If we really want to protect everyone, the entirety of humanity should hibernate like bears for four or five months out of the year.

Is anyone suggesting banning all human contact for the duration of the flu season every year? I didn't think so."
2020-03-08 14:53,"Loss of the most basic sense of security, of jobs, with many
business being threatened with running out of cash.  Hopefully 
these lock down restrictions are being imposed with an aura of compassion, patience and generosity.  This is how people can 
receive them with the authentic  teaching that that they are temporary necessities given the uncertainty of how devastating
the consequences of less severe restrictions could be in dealing
with this crisis."

As a doc, first the facts about epidemics:
- Social distancing decreases human to human virus transmission
- 2% or even 1%dead are a lot of dead, if it happens quickly. Life is fatal but not all at once.
- it's not just about the dead but also how easily transmitted and how sick. Many severely ill at once cannot be managed.

- While infection can't always be  stopped, buying time is critical. Vaccines don't happen overnight.
- Data helps. Funny how we worry about Chinese data but can't or won't collect our own.

China's measures are hard for Americans to fathom, because *we* can't survive them. We lack the safety net, infrastructure, community and access to health care to even make a real go at containment and mitigation. We really can't afford it. It's what many Americans face all the time. ""I don't know how much treatment would help, but the cost will ruin me"". Many can't even afford a sick day. For America, the cure would kill us, so we have no choice but to bear the full brunt of this epidemic and hope for the best. To take it on the chin and pray. God help us."
2020-03-08 14:56,"This might be a test case for a more sustainable economy. What happens if improving our green technology isn't enough, and we need to do less? What would happen to the economy if we took fewer car trips, even in our electric cars? What if we had to take at most of our vacations somewhere nearby instead of flying off to the other side of the world? 

The parallels aren't perfect. We'd still go to movies, sporting events and other social gatherings, and we'd still eat out as often as we did before the virus. Supply chains would still operate, although hopefully  many of them would be shorter. But the effect on the transportation sector is a bellwether; when we live more sustainable, it will take a hit.

When we do become sustainable, unless we find endless free energy, we will have to slow down, and figure out how to do so without tanking the economy."
2020-03-08 14:57,"Has anyone asked why the mortality rate for Covid-19 currently is estimated as more than the seasonal flu? Perhaps it is because Covid-19 patients are being hospitalized in places where they are exposed to other contagions, whereas people with the flu typically recuperate at home.

How about this: Why not just have people recover from Covid-19 at home, just as they do with the flu? That way they are not exposed to germ-filled environments such as hospitals. I bet the mortality rate for Covid-19 would go down. Has anyone suggested this to the World Health Organization?"
2020-03-08 15:01,"China may be experiencing pain but the fact is that it is achieving control of the epidemic and has shown the way for the rest of the world. Chinese economy may be in a standstill now but when the rest of the world will be battling and going into standstill, it will be first off the block into the recovery phase."
2020-03-08 15:01,"Little mention of group immunity after recovery, in part because data is probably scant. If enough people develop immunity post Covid-19, it should slow the rate of infection and increase the rate of recovery. Then hopefully we will have a functional vaccine that people actually get rather than subscribe to a fantasy. I am not a scientist but the history of epidemics has this trajectory. 

However, with the U.S. lack of testing, we will not know the rate of infection. There is an antibody test which again no one mentions. More on this please."
2020-03-08 15:03,"China's number are hard to believe. Beijing is around 400 cases, hardly increasing for weeks. Everywhere else, a few hundred cases are enough to spawn new cases at light speed. 

Even if it's true that the outbreak is contained within Hubei, such measures won't happen in the US.   

Eventually, we will have millions of cases, actually most of the population. Of course, this includes the mild and asymptomatic that will never be counted."
2020-03-08 15:09,"China took the right measures to contain the
virus. Specific numbers may not be accurate
but the trend is down. Imagine if Chinese from
Hubei province were allowed to move around
in China and the tourists allowed to travel,
as they do in millions, the number of cases
would have been in millions. USA itself would
have not 400 cases but 40,000 as many
Chinese tourists come here and the shortage 
of test kits would not have allowed the tests
of all the tourists coming here in millions.
Sometime harsh measures are just that-harsh-but have to be taken. The most important
harsh measure China can take is to ban the
the market in wild animals. Chinese need to
change their food preferences."
2020-03-08 15:12,"One can see many advantages with what China has done – even if they can’t really eradicate the virus.  First, they’ve bought themselves time, which they seem to have used effectively to prepare for further spread, like ramping up testing and expanding hospital beds.  Second, it will shortly take the international focus away from them – they will no longer be the front-runner for the number of infected.  Finally, they will have bragging rights – abroad and, most importantly, at home.  I suspect they haven’t wasted their time in other endeavours as well, such as working on vaccines and anti-virals.  Yes, the cost to China may seem high for now – but in the end, it’s an investment that might pay handsome dividends once the dust settles."
2020-03-08 15:21,"We are facing a worse-case scenario in several ways:

Hard to detect? Check. Some cases are mild, and it appears that people are contagious before they show symptoms.

Easily transmissible: Check. Apparently it is transmitted more easily than influenza or rhinoviruses.

Deadly: Not so fast. The death rate is high by so-called normal standards, and this a tragedy, but it could be far worse. The next pandemic could be 10 or 20 percent fatal. What do we do then? We had our chance with MERS and SARS but we didn't figure it out then, so we're learning (or not) now.

My bet is that the future of this virus will track influenza: either we'll figure out how to beat both, or we'll have to live with both. 

Alternatively, this one could rage through the population then fizzle out when it fails to evolve like seasonal influenza. 

Some day we might learn how to stop them in their tracks but we aren't there yet."
2020-03-08 15:46,"On Tuesday I returned home from a first-line hospital in my city and while there I witnessed an institution woefully unprepared for Coronavirus. The hospital was overwhelmed—shoulder to shoulder in the ER, most every hospital room filled. Just a simple call for transport meant waiting hours. Housekeeping did only a cursory job of sanitizing the room. It took five hours for a routine test in radiology to be completed. Nursing staff were always kind, but obviously frazzled. All this before a single case of Coronavirus had been confirmed in my state. Curious, I asked a member of hospital staff if there had been any special training for or preparations made for a Coronavirus outbreak and he said he thought there might have been an email. If I wasn’t worried before, I am now. I can’t help but be concerned about how an already overly-taxed health care system in Oklahoma will effectively deal with this deadly pandemic."
2020-03-08 15:48,"If the coronavirus did not come along, something else would have happened at some point. The next event could start somewhere else.

The weakness that was exposed not only has to do with how China governs itself. It showed how brittle the global systems are to natural but unexpected threats. It also showed that some Western countries had become COMPLACENT in how they run themselves.

The plans of MBAs are often made in a vacuum. They make assumptions about what tolerances the model can handle without ever stepping outside of their offices. With the ever growing pressures for profitability, the tolerances have become paper thin.

ANY disruption causes problems but the people at HQ are NOT the ones that have to deal with the consequences. The lack of input from the field is why this keeps happening (yes, the coronavirus thing is only the most recent and largest disruption but it is far from the only one in the past decade).

And, like the risk analyses that failed in 2008 due to hidden flaws in the markets, this event exposes the issues in the global markets OUTSIDE the financial system. This is a stress test of both it and each country's governance. IMHO, some have failed already even if they don't want to admit it."
2020-03-08 15:54,"China approach may seem too radical and drastic, but we need to remember that the goal is not to bring the number of infected people down to zero but to slow down the spreading of the disease. It’s a math problem with even the best health care systems unable to provide for treatment and beds if everybody gets infected at the same time. In the north of Italy that’s precisely the challenge right now, to provide treatment for everybody in need at the same time. Hospitals, which are some of the best in the world, are running out of beds and are considering moving patients to other regions in Italy where the virus has not spread yet. Isolation and widespread testing has proven to be so far the most efficient way to contain the virus while we buy time to find a vaccine. I am worried by the lack of both measures in NYC right now. Talks keep focusing on the consequences on the market, instead of the consequences on people’ lives basically admitting that the economy is what is driving every political decision at the moment. On top of being ethically questionable, this approach seems to forget that if an epidemic crisis had to occur in a city like NY the consequences of inaction would be far greater then drastic preventive actions not only on people lives but on the economy as well."

The Virus is threat to all of us.  China’s actions helped us all.  It slowed the movement of the Virus.  And gave many nations time to prepare.

2020-03-08 13:04,"The belated Chinese action to contain the Covid-19 spread though commendable and worth emulating by others if, really true, yet the same could have sounded more convincing if not preceded by a deliberately spread shroud of secrecy, denial, and inaction.But, better late than never. As the Covid-19 is expanding its footprint across countries and the world is coming to terms with the disease through a combative strategy of preventive and curative efforts, the instinctive reaction of the governments and leaders still remains identical to that of the Chinese authorities I. e. Of studied denial or slow action with a boast of being in full control of the situation though reality might be different. The kind of concerted global effort is required is either missing or lost in the din of pseudo nationalistic clamor and the xenophobic nativist outbirsts."
2020-03-08 16:08,"Scientists have been warning about coming pandemics for a long time. Human patterns of land use change, deforestation, road building, mining, and agricultural intensification are pushing into dwindling wildlife habitat, increasing chances of human infection. Peter Daszak, a zoologist who studies the connections between human and wildlife health, said that “It’s our everyday way of going about business on the planet that seems to be driving this.” In response to the Coronavirus, China, (officially, at least for now) banned the trade of wild animals as food, but not for ""medicinal use.” The use of animal products in Chinese traditional medicine is driving a surge in illegal trafficking of wildlife. The growing use of threatened species in traditional Chinese medicines has accounted for more than three-quarters of the trade in endangered wildlife products in Hong Kong over the past 5 years. Last year, record volumes of pangolin scales, rhino horns, and tiger parts, were seized by authorities in Hong Kong. As long as China encourages and promotes traditional medicine using animal parts from threatened and endangered animals, the illegal wildlife trade will flourish. The Chinese people need to start questioning and raising awareness about these practices to a much greater degree, and move toward more effective and sustainable and effective ""cures"" and products. Herbal products are highly effective, and they do not cause viral pandemics."
2020-03-08 16:16,Considering the CCP history of tightly controlled news dissemination we are likely getting an opaque view of what is happening in China. The main goal of Chinese leaders is to maintain total control first and foremost. They have covered up the death of millions in the past to do so.

We need to do stop pointing out how this only affects the old... We all know old people. We need to quarantine in order to not over burden our hospitals plain and simple.
2020-03-08 13:04,"Well, here we can already see that politics trump (No pun intended) health here in the USA. I'm not just referring to what we have seen this week in domestic news. More specifically I am referring to the fact that people that have been in China and Iran have to be quarantined, but not people coming from Italy and South Korea. Why not? The answer most likely is that the last 2 countries are our ""friends"" and ""allies"", while the Iran and China are not. That's how it is now in our country. Pretty sobering."

I understand that it is important for us to have visualizations of the work the doctors are doing on the front lines. But even covered up, the patient’s face is visible, and she is clearly very ill. How is this not a violation of her privacy? She does not look in a state to have given permission for this photo to be used. I would be deeply upset if this were me or someone I knew."

Yes it is “we” and not the trump administration, or the Chinese government, or Iran, or any other institutions that are often the subject of criticism in the NYTimes. It is not the time to highlight the differences in ideology or to advance any political agenda. Life itself is on the line. Are we fighting the virus or each other?"

2020-03-08 13:50,"For a country this size with the number of international travelers and the known duration of the disease the number of cases is vanishingly small- as are the number of deaths- except in the Seattle area- which is a public health catastrophe thanks to the Seattle city council and inept Governor.
  Why we don’t have numbers like Italy has nothing to do with testing and everything to do with common sense measures taken by this administration, namely restrictions on travel from China that were objected to as racist by Trump’s political opponents.
We are seeing drips and drabs of new cases- nothing consistent with the apocalyptic whining of the media or politicians with an axe to grind."
2020-03-08 15:47,"Every day I show the map of the US virus cases to my 8th graders. We are keeping score so to speak. Every day the numbers are going up. It is mandatory viewing in my class. 
I hope every teacher is using this resource and keeping their students abreast of the situation. 
There is a ""hygiene rap"" video if any teacher needs to show it on YouTube. It has a ""catchy"" rhythm to it. 
Now I am waiting for my school district to communicate with the parents. Nothing yet. 
Thankfully we are 1:1 laptops, so the students can take them home and we can use Google classroom for all assignments. 
Just in case we go to panic mode and close the schools."
2020-03-08 12:11,"Does anybody else think that there's a kind of hysteria going around about this? I don't mean to take Trump's line, because I think his administration has buried its head in the sand: we have no testing kits with a month-and-half lead. We also have not tried any of the many drugs we have that combat viruses in that same time. But shutting down whole cities and regions?

Let me put it this way: if we had the media acting as a speaking clock every day saying: in your state there were 10,000 cases of the flu suspected and 1000 confirmed, with 10 deaths (this understates the number, I think), wouldn't we all be very alarmed? But it's about that, if not more. I don't know the figures for this year, but 10,000 plus will die of the flu this year in the US alone. We just don't do this, because it would spread panic.

Think of the deaths worldwide of COVID-19 to date. They're a tiny fraction of the population.

We should be taking all necessary precautions (as we should with the flu each season). Panic serves us poorly. And don't quote mortality percentages for this virus as a reproach: we don't know how many people (countless hundreds of thousands, I would guess) who come down with mild cases or subclinical cases that go entirely unreported."
2020-03-08 12:24,"All the most supported comments argue for more state surveillance and state collection of personal data.

Italy -to its credit- is following China's model.

However, we are offered bumbling incoherent responses and non-actions by an incompetent Administration. Where is our 'exceptionalism' now?"
2020-03-08 14:29,"In the mean time, the US is completing an ""experiment"" that is in direct opposition to China and most of the rest of the developed world.  
We are testing an extremely limited pool of individuals so that the reported numbers can remain low.   We even left a cruise ship stranded off shore so that those infection figures are not added to the total.
When a state governor such as Inslee takes action to control the outbreak our POTUS tries to undermine his efforts by calling him a snake.
Millions of Faux News viewers are being told that it is a democratic hoax to take down Trump and the latest medal of freedom winner, Rush Limbaugh, calls it the common cold.
It will be interesting to see how the US experiment turns out.  The American Hospital Association is currently estimating 480,000 US deaths from COVID-19.  There were 34,000 flue deaths in 2019."
2020-03-08 15:53,"China can't get a break, at least from the West. First they were criticized because they did too little. Now criticized because they are doing too much.

A virologist in Taiwan claims that his genome sequence of the virus can't find a Chinese origin. If he's right, then the virus came into China from a traveler either from China who was returning home or from a foreigner visiting China.

The real issue is how can all counties work together to address this crisis?

The lesson is not who is doing a better job, but that we are all interconnected. Nature is proving this whether we want to hear it or not."
2020-03-08 4:56,"It seems quite cynical to me that the author has been criticizing the Chinese has been doing too little and too slow and now too much and too costly. You just can’t have it both ways. For all the extra time for the rest of the world to be prepared, we all but waste them entirely. If you look at the speed and quantity of the new cases, the entire world will be facing a very similar situation as China did two months ago. Surely the transparency is much better, but transparency along isn’t going to matter at all if no proportionate actions are being taken. If anything can be learned from China’s draconian while effective measures to combat the disease, learn it. At the end of the day, the virus will not go gentle on us."
2020-03-08 8:33,"Ok, let's do an experiment: Unleash the power of the magic marketplace to confront the coronavirus epidemic.  Then let's compare the results.

2020-03-08 14:24,"As one of top healthcare officials in Chinese government said, ""in the beginning they fear us, and now we fear them.""  As new Covid-19 patients down to double digits in Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, there is zero occurring in the rest of China.  Only the infected patients coming back from out of China.

And Italian government just passed the law to quarantine 16 millions people in norther Italy including several famous cities.  They followed the WHO recommendation that China set a good example to control and contain the virus spreading. Exceptional times require exceptional or draconian measures to stop the virus.

Just read news from HK, as we withdraw our troops from Middle East, China is sending an expert team composed of Coronavirus experts with medical supplies to visit Iraq helping them to combat Covid-19.  No doubt that it will attract attention and appreciation from Iraqi people.  We should do the same."
2020-03-08 14:33,"I’m appalled at the way the New York Times (and the mass media in general) is pandering to the wildly out of context fear and obsession surrounding coronavirus, which it has largely CREATED. The actual number of cases are minute when compared with seasonal flu, or other viruses. The recovery rate is extremely high. The media is contributing to a pandemic panic which is completely detached from reality. 
 The coverage is infinitely worse than the disease."
2020-03-08 16:03,"The virus does not have to be ""completely eliminated."" It only needs to be suppressed for about a year, until a vaccine is deployed. At present, ~30 people per day are dying in China. If the Chinese can keep the death rate down to that level, that will be about 15,000 deaths in all.

In contrast, in a briefing of Epidemiology Estimates By US Hospitals Association, Dr. James Lawler, professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center gave his “best guess” estimates of how much the virus might spread in the US, as follows:

•4.8 million hospitalizations associated with the novel coronavirus

•96 million cases overall in the US...

•480,000 deaths

This is what will happen if the U.S. does not quickly implement the kinds of measures China and Italy have implemented."

2020-03-08 14:45,"Being entirely dependent upon China for the vast majority of our supply chain has proven to be a major national security, economic and public health issue.  Corona virus has not caused a ""backlash"" against globalization as the article's author clumsily pontificated.  Rather, the current events surrounding the precarious state of such a globalist economic system has raised valuable and opportune questions about how much a nation can depend upon other nations for it supplies and remain safe during times of crisis.  If China faces utter destruction, the United States need not die with her.  Globalists like Bill Gates, Bloomberg and Soros have billions of reasons to keep such an system intact notwithstanding the threat it poses to the lives of Americans. And the liberal mass media will mainly defend the corporate interests of the corporations who own, operate and set the agenda for them.  But if you can put aside your corporate interests and consider the lives of Americans as worthy of protecting, you might at least be willing to poke holes in your own high subjective claims about globalism."
2020-03-08 14:51,Exactly. China should listen to this article and put the economy in front of saving human lives. That surely will stop Western media from criticizing it.

In the meanwhile, let’s acknowledge that a country that refuses to even characterize the problem is off to a dangerous start. We need widespread and continuous testing right now."
2020-03-08 12:36,"Based on my understanding of virus outbreaks I share Mr. Osterholm’s implied view that China is merely using its martial might to suspend the outbreak. Until a virus works through a population which then develops antibodies to resist it the Sword of Damocles remains suspended. (Or until the April warmth, according to our national “leader”.)"
2020-03-08 14:28,"I do not see any role model out there in dealing with the virus. 
Not in China, not in Italy, Korea or elsewhere. 

So, how to deal with a pandemic in the future?

I have a plan:

What about investing more money in defense of our health (science!) than in military defense? 

What about all our brilliant minds from Harvard and Stanford who just “follow the money” and rather start the 17th delivery app or work in “finance” (finance as in Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs) - to create wealth just for themselves but for no one else? 

Imagine if - let’s say - just every fourth Silicon Valley company would dedicate itself not to app development (“organic dog food now delivered right at your door step!”) but to fight global diseases and cancer?

What about raising the level of generell health education? 

It’s time to move from a just reacting symptoms fighting health system to address the underlying causes."

2020-03-08 15:03,"More than any other form of media, I depend on the frequently updated NYT maps for insight into the spread of Covid-19.  But the maps are deceptive.  Minnesota, for example, is completely filled in giving the erroneous impression that a large section of the upper-midwest is doomed.  In fact, there is only one confirmed case in Mn.

A better way of presenting the data would be to use a ""heat map"", in which the frequency of cases is indicated by the shade of a color (on a log scale; darker indicates more cases).  To avoid the spatial ambiguity caused by the largeness of  Western states, the entire country should be broken down into relatively small equal-sized hexagons (e.g. 100 km on a side).  Thus, Mn would show one very pale hexagon centered on Minneapolis and the rest of the state would be white indicating absence - a much more accurate portrayal of the state of the epidemic.

If we're going to beat this, we need to focus on effective communication - data presentation is important!"

The only sincere point of any contention in China's containment policy is, must it remain until vaccines are developed, then everyone vaccinated? Or, is a slowing spread-- without vaccines, an all clear for resuming normal activity? 

The US alternative, until very recently, seemed an actuarial game. With only the elderly and or immune compromised at greatest risk, i.e. those that are already a HC expense (harsh truth).

In the event of vaccine, who gets it first? If The US develops first, will those most vital or susceptible be first? I suppose if China develops first Chinese will be first. Is a nasty scenario possible? Is fostering hate and phobias over climate fraud and or other paranoia a good idea?"

We have only just begun to see the destruction this will cause, and for other countries to adopt such draconian measures is absurd. The best way to protect a country from this is to give the people masks, hand sanitiser and make sure hospitals are prepared for an influx of patients. Hopefully the western world will realise that having anti-viral medications be produced 80% in China wasn't such a great idea and we will once again return to national reliance and end globalism."

It is this no surprise at all that the mortality rate in China is off the charts.

As for the accuracy of Chinese statistics: it was only two weeks ago (February 23) that President for Life Xi told a special gathering of the Communist party that the coronavirus epidemic was “a crisis and a big test” for the country. I visited the Chinese media’s official website (link below) which carried a report on the speech, and translated the text from Chinese into English. Xi used such words as “grim,” “complex’” “ordeal,” “critical,” “crushed.” And then there is “bite the bullet."" 

Anyone who has studied communist party political phraseology and vocabulary will know that such language is meant to communicate a dire situation inside the country, far more serious than that which Chinese media and spokesman are portraying publicly.  And now that China has shifted rhetorical gears, I'd submit -- if the past is any guide -- that the situation in the country is WORSE than it was two weeks ago.

2) Denying reality
3) Worrying about re-election
4) Firing top staff
5) DNA testing immigrants / not testing for the virus
6) Making sure the stock market is happy

In the age of digital media, however, the powers that be in each country don't have to manhandle its people, they can be firm, but kind, and do the same thing.  Italy, sadly will have to go into a similar type of quarantine that Wuhan, and Hubei province underwent.  We have family in Europe, and have spent many wonderful days in Italy, but not in the area of the outbreak recently.

I have Chinese friends, who have family over in China, so am getting a more updated view of how they see this play out over there.  Their leader Xi Jinping, does care about his people, but his fears of the religious Uighurs, and his fear of the whole truth about the virus, because he knew how dangerous a serious virus can be in a dense, and populous place like China, made him blunder.

Fortunately, doctors and researchers across the country are distributing factual information. The states are stepping in, but if all people listen to is FOX news, they remain uninformed.

When corona first exploded onto the scene in January, any competent leader would have concluded that the virus would eventually work its way here and began the process of acquiring and distributing test kits. But Trump lives in an alternate reality, his only concern is reelection and continued looting. He seems to believe he can bully anything and anyone into submission. Sadly, it's worked for gutless republican senators and his brain dead supporters.

In the past, America has enjoyed great leaders such as Pres Eisenhower who would have managed the virus as effectively as he managed WW II. In sharp contrast, we suffer a bumbling narcissist whose mental problems preclude listening to facts he doesn't like or fit his distorted reality."

2020-03-08 3:58,"Nobody has any idea if China stopped the virus and one thing is for sure their official numbers are not to be trusted.  It’s amazing when a free press that can’t operate freely in China because of press restrictions and people on the ground know that telling the truth to the nytimes could lead to jail time for them and their family, report the official Chinese governments numbers because there are no other numbers to report.  

All the videos on Social Media of people being dragged by force in horror from their apartments in the middle of the night to an unspecified quarantine holding area are being characterized as “bold” measures taken by China to contain the virus.  When in reality they show how brutal the government treats its people and the rat race they live in where nobody has rights to say anything bad about their corrupt thuggish local to central governments.  

As Western media extols the Chinese containment as a success, keep in mind that social media keeps reporting the Body incineration particles in the air over Wuhan are way greater than the death rate China claims.  And it’s doubtful the Chinese count the dead in homes as Coronavirus victims.  

While keeping sick people off the streets can be useful.  Locking people up as if they are criminals is not the answer.

Basically this same thing is what is happening in China right now to the people. The draconian state is controlling the people as if they were the ones in the cages and they are so effective in doing it because they are draconian in their ways. Of course it’s necessary, right? For the good of the people! But what good was the state doing for the people by basically forcing the poorest to sell exotic animals for food under the harshest of conditions? I think you know that answer.

We in the west are certainly no poster-children in this regard. Our factory farms, though more ridged and kept steril through drugs, still treats the animals as non-beings. Their (animals) only purpose is to serve us and it is our greed for more of everything that is causing these problems world wide.

There is no fighting, looting, or burning going on which usually happen in places where people enjoy too much freedom after a natural disaster, an election of an unpopular president, an undesirable court verdict, or a loss (or win) of a ball game.

2020-03-08 15:29,"Amy,

This is disappointing coming from you, someone with roots back to China.

The least you should be able to acknowledge is how effective and efficient China has been in containing the virus, after the initial mis-steps.  It is an effort worth at least highlighting because it bought the world and itself time and reduces the blast radius.  Is it worth it? Absolutely, beyond all price, the fact that you are doubting this is mind boggling.

If the world looks at China via the lens of ‘because it is CCP everything it does must not be worth a praise’ then I think the world has missed a crucial lesson, and will pay a dear price for that.  It probably already is paying such a price.

You do not need to be singing the praise for China, despite your association with it. But at least you can be objective, and not be afraid of your association with it.  There is a price to pay for that.  You know that more than I do.

As soon as these officials were ousted, the country went into action. And by that I mean not just government, but the citizenry.
Another one: ""there is also concern that China’s numbers may be flawed and incomplete."" In scientific terms, it's called ""Sources of error."" Does the reporter realize how difficult it is to get the figures exactly correct when the crisis is still ongoing?

From an ethical perspective, let's hope Xi wakes up to the fact that governing is not about power struggle a la the Cultural Revolution. If he doesn't get the Chinese's heart, he will never be a good leader. His mistake is that he thought he mimicked Mao.

What he found was that they doubled down on their beliefs continually moving the date but always believing that the end of the world was near.
This reminds me of the New York Times comments. People seem to be searching for some doomsday scenario.￼￼￼ they claim; the virus can’t be contained, that it’s too little too late, or that there will be other pandemics that will bring us down so everything is futile. ￼ I think the real problem here is pessimism. New York Times readers and commenters in particular are not representative of the American people they are like the Twitter mob a highly select group of elitists.  ￼Probably over educated in some arts program they have taken on the current mandatory mood of pessimism, futility, and natural payback for what they feel we’ve done to the world￼. This is not real this is psychological despondency and they really need to go see a therapist.

The NYTimes published an interview with Bruce Aylward, WHO China Mission Team Leader last week where he clearly stated that he has seen no evidence that the official figures are not accurate. Does the NYTimes have reason to doubt his statement?

Accuracy of numbers is crucial, but casting a shadow of doubt over these official numbers that are so crucial to the gauging of global recovery should not be done without some facts or explanation, based on investigation and reporting.

I don't to post a personal, self-absorbed memoir comment about the outbreak - I've seen a lot of those, and I have to say, they annoy me. Also, Western media tend to treat outbreaks as click bait and entertainment - hey it's the zombie apocalypse (and yes it really has looked that) ! But that's horrible and I hate that as well.

So just the facts :

Sometime in mid-January I knew from reading reports that something was wrong in Wuhan. Zhengzhou is 500 km from Wuhan, in the adjoining province. The most troubling thing was that Spring Festival was coming and everyone travels for that. Also: Zhenzhou is centrally located - travelers going north, south, east, west would be coming through our train stations.

On 1/27 I sent a text on We Chat to my Chinese boss asking where to buy masks. She said not to worry. My taxi driver that day was wearing a mask. After this everyone will be wearing masks.

One day later my Chinese friend said I should be very worried. Wuhan was now on complete lockdown. At that point police were taking our temperature.

We don’t have face masks, hand sanitizers, and even test kits. Today, we said that our infected number is over 400. Do you believe that number? I don’t.

Thursday March 5th, 2020, the spokesperson of the government of Morocco made an official statement about the measures taken by the government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. All gatherings involving one 1,000 participants or more are banned. What struck most Moroccans as strange and illogical was the exception clause. The spokesperson made it clear that there was one exception to these gatherings. It was not Friday congregational prayers as many had expected, but it was what is referred to in Morocco as “moussems”. The ban designed to provide a buffer against the coronavirus outbreak does not cover moussems.
Moussems are traditional festivals for the veneration of long-dead pious men, attracting tens of thousands for days and where people often relieve themselves in the bush. In a typical moussem, the conditions for the spread of a virus like corona are very favorable. What then are the reasons that pushed the government to exclude moussems from the ban? The government spokesperson was asked the question and he replied that the decision was made in collaboration with the ministry of health and that the measures the government is taking are in line with the guidelines and recommendations of the World Health Organization."

2-Despite draconian measures the epidemic continues like wildfire. Millions are dead in their homes. The PLA is burning corpses by the thousand every day. If this is the case, does taking no steps here in the West make any sense? At the very least, we better be preparing for mass body disposal.

What worries me is that people here in the U.S. are too stubborn, spoiled and selfish to comply with such mass-quarantine orders, even if it saves lives. That said, if businesses could somehow be forced to give everyone the time off needed - with pay - so we can stop this virus from spreading, then I think more people would comply.

The paper has already declared the US is in an ""existential systems competition"" with China and the emergence of the disease was too good an opportunity for furthering panicky US propaganda efforts to hammer the Middle Kingdom. Balanced reporting (along with paying attention to what the WHO said about China' efforts) went out the window. 
After several humiliating recent flop sweat infused propaganda campaign losses including those directed against China's new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), it's related ambitious  Belt and Road program and most recently Huawei all failed (76 countries joined the AIIB, and even the UK and Germany refused to ban Huawei etc...) despite reams of negative US media and Washington arm twisting the coronavirus is proving a godsend for US propagandists. So we are treated to endless stories about China's ""heavy handed"" approach which pretty much is what any responsible government does in the face of a pandemic. (See all other countries currently seriously affected and what the US will also have to do if things as they likely will get worse.)
Stop using this global crisis to score cheap geopolitical points. This is not the time or the context."

If it's effects are limited to an an at risk cadre of those in their 60s to 80s with pre existing illness...as the data should know by now, the response should be commensurate with that risk.

The data disclosed so far does not justify the near panic and breathless disclosures disgorged by the media. But neither does the idiot Trump assist by blathering nonsense.

There are many of us who feel this is a greatly overblown threat, exactly based on the data to date. No children at risk...the same elderly cohort at risk as in any flu because of pre existing conditions...the de minimis global spread.

No one is suggesting nothing be done.  Only that which is commensurate with the threat and honesty is the disclosures...not a 24/7 breathless hype...or a brain dead Trumpian expulsion of intestinal gas."
2020-03-08 14:32,"Chinese efforts were excessively heavy handed, putting people with coughs and fever from any reason in concentration camps with little food and water and a single latrine outside, when quarantining communities would have worked.

They did one thing astoundingly right; they forced the virus to become milder faster than normal.   Most viruses become milder over time. Being often dramatically and quickly fatal, easy to catch and forcing groups and communities into quarantine, isn't good for the long term survival of the virus.  In time milder strains evolve and as people get them and become immune the deadly one becomes extinct. This happened when 1918 killer flu turned into common H1N1.

Coronavirus has two strains.  One that kills 7% and seems not to have spread far beyond Wuhan, and one that kills 1-2% and often noone can tell who has it.   It's the latter that has spread worldwide, and that reached the U.S.   Quarantine strategies have stopped more aggressive strains of the virus.  The process of evolving a milder strain that quickly becomes dominant took only a few weeks, and that is very good work.   

Incidentally, the way the U.S. is handling corona virus has given the Chinese reason to call Americans ignorant idiots.   That's the height of shameful.   If I were China, I'd ban Americans and stop doing business with us.  Really!"
2020-03-08 17:33,"I for one believe that a good faith effort is being made across the globe to share case counts and clinical outcomes, foremost by China. Some of preventiv measures taken there are nonstarters in the US and western democracies. However, it is likely that they are having some success, and indeed the new case count has be declining for almost a month. 

At this rate, the epidemic could be over there by April. If one studies the numbers, the resulting proportion of the population ending up being counted as cases in Hubei could end up be < 1%, far smaller than the predicted 40% by epidemic modeling cited by Dr. Lipsitch. The difference may have to do with sub-clinical cases, but presumably the Wuhan numbers  include many mild cases (80%) as well.

The importance of preventive measures should not be diminished by these calculations, however it does provide some perspective. It is a disease to be avoided, especially for vulnerable age groups, and hopefully our experience will help in preventing other infectious disease outbreaks."
2020-03-08 17:36,"it is kind of comical to see so many Americans questioning the validity of the numbers coming out of China, despite the fact that the WHO says they see no signs of fraud on the part of China.  I have been graphing the data from the WHO situation reports for each of the countries with major outbreaks, and after a period of initial chaos, they all settle into clear trends. Except for one country where the data is very chaotic and unreliable.  That country is the USA. Those questioning the validity of China's data would be better served holding their own government to account."
2020-03-08 18:16,"Paranoia about Chinese information aside (and the politically charged commentators aside, sigh), as someone who was in China and got out towards the end of January, my question has always been when will the quarantine end since the coronavirus is not going away. I mean, as experts have claimed, this virus is going to be around for a long time so at what point will things 'go back to normal'? It seems that to lift the strict quarantine before the virus is entirely eliminated would be to admit in some ways that it wasn't necessary in the first place. Which seems like an unlikely thing for the Chinese government to do; that is, to admit that they had overreacted. 

All to say, I think for the quarantine to be lifted than some kind of measurable outcome that was achieved will need to be recognized. I'm really not sure what that could be."
2020-03-08 18:32,"China brought it on themselves, they did the opposite if everything New York is doing. New York is ecstatic when they find a Corona case not because they want Corona virus here but because the only way to halt the spread is find the cases and get them off the street. Then you find the people they may have infected and get them off the street breaking the chain of possible infections. 
  China on the other hand pretended it wasn’t happening, they stopped nothing, every chain of infection spawned a new chain . It’s a common theme of communism , lying and deception. Russians use to read the government newspaper Pravda, by reading the articles and deciphering the real news to be the opposite of what they just read.
  A free press and freedom of speech is very healthy."
2020-03-08 18:37,"A lot of criticisms have poured on China's initial response to the virus in the first two weeks of January. But it has acknowledged the mistake thereafter and taken its fasted and heaviest measures to combat the virus, without hesitation to sacrifice its economy. The first whistle-blower Dr. Li Wenliang has died and now honored as “outstanding person” by the government (sounds ironic). It at least shows the government acknowledges mistakes and take actions to correct when the coronavirus was unknown to the world. Our Wuhan University class of 2004 also made one of the first donations to Dr. Li Wenliang's colleagues and patients in his hospital. 
This mirrors the HHS whistle-blowers on U.S. workers without protective gear assisted coronavirus evacuees in Washington. They were also facing retaliation even when the world has learnt about the virus from China's situation. 

So I repeat until the world shows at least basic sympathy to China's disaster (now the world's) that, ""stop bashing on China and politicizing the coronavirus"". There is even no solid scientific evidence the virus originated from Wuhan (we only know it breaks out in Wuhan). 
Locking down Wuhan has saved millions of others within and outside of China, including my families who live only 50 miles from Wuhan. Stopping China's economy is for the sake of basic human right, that is, to live and be healthy. You still see politics? no, please not!"

Well...it's long past time, but if we do not start mass testing and  imposing quarantines, this is going to get incomprehensibly worse. 

I hope it's perfectly clear to Americans that when we look at the handy map the NYT provides, it is not remotely the real situation. Absent widespread testing, we have no idea how bad it is here. The tragedy is that the attempt to pretend we don't have it as bad as others may ensure that ours becomes worse.

Immunity and recovery will dominate over the susceptible who will pass away. Once the susceptible are gone then we can resume our roaring economy.

While the risk of a global spread of Ebola had been low, the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic and the current COVID-19 are different. The two diseases can be traced to China’s “wet markets” – open-air markets where animals are bought live and then slaughtered on the spot for the customers. 
Until late December 2019, everyone affected by the virus had some link to Wuhan’s Huanan Market. The hygiene there in these huge markets are absolutely deplorable. What’s even worse is the suffering of those poor animals – some of whom are protected species –crammed together in tiny cages waiting to be slaughtered.

Yes, the hurt on China's economy and the world is enormous, but the country has done so to protect its people, contain the virus with all quickest measures, and buy time, more than a month, for the rest world to prepare (though still some are not prepared while watching for weeks). 

What is the purpose of sustaining economy while booming a killing virus? What is the aim of democracy when the majority cannot even know the truth of the threat of COVID19?

If this is going to become a recurring seasonal variation of the flu will this help? Especially since it seems that the young have not become symptomatic infectors but spreaders."
2020-03-08 18:56,"Why such emphasis on an ‘economy’ without considering the components of an economy, primarily product or service, money, and PEOPLE? With significantly fewer people, there would be drastic changes to any economy. 

For historical examples, look at the struggling economies in Europe following WWI and the flu epidemic that wiped out much of the younger population. And how that ended."
2020-03-08 1:59,"As an American who stayed in Shanghai throughout the whole epidemic, I have to say that the epidemic controls since February have been impressive, even if control of the initial outbreak was horribly bungled.  One has to split apart the initial failures, which would be unacceptable in anywhere, with the followup controls, which have many impressive elements:

- Everyone can get a colored QR code (the green/yellow/red codes) which is generated from a combination of travel history, cell phone tower data, contact with infected individuals and trains/planes, and big data.  To reopen a company or go to many restaurants, you need a green code, which 99% of people are getting.  This is pretty Big Brother, but is also the most advanced form of contact tracing I've heard of.

-99% of people on the streets wear masks, and all indoors venues require masks and temperature checks to enter.  There's government distribution of very inexpensive surgical masks every few weeks.  It's only 5 masks every time, but it's something.  3M N95 masks, made in Shanghai, are now available in stores as of a week ago for 20 yuan, which is 1/7 the price of $20 N95 masks I'm seeing on eBay in the US.

-The neighborhood committee volunteers are nowhere as scary as the NYT is making them seem.  They're mostly white-collar office workers who help with finding delivery packages, which are left at the gates, and collect info on folks returning to Shanghai."
2020-03-08 21:02,"Scientists have been warning about coming pandemics for a long time. Human patterns of land use change, deforestation, road building, mining, and agricultural intensification are pushing into dwindling wildlife habitat, increasing chances of human infection. Peter Daszak, a zoologist who studies the connections between human and wildlife health, said that “It’s our everyday way of going about business on the planet that seems to be driving this.” In response to the Coronavirus, China, (officially, at least for now) banned the trade of wild animals as food, but not for ""medicinal use.” The use of animal products in Chinese traditional medicine is driving a surge in illegal trafficking of wildlife. The growing use of threatened species in traditional Chinese medicines has accounted for more than three-quarters of the trade in endangered wildlife products in Hong Kong over the past 5 years. Last year, record volumes of pangolin scales, rhino horns, and tiger parts, were seized by authorities in Hong Kong. As long as China encourages and promotes traditional medicine using animal parts from threatened and endangered animals, the illegal wildlife trade will flourish. The Chinese need to start questioning and raising awareness about these cultural practices to a much greater degree, and move toward more effective and sustainable and effective ""cures"" and products. Herbal products and plants are highly effective, and they do not cause viral pandemics."
2020-03-08 21:52,"China is wasting effort. COVID-19 is a global community disease now. Even if they eliminated every case, the disease would reenter from outside China!

The only countries that have not reported it are generally those lacking the infrastructure to even notice the disease! Do you think Algeria, Nigeria, and Morocco will contain the coronavirus? Do you think India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran will eventually contain it? Please, China is trying to close the barn doors after the horse has left the barn, sired many generations, and run to every corner of the globe."
2020-03-08 22:13,"Reading this and some of the accompanying rabidly anti-China comments, I fear that the US will obstinately refuse to follow in China's footsteps, regardless of how scientifically based or effective they may be,  as that would leave us eating humble pie.

Trump seems to think it'll just go away.

Meanwhile, most Americans are preparing to make Trump go away."
2020-03-08 23:41,Would you rather be ruled by the Chinese communists or by a democracy like the US.  I think most would choose the latter.  We have freedoms that the Chinese will never have under communism.  We have freedom of speech and will not be imprisoned or shot if we misbehave.  We are far from perfect but with all its imperfections people are still coming here legally and illegally.

The Chinese people I have met are lovely and it is a crime they are controlled by the communists.  I really liked this person who invited me but would be so uncomfortable visiting even in healthy times for fear I would unintentionally misbehave and end up behind bars.  When they are granted their freedom, I would happily go.  We have our problems but we also have our freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  These are priceless."
2020-03-08 4:08,"Wouldn't it be nice if the Chinese numbers are accurate? Not just for the people of the world, but for Xi and the CCP. But can we simply accept what the CCP tells about the virus? Do they have any incentive to make themselves look better than they are?

It will be some time, weeks or months, before we know what is going on in China, or with the virus generally."
2020-03-08 11:41,"I’m sorry but we can believe nothing which emanates from the Communist regime in China.

It’s an insidious machine that values government more than its people.

I’ve heard the numbers are not diminishing but increasing at rapid proportions, with estimated that 50-100 million Chinese will become infected by year end. 

In addition, the likelihood of a vaccine being available to the Chinese public is de minimis. 

The virus is going to plague China much more than anyone can imagine.


The Chinese government’s intentionally suppressing the virus’ existence will cost the Country millions of lives - it does not care. 

The author is either gullible and believes the Communists - or may be one herself."
2020-03-08 18:46,"The number of cases in China has not decreased. The number of Chinese Nationals seeking treatment has decrease. As all treatment centers are government run, operated and controlled. Many are now reporting that family and friends who reported to a treatment center have now gone missing. The family does not know if they have been transferred to quarantine centers or have passed away, but they have not been seen since seeking treatment. This has terrified the population to not seek treatment, but rather stay at home. This was reported to me by a Chinese National who lives in Mexicali Mexico who just returned from China. "" Do Not Believe anything the Chinese Government Reports"""
2020-03-08 23:24,We must remember that the China example is of a totalitarian government that lied to its people and the World. These lies gave the virus time to incubate and explode upon the unsuspecting.  First World countries are (mostly) trying to provide up-to-date information and help. But the virus is cunning and will eventually be found in many places in the US.  Lets hope the present US administration gets out of the way of the experts and shuts up.

Two weeks ago I came down with what felt like the flu - cough, fever, dizziness, severe fatigue, etc.

I called my doctor on March 2nd and was sent to the express care clinic, where I was told they were so full they were only taking appointments.  I made one and went back the next day, where I was sent for a flu test and chest x-ray.

The flu test was negative, but the chest x-ray got me a diagnosis of ""acute bronchitis"".  Since then, I have been staying home, calling everyone I can think of to see about getting a coronavirus test.  Friday, March 6th I was told that the few tests that are available have to be used for people who are hospitalized or who have had close contact with a ""lab-confirmed individual"".

How in heck can ANYONE end up as a lab-confirmed individual if there are no tests?  I am still sick, and no one seems to want to know whether I have COVID-19 or not."

Here in MA, for example, our authorities tell us that the risk of the virus is low because all who come from Italy are interviewed and asked to self-quarantine. No word of course, on the community contagions in NY, NH, Seattle and California because, I guess, those Americans do not travel to Massachusetts and their contagions have the courtesy, I suppose, of not infecting anybody in the Bay State.

However be certain that the interest of business will be respected. Under no circumstance should we talk about cancelling the Marathon (the horror!) or deal with overcrowded and unsanitary subways and trains, a staple of Massachusetts... nor asking state agencies and large employers to have office workers work remotely if they can...

All is low risk here, go on spend your money as ignorance is bliss! That is the message we hear."

This type of “ shut-it-down” approach will halt the virus (as much as we can) and allow us to get supplies, better information, and also allow the US the “really” assess what is going on. A month goes by fast—this is the best fix of this current situation. Let’s see if leadership takes this smart approach."

I.e., viruses, almost like entropy, can not be beaten, not by us.  There is no “fighting” it, not in this article's sense.  Might as well stop the panic and fear—it will run its course the human population, as many had throughout biological history, and subside.  The most humane thing we can do is isolate and treat the infected.  Lockdowns and quarantines reflect human fear of other humans, not effective against the virus."
2020-03-08 22:26,"Trump and Pence are useless in this matter.  They should be ignored.  Not one piece of information either of them has put out this week, has been useful, and more often than not, has been just plain inaccurate.

Meanwhile, my students (ages 12-14) are asking the right questions: 
1) If this isn't a big deal, why do we see videos of the Chinese government using trucks with giant water guns to spray down entire streets from top to bottom? 
2) Why have entire countries closed schools for weeks/a month when we've never seen that for the flu? Even if they just have a couple thousand cases (a small number compared to their total populations)
3) If it's in Seattle and CA, why are people still flying from those places to NYC, unchecked? 
3b) how many flights per day land in NYC? 
3c) how many passengers from those flights then take public transportation throughout the city?  
4) why are they still not testing that many people here? 
5) I live with my grandma. Is she gonna be okay? 
6) How many people live in NYC? What's 1-3.5% of that number? (A: another big number.) 

As an American, I am worried that the failure to act by our government will be disastrous for the entire world. As a teacher, I'm proud that my students ask the questions that our government is too cowardly to address publicly."

Also, we are only a few months into scientific research. We have to be concerned with the fact that there is no vaccine, we do not have the luxury of years of research, we do not know if it is biphasic, we do not know if it hides within the body after recovery, we have not pinned down all the existing strains and their impacts. 

Let’s not blame the media for providing real-time updates, and let’s stop deeming them “alarmist propaganda”.

If world leaders had closed borders to and from China for perhaps a few weeks this kind of disaster could have been avoided.

It might have been bad for business for everyone, and no one could tell what the financial cost would have been, but at least your countrymen would risk a lot less by this new virus than now. And it is not like the financial cost would be any less significant now.

Hong Kong's population had been asking it's non-responsive and non-representative government to close borders with China to no avail. But it pains me more to see elected governments worldwide had not seen this danger, even with ample warning signs way back in January.

1918 Flu Pandemic That Killed 50 Million Originated in China, Historians Say

China manages its economy on the cheap as the sources are China’s unregulated livestock industry which is a cesspool of dangerous viruses and bacteria. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

If the coronavirus reaches Africa or large developing countries in south Asia (India, Pakistan, etc.) or in the west Pacific (Indonesia, Philippines, etc.) then it can spread to be a global disaster. This is because these countries do not have the infrastructure to deal with or control coronavirus.

What will China do to compensate the civilized world for:

1. giving the coronavirus to the world that is spreading without any end in sight,
2. its unregulated reckless industries and 
3. its immeasurable vast theft of intellectual property that have taken so much away from the West?"

The simple answers are:

It is not yet a crisis. (though you wouldn't know that by observing mainstream media)

You can't just quarantine 300-million Americans, under any circumstances.  Even when absolutely indicated, telling 300-million people that they can't do this or do that is going to be...problematic.  People need paychecks.  People have family, friends.  And if you think store shelves will empty of toilet paper and bottled water when they're raided by a few hundred customers, imagine a raid by a few hundred million.  Oh, and not to mention the effect to American daily life when the people who MAKE that toilet paper are told to stay home too.

We lack self-discipline, anyway.  We are not China or the Chinese people.  It's ironic.  Times readers complain about draconian government containment efforts, but are the first to gripe when ""Trump is doing nothing!""

There's always you.  That's where any mass quarantine would begin  anyway.  If you wish to self-isolate, go ahead.  No one can stop you.  And therein lies the rub:  

By self-isolating where and when numbers and the logic say you really shouldn't, what harm might you be causing to your fellow citizen?  Heaven help us if you work in a toilet paper factory."
2020-03-09 2:15,"Unless one is an epidemiologist, private opinion on this virus is useless -- even harmful I check the CDC and Johns Hopkins sites, each of which deals calmly and informatively regarding Covid.

The media knows no more than what MDs tell it and one can get the same information -- absent dire warnings made to sell copies and airtime -- by going to the above sites.

You would not ask a ""journalist"" to decide whether you need cancer treatment; Why would you trust them in this matter?"

Another indication this is serious is Fox News -finally- started to feature covid front and center on their app. It didn’t fit their narrative before but now they can’t avoid it or pretend otherwise. It’s a crazy world."
2020-03-09 3:46,"We thought this was a Chinese problem. We instituted heavy travel restrictions for China and thought that would be the end of it. Similar elementary logic behind installing wall to keep out illegals. We all know the real world doesn’t work like that. We went to sleep thinking we were safe over the past 8 weeks while the rest of the world was melting down, our government did virtually nothing to prepare our society from the onslaught that we are seeing now. Inability to test people in the past month created the appearance that we are safe from the outbreak ravaging the rest of the world. Meanwhile travelers of ALL RACE either returned home to the US or visited from abroad were quietly bringing the virus to our communities and unknowingly allowing it to spread and incubate. The explosively high percentage of positive test results we are seeing now is a direct result of the confluence of these factors. Had we began to prepare and gotten ready starting from two months ago, we would have put measures in place to slow down outbreaks. Instead we are now reacting to outbreaks that have been quietly brewing for all this time.  Its like reading two month old news and using that info and data set to make life or death decisions today.  The perfect storm is here. Thank you for keeping us safe America."

He doesn’t have a clue what is going on and he is on the “Task Force”, along with other appointed cabinet members who have appear to have been given the orders to give a positive narrative so that Trump doesn’t look like he’s incompetent. Why are appointed cabinet members who are not infection/pandemic specialists the only ones who are allowed to give updates? I hope every American watches this interview to understand the degree of political narrative that’s happening.

Washington residents are a top priority, Oregonians and California residents also a priority. If a pharmacy in a grocery store, or a Walgreens, etc.,  can give flu shots, then why aren’t we gearing up for widespread testing in critical areas..."
2020-03-09 5:26,"Having been a hospital COO, I see the best course of action,  with so many questions, is to avoid public places if you/we have any sort of compromised immune system.  Just stay hone, out of harm's way.  Harm's way would include -most likely - going in to urgent care.  Call the primary doctor - if there is one.  Check to see what local hospitals advise.  I sure don't know that I'd go into an ER unless the ER had a separate facility to treat me....even then...
It seems worth it the most to check locally before going to a high germ, crowded place."

One ill passenger tested negative for coronavirus but s/he could test positive in a few days as well as one or more of the other passengers who are now at large in California or elsewhere in the US.   Another 4,000 passengers have boarded the ship for a week-long cruise.  It seems long past time to shut down ALL cruises."

2020-03-09 4:43,"Imagine this headline: ""In U.S. Cases of Flu Cross 500, and Deaths Rise to 22.""  You can't imagine it because it would never happen, since cases of flu cross the hundreds of thousands if not millions, and in 2019 alone, over 5,000 people died from the flu.

There is far too much hysteria going on for something that is tracking very much like a ""regular"" flu: the transmission pattern is similar, the morality rate (~2%) is exactly the same as the average flu, and those who have died are in the same demographics as those who die of flu: the elderly, those with compromised immune systems, and those with pre-existing underlying respiratory issues.

We should all certainly take normal precautions, just as we would during any flu season.  Get a flu shot (even a non-coronavirus flu shot can help), wash hands frequently (hand sanitizers are only temporary measures), get checked out if you feel truly ill.  Beyond that, don't give in to the hysteria and hyperbole out there.  The CDC and WHO are providing the facts; the news media and others are not experts, and should really stop covering this like it is a quasi-Armageddon.  They are only making things worse."
2020-03-09 5:25,"Most notable in Trump’s response to this crisis so far has been to; 1. Hold self-serving, campaign rallies potentially exposing hundreds of his supporters and others they come in contact with to the virus.  2.  Accuse Democrats of politicizing the crisis while he calls the democratic governor of a state that is dealing with the crisis a “snake.”  3. Expect the American people will believe whatever he has to say about the impact of the virus despite his reputation for lying and a tally of over 17,000 lies told and counting. 4. Impose himself at the CDC for a campaign photo op while they are working to develop a vaccine. And most importantly, hangout with his entourage at Mar a Lago. Stay tuned..."

Italy had no choice but to close off a substantial part of the country. Folks, this is what a pandemic may well look like elsewhere around the world. Italy just got a head start.

China used even more draconian measures than Italy and reportedly is finally bringing its epidemic under control. It remains to be seen whether lesser measures will work elsewhere.

Once we start testing in earnest and at the rate necessitated by local events, we may find our own recognized numbers of cases expanding rapidly. Regional closures here probably won’t be far behind. 

As if things couldn’t be worse, we have an incompetent and scientifically illiterate egomaniac trying to lead us out of what may soon be an endemic disease. His plan seems to be hope for the best, don’t plan for the worst, and blame everyone else for his plight. 

What a loser. He should resign if he’s not up to the job."

Earlier, when the passengers were confined to their cabins, one sent a selfie to a news outlet saying she was starting to have hallucinations.  How many of these hyperstressed passengers will decide they can't stand being isolated any longer and will somehow manage to enter the city and disperse to wherever they decide to go?  

This scenario is worrisome, as Governor Newsom is well aware, and he has said the whole operation could take three days or longer.  For everyone's sake, let's hope that it all goes off smoothly."
2020-03-09 3:52,These gop rallies... they’re going to stop. It’s going to be hard to keep the storyline about the crazy overreacting mainstream media when the rallies are canceled. Maybe trump will just go back to blaming Obama or immigrants. Or open borders. I’m sure he’ll think of something.
2020-03-09 4:21,Should we concern ourselves with uninformed trumpers who believe the guy they worship who said it's all a hoax or made up by Democrats?

Closing airports & other transportation centers  might help but restricting all movement isn’t  possible in a democracy.

2020-03-09 13:39,"Our best government scientists said tonight they believe we will witness world wide spread. This means many will die. 

A minority - parenteral. Subcutaneous.

Most will survive. Still, practice makes sense."

 I am very skeptical a vaccine will ever be successful against this virus- there is still no vaccine for SARS or MERS and the vaccine for feline corona virus that causes FIP doesn’t work. 

I want our government to act decisively now . I do not want the public to panic but I want them to know this isn’t the flu ; this isn’t going to magically go away on its own."
2020-03-09 16:39,"NYT predictably makes the oil price crash all about Saudi and Russia.  Both had been restraining production, ceding markets to US producers (who have higher production costs).  This appears to be about squeezing excess supply out of the market, and high cost suppliers will feel the squeeze most of all.  Will they be US suppliers, whose costs are high, Mideast producers who need high price to buy social tranquility, or Russia?  Russia, squeezed by sanctions and prepared to cope with low oil price, having already been forced to improve efficiency, may be best situated here.  Time may tell."

2020-03-09 3:28,"22 deaths from a 500 cases in the U.S. is welcome news. The fatality rate is still 2% similar to China and in sharp contrast to Iran and Italy where there is over 4% fatality rate. Why do I call this welcome news? 98% of the cases have survived so far and of the 22 deaths, 11 were in a nursing home in Kirkland, WA outside Seattle which had over 70 year old seniors with multiple underlying life threatening conditions. 

It is about time for the sake of public health to reveal the age of those who died and whether they were smokers. For the sake of privacy, their names could be kept confidential. The standard of care of infectious diseases in the US with immunocompetent person under 70 must be great for fatality rate to be around 1%.

I am excited that the fatality of younger than 70, non smokers getting plenty of fresh air and kept far away from  cruise ship with infected persons or from infected persons in closed crowded areas. Keep safety measures in place . 

Although the number of cases of persons exposed could well rise to a 1,000 in a week, the nation will start building a herd immunity that will help to decimate and eliminate, the Corona virus within a month or two. Humanity will be winning its war against Corona virus before we know it. The panic selling on wall street will continue to bring the markets down but that is not as important. Health first. As I had said yesterday Corona infection is CURABLE and not fatal in immunocompetent nonsmokers below the age of 70."

A lot of these kids have (mostly) beloved grandparents nearby, whose lives are at risk if they’re infected with COVID-19.  The kids seem oblivious to the risk.  The President is telling everyone to relax and go about their lives and my kids’ classmates, I guess, believe him.  Or they believe their parents, who believe him.  In any case, far too many people trust Trump and believe him and aren’t taking the threat of this virus seriously.

The right thing to do is urge calm, work intelligent and in lockstep with experts to protect and save the most vulnerable, and grind through what will be a difficult few months.

2020-03-07 21:40,"We still do not know who decided that the US would refuse to use the WHO approved test kit that is widely available and has worked well.  But that decision delayed effective testing in the US by a month--a problem that is still not fixed.  Lack of adequate test kits, plus unusually restrictive criteria for allowing a suspected case to be tested, has allowed the virus to spread while totals for the US are grossly under reported.

2020-03-07 21:36,"Somehow, Trump knew this would land back on him and he was not equipped to respond in a way that would calm people, yet make them aware of the problem. So he lied. Often. Teflon Donald has somehow managed to deflect accusations as fake news and some plot by the Democrats, but not this time.

Even after the devastation and a real psychological blow of 9/11 - I remember W, his administration and even the Congress urging Americans to go back to normal soon.

And sure enough, things did go back to normal soon.

Ditto with Anthrax outbreak in Obama days.

It's the nature of things for a POTUS to show everything is under control.

It's more like that duck who looks sanguine but is paddling like heck below the water surface.

I just crossed 72 - and lived thru H1N1, HIV, SARS and now Wuhan.

I think this virus will indeed pass from memory as the weather gets warmer - since it is more a fly virus.

As it is, China is already reporting less and less infections - to a point - outside China infections now outnumber those in China.

At the end of the day - a POTUS looks just as much after infected as uninfected.

Brits have a famous saying ”stsy calm and keep moving.”

This Wuhan threat  is no different."
2020-03-07 21:38,"At a time like this it is incredibly inappropriate for any president to go to the CDC for a photo op wearing one of his campaign hats. Ditto bragging about the size of his rally in El Paso at the hospital following the mass shooting. You can be certain when Trump says he is an expert in anything, like his comments at the CDC, that the exact opposite is the case."

Informing people of how to protect themselves, starting with 'cough into your sleeve, stay home and avoid crowds if you are coughing and sneezing with a runny nose"" is far more effective messaging."
2020-03-07 21:39,"The fact that this is even a story reported in The NY Times should cause all of us concern, anger even.

The number of folks tested? Just think seriously that lying about it, or concealing the truth on the low numbers of tested, the inadequate numbers of working test kits is acceptable.

The best practices to - literally - save lives, you cannot focus on that, you’ve got to put a shine on it all. Don’t get everyone worried that we may actually have a problem. Contradict experts, suggest everyday living and working practices on TV, on Twitter that increase risk. Be irresponsible, embrace lies to polish an incumbent’s image, even if only for a moment, or a news cycle.

How many are infected, how many have died, how many might become infected, or die - move on past that. Those aren’t numbers in keeping with the administration’s interests. No matter what oaths they swore.

Because, in the end, the numbers our current (mal)administration wanted to focus on was the stock market indices. The truth? That would be too disruptive. The real numbers that count, too hard to hear. The duty to protect our country? Too tough an act for the White House to perform."

Who needs truth, science, competent government when cheap public relations, reckless tax cuts and cultured ignorance are available ?

Yet another impeachable reason to overwhelmingly outvote Trumpistan on November 3 2020."
2020-03-07 21:37,"Who is the man on the far right in the photo, bald with a gray beard? He was looking at Trump as he spoke and was smiling. Makes me angry that nobody stands up to this president when they know this is a public health crisis. Even Romney has now acquiesced with the Biden/Burisma subpoena."
2020-03-07 21:40,"We know what trump did to win the White House. We know the utter contempt that he has for our democracy, our elections, our Constitution and the Rule of Law. How is it so hard to imagine that he would sacrifice the lives of innocent Americans if that's what it takes to hold on to power in November?"
2020-03-07 21:41,"The last quote of the article, ""I like the numbers where they are."" is slightly different from yesterday's,  “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault,” he said.""  The difference is significant because of his use of,  ''I"" don't need...""  As always it is all about Trump's desires and not the good of the country. Lying  to the public about reality as in his gross inflation of crowd size at his inauguration, downplaying the injuries and severity of the recent bombing from Iraq are just a couple of examples. 

To Trump it is all about the election and politics, but his lies won't go away with a virus that has no interest in Trump's politics.  This is a serious health issue, and treatment and prevention are key; the stock market, falsly attempting to convince voters of his ""great"" efforts should take a back seat to his ego, but of course that will never happen.  Looks like he learned a lot from Puerto Rico. 
These numbers and statistics, first and foremost, represent human beings.  Attempting to keep innocent people on the cruise ship where they will be infecting other passengers and missing the health care they need to cover up his ineptitude is inexcusable."

2020-03-07 21:35,"There's never been ""debate"" within the Trump crowd. Their instincts and actions are to cover up, distort, leave important information out. 

From day one."
2020-03-07 21:36,"Of all the stories today, including a private army of spies trying to undermine ""enemies"" of the President, this may be the scariest:

""From the beginning, the Trump administration .. was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth.""

First off, telling Americans the truth might be a good place to start.  Then letting Americans know what the government is doing to stay on top of the threat might be a good place to go next.  

This is so basic I don't even know what to say, except that clearly the administration wants to keep an unhealthy distance from the truth for fear of upsetting the markets and his reelection.  Now that is scary!"
2020-03-07 21:57,"The Coronavirus provides an important lesson about how America has lost control over critical resources in an emergency.

In 1982 the Justice Department split the monopoly that was the Bell System (AT&T) into entirely separate companies that continue to provide telephone service around the country today.

So why do we allow America today to be so dependent on China’s monopoly over our drug manufacturing industry?  

It is reported that the United States depends on China for an estimated 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to produce drugs in the United States."
2020-03-07 21:46,"Why did they only test 46 people on the cruise ship docked off San Francisco? My guess is once they found out that 21 out of 46 tested positive, they stopped testing because that’s a 46% positive rate and with 3,500 people on the ship that would equate to 1,610 people. Those numbers are too high for Trump’s PR campaign, his reelection, and the stock market. And we all know those are the only three things that matter to him."
2020-03-07 21:50,"“I like the numbers where they are,” Trump said about evacuating the cruise ship off the coast in California.

Sounds like no one’s told Trump the truth yet. US numbers will rise anyway. 

On February 24th Italy had 322 cases and 10 deaths. Today, we have 312 cases and 17 deaths, about the same. One week later, Italy had 2200 cases and 80 deaths, partly because of a delay in testing. I expect in one week the US numbers will rise likewise. 

Why doesn’t Trump know this? 

It is scary how much officials defer to Trump. He seems ever poised to override their recommendations with fits of rage. He just called the Governor of Washington a “snake.” What might he do to our state out of hatred and retribution when our numbers go up? I wouldn’t  put anything past him."

He was wearing his campaign hat. He talked about his ""perfect phone call, perfect transcript."" On the same day he announced a ""birther"" as his chief of staff.

Journalists are failing to do their jobs if they are not SAYING CLEARLY:  Trump is lying. Trump is unfit for office. People are are dying. A pandemic is spreading.

Two questions:
What is the job of a president in a time of a global public health crisis?  
What is the job of a newspaper in a time of a global public health crisis?"

Pledge money and effort for our country’s next elections."
2020-03-07 22:10,"Trump's inability to communicate clearly and accurately to the US population on this crisis is clear.  His self-centered comments are worthy of rebuke by leaders of both parties, but I'm pretty sure the GOP will stay silent.  Never in the history of our nation have we had someone in charge so unfit to lead in a time of need.  I don't see any way for him to improve his communication except to refrain from opening his mouth or tweeting."

Facing a health crisis of global proportions and after weeks of confused and contradictory responses  from his administration, our POTUS dons a ‘Keep America Great’ cap during his visit to the CDC, essentially turning the event into a partisan campaign rally.  (And for good measure, he calls Washington State Governor Inslee a “snake.”  Trump’s abundant use of derogatory name calling is directly proportional to of his intellect deficiency  and his paucity of moral values.)  And from his GOP acolytes: (embarrassed?) silence."

2020-03-07 22:07,Trump said there would be a million test kits available by today. There are not! And his own Staff have confirmed this. We are in desperate need for the truth and all we get are lied. Last Monday he told us it was all a Hoax. Yesterday he was afraid to visit the CDC because he thought someone there was infected .

Is it not possible to report on this without causing panic?  Speak softly and carry a big stick.  The government needs to act on this competently, fast, boldly, all the while easing the fears of the public.  The press needs to help with this, and not uselessly fan the flames.  That is not to say withhold information.  But it is to say reassure the public if at all possible."
2020-03-07 21:56,"I have several personal characteristics which the CDC says put me at increased risk. I spent this morning trying to pry from medical experts any kind of advice about whether I should change my routines, with an eye to self-protection. 

No luck. Time after time I was referred to boiler plate statements on the web, that in no way qualified as medical advice. Hand washing was the leading theme. Up-to-date assessment of the state of the epidemic in my area is unavailable. 

Two points:

1. The handling of the response is disorganized.

2. Local health authorities seem to be running scared, under-describing what is going on, and strongly prefer anodyne responses to any which might cause anyone to act in response.

This morning's experience redoubled my concerns."
2020-03-07 22:00,"I think Mr. Trump's greatest concern is COVID-19 is immune to EO's and fiats, his ideal form of governance.

2020-03-07 22:04,"We need to stop blaming Trump for everything. 
The Republicans along with a handful of conservative anti federal and regulatory voting libertarians have been active in undermining public services at the federal level.  And Democrats have lost their ability to explain to the public why this is a dangerous route. 
They too have been complacent in undermining the US’s autonomy and sovereignty by exporting manufacturing of goods and drugs to poorer parts of globe where labor is cheap. 
This is a culmination of decades of greed and money interested dictating government policies. 
It’s time for a revolution."

I don't think 3 day old information is adequate in the current environment.  Why isn't there at least a daily update?  Makes no sense."

How about the truth? Oh, I forgot, it’s anathema to them. Devise any ‘alternative fact’ you can to deflect and obfuscate. These people are reprehensible. This administration would do well to listen to New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who actually is a grown-up and has experience in this regard and has been having twice-daily briefings and, yes, telling THE TRUTH to New Yorkers. Ironically, Trump and his criminal syndicate make everyone sick. Deplorable."
2020-03-07 21:59,"So easy to second guess. The “truth”? With this no one knows until tomorrow.  If Trump suggested all the worst guesses and they never happened then you’d all say he was hysterical and weak (in addition to all the other names)
Why don’t you all let us know right now what will happen with this tomorrow and next week before it actually happens. Now that would be of value."
2020-03-07 22:01,"Trump's lies call for big headlines saying Trump lies again. We all know he lies constantly, but we have to call him out on it.

1) People need to quarantine
2) People need to know they can retain their jobs
3) Companies need to know they can get financial relief (like a natural disaster) to keep their doors open (not maintain profit levels) and not fire people.

This could cost $1T in FISCAL not monetary stimulus which requires the President and Congress to act together.  Congressional leaders have offered no solutions - Shame on them.

The President is the cowardly liar- Shame, shame on him.  Time to for him to step up, tell the truth, propose a financial support system for the economy tied to full employment.  People and the economy can hiberate and should be forced to without damage and be restored to health when the virus is tackled."

Somebody dropped the ball. I am not talking about golf balls.

Despite constant attempts to lie and cover up administration bungling, miscommunications  and response delays, when all is said and done, the data and numbers will reveal the real story.  

Per Johns Hopkins to date, there have been around 3000 reported virus related fatalities in China with millions of people tested.  In the U.S. there have certainly been fewer than 20k people tested to date.  Trump's utter failures as President are stark compared to China.  He is the worst manager ever to hold the office.

But on the other hand, he is not imposing the opinion and deferring to public health experts. It is important not to attack him for every single move and over politicize the crisis because it will create confusion and distrust in the public. Mr. Azar seems to have a good handle on the issue and seems to have the ear of Trump.
  Let the handling of this global epidemic be a rehearsal for future more lethal ones that may hit in the global future (imagine an Ebola type one spreading). This should raise flags regarding the need to have plans, adequate supplies, and training of personnel for the future. Make this a well funded. permanent branch of the federal government."
2020-03-07 22:24,"A number of things need to be understood dealing with an issue such as this:
Number 1 - let the blame game start AFTER the problem is under some measure of control. CDC has done fine and should not be in the cross-hairs at this point.
2. This is not going to controlled tomorrow - so we might as well keep our mouths shut and do the heavy lifting NOW much like the chinese seem to have done.
3. This is a matter of medicine , so instead of the republicans and the democrats it should be the doctors and the nurses and the healthcare workers who should be in the forefront making the decisions- not Mike Pence who would suffice for campaigning but not matters like this.
4. There is suffering ahead and there is no way of avoiding that; but it is during times like these that efficiency,brain power, decency and sheer hard work make the difference - not politicking,posturing and blathering which have recently come to epitomize the american public space.
5.  At the end of the day things will work out but during this process we should as a country come together and become stronger instead of falling apart."

I answered, truthfully, ""no,"" but the official didn't bother to check my passport. Anyone asked that question must know that he/she would probably be quarantined if the answer was ""yes,"" whereas a ""no"" answer means no quarantine.

Shouldn't US govt officials at least look at passports if the traveler claims not to have been in China recently? And is the ""last 2 weeks"" long enough?"

Likewise his pressure on Powell to lower the interest rate, a strategy not appropriate for the current situation, and one that has been shown to not work in these circumstances.

Not testing medical personnel despite showing symptoms keeps the numbers down.

Some of the best analysis of what needs to be done comes from Senator Patty Murray who has argued we need  provide emergency paid sick leave so that people can stay home if they are sick, public health care to pay for testing and treatment, and plans for teachers and students to be able to communicate if schools are closed."

Trump is not a source of useful information this. On the contrary, his political bias and information-processing limitations make him very unreliable. 

The good news is that no one, including people who support him, puts any stock in what he has to say about Covid-19.

Let's get those test kits and that protective equipment made, eh?  Looks as if folks are working on it.

Social distancing has started, a good thing.  Pay attention to what public health authorities say in New York, California, Washington.  Those folks are competent and apolitical.  The New England Journal of Medicine has high-quality non-technical updates at its website.

I do agree that panic is not warranted.  This is not plague.  Most cases are mild."

The purpose of control of virus penetration should be:  ideally prevention of occurrence;  but at least delay penetration until there is a vaccine, and/or slow the progression so that medical facilities are not overloaded. 

Of course, we really don't know what is going on since testing is woefully inadequate.  There should be 100% free testing of anyone presenting for any medical reason at medical facilities nationwide.  What a concept."
2020-03-07 23:02,"Speaking for myself, I know I feel a little calmer when I trust the information I'm given - even if it's bad news. It's the not knowing, the uncertainty, that breeds anxiety. How can anyone plan, let alone act, if we don't know what's really going on?

Markets, I'm told, react similarly to uncertainty. Since Mr. Trump seems to care more about the Dow than the well-being of the American people, perhaps someone might risk the president's ire to remind him of that?"

Unless the United States offers free testing, treatment and paid time off of work, nothing really matters. We'd all be better off being uninsured, ie, dropping healthcare insurance altogether. The insurance companies would go out of business and we might just get some power and control back into our lives. If we have Medicare for All then the fight against COVID-19 would be fair."
2020-03-07 23:18,"We need to move from reactivity to proactivity is what some experts say. Thus far I have seen proactive measures to calm the markets and sooth the nerves of the public. Other than the ban on air travel, not much is forthcoming at the federal level. For weeks we have heard promises of tests for the virus, yet as of today only a few thousand tests have been performed. 

The virus is here and it will do what they always do. We need a clear unified channel of communication from Washington and more importantly swift action.  The longer we wait the more severe the impact will be on both the health of the public and on the economy. What will the reaction of the markets be when we have hospitals filled to overflowing?"

2020-03-07 23:38,"Don't feel sorry for the airlines.  This afternoon my husband and I decided we should forego our planned nine day trip to Florida (flying from Boston) scheduled for March 21st because I am 80 and he is about to turn 92.  When I went on line to cancel, the Delta website mentioned a cancellation fee of $200 per ticket for domestic flights.  The fee to us:  $346.98 per ticket.  But our health and well-being is better protected staying closer to home."
2020-03-07 23:45,"It is still too early to know what the extent of coronavirus will be.. So far there have been few localized episodes; which isn't even close to being a pandemic. This is a ""novel' virus, and hence DNA sequencing and testing presented some challenges in the first few weeks.

So far, based on the latest data, the novel coronavirus is especially worrisome for the elderly and those with certain health conditions. Otherwise, it's fairly benign. The one person from Westchester NY is apparently recovering nicely and the majority of deaths are associated with the old-age home in Seattle."

2020-03-07 23:46,"I am in Palo Alto, one of the expanding epicenters for coronavirus in the US. Schools are closing, major conferences are being canceled, Google and Facebook is telling most employees to stay home. But life goes on...the restaurants and bars are still open, we still have get togethers. Talk of coronavirus dominates all conversations, but we are not in a florid panic.

What every community needs is a measured, well thought out guidance appropriate to their community. I will say that Dr. Meissner's comments were floridly inappropriate for vast parts of the United States. It spurred panic where it did not need to be. Even in our area it was not useful as there was no guidance given as to what to do to protect ourselves. It did cause panic buying at grocery stores and Costco. Fortunately, because the reality is that while the virus is spreading, there's enough time to stock up so food supplies are back to normal (just not Purell or face masks).

The public needs absolutely accurate information for their region. Global statements that give a false sense of security or induce widespread panic are useless. 

Perhaps every county health department should adopt levels of threat assessment they update daily. For example, a zero means no evidence of threat within a hundred miles. A one indicates potential exposure but no disease. A two is confirmed COVID-19. For each threat level, there should be a commensurate response. That way we can manage this crisis in a sensible, regional fashion."
2020-03-07 23:14,"Appears to me that Trump is not only whistling past the graveyard, but also is less concerned about the public welfare than he is about how an incipient pandemic might damage his image or affect his personal prospects.

It certainly didn't inspire confidence yesterday, while discussing the government's ""perfect"" preparedness to conduct virus testing, he felt compelled to add a comparison to the ""perfect"" transcript of his phone call to Ukraine.  Huh?

Nor was it reassuring when, in speaking about the cruise ship moored off the CA coast, he expressed his preference that it remain quarantined offshore so as not to result in numbers  that ""I don't want"" (not WE...not AMERICA...numbers that HE doesn't want).  Apparently leaving the 3000+ people on board that ship to stew in a petri dish is the more prudent alternative when it comes to projecting a responsible image to his followers?"

We need calm, clear public service announcements about things people can do to prevent the spread of the epidemic ( How to properly wash your hands,  What is social distancing, and why it is important.  Why Noone with Coronavirus should go to work or be out in public.  When and how you should self-quarantine).  if Trump won't allow our federal healthcare professionals to do this, a charity or philanthropist can fund it.  Broadcast it far and wide, on All networks.  Truth is a great disinfectant."

2020-03-07 23:56,Health officials were not unanimous on this and many called for calm. Obviously you want a reaction in proportion to the danger. And the suggestion that all health officials perceived the same level of danger is absurd. Many called for calm themselves and warned of the danger of panic. Trump was not alone in that.
2020-03-07 23:24,Be clear- Dr. Messoneir’s statement was made on Feb25.  The Dow lost 1000 on Feb 24. Her statement did not cause the market volatility. The uncertainty created by the incompetence and foot dragging by this administration did that all by itself.

2020-03-07 23:30,"Based on the data from S Korea I would say whatever to be done from now is already very late. Fed govt should do something quickly. The fed government should have started preparing for the massive spread - preparing the basic supply for the health workers - protection gears, masks, sanitizers, and so forth. Now those are running short even for the health care workers in the front lines. When the number started going up in many places, S Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan several weeks ago, and we were lucky enough to be far from the epicenters. What did we do? Nothing. We wasted all those precious time and now here we are, totally unprepared. As a statistician I would say that COVID19 will be here for very long, while normalcy of our lives will be heavily disrupted. With this non-existent public health care, we're doomed."
2020-03-07 23:42,"""From the beginning, the Trump administration’s attempts to forestall an outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth.""

If you just leave out the words ""outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe,"" what's so different now in terms of what Trump tells the public?

A man who lies about crowd size, the path of a hurricane, the progress of a war, or the reason for firing someone (anyone), is hardly going to tell us the truth about a genuine health crisis--particularly when it hits on the eve of an election campaign."
2020-03-07 23:52,"Also worth asking: why is the CDC's official website reporting only 164 confirmed cases in the US as of today?  This number seems implausibly low considering the 19 confirmed deaths from the virus in the US so far; you would think that aggressive testing around those cases would have turned up a lot more confirmed cases.  Also, the Guardian today reported 400 total confirmed cases in the US, citing information not only from the CDC but also from state health and local departments.  Why the disconnect between their numbers and the CDC's?  Why would the Guardian, but not the CDC, be able to tally all reported cases from states and municipalities?  Is there perhaps pressure coming from the White House for the CDC to keep its numbers low?  I would think that would be worth an investigative reporter's time."
2020-03-08 0:04,"And when all else fail Trump can just bet on two horses to make sure he can take credit and shy away from blame.  He said he wanted to keep people on the cruise ship in California, but he gave his people authority to make the decision.  So if the public perception ends up going against the scientifically correct decision (get them out to places where a real quarantine is doable), he has his behind covered.  A real leader would give authority to the experts, but then back them up 100%.  Amazing that anybody would work for such a person."

In this situation, candor, facts and transparency are important.  Mr. Trump is unable to be candid, he basis his decisions on hunches and is not transparent.

Again this is to build confidence in the government.  If something is not known, tell people, don't make stuff up.

The government needs to speak with one voice and it should be the experts, NOT the politicians.  The experts must keep the political leadership informed and tell them what the plan is going forward.  When everyone is speaking from the same, accurate script, it will prevent what we have now, which is a Mucking Fess.

Mr. President, you need to reassert control and make sure all know that it is the experts who have the lead on the response.  Stay off Twitter on this issue.  When a question comes up, bring your expert to the microphone and STEP BACK.  You will gain credibility for having the sense to put together a good team and letting them do their work.

They would still vote for him and swear he is being used by God to do God's will, but they are old enough remember polio before the vaccine and heard stories of the 1918 flu from their parents.

Some may recall he and Pompeo said that COVID-19 was a hoax created by the media and the Democrats. This administration denies any basis of fact, and biology is a factual science. The spin and lies that Trump has perpetrated about everything from Russia to weather are no match for the science of virology. COVID-19 has more power than Wall Street, faux news, or rush Limbaugh. When people live in fear and count the dead,as they are left helpless by the most powerful and wealthiest government in the world fumbling  its responsibilities to 350 million people, ah facts do matter, Mr President! 

Americans should know there are many civil servants like Tony Fauci who have rational information at their fingertips and who are working day and night to minimize this epidemic. Government scientists are working very hard to develop an effective and safe vaccine testing it in clinical trials. They are gathering data from other nations to understand the natural history of the virus. Too bad these Americans have been muzzled from speaking by this administration."

It's too late for that strategy here.  We spread the virus from person to person now.  The virus is out of the box and can't be put back in.   As of today. there are 102 confirmed cases.  That number will climb as the University of Washington tests more samples - a capability they only acquired a few days ago - and as we continue to spread the virus among ourselves.

I unexpectedly learned on Friday that I won't see my college students again.  We'll complete the quarter via online teaching, as will a growing number of students in the area.  That includes some children who now need supervision at home.  Who pays when one parent can't go to work?

Our health care workers face shortages of masks and other personal protective equipment, and our county bought a motel to house quarantined individuals.  The hospitals are full.

By now (and it’s not done) the COVID-19 has infected 100,000 people. 3400 have died for a death rate of 3.4%. 
The flu’s death rate is .1%. Not even a full percent. If the flu were to infect 100,000, only 100 would die. 
Sure, the flu seems bigger because it’s been around longer and has had time to infect more people. It’s also been researched for decades and has annual vaccinations. In 1918, the flu killed over 2% of its victims. That rate has been brought down through study and medicine. But COVID-19 is brand new. And it’s taking 3.4% of its victims. So far, in the US, we’ve lost 17 people in 300 cases. Guys that’s over a 5% death rate in our country. Granted if we could TEST more, that rate might go down, but based on the numbers we have, more than 5% of our confirmed cases are dead and it’s only been a few weeks since the first case.

Days later, the patient is still in the hospital and it is still unknown whether she has coronavirus.  This is what starving the beast, drowning the government in a bathtub, eliminating wasteful spending, and America first gets us."
2020-03-08 2:01,"We are not going to get “truth” from Trump.

In this administration it’s obvious that  the “truth” is whatever Trump says it is. 
It’s well known that Trumps version of “truth” is what he thinks makes him look good.  
If the “truth” won’t make him look like a genius, he’ll throw a giant screaming tantrum and scare a lot of people.  

Trump wants is to win the next election, the rest means nothing to him.  

There’s no point in hoping this administration will or can do much to help the people of the United States stay healthy and safe.  They simply don’t know how to.  And Trump only cares if he thinks it benefits him personally.  People only matter if they are “loyal” and vote for him.  

In a real crisis, Trump is just noise.  It could be that this crisis will have to be handled DIY state by state.

If we make it till Nov. 3, we have to vote him out of office for our own protection."
2020-03-08 1:11,"What I want to know is why the Princess Cruise ship off the California coast is not allowed to ""park"" itself in San Francisco Bay, out of harm's way, while awaiting action.  If people are going to be stuck on board, let them idle in a sheltered location.  Somehow I suspect that Trump doesn't want these people to be part of""his"" numbers, so he's forcing them to remain in international waters."
2020-03-08 1:05,"I understand where President Trump is coming from; the only problem is either he did not say it with sufficient clarity, or he ended the sentence abruptly without much thought about how such an assertion from him could backfire in the public. 

Perhaps it would have been better to have the passengers  removed from the ship and have them observed somewhere inland under quarantine for another two weeks before releasing them if nothing serious is discovered next. But the way he approached the issue makes him appear heartless to the plight of people both offshore and inland. 

President Trump is taking an enormous risk by undercutting both CDC and WHO. He wants to show he is more knowledgeable than both the Public health physicians and the epidemiologists without ever taking any formal training in medicine and in public health. Think how well it would work, if it works."
2020-03-08 1:31,"Of course, the president still has his bullhorn and does not want to be held responsible for the death of anyone, let alone his country folks.  He also is not immune to this virus, and may worry about his own health, and family members.

Understanding the president, and what he might understand about this health emergency, might help to clear a passageway for health experts and workers across America to do the best they can, keeping in mind that they are placing their own well-being at risk.

The Go-Between or Messenger, somebody he can relate to and even trust, to keep him awake with the account of a popular best-selling American novel, and some excellent ones have been written, about a 'plague' shutting-down the country (not Camus's mandatory read at school in France, but an American blockbuster).

He probably is hearing a sea of numbers and figures from top scientists and doctors that only confuse this national concern, but if he is given a science fiction panorama to stand back and make some decisions, knowing that he has an excellent and very professional team on hand, experts in the field of containing the outbreak of epidemics, he might even emerge as a hero at the end of the day."
2020-03-08 1:33,"As Trump said about quarantining folks on the cruise ship out in SF, it’s about the numbers.  To Trump, it is all numbers; wealth, votes, electoral college, inaugural audience, rally sizes, stock market.

He equates more known cases and deaths with failure. 

His efforts to minimize and trivialize backfire because we all know his pathology to lie and cover up and we expect the worst as a result.  The truth will set us free and keep us more safe, but Trump can’t ever appear to change direction or admit anything that appears mistaken (lose) in his mind.  As a consequence, we all lose."
2020-03-08 2:02,"I think the only people panicking are Wall Street. And they need to. If this thing kills two percent and half the nation gets it there will be a population decline of 1%. That may not sound bad, but it is a decline in the economy. There will also be a decline due to cancellations and self isolation, which is a reasonable response by individuals. 

As for the people panicking, I don't see it. I see a lot of people on-line making political hay but I suspect that people in general are not that worried. I believe it is a minority who even plan to change their habits. If your poor or lacking in good healthcare you were already balancing in the edge of life anyway."
2020-03-08 1:48,"I returned from Seoul two days ago. South Korea's efforts to address the public health crisis of the coronavirus are impressive. More than 100,000 tests conducted at little or no cost to individuals. Direct phone contact made with 200,000 members of the secretive cult at the center of Korea's outbreak to see if they are symptomatic. Complete transparency with information, including twice daily briefings by scientists rather than politicians and phone alerts about locations of newly confirmed infections. My point is that these steps are what citizens of every country have a right to expect in a public health emergency. Trump, always in denial about what he doesn't understand, is a complete failure."

How do you do that? Social distancing and hygiene:
1) stop shaking hands
2) don’t attend gatherings of large groups. The larger and noisier the group, the more people shout at one another in close proximity to be heard over the noise. Equals respiratory transmission. 
3) don’t valet your car
4) clean your hands, KEEP YOUR FINGERS OUT OF YOUR EYES
5) don’t use cash if possible

2020-03-08 1:23,"If Trump was a smarter bulb he would realize that he only damages himself and his re-election cause by trying to hide and minimize this outbreak.  By his not allowing public health officials to properly educate the public and by his purposeful misinformation efforts to make people believe this is not serious he has caused people to believe they are not at risk, that they do not need to be careful about catching the Coronavirus.  This has led to more people being out and about, thinking they are not at risk themselves or to others as they must just ""have a cold or at worst, the seasonal flu"".  People who are given accurate public health information can avoid panicking any more than is necessary because they have the confidence they know what to do.  Trump is more worried about himself and the stock market.  This will blow up and be even worse for him."

The idea, that in the age of digital media, that people aren't going to find out the truth, except from this President, is back in the dark ages.  However, that is where this administration could put us, if it keeps up with its idea, that a tight control of what is said, is what is needed, it is not.  The public needs the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  We will get it from all of our news sources on the internet, the Star Tribune, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the L.A. Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, Reuters, etc.  Yes, there are journalists that can give a distorted or favorable report about this administration, but I am perfectly capable of reminding them in the comment section of their piece, if they have missed the boat.

Obviously visiting the CDC on Friday interfered with weekend golf plans.  He was dressed to play during the CDC visit.

All that was missing was that green coat with ""I don't really care"" scrawled across the back.

Trump recounting that he told Pence not to say  anything nice about Jay Inslee and calling him a snake reminded me that the occupant of the highest elected office in  our country is a mean girl trapped inside a 70+ year old man's body.

2020-03-08 1:25,"His instincts are correct, the right message is to remain calm, the problem is he has no credibility, he is distrusted, whatever he says people will doubt, not believe.

And of course remaining calm is not the end of it.  Remaining calm does not mean doing nothing. It means doing what needs to be done, deliberately, efficiently and without delay. Trump has no message on that. 

His big move so far has been to put Pence in charge. Trump does not want this buck stopping on his desk, he wants it to stopping on Mike's desk. And if Mike chokes, Trump will find another desk for it to stop."
2020-03-08 1:14,"Perhaps younger people may not notice that this is a new, altered ""normal"" in our nation.

I watched with dismay in 2005 as George Bush, who could deliver a conventional bomb or troops to anywhere on the planet within hours, stood idly by as Hurricane Katrina created extremely disturbing events at the Superdome stadium in New Orleans, and in the city's hospitals. When he at last appointed a National Guard officer to lead relief efforts in the city, it was very late and the government's credibility had been altered, perhaps forever.

Living in the Northwest, I was alarmed when I read that the first patient our state, in Snohomish County, Washington, was granted a compassionate use allocation of an unapproved drug, Remdesivir. Compassionate use exceptions normally follow dire conditions where the patient is not expected to survive. This red flag remained unexplained for two weeks, until the New England Journal of Medicine published a description of the case and explained the use of the drug. 

The avenues of research on treatment are somewhat reassuring, but to date the government is repeating the same propaganda and not elaborating. Recently, for example, de Blasio of New York stated that no public school student had exhibited symptoms of the disease. There is no way the Mayor can know that for certain, so he dilutes his credibility with that statement the same way that Trump has. 

Are the peasants considered expendable by our leaders, whether it's a hurricane or a microbe?"

He's acting aggressively to contain the virus behind the scenes while attempting to promote calm, and deferring to public health officials on important decisions; it sounds like he's actually doing as well as anybody could with the information available to him. But the fact is that nobody has any faith in him because of his peculiar strategy of repeatedly lying and blaming the media, so his attempts to keep people calm just exacerbate the panic. In this article I see Pentagon red tape, CDC incompetence, and China being China, but nothing that Donald Trump has done wrong other than just being Donald Trump--someone who no educated person has any faith in, solely because he doesn't know what it is to make yourself a leader without your Klansman father co-signing the equivalent of a $50 million loan for you to squander on failed business ventures."

Today in my state there is the center of the coronavirus epidemic, and my red feed is entirely eaten up with a supposed “sexxx education” bill in the state legislature. They say it teaches “a variety of sexual stimulation” to kids and are especially upset that it refers to gender as not being essentially a matter of body parts. They have dismissed the coronavirus as a hoax and repeat that it is barely transmissible plus it’s in the population now so it’s inevitable and just a mild cold (yes that’s cognitive dissonance). The blue feed is news reports and info they, as doctors, public health officials and helper-profession folks, are getting from the ground.

After reading an article today about why NYC schools basically couldn't be closed, I finally understood. If you missed the article, basically NYC schools can't close because they feed, yes as in food, kids. They offer what turns out to be a key social service, childcare, for millions of families. They provide safety, stability and structure, and if a little education gets in the mix, all the better. While my child attends a NYC public school,  I am privileged enough that this had not occurred to me. The US didn't do anything because we simply can't.

At this point, I still have the freedom to choose to go to NYC which could be fun and would make a contribution to the NYC economy. But I don't want to risk my life and losing the ability to breathe is a particularly distressing demise IMO. I am going to consult my MD but there are no guarantees. 

We all have to evaluate the news being shared and make personal decisions but I am not at all confident the situation will get better before it gets much worse. The government is not inspiring confidence that if I do get sick I will get the treatment I need to remain alive.

Pretty much everyone who's asked that question knows that he or she will be quarantined for a long time if the answer is ""yes,"" but will not be quarantined for even a second if the answer is ""no.""

2020-03-08 6:29,"The thought that the Trump Administration is still not certain of its communication plan is extremely discouraging. At this point, Americans want Trump to forget about the communications plan —likely a personal damage control plan anyway — and get on with realistically dealing with an enormous public health crisis. Failure to do so will be even more damaging to his legacy than impeachment. 

At this point the Trump Administration and Vice President Pence have no credibility and our nation needs physicians, scientists and other healthcare experts communicating freely and directly to the public. The Administration should focus its efforts on properly funding US government agencies which can mobilize healthcare experts nationally and globally to provide the treatments and advice the public as well as patients need."

1. Most experts say that political leaders should present a calm public face. They should work feverishly behind the scenes, but present a calm public face. Trump appears to have understood the ""calm public face"" part, but the ""work feverishly behind the scenes"" part -- not so much.

2. I admit to being a slacker myself until my doctor, during a recent checkup, suggested that I get a flu vaccination. Roughly half of Americans don't, and don't plan to. Flu vaccines are of limited effectiveness -- they reduce the risk of getting the flu by 40-60%, depending mostly on how well doctors have ""matched"" the vaccine (which must be produced and distributed way in advance) to the disease. Even so, 40-60% multiplied by the reported 8,000 - 10,000 flu deaths each year (just in the US) means that about 2,000 - 2,500 flu deaths could be prevented each year (just in the US) if 100%, rather than 50%, of Americans got vaccinated. Why not? If the answer is economic, which it may be (mine was free), either health insurance companies or the federal government should bear this cost."

There is a co-efficient -- 2.5 to 3, if I recall correctly - for how many people catch the disease from each infected person.  

The White House officials who argued for covering up the spread of the disease and""buying on the dip"" deserve a co-efficient of their own to describe the number of people exposed to corona virus because they delayed an honest accounting to the public of the risks of spread.  That delay has surely infected a lot more people.

For years, I got a flu vaccination each year, but only because my office provided them for free in a conference room very close to my workplace. I recently got a vaccine for this year, also free. I've read that roughly half of all Americans don't get vaccinated. They should, and it should be provided for free, paid for either by health insurance companies or the federal government."

2020-03-08 9:52,"Don't blame Trump for the delays in gaining access to the tests.  If anything he's cutting through the bureaucracy remarkably well.

The first step in providing greater access to testing was to loosen the CDC regulations.  Some states are still awaiting approval to conduct tests.  In total there will be 100 local and state public health labs doing the testing with a potential capacity to do 10,000 tests per day, with a few private labs also testing.

The reason for the rocky start was the CDC's decision to develop its own, better, test -- versus using the WHO's -- and it had some defects. 

The FDA also had to loosen regulations so private/commercial tests could be used.  The CDC won't confirm test results done by the FDA-approved tests."
2020-03-08 10:30,"Lord knows, I'm no fan of Trump. That said, the media is certainly not doing its part to help people keep calm. The media loves a crisis (nor surprising, it makes their jobs exciting and gets the public more engaged) and often does more to stoke fear than to calm people. For example, the CDC said that this 'could be' like the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918. When the media tells us that it adds ""when 20-50 million died world wide"" (usually they mention only the upper number). Very seldom do they add that that was a death rate of 3-5% (i.e., a survival rate, even in 1918 of 95-97%). 

The media tells us over and over about 300 cases in the US (often in voices tinged with alarm - looking at you, ABC World News Tonight), but never reminds us that there are 350+ million people in this country. In short, the media could both do their public service work of presenting the facts AND do so in a way that would help to keep people calm, if they chose to do so."
2020-03-08 10:52,"I don't have  Mr. Trump's gift for understanding these things, but my understanding is viruses are hard to fight because they mutate at a relatively rapid rate.  Same reason that a new flu vaccine has to be developed each year.  Isn't mutation in effect evolution?  And doesn't Mr. Pence, the person in charge of our defense against Covid19 deny evolution?  And therefore isn't the idea that he be in charge really a bad one?"
2020-03-08 11:44,"The message from Ms. Messonnier has still not been put out. Other than a few work conferences, the SXSW, a few college basketball games(that were to be held in Washington), I have not heard about schools or businesses being closed other than in the epicenters of Washington and now New York.

Ms Messonnier have a much broader message of major disruption to everyone’s daily life. Trump had stated that the disease is contained, the symptoms are mild, and deaths are due to underlying conditions. It is supposedly milder than the flu but many people get inoculated against the flu. The death rate from the flu would be more notable  if there wasn’t a vaccine for it. There is no vaccine for the coronavirus."
2020-03-08 5:19,"It is natural to project calm for the government.   This administration has such a reputation for dishonesty that anything  but the truth will provoke mass panic.   Trump is seeing this already.  In the end whatever grift, bluster, and confidence a president may convey he/she is not omniscient.   Incompetence in the face of a disaster like this is the best way to elect  a democratic candidate.   Certainly the public performance  of the Democratic party inspires not much competence but Trump even less."

2020-03-08 4:09,"The Trump Administration shows a mix of political concerns during a potential public health emergency and not Trump and Pence not knowing what they are talking about. 

For example, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the immunologist heading National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which will lead our country’s effort, in conjunction with the WHO, in developing a Covid-19 vaccine, tried to explain to Trump that if research proceeds without a problem, there might be a phase 1 testable vaccine trial in two months. Then, if that is successful, perhaps in a year, researchers will be ready for a widespread phase 3 trial, followed by FDA approval in a year and a half. Trump kept repeating, (paraphrasing) “Great, in two months I’m there will be a cure”. Dr. Fauci again repeated that no, a trial might be ready in two months, not a finished vaccine. Trump then went on saying try to make it two months. Obviously, Trump doesn’t understand medical science, or any science for that matter."
2020-03-08 11:45,"There should be no debate over ""what"" to tell the public, only ""how"" to tell the public.

2020-03-08 6:25,"Why can't we accept our President for what he is?  He has always made things up as he went along, ad libbing from the hip first and asking questions later.  He is the least reliable source for information, and a total flop at guidance.  Fortunately, we have health professionals and responsible governors and mayors who are striving to stay on top of this and informing us of what the true situation is with the coronavirus insofar as they themselves know.  They are offering us information as it becomes available along with recommendations for steps we can take to protect ourselves.

Trump has never been a reliable source for steadiness and truth.  Why would he start being that now?"
2020-03-08 11:25,"It's too bad that both Trump and the media do not seem to understand that we can handle the truth.  Just say it. Don't hide it and don't embellish it. It's not ""all is well"" - nor is it ""virus hits, everybody dies, news at 11.""  

If ever there was a time for critical thinking, it's now."

Good luck with that.

Let's see we're at 400 and counting as of today and this is with very few test kits in distribution. Just wait a couple of weeks when there will be enough test kits to test everyone who is sick and who is displaying symptoms- then we'll get a real count."
2020-03-08 5:24,"The U.S. government under Trump was caught flat-footed by this outbreak, he having eliminated the office that could deal with a possible pandemic. Why? Out of spite because it had been established by President Obama. The only reason we haven't suffered more is because he inherited a strong foundation. But we definitely shouldn't risk another four years."

It will not be easy because in US people are armed and lock downs can have unpredictable outcome. But when the out brake will reach a certain level the measure will be inevitable.

As for the media, typically the journalists are blamed for everything (in any country) it happened many times, even during the Vietnam war. Meanwhile people are forgetting the impact  of social media in itself a ""virus of propaganda"".

That said not all reporting is fare. For example when it come s to Italy  not a word about the over 600 people that already recovered and the over 35.000 test performed (that is the reason the Italian authorities found so many cases acting better and faster than other countries in Europe).It is also unclear why the NYT map, when Italy had 500 case was already suggesting not to travel there, but there is no warning for France that has over 800 cases (and the data is even wrong because according to French sources there are over a 1000 cases, possibly 1200 over the week end). 

In any case the US  should brace for impact and try to change its leaders ...fast."
2020-03-08 6:06,"Analysis of Trump and his administration since 2016 are distilled in his response to the COVAD-19 international emergency: no reliance on facts, concern only for his political welfare, a message and tone set by ratings instead of the truth, deflecting blame for incompetence on others (particularly his predecessor). 

After years of practice, citizens' expectations of a president in charge are as low as they can go. No wonder the passion to Fire Trump is sky-high."
2020-03-08 11:16,"It is noted that the United States has not canceled travel to Japan, one of the epicenters of the virus. My understanding is that professionals with the CDC wanted a ban on travel of the elderly to Japan but they were overruled by the White House to maintain calm and help the airlines. It appears the administration is more concerned about business than the health of its citizens."
2020-03-08 5:01,"He's sowing confusion and doubt, not calm and confidence.  But what else would you expect from him?  The truth?  Not likely.

2020-03-08 6:29,"Influenza. This flu season 19 million cases with 180,000 hospitalizations have been estimated in the U.S.  Deaths in U.S. are estimated to be 10,000 as of February 1, 2020 per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The World Health Organization says that seasonal influenza epidemics worldwide cause 3 million to 5 million severe cases every year. Deaths worldwide are estimated to be 650,000 people.

This happens year in, year out.  No headlines, no panic, no daily ticker. You hear of school closings here and there. Sometimes it happens to be your kid’s school. We tell our employees to stay home if they are sick. Nothing new. 

Can you imagine the news outlets reporting an average of 66 influenza deaths per day in the U.S. from October to February with peaks in the hundreds?  Can you imagine the reporting of the worldwide deaths from influenza?  2,700 plus per day with peaks in the tens of thousands.  We would live our lives in total fear for eight months every year; year in, year out. 

When I read of 106,206 coronavirus cases worldwide with 3,600 deaths it seems very small compared to seasonal influenza numbers. For now I’m telling Chicken Little and friends to be on their way.  But I am going to wash my hands more just to be safe as well as observe the normal flu precautions."
2020-03-08 7:43,"By putting his head in the sand through grossly inadequate testing, Trump can suppress the number of corona virus cases but only for a while. Eventually dead bodies will start piling up. Mortality for 60 year olds is 3.6%, for 70 year olds 8% and for 80 year olds 14.8%  As of July 1, 2018 in the US, there were 37 million people in their 60s, 22.6 million in their 70s and 11 million in their 80s. These mortality rates predict a potential for 1.33 million deaths among 60 year olds, 1.81 million deaths among 70 year olds and 1.63 million deaths among 80 year olds. That is potentially 4.77 million deaths. Now everyone in those age groups may not get the virus, but consider also the number of hospital beds that will be involved, including those seriously ill but who recover, and the medical resources needed to treat them. 
By failing to deploy adequate testing kits, this administration has given this virus a huge, largely unmitigated head start in infecting the population. What is happening in Italy will soon happen here. This virus does not respect American exceptionalism."
2020-03-08 10:30,"It is beyond appalling that what to tell the American public was subject to debate.  How about NOT infantilizing the public and, instead, being completely open and transparent?  I don’t blame the President, nor his Administration, for the virus — what I fault them for is the inadequate response to what is clearly a public health emergency, one which any casual observer could have foreseen coming to our shores based on the information coming from China and other parts of the globe currently faced with outbreaks of COVID-19.  Instead of hoping for the best, yet preparing for the worst, the only thing I’ve seen is an attempt, particularly by this President, to engage in “messaging”.  Not telling the truth has made the situation worse!

Additionally, a few other questions:

1. What is the specific timeline for testing those with symptoms of infection?
2. What measures are in place to ensure marginalized populations in this country (i.e. homeless, uninsured, etc.) get the testing and care they need if they show symptoms, given that healthcare in this country is NOT a public good?
3.  How are we ensuring that first-line personnel (e.g. first responders, ED/ICU doctors and nurses) have the PPE and other tools needed to protect themselves and care for patients?
4. Have healthcare facilities across the country made provision for dealing with surge capacity?  What protocols are in currently in place to deal with a public health emergency?"
2020-03-08 4:13,"To the present time the incidence and mortality from the coronavirus across the globe and particularly in the USA simply do not merit the attention they are getting from the press. As of tonight  the number of Americans who have died from having this new virus has to be put in perspective i.e. more of your fellow citizens have died in the same time period from, for example, accidental gun shootings, murder, armed robbery etc. Thirty thousand citizens of the USA die every year from gun related deaths.  Where is the panic over that statistic.?"

The Trump administration is working around the clock to lessen any damage to Trump’s re-election hopes while the president vacations.  The misinformed virus panic buying has already taken hold.  Masks of any kind, hand sanitizer liquids are gone.  When thinking about masks, remember an average hospital uses thousands every day; how far are 12m of single use masks going to go?  Unless Dr. Trump and his mixed messengers get on the same page and start planning for this attack, worse outbreaks than those in Italy and China will be happening here."

America is the Indispensable Nation, and only American leadership, working closely with our allies and trading partners, can fix these problems.

""The [response of the] Trump Administration ... is extremely discouraging.""

I agree with that statement, though I note that I've never counted on any government official -- and I don't plan to -- to protect me from a virus. Frankly, it never even occurred to me that I'd look to Donald Trump, or anyone else, for protection. That said, I do think health insurance companies should be heavily leaned on to provide free flu vaccinations, and that the federal government should foot this bill for anyone who doesn't have health insurance. One way or another, flu vaccinations should be free, thus encouraging them for the roughly 50% of Americans who don't now get them."

2020-03-08 4:02,"There is nothing that the Trump admin. has done orcould have been done differently. Unlike, China which can change rules and enforce restrictions, curtail travel and contain the virus, USA is slow and politics comes in the way of enforcing public health interests. In a multi-pronged approach to eradication of any virus, being able to accurately test the presence of a deadly virus in a person is very critical. 

2020 is election year, politicians from both parties had their own agendas. The Trump admin. wanted to project that they were doing their best and what measures they were taking were along standard practices and protocols. The Dems and the media were fear mongering causing panic and hoping against hope for a recession as the first nail in the reelection of Trump. 

Everyone involved was seeking lime light and governors are trying to exploit the situation to grab a piece of the golden pot of 8 billion $s. Decisions and information spread was being made on the basis of incomplete knowledge and unknowns about the viral infection. 

I have spent more than half my life studying viruses to know that what you don't know or don't want to admit to not knowing can be the detrimental factor in decision making. After 30 years and multi billion dollar investment passed by bipartisan politicians in the US congress why do we not have a vaccine that could provide sterilizing immunity or a cure, against HIV?  Throwing money without a sound scientific basis does not get you too far."

Trump can’t even make testing available with 2 months lead time. It won’t be long until China blocks travel from America. They are getting it under control won’t want us bringing it back to them. The virus will be bad, but the societal collapse in the USA will be devastating. 
It took just 15 days from first case in Italy to closing all schools in Italy. We live in a country of two working parent households that uses schools for daycare. By mid-March half the American workforce will be staying home from work to care for their children. Trump’s small government, low tax economy will be crushed.

      The political debate over Obama-care, ""Medicare for all"" and other health cost issues should remind all of us of the public's great interest in medical costs.

      Is the patient's cost for getting a test likely to discourage [our prohibit]  some who need the test from getting  tested?

If he goes into panic mode, then his base will panic while the rest assume he's exaggerating.

Now, this Uber driver in Queens went to an emergency room, and now 50 health care workers have to self-quarantine because they may have been exposed. Why, why did DiBlasio insist that in NYC and in NYC alone, people should not call, they should go??? I thought that was outrageously unclear and irresponsible.

At the end of the day, all the information or misinformation from the White House will not matter, your neighbours, friends and family will. Find the will to cut through the toxicity of this political environment in this period of time, and see people not as Democrats and Republicans, but as human beings. This virus sure doesn't distinguish between the two. 

I'm not arguing that this administration didn't make serious mistakes and still continues to do so, but besides calling your Representative and Senator, and taking personal precautions, there's nothing more that can be done by any one individual now. What I'm saying is that when COVID-19 inevitably spreads to all corners, don't risk living with the fact that you let a 73 year old man on Twitter get between you and your own humanity. Don't let the last memory of your liberal aunt or conservative father sickened by this virus be a political fight over 280 characters. That would weigh on you forever."

No surprise that real doctors are muzzled by Republican's and Trump in a medical emergency as the political witch doctors prescribe what has so far been wholesale poison and propaganda designed purely to maintain a grip on power. 

Oddly Trump's casual honesty of admitting he'd trade the lives of Americans for poll numbers might be a truth too far. 
As Americans die, he lies and Republicans stand by their ""man"" toying with politics.

Trump blamed PR's lack of preparedness and crooked politicians for an ineffectively tragic response. Those of us who remember recall Trump saying that ""around 15"" people had died -- when indeed it was thousands more. Expect to see the same with the coronavirus here within the U.S. He withheld disaster aid to the island, and demonized its leaders.  He is doing the same thing now by calling the governor of Washington ""a snake"" in the middle of this disaster. 

Just another frame in this American horror of a presidency. At age 70, I am not trusting a word from this White House...and now am skeptical about the muzzled scientific experts in the federal government giving me the infomation to survive."
2020-03-08 11:19,Trump is trying to keep the number of the infected down instead of accepting reality and doing what he can to help all Americans. Ignoring numbers is showing he does not take this seriously and that he doesn’t believe is science. This is all about his image and his re-election effort above all else. It’s sickening to see pictures of him wearing his red “Keep America Great” hat during his tour of the CDC. How are people okay with him being a walking billboard for re-election? I’m ashamed and embarrassed that he is our ‘leader’. Let’s not even start on Pence’s qualifiers.

People getting sick, its about him, so dont help them, or raise warnings. 

Till not helping them is then about him. So then lets form a late-day task force, and take credit for its then 3 days in a row daily meetings. ""See how great I am!"" 

And then make sure everyone on that task force, ""mentions how great I am every other sentence, especially you Pence! You own me your unending adoration, or else...its out-ski!""

Trump will never see anything as nothing but a threat to how great he believes he is, and how he believes the public must see him. Its I'm great 100% of the time, and that great means I'm the greatest of all time. 

Even the panic will be spun to make him feel great. See, never before have people been more worried, this is a record of panic. And its mine!

Somewhat less than half of all Americans are likely sure the president is telling them the truth that the epidemic is a hoax, the virus no more dangerous than a cold, and that anyway, the virus will ""miraculously be gone"" by April.

How are we going to find community based disease spread if we refuse to test those people that are representative of that? Is this a political move to keep the numbers down? What are we doing here? Who and what are we trying to protect, the People, or Donald Trump’s Narcissistic self image and Stock Market, because I am pretty sure that ship sailed! Why are we not testing those in the Community that are symptomatic? It is medical malpractice bordering on criminal not to be doing this.

2020-03-07 23:37,"A few observations:
1. Americans pride itself on its democracy and condemn China for its ""vile dictatorship"". Yet, these events seem to show that Amerians rely on their president for everything and everything revolves around the presidency, blaming Trump for everything as a consequence (setting aside the issue of whether it is his fault). Contrast this with China. Provincial officials took immediate drastic actions once they realize how serious it is (Yeah, I know, the western press kept harping on the police incident re the doctor who first raise the alarm as if every human must be perfect). Then, recall also how the western press even mocked and ask where is the Chinese president. Remember?
2. China is also blamed for not ""cooperating"" with the US experts initially. There is a serious Johari Window issue here. I apologies if this sounds insulting but Americans do give an unfortunate impression, rightly or wrongly, of being bossy, domineering, talk too much, argue excessively, egoistic with their opinion even when ignorant. So, is it not understandable the Chinese, who tend to get things done rather than talk endlessly about it (see how they build hospitals out of nothing in 10 days) avoid americans in crisis resolution?
What happens if apocalptic climate change threatens mankind with extinction? Will Americans continue with endless talking, arguing, debating, opining in the name of free speech and democracy?"
2020-03-08 0:33,"Here we are on the cusp of an impending pandemic coupled with clueless leadership from the White House.

I am currently in Spain where I hope that the Spanish government and EU is more proactive than our golfer-in-chief who is more concerned with the investment markets than our well being.

In all this and much more we cannot find a coherent word about collapsed immunity in the elderly and the rest of us. But this is where it starts. Immunity In man, livestock and wildlife has been hammered by man. Covid 19 offers proof. 

We can wash hands and avoid facial touching. That will help though unconscious gestures will control. 

We seem unable to ask what matters. For example, should parenteral be in use where antibiotics are concerned - with but two exceptions: H. Pylori and C. Difficile? Are we trashing our gut microbiome with pills made to kill bacteria? Is our gut biome essential to our immunity? 

Why do we permit tetracycline use orally in livestock to control anaplasmosis? What does this do to the gut microbiome of beef as it causes obesity in cattle? Does it cause obesity in us? 

Dr. Fink understands immunity. She knows mtDNA and immunodeficiency. We have long ignored our most important elements: gut immunity. 

Those with strong immunity may do well now. The use of antibiotics by mouth affects gut immunity. 

Start there. Subcutaneous application works.  But try to get a needle. It’s almost impossible. See your local hospital ICU. They have it."

And therein lies the problem. If we cannot trust government to give us timely accurate information we begin to panic. And that panic whether warranted or not, is a direct result of ALL of his lies that took place before the virus started spreading.

In addition, we have a man-child as president, who judges everything solely in terms of whether it makes him look good or not. And as a result of his ego, and the  mismanagement of information more people will perish."

 Trump, once again true to his narcissism, is incapable of thinking beyond its short term effect on his political fortunes.  He would let thousands become ill & die from the virus before allowing any appropriate response to the outbreak which might (as a byproduct) scare some people away from voting for him.

 This is what happens when a POTUS treats the instruments of government as tools to be wielded primarily as weapons against one's political opponents instead of protecting the interests of the American people.

Before Jonas Salk, people feared the summer, the time of Polio epidemics. Before  vaccines cities were very adaptable at fighting epidemics. When there is no vaccine there is only one way to stop an epidemic and that’s quarantines. Salk and his fellow scientists changed the world. The population of the world grew exponentially after vaccines. 
  in many ways the Corona virus is a wake up call, we need more scientists and banning immigrants hurts in that the child of one of those immigrants may be the next Jonas Salk, whose parents immigrated from Eastern Europe.
  Something much worse than Corona is coming , the death rate for Corona is very low though the panic it is causing is very high. Science and scientist like Salk changed the world, we will need scientists in the future to save it. Because Corona is showing what  an incredible weapon a virus can be.

Hearing  that the ""Test is beautiful, like the letter was beautiful, ....it's perfect"" is just plain alarming; as in not inspiring any level of confidence in its accuracy by this president. Conversely, reading of nearly the same exact accounts had a decidedly different feeling: pure chaos. It's as if this were a dry, thoughtful version of everyone being under a major panic attack. And nobody knows what they are doing.

If we are getting mixed messages from just the reporting about all the activities being conducted by our all our officials in both public and private sectors, then how is this Pandemic ever going to get under control? 

So far the Chinese solutions are so drastic that the 'Cure being worse than the disease' cliche as seriously being asked. Now Italy is trying similar methods while our own country is quietly shutting down, except for the pandemonium on Wall Street.

She left Eastern Europe, alone, at 20 only to sit on a ship in New York harbor wondering if she would pass the health tests to get in. 

She was denied the vote and so was her daughter, until Grandma was 40 at suffrage. Now we see voter suppression is back with a vengeance.

In contrast the US had plenty of advance notice given that we could observe China, and still we continue to stumble badly - not following any of the basic protocols of how to manage a crisis (Pence as point person is much better than Trump, though the latter continues to sow havoc).  Not to mention Trump’s dismantling of our preventive health architecture, and trying to take a cue from Xi by visiting the CDC - only with his MAGA hat on! 

So we’re the laughing stock of the world now, worthy of an F."
2020-03-08 3:42,"Well, the cat is out of the proverbial bag. There is essentially no hope of containment. Even though this will not result in deaths on par with the 1918 flu, the economic catastrophe awaiting us all will define this era. The question is whether our political institutions will survive. And I wonder if people will finally realize how suicidal it was to ""elect"" a vulgar, reality-TV circus huckster, and place him and his minions in control of our nation's destiny. Time will tell. But the clock is ticking fast."
2020-03-08 10:18,"Because officials cannot upset the president, there is no credible public data released that would help to characterize this outbreak.  We do not know the denominator for understanding positives identified in testing.  How many tests have been administered?  Of the people tested, how many are symptomatic? What are the transmission routes for clusters of cases?  Which demographics are at highest risk?   Have there been clusters of unusual spikes in pneumonia cases?  Were those clusters tested?  Answers to these other questions would underpin public messages and support communities in making prudent decisions for mitigating transmission and care of those afflicted.  It is possible CDC knows the answers to these factual questions but is not allowed to release them for fear of angering or upsetting the president.  A confident, competent president would have led with the provision of truthful information so that other domains of our society like transport, education, finance, and so on would be able to operate prudently, safely, and without panic.  It is appalling that these Cabinet and NSC officials cannot operate truthfully with the president because they don't want to upset him.  Officials should be able to speak confidently to a leader when issues of health and safety arise Their driving force -- including the role of the president -- should be to do their business in service to the American people -- not to the erratic emotional state of a president."

If we would have known sooner our health officials could have reacted in a manner more closely related to the symptoms and spread of the disease. If you’re not aware I will tell you, do United States is at the beck and call of China. They are central to all commerce in the United States. They receive more than 85% of all raw materials to conduct manufacturing. They control much of our pharmaceutical raw materials and that includes antibiotics. You may not like Donald Trump but he was right about moving manufacturing back here, closing the borders and bringing our companies back to America where we can control production.

Here's a novel idea, for a novel virus-how about the truth?

Deep down, even Trump supporters know they can trust their lying eyes more than Trump himself.  Every death, every infection, every new quarantine...each school closing, each new order cancelled, each job lost because the president is more interested in keeping his numbers low instead of keeping supply chains open, more interested in politicizing something real than in fighting it to save the lives of the citizens he theoretically serves...these chickens are coming home to roost.

Eventually, reality will hit these people over the head with a frying pan...and they'll actually feel the pain when a loved one of theirs adds to the president's numbers...and they will have nobody to blame but themselves, for choosing an alternate reality where lies are the currency stoking the economy of greed, in which ""the market"" means more than any human life."

For leaders to act in this way is a crime against humanity. Everything proposed by Trump is too little and too late. There is no tax payer funded healthcare system in the US and the relief fund proposed to tackle Coronavirus can never be effective if the testing and treatment of this virus is not freely given to all.
We have our own effective son of Trump here in the UK, who was missing from the UK Parliament for the whole of January and only held an urgent meeting of his  cabinet last Monday, when everyone was told that the Government was trying to contain the virus and everyone needed to wash their hands. Now within 6 days the number of infections has jumped to over 200 and 2 people have died. The grossly incompetent Johnson Government is now moving to delay measures and are reported in the UK press to be looking for NHS volunteers, to act effectively as cannon fodder, to fill in for the tens of thousands of vacancies and 20 billion pounds of cuts created by 10 years of Tory  austerity. You cannot substitute an unqualified volunteer for a doctor or nurse anyway.

At least in the US in 2020, you can vote for change an elect a Democratic President who will put humanity before profit. We are now stuck with the Johnson dictatorship who will be responsible for the deaths of large numbers of the population."

Tacky is the best thing you can say about it - at least it wasn't quite as bad as Melania's jacket.  But where is the help for people who will not get paid while they are quarantined or sick?  Why announce tax delays for companies that don't pay taxes but not for Americans who need help in the good times and don't have a lot of safety net to fall back on in times like these?

Part of this is a dilemma of Trump's own making. He spent weeks convincing his base that the coronavirus is a hoax created by Democrats and the news media, so many of them now won't heed advice to take precautions, and may readily spread it. Some don't believe the virus even exists. With Trump's 15,000+ documented false or misleading statements, a significant proportion of the population views  anything coming from his administration with skepticism.

Government leaders are always obsessed, so obsessed that they readily choose to lie to the people rather than tell the truth.  Trump is doing it now.  Other political leaders of both parties and all political philosophies do it.  So also are media and even readers who comment on these pages.  

For example, there are no N95 masks available for the regular American public to protect themselves from this China virus.  The inadequate supply has been redirected to medical workers and to the government hoard for government officials.  So, the CDC, the US Surgeon Gerneral, and media like the NY Times 
carry articles by doctors and other medical ""experts"".  All claim that N95 masks cannot protect regular Americans at all but in the same breath claim that the same N95 masks do work well to protect medical workers.  Their preposterous claims insult our intelligence.

Why aren't there enough N95 masks for regular Americans?  It is because the government has allowed selfish American mask manufacturers like 3M to save a few pennies per mask by building factories in non-ally foreign countries like China instead of making more masks here in America.  And now when disease and death threaten the entire US population, we have no masks because those American masks made in China are now being worn by Chinese citizens instead of being exported to the US when need was low."

All of the automation that makes our lives easier to get back through immigration certainly wouldn't make most people uncomfortable, they are all anxious to get home at that point, or in a hurry to catch their connections. Nothing impeded our progress, only the one question. We are so far behind in this effort. From the contagious nature of Covid19, it's clear we don't have enough information to determine the actual statistics.

I strongly believe WHO better, but that requires drastic measures seen in war; unfortunately, many scientists are politicized, they must follow a country's political and economic agenda. On wednesday, a virologist in Switzerland (with only 113 cases) said something like ""we should aim at slowing down rather than contain"", a preposterous statement, but as a Swiss I know that my country will place economic matter first.

I do not agree with  WHO recommendation against closing borders: WHO three reasons not to: a) flows of information, b) flows of services and products, and  c) economic damage. The first two in my opinion can be overcome, the third is inevitable and requires a government and population ready to sacrifice something.
Countries that have closed borders like Turkey, have been successful in slowing the spread of the virus, so is Canada with strict border controls and quarantine; Islands also fare better. Switzerland didn't even had control at the borders when monday it opened them to 70000 cross border workers from Italy; cases jumped from 20 to today 336 cases in a week.

It's critical that it is handled based on facts, not propaganda. 

It requires expertise, not braggadocio.

It relies on a well functioning healthcare system with universal access for testing and treatment services. 

It demands leadership and cohesive message to the population.

It has to be managed competently and transparently  to instill confidence in the markets and businesses.  

It can only be handled with global cooperation and communications among countries.

They have also requested that their citizens not travel to other countries right now.  I was concerned that they would not allow me entry into the country and then what would I do.  

President Trump was correct to close our borders to China and not a moment too soon.  We may have to deny others if it continues.  We must all be on our guard and take the proper precautions like washing our hands and staying home when sick.  We should refrain from shaking hands and hugging and instead use the elbow bump.

Health care providers are most at risk and absolutely require these when dealing with patients who have infectious disease or who are immune compromised.

Alternatively , please leave the building to cough.

Do not make fun of people who wear masks or take safety precautions . 

Hong Kong , a country that has actually experienced SARS which this virus is very closely related to , and for which there still is no vaccine , states that while it is not necessary or recommended  for the general public to wear masks that health care workers , food preparers , those living with and caring for immune compromised individuals , those who are sick or have a cough should wear masks in addition to washing your hands etc

I have asked my staff to take their temperature in the morning and have posted on my website for clients coming in to please take their temperature at home and not come in if they have a temperature of 100.4 or over.

If there are 86 community cases in Washington, the infected population is actually more like 1,800 or even higher. The unconfirmed cases are still spreading the disease.

The good news is the epi curve appears to be sigmoidal. Meaning: the infection rate will accelerate more and more until a certain inflection point then the infection rate will slow down. You'll eventually plateau. Everyone who was going to get the disease either already died or already survived. It's an S-curve. You see these often in natural rates of change.

It is almost now completely believed that the Spanish flu originated in the United States.

The US government under Woodrow Wilson basically lied to American citizens by insisting on not telling the truth about what was happening or how bad things really were. This is not a conspiracy thought. It is well documented. It is a fact. That attitude of shielding or more accurately, lying to the public and hindering the press led to a much worse situation. Granted, how medicine was practiced in 1918 was very different from today. There were no icu wards or antibiotics. But the fact still remains that a big reason for the spread of that disease was a lack of communication, a lack of honesty from the highest office in the United States, the President of the United States. Lets hope that mistake is not repeated."

But now we have leaders who sow fear and panic, and criticize anyone who doesn’t jump on the bandwagon. You will have to forgive me if I am not going to panic over the Coronavirus. Maybe if we were talking about Ebola I would be nervous. Or the Spanish flu that killed 50 million people and more soldiers than combat did during WWI. But the only people who really need to worry about this flu are the same people that have to worry about getting the regular flu or even the common cold, people who, because of their vulnerability, we should be concerned about. But for the majority of us it will mean an inconvenience for a little while. So I will not be stockpiling canned goods or water and I won’t be wearing a mask"

Here is another warning, stop politicizing the coronavirus. Congress and many local politicians, including democrats have failed. As this pandemic grows the failure of local democrats in large cities will become more apparent. 

Trump will also tout how his action in banning people from China helped. He will also show how his cracking down on entry into the country has helped and the open border policies of democrats would hurt.

As this pandemic grows there will be more anger over porous movement in and out of the country. Democrats always lose on that issue. Politicizing the coronavirus is a dangerous step."

I am five years younger than Donald Trump.
Having seen him get caught in lies hundreds of times, I’ve NEVER heard him explain his “error” or apologize for his untrue claim. Trump lies. He shrugs. He blames others.
In the matter of the coronavirus outbreak, the president’s lies, errors and misleading statements simply continue. By the values with which I was raised, Trump has disqualified himself from being a gentleman, a dignified man. No decent person would want such a man as a friend. He is a naught but a pitiable wretch of the lowest character.

For three years I have been in shock that such a deceitful scoundrel could be elected to high office in our country. I have no idea what it is his supporters see in Mr. Trump.
In our current crises — global warming, out of control health care costs, the coronavirus pandemic, the polarization of wealth, the unethical behavior of the Republicans in congress, rampant corruption — D.J. Trump is ever part of the problem, never part of the solution.

Count on Donald Trump for nothing in finding solutions to the problems we Americans face. Nothing at all."

Sadly, Trumps' blunders, now too many to name, are starting to obviously kill people. Trump ought to shift his permanent residence from Florida to Kansas, where he can suitably blend in with the ""Flat Earthers,"" chanhing his name to that of one of Galileo's detractors.

How many intubation mechanisms do you think are available in the US? How many ICU nurses?

This is why it's so important to have sufficient testing, and to act immediately to cut off a hot spots.

That's why it's not ok to propagate the message that it's just another flu and just carry on as usual. Stop letting your politics and Fox News nonsense drive our policy. We have a reality TV host at the helm, he will do whatever his base clamors for.

After towing the official line for three weeks, the facility has now broken ranks to describe what is really happening.  Residents are dying with CoVid-19 symptoms but not being tested.  Nearly a dozen people have died without ever being transferred to a hospital.  More than 70 staff have fallen ill with CoVid-19 symptoms but NONE have been tested due to strict CDC-imposed testing guidelines that remain in place despite VP Pence's statements to the nation.  The facility has inadequate supplies, inadequate staffing, and inadequate support from health authorities, but the number of confirmed CoVid-19 cases is under control due to the lack of testing those who are ill, dying, and dead from it.  Families cannot take their loved ones home because no one is allowed to enter the facility.

The facility loyally echoed the Trump Administration line for weeks, but eventually, it seems, enough is enough.

In a way, it's just like the Republican game book. You think they won't be so bad until they get in a position of power and then the infection spreads from the White House to the Congress and to the Supreme Court and before you realize how sick you really are the entire body politic is in real trouble.


As the saying goes, ""A fish rots from the head down.""


Give the public health and infection disease control experts the resources and authority to confront this pandemic. The politicians should just listen to the experts and follow their instructions.

Without a test that’s widely available, you can’t know who’s contagious.

Without knowing who’s contagious, you can’t know whom to quarantine.

Without knowing whom to quarantine, the virus inevitably spreads, and spreads, and spreads....

The White House, without (1) a readily available test - (2) that’s available to every community nationwide - (3) that can be used for thousands of people every hour - (4) and that doesn’t produce a large percentage of false-negative results - is impotent in the face of this pandemic. 

The White House has none of those 4. It is impotent. Its charade is going to be exposed in a matter of days, at the most. The “fake news” denials it uses against all truths it doesn’t like won’t work in this situation. The coronavirus doesn’t listen to Trump, and it won’t be bullied by him."

After a visit to the states, Dr Higgins developed a runny nose on an internal flight from Denver to San Francisco on February 27 and then flew from San Francisco to Melbourne (Australia) on flight UA0060 arriving at 9.30am on February 29.  His ""cold"" cleared up and he returned to full-time work as a GP seeing over 70 patients and two in an aged care facility.  He had a swab taken on Thursday, almost just as a routine thing,  and was amazed to find he did indeed have covid-19. The  state health minister stated that she was 'flabbergasted"" that as a medic, he had not been more circumspect about returning to work.  General practitioners are united in their call for an apology from the minister.  She is accused of scapegoating the doctor and not showing support for frontline health workers.  This is all going to get very ugly.

One should not judge the PM too harshly for  lately offering ""thoughts"" as consolation to victims of the latest human crisis.

He keeps God out of the blame list.

Allelulia!

Lack of effective governance by PMs and Presidents are not matters solved by  prayer.

They were right to do so. It seems that the  CDC has become a primarily political agency. Why would China trust agents from an unfriendly government?

And sadly, we are also about to witness our deeply insidious  culture of entitlement...rear its ugly head like Methuselah.

Will we be our brother's keeper? Or will we stand in fear? Will we seek to protect and care only for ourselves? Do we believe our money - status, power, success - puts us at the head of the line?   

Our support of countries around the world - and how we react here at home - will be a true test of our American Spirit in the coming weeks and months.

If we are wise, we will find out what we need to know, turn off our smart phones, and turn away from the relentless news cycles. We will go about taking care of ourselves and our loved ones, and we will actively practice kindness and generosity wherever and whenever opportunities arise. And...we will refuse to stand in fear as many hours of the day as we possibly can.

Perhaps then we will remember that without our humanity...nothing else we possess is of any real value."

This is what happens when a narcissist claiming to be a very stable genius is in charge of the country.  The machinations reported here remind me of the movie “The Farewell” about a family arguing whether to tell a beloved matriarch that she is dying of cancer.

Don't believe a word he says about the virus as he has already sunk his credibility. It was jaw dropping when he said not to bring the ship passengers ashore because it would increase the numbers statistically and he likes the numbers where they are. What?
Yet even more inexplicable and frankly shocking was the health official turning to him with a straight face and complimenting him on his supposedly decisive action. Huh?

2020-03-08 4:35,"Trump is more concerned with how he is perceived than with the health of the American people.

Trump repeatedly lied about the extent and potency of the COVID19 virus.
Pense lied about the number of testing kits available.
Trump drastically reduced funds for the CDC, and eliminated the Global Health Unit of the NIH.

Trump's  incompetence in the handling of this outbreak is staggering, and infuriating. Trump's lies and blunders have undoubtedly lead to an outbreak that is worse than it could have been. We need a president who will be honest with the American people. We need a president who cares more about  the health of the American people than his political concerns."
2020-03-08 7:09,"So it is unclear if it’s Trump's gut feelings and elitist view that dictate his beliefs, or is it just a no holds barred immature power game he plays to win by deriding anyone or anything that could belittle him? (probably a contagion of both)

The real power given to Trump comes from the people and their institutions and can reverse as the writing on the wall becomes more apparent to most independent, free and untreasonable thinkers and doers, and the fog clears for some of his captured hoodwinked followers. 

If you believe that Trump should be given the benefit of the doubt, then understand by his actions that he will never reciprocate such action and as the greatest expounder of false facts and misleading innuendos he will willingly throw you under a bus when it suits, while in the meantime, unwittingly or believing his intellect is greater than everyone including yours, will pander to you for his own benefit.

Trump ignorant and self-centred? are not we all? but take care for what you wish for, better take the option that is open and considerate before you become trapped by your own bias and flung to the ravaging dogs

It should be apparent where I stand; I wish only that you engage and treat my thoughts with critical thoughts of your own as we all should in regard to Trumps tweets speeches and announcements along with anyone claiming to represent us. I hope that you are honest with yourself and form your own conclusion and path"

China did not react slowly. They built a hospital in 10 days. They shut down Wuhan. They got on top of the virus.  China has clearly told the world that containing this virus is all about speed. Now their numbers are going down. 

Nothing in the Trump led USA suggests rapid action. There is clear incompetence seen, and blind loyalty to Trump, no matter what. After weeks of reading posts by Fox news devotees who use the word a hoax and compare COVID-19 to the flu I shake my head. There isn't even enough masks and test kits. It's absolutely unacceptable and the worst part is, Trump saw it coming.

You have to wonder what they are thinking now, with a deadly virus ripping through the country and an incompetent president who gutted our ability to respond, has made the situation far worse by claiming it’s a hoax and contradicting medical professionals while installing loyalists over experts as point persons, and cannot refrain from using conman language even as Americans die (there is no test shortage, it’s a “beautiful test” for anyone who needs it).

I forgot--the United States is okay with throwing its citizens who don't have health insurance under the bus on a daily basis, so why should this be different? 

Maybe we should elect an executive who isn't selfish and stupid--if Trump were actually concerned about the welfare of our citizens and actually understood the public purpose of the executive branch (not a personal fiefdom to grant favors to loyalists, not a re-election machine) perhaps we would still have a robust global health initiative, perhaps he would have mobilized his team to create the ""bigger, better"" health care plan he promised, instead of cobbling together the response to the virus on the fly to a population only partially covered by health insurance."

2020-03-08 10:57,"The test, which takes hours, and is laborious, is not widely available. The White House lies when it says it is. Only a few thousand people have been tested.

Without a test that’s widely available, you can’t know who’s contagious.

Without knowing who’s contagious, you can’t know whom to quarantine.

Without knowing whom to quarantine, the virus inevitably spreads, and spreads, and spreads....

The White House, without (1) a readily available test - (2) that’s available to every community nationwide - (3) that can be used for thousands of people every hour - (4) and that doesn’t produce a large percentage of false-negative results - is impotent in the face of this pandemic.

2020-03-08 6:52,"Trump's rhetoric from the beginning in his rally said, "" Keep the sick and infected out "". The talking point from his sycophants Larry Kudlow, Kellyanne Conway is, "" The infection is contained "". The strategy appears to be no test, no disease and therefore contained. The experience of the rate of infection in Wuhan was published in NEJM showed that the doubling time was 7.2 days, i.e. the number will rise from 1000 to 2000,2000 to 4000 every 7.2 days. The number reported from other countries may be even shorter than that. Of course the confirmed cases have to rely on availability of the diagnostic kits.

South Korea the confirmed cases jumped from 30 to 7,041 with 44 deaths in less than 3 weeks, Italy has 5883 cases and 233 deaths, and Iran has 5823 cases with 145 deaths,

US has double digits of confirmed cases to over 400 and 19 deaths in less than 10 days with limited diagnostic test kits.

Don't tell me lies or avoid the truth because you're worried that I'm too stupid to understand or will only panic. That I realize I can't trust what you say and have to look elsewhere and read between the lines just makes me distrust everything that you tell me!

Case in point; masks. To tell the American public that we shouldn't buy or wear masks as they ""don't work"" is a lie. When you follow that up with saying that we need to reserve the masks for medical personnel so they can wear them, well if masks don't work why would they bother to wear them?

Instead, it would have been so much better to discuss WHEN masks should be used, what kind works, HOW to effectively use them and why hoarding them in high numbers is harmful to the effort to fight the virus. Asking people to refrain from buying up 1,000 of them to resell on eBay for $50 each is a reasonable message to put out. But not that they don't work. 

Also, we have no idea if this virus will weaken in hot weather or not(and some parts of the US are many months from hot weather anyway). I wish President Trump wouldn't put out messages like this as well as other attempts to prioritize the stock market and the economy over the health of the country. Tell us the truth!"

This could and should have happened at the CDC and at countless other times, including cabinet meetings.

Future generations will conclude that gutlessness was the defining characteristic of this era."

After all, if you do no testing  at all  there are no confirmed cases and the US would surpass every other country in the world for avoiding the virus.

As Trump pointed out most of those sick people will get better anyway, so we have to conclude that there is no reason to test. The logistics of minimizing the crisis requires test data, of course, but Trump and his followers will never, ever realize that.

Trump is both incapable of even any trace of human compassion, and incapable of visualizing the complexity of managing any sort of crisis.  It is much, much, much more complex than merely skewing today's headlines to make himself look good.

There is a bigger picture and Trump can't see it.  It took a massive crisis to illuminate exactly how unfit Trump is for the job of President.

Unfortunately, I have become so cynical about the ability of the average voter to keep himself informed that I think this catastrophe of ignorance and incompetence will unseat the Donald and his ruling family, but his 35% base will still be left puzzled as to why he couldn't blame it on Democrats."

2020-03-08 8:37,"“'China nice-talked it for a month,' said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security who was working on the coronavirus effort. ‘""Oh, well, thank you for the offer. Blah, blah.""’”

Seems to me the Trump admnistration has been ""nice-talking"" the pandemic itself. It preaches the need for transparency to China and Iran, but doesn't practice it at home. No, no, that might hurt the reelection chances of il Duce, or simply make him look bad. ""And a man in my position can't afford to look ridiculous!""

By its PR sanitizing, dismantling of infrastructure and mishandling of preparedness, the administration has blood on its hands."
2020-03-08 15:14,"There is confusion in the White House? Shocking !
Forgive my sarcasm but of course there is confusion, why wouldn't there be ? Trump views every problem, every occurrence only in how it affects him. Not how it affects the citizens of the country. Rather than meet the problem head on with a rational ,measured response Trump has opted for denial and blue skying the situation. If that doesn't work expect phase two of his response,- name calling, bullying and finally calling it fake news. What could go wrong ?"
2020-03-08 15:20,"A rather long winded way to saying that OUR President is incompetent and only concerned with HIS needs.
Add in the Trump/GOP hatred of science, government and the general public and what could go wrong?

I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that Trump checked the political affiliation of these people before making that statement."
2020-03-08 15:06,And the decision made by this administration as to what to tell the country was the time tested response they've used before..............it may get worse. It may get better. We'll just have to wait and see.
2020-03-08 15:23,"There is no Captain on deck, no one at the helm and the crew is absent or useless. Unfortunately, that describes the USA at this point. It is even possible that the Captain is about to abandon ship, since he cannot and will not do his job. Not only is our country not a leader of the world in this crisis, we cannot even take care of ourselves. But this level of neglect is a Trump specialty used in all crises. His level of incompetence is now very apparent, but is it too late?"
2020-03-08 15:04,"And still Trump i s more concerned about political calculus and appearances than the safety and health of the American people.   And to make it worse, he has steadily eroded access to health care and will argue against the ACA mandate to the Supreme Court, further destroying the ACA and throwing millions more off of their health care.  This illustrates the need for universal health care be it Medicare for All or a system that combines Not For Profit insurance with a public option."
2020-03-08 15:14,"The chief of one of the largest fire departments in the nation once told me that most fires could be contained with a gallon of water if they could jump on the fire early enough. 

For the last two moths when the Coronavirus erupted in China we have seen America’s public health “fire department” slow to leave the fire house.   Trump bungled it. More interested in a positive spin when the experts said otherwise.  And let’s not forget Trump’s earlier effort to cut the budgets of the national public health apparatus. 

Trump isn’t qualified to play with toy fire trucks let alone direct the full federal public health apparatus in America."

I'm not listening to him.  I can't understand why highly trained medical doctors aren't laughing at him & pushing him off the stage."

They’ve lied about everything and anything from day one, from stupid inane things like inaugural crowd sizes to the nature of crimes committed by its officials.
Anyone expecting them to have a change of heart or to suddenly turn it all around will be sorely disappointed.
The lies, misdirection and subterfuge will only get worse. 
Individuals like the ones infesting this administration make many of their decisions based not just on ineptitude and inexperience but more often on greed. 
They have too much to hide and too much to lose, now more than ever and if it takes risking a nationwide pandemic to keep them in office, to them, that’s a small price to pay.
They know that themselves and their families will get the best medical treatment and beyond that, the rest of the population is on its own... 
“It’ll work out...”
They will lie and misdirect, obstruct and interfere regardless of the consequences for the citizens of this nation.

I live in Seattle, where there are so many confirmed cases, and I got sick this week with the symptoms of coronavirus (which, just to be clear, are the same symptoms as the flu) and they would not test me because I'm not in a high risk health population and there aren't enough tests (they asked me to self quarantine and to treat myself as if I had COVID-19 despite not testing me). That tells me that there are a LOT of people out there like me.

I have no faith in the numbers we're receiving, and as a result I fear that we are not being nearly as responsive as we should be, and that the outbreaks will be much worse due to that lack of information.

I blogged about my experience this week. I'm still stuck at home, hoping to go back to the classroom on Monday, but concerned that school is still happening at all. My district has been clear that if there are identified cases of coronavirus they will close schools, but if they won't test us then how can they have that information?! <a href=""https://kristinadahl.blogspot.com/2020/03/self-quarantined-in-seattle.html"" target=""_blank"">https://kristinadahl.blogspot.com/2020/03/self-quarantined-in-seattle.html</a>

2020-03-08 6:05,"It has been said by historians that we always prepare for the last war. And we have. And, we continue to invest 600bn$ yearly to keep it that way.

But the current war, the one that has just landed on our shores, and at a 3.4% death rate, will kill 11 million Americans, what of that? Well, we handle it with underfunded public health offices both at the state and federal levels. Trump even went so far as to gut its federal offices and then give tax breaks to the super-rich.

The twin towers attack killed about 3,000 Americans and we responded by going to war, one that is still going on and is estimated at 1.1 trillion dollars. Compare this with the 8.3 billion dollars has allocated for COVID-19, which may kill up to 11 million Americans.

A disconnect in priorities and spending? You bet. We can't get enough test kits. We can't get enough PPE.

And the White House is worrying about messaging? OMG! Please get rid of these stooges in November and do what the servile Congress should have done."

That means if you do the math for 10 cycles, one person infected with the flu will turn to 13.8. For the corona it will increase from 1 to 59,049. 

We are still in the beginning of the outbreak but already saw in Korea and Italy that once you reach a critical number of infected people it will be difficult to stop the outbreak. What have we done so far? Pretty much nothing. The economic consequences will be enormous and the toll on human life, specifically the elder very large. The corona virus is about at least 20 times deadlier than the flu.

Can it be any plainer than the noses on our faces that Donald Trump is DANGEROUS to this country and its people?? That statement alone should have made Congress running for cover under the 25th Amendment. My god, what does he have to do to have our Congress take,with the utmost seriousness and solemnity, steps to remove this president??"

When Trump imposed a travel ban for entry from Asia, the Governor of Washington and many businesses complained that Trump was overreacting. Washington was said to be well prepared for any projected emergency. Now, suddenly, Washington is complaining that the travel ban came too late and because the State really isn’t prepared, they need special help from the Federal government. Gee, I wonder why Trump is upset."

2020-03-08 15:56,"So many good thoughts but I would add that this too points out why we need good government...seems basic but, much like insurance, you don’t need it till you do.  We should have a vaccine, particularly for health care workers, we need testing equipment and materials at the ready. This is exactly what comes from competence and the role of the federal government as the lead for states in their effects.  Instead we see “Captain Chaos” for whom everything is political and about him (Campaign hat at the CDC is grotesque)...and while this makes me want to vomit on a daily basis, we must all learn a serious lesson from this crisis, excellence matters! Imagine “No Drama Obama’s” response, thoughtful, reassurance that while serious, we have this under control...and you’d believe it.  Last thought, I’m worried that this virus has been around for a while longer than thought, and not only have they bungled the response, they missed the inception. Think what that suggests..."
2020-03-08 16:07,"What some people call mistakes, other people call progress. I believe Trump and the Republican support for only the Rich and famous is a mistake.  They believe it is progress. If all people can't gain a good life by way of their own efforts in the community they can't progress. We are shut out of information, education, and truth these days.  The ""Deep State"" that Trump and his supporters oppose and is  demeaned by them has a place in our history. It is my opinion that Trump's State is a ""Shallow State"", shallow in experience, shallow in science, shallow in truth, shallow in competence, shallow in plans for the future growth of freedom, shallow in the acceptance of responsibility for failure, and shallow in claiming responsibility for changes they did not accomplish. Given a "":Shallow State vs a Deep State I choose the deep one, reaching back to Jefferson and Madison: the one that said if you give your government the opportunity to rob you, use you, and hurt you, be prepared to be robbed, hurt, and used.  Take the Deep State over the Shallow State."
2020-03-08 15:36,"In 1721 a British ship arrived in Boston Harbor, its crew showing signs of small pox.  Too late to act, the disease spread.  Debate raged over whether to use a new technique, already practiced in Turkey, China, and parts of West Africa, to contain the spread of the small pox:  inoculation.  The Reverend Cotton Mather, a leading Boston citizen, became convinced of the efficacy of inoculation after learning from one of his slaves from West Africa, named Onesimus, that he had been inoculated while in West Africa against small pox.  Mather advocacy of inoculation resulted in personal threats it appears from folks who believed that any attempt to interfere with small pox was going against God's will, or, further the spread of the contagion.  Nonetheless, inoculation was adopted.  Fifteen score later, I am amazed (not really) at how the Trump administration fumbled and stumbled its way through the opening stages of this potential calamity."

Of the many lies he has told, this one may prove to be the most consequential. I’m not sure if there is anything they can tell the public that would be believable. As the number of cases rise and the death toll increases, the Coronavirus is telling a different story. And those numbers don’t lie."
2020-03-08 15:59,"Alarmingly, America has a President focused on how a public health emergency will either negatively or positively effect his own image in this election year and secondarily it’s consequences for the stock market. For President Trump it’s not a humanitarian issue. We have a President who over the last three years has shown himself to be troublingly deficient in all aspects of leadership. Now faced with the coronavirus his incompetence has risen to new heights, become front and center, with his inability to reassure Americans in the midst of a world wide/national crisis that he and his administration can expertly and constructively deal with what’s demanded of them. What we have here now in America with this issue is a failure of faith. As a nation we are confronted with the inability of its leadership to reassure Americans they know what they’re doing."
2020-03-08 15:41,"Since long before Trump took office, it has been clear that most of the time he talks through his hat, and the rest of the time he lies outright.  Reassurance from such a figure is like Macbeth's ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""

Just think of the other things Trump assured the public of.  (1) We have a terrific health plan in mind, better than Obamacare and less expensive.  Everyone's going to love it.

Where is it?  The Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency.  Where is the wonderful health plan?

(2) We're going to dedicate enormous resources to repairing crumbling infrastructure in the United States.

Where is it?  The Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency.  Have any infrastructure efforts actually happened?  If they have, everyone's keeping it a deep, dark secret.

(3) The corona virus outbreak is well under control.  It's nothing to be alarmed about.

Except that people are dying.  Except that there are not enough testing kits.  Except that the virus appears to be spreading over the globe and throughout the United States even faster than Trump's lies, if that's possible.

The two Republican council member dolts who just follow him around like velcro dogs refuse to address public health concerns created by Trumpy the con artist.  No public policies are made, but lots of photos, tweets, fb posts are made by the Town Supervisor.  Hey GOP, Trumpy said ""We want to terminate Obamacare because it's bad. Look, we're running it really well, but we know it's defective. It's very defective. We got rid of the worst part. And that was a very important thing. You know getting rid of the individual mandate was a very important thing.

2020-03-08 16:01,"I just listened to the complete news conference that took place at the CDC yesterday. To his credit, Mr. Trump comported himself in a proper manner, with the exception of his silly statement comparing the perfection of the test kits for the coronavirus to the perfection of his transcript and phone call with the Ukrainian president.  

What I think many people commenting here do not understand is that Mr. Trump’s  popularity is sourced to the fact that he speaks just like a normal human being. Voters can relate to him. And he does not really care what his political opponents think of him.  Sure, he tells lies all the time, he exaggerates, and he miss represent reality. 

But that is really nothing new. I understand that the Washington Post has filed a freedom of information act request to get copies of Obama administration memos, prepared at the White House and reportedly approved by the president himself, which instructed government personnel to fabricate stories about success in Afghanistan.

This hype about the coronavirus is to my mind a tempest in a teapot, and like the impeachment fiasco, it too will pass.  Warmer weather, in which the virus cannot survive for long, it’s just around the corner.

 And November is not far away after that."

Public health means nothing to him.  Expertise means nothing to him.  After all, he (according to himself) has a unique understanding of medical issues because he had an uncle who was a physicist.

There's a lot of verbiage here that is exhibit A for a group of reporters who are afraid to tell the truth straight out.  Instead they weasel and waffle.  Keep in mind that this is a man who doesn't want a cruise ship's passengers to get off the ship because the numbers of people with the virus in the US would rise.

The economic impact is a separate issue related to the disruption of supply chains. Trump's tone and response has been spot-on based the reality of the situation rather than the hyperventilating, breathless reporting the Times now specializes in. We are a nation of 330 million with a relative few handful of cases, most, as elsewhere, not serious. Ask any doctor, as I did when I had my annual physical a few days ago and two doctors who were at a family gathering yesterday. They will tell you, as the administration and all CDC officials have said, that this disease is much ado about nothing. The Times does a great disservice is helping to sow panic about a situation that will soon end with very little physical damage to the vast majority of the population, news the Times will certainly ignore.

Who are these people who “tell” Trump things? Why are they never named? Why do they tell him such ridiculous “facts!?”

And the whole show began with the director of the CDC obsequiously praising Trump, North Korea-style!

A reader would be more informed simply by watching the video online - and take in the full insanity on display - than by the Times's constant straining to make it all seem somehow normal, lest they be accused of impartiality.

Instead, scrambling, and speaking nonsensically, like a spoiled child about Democratic hoax, Trump has pretended to be in charge of a crisis for the citizens of this country.  Then, because he feared responsibility, and ultimate blame, he sprung this responsibility on Mike Pence - who has no medical experience or national crisis management experience. To top it off, they had Alex Azar, a Trump appointed man whose medical experience is composed of being an attorney for Big Pharma, at the helm of the US Health and Human Services trying to explain the work of a newly found crisis solution.  

One says coronavirus testing enough for 75,000.  One says for a million.  One says test some of the ship passengers, another says bring ‘em in and test ‘em all.  Dr. Birx gets appointed to counsel, but she speaks nothing.  She stands in the group, lips sealed, as we expected at least her, an Obama appointee, to give us hope.

In the meanwhile, the numbers mount. Healthcare workers declare no leadership or equipment. Pence poised a lottery on who gets tested and what criteria to be used.

In the meanwhile, the deaths climb, the cases climb, the public is totally confused and doing each their own thing.

knows the devil he's doing.  Now, however. with the incompetence 
of both him and all his toadies who fear correcting him lest he turns his vengeance on them----he is literally causing deaths.

2020-03-08 3:40,"I realize this is a new virus, something other than the flu, much like AIDS was a new virus. Panic has set in. 

We are encouraged to get a flu shot with no guarantees that if you get that shot, you won't get the flu. If the numbers of flu cases and related deaths were published, there would be no panic even with those numbers in the tens of thousands, nothing more than a shrug. AIDS 
can be treated. We're used to that. Life goes on as usual.  

Our response to this new virus is not that much different than in 1918, quarantine, avoid crowds, etc.  The main difference is that it is spreading quicker, or reported quicker and hopefully contained quicker.  It's also been reported that this virus escaped from a Wuhan bioresearch laboratory,  If that turns out to be true, that's a whole other kettle of fish and a different kind of panic will set in.

People, hoarding toilet paper and bottled water won't help.  Use common sense.  Wash your hands.  Stay home if you are sick.  Don't spit  on a city street or sneeze on someone.

Here's a sample of his past approach to public health crises:  

""Redfield's early engagement with the AIDS epidemic in the US in the 1980s and 90s was controversial. As an Army major at Walter Reed Medical Institute, he designed policies for controlling the disease within the US military that involved placing infected personnel in quarantine and investigating their pasts to identify and track possible sexual partners. Soldiers were routinely discharged and left to die of AIDS, humiliated and jobless, often abandoned by their families. In the 1980s Redfield worked closely with W. Shepherd Smith, Jr. and his Christian organization, Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, or ASAP. The group maintained that AIDS was ""God's judgment"" against homosexuals, spread in an America weakened by single-parent households and loss of family values."""

As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria, worldwide spread of the new virus.""

Someone who attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last week in National Harbor, Maryland, has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, and the state's governor says anyone who attended may be at risk.

Five hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago you knew that humans were alone on this planet.  Imagine what you’ll know tomorrow.”

Donald Trump and his downscale appointed surgeon general and head of CDC (not the scientists and experts lower down) think their supporters are quite stupid, and that as long as they are allowed to hate and discriminate openly and freely, no one else’s lives count.  They are to lie, steal, cheat in ways minor and major and to do so without any fear of correction, much less retribution.  

In 2016, the majority of Americans knew exactly what they were, and voted accordingly. Despite that, they command the levers of government.  When most of their crimes were merely financial, or involved enabling and encouraging hate and bigotry among the faithful, all was well.  Now their crimes will involve Americans, even MAGAts, dying.

Ideally, the head of the national security council should have convened in late December 2019 what is called a ""deputies committee"" meeting of senior representatives from State, HHS, CIA, CDC, Transportation, Commerce, and any other cabinet agencies that conceivably might have had a role to play in developing a USG strategy to address all aspects of the ""crisis.""  All aspects includes the production of testing kits and preparations for handling US citizens overseas to development of an information strategy that would be put in place uniformly throughout the government's vast bureaucracy.

It is unfair to pin this real or imagined ""crisis"" on Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence.  The US government is staffed with thousands of experienced career civil servants who make it their business to prepare for precisely this sort of situation.

Right now anybody who feels sick should stay home till they feel better, you can get anything you need from Amazon, or Walmart, BJs, etc, they deliver.

The second thing is not to panic.

Testing is now the key. Either get more test kits or hire thousands of labs to do it. Corona was inevitable, the people who recover, which will be most will create antibodies that protect them from future incursions. If we didn’t have this outbreak, we would have had one eventually.

Look at 9/11.  Sure it was a terrible event.  But nothing that was even close to toppling this Republic.  Several buildings damaged or destroyed.  Few thousand dead.

I'm sure the American death toll to COVID-19 will exceed the death toll for 9/11.  It's not a disease that can be eradicated like small pox.  But considering the current global death toll to be something like 3400, out of 7.5 billion,  that's 0.000044736842105% it's not a threat in the scheme of things.

It's unfortunate that the government did not prepare for this.  Personally I would love to see 3-5% of areas of certain major cities tested (voluntarily of course) to see what is really going on.  For example, test 5% of a large government building I work in where people travel in from all the suburbs to work.

Last week, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, warned lawmakers not to downplay or minimize how severe the coronavirus risk is for vulnerable Americans. Speaking at a congressional hearing, Hotez explained that the coronavirus “is like the angel of death for older individuals,” AP reported.
According to Vanderblit University infectious diseases expert Dr. William Schaffner, “The clear message to people who fit into those categories is: ‘You ought to become a semi-hermit.

“If there’s a doctor that wants a test, if there’s somebody coming off a ship like the big monster ship that’s out there right now, which, you know, again, that’s a big decision. Do I want to bring all those people off? People would like me to do that. I don’t like the idea of doing that.

I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.  They would like to quarantine people. Now when they do that our numbers are going to go up.  The tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. This is not as perfect as that, but pretty good.

I like this stuff. You know my uncle was a great person. He was at MIT. He taught at MIT for, I think, like, a record number of years. He was a great supergenius, Dr. John Trump.

Please investigate the reasons for the test kit delays and shortages. This is such a fundamental need that had an easy solution yet is still a massive failure. Right now, CDC or NIH is the  media's bad guy because they released a defective kit, and released it late. That is a minor error compared to the big ones. There are many leads and avenues for investigation:

Who decided not to use the WHO test kits and why?  

Why did the CDC decide to reinvent the wheel and design its own test kits?

Did someone (Azar, former head of US operations of pharma giant Lilly) see an opportunity for US companies to make more money from the crisis by making their own test kits instead of the WHO kits?

Was testing delayed and/or manufacturing restricted because Trump didn't want the true numbers of infected to be known?

A comparison with the South Korea response on testing (overnight ramp-up of manufacturing to produce hundreds of thousands of kits, and currently tens of thousands of tests done every day) might also be useful."

The airlines (who will be bailed out at taxpayer expense) won’t consider refunds for tickets booked before 3/1/2020 to any country without a level 3 advisory.  We the people will have to bear our financial losses or risk our lives, health or a miserable quarantine.  This is Russian roulette.  Never thought the USA could sink to such mediocrity.  There is no leadership, only censorship.  Shame on you all in the Trump administration, just a bunch of liars and cowards.  The economy will eventually recover, so will our 401(k)s, but death is forever."

2020-03-08 16:42,"On Friday Trump also said something to the effect that the testing would quickly be almost perfect, just like his perfect phone call to the Ukrainian Prime Minister (that got him impeached). 

We are in serious trouble, folks."

2020-03-08 16:16,People are saying they do not trust what the Trump administration is telling us about the coronavirus?  Can we trust what China is telling us about their coronavirus numbers?  They were not forthcoming when it started in December.  They would not listen to the experts and the reason it has spread to over 90 countries.  I trust America more than I do communist China.  They have a very bad record on human rights abuses.
2020-03-08 17:58,What bothers me most of all is that Trump is playing golf this weekend at one of his courses in Florida. Would any current world leader be so brazen and clueless at a time like this? Reminds me of Emperor Nero playing the harp while Rome burned.
2020-03-08 17:00,Those who hate President Trump will never believe anything he says and criticize him unmercifully while In office.  They have done this from the beginning of his presidency.  I think the Trump administration is telling us the truth.  The doctors and medical staff would not lie and neither would our president.  Then again I support our president.
2020-03-08 17:17,"Unfortunately for Trump his pattern of prolific LIES has permanently erased his credibility. A particular case in point was his bizarre fantasy about hurricane Dorian. While his high-visibility reporting that the storm was on path to Alabama at first seemed like inadvertent ignorance, his insistence on his hand-drawn weather forecast after he had been repeatedly told it was false only proved that Trump was not misinformed, but lying. 

Consequently, we cannot believe a single word that comes out of Trump's mouth, especially when it comes to public health and safety.

Trump is an autocrat that is concerned with his political image above all else. He might look better than a liar if he took action to eliminate the current shortages.  He declared a false emergency at the southern border in order to build his wall. Now he should declare a true emergency in public health, and order government production of massive quantities of test kits, personal and household sanitizing supplies, and face masks.

Meanwhile citizens must take care of themselves. Everything will be fine with informed, thoughtful precautions, not because Trump said so."

I was utterly shocked.

It was like an audition for being Trump's next Health Secretary.

I mean, WOW!

Politicians politicizing the current health crisis that's about to thoroughly test America's (from over here) ridiculously expensive, inefficient and unequal Healthcare system - probably the leading issue in this year's election, after the character of Jerome Adams' boss, the Fake President - is bad enough.

But 'America's chief doctor' Adam's shameless PR for Trump really is the bottom of the barrel.

As a 67-year-old male with a history of heart and lung problems I'm VERY relieved to be confronting the challenge of the pandemic that Adams more or less dismissed, here in crazy communist Europe, with an efficient functioning healthcare system, led by expert doctors, rather than aspiring politicians!"

America and the world is watching the epitome of the most perfect incompetence unfold in real time, not the carefully edited content to maximize ratings of a reality television show.  Unable to use his standard go-to safety net deflection of current stock market performance, circus performer Donald Trump is staring down at the erupting volcano of Coronavirus before he tentatively steps onto the tightrope as the boos drown out the cheers.  Where is that unflabbable Congressional Republican cheerleading squad now?"

Anyone remembers the scandal that hit the CDC several years back? They have been plagued by incompetence and a lack of proper equipment for decades.

Wait until parents see the waste in education and the missing funds that were suppose to be used for upgrades. Our lack of internet access for many and outdated tech will be blatant when these schools are actually forced to do remote teaching. The number of teachers who barely know how to turn on a computer will be shocking. Then there are all the hospitals shuttered or turned into condos with huge areas lacking medical facilities.

This coronavirus will expose a lot of greed, corruption and incompetence."
2020-03-08 17:01,"The Trump administration must take a back seat to the advice of the medical and public health experts now. This should have happened earlier, but to our great regret, it did not.

It is personally appalling to me that the President played politics with the testing issue, trying feebly to cast blame on President Obama.

Many Americans are worried as I am; will my elderly parents survive? Will my adult child with asthma survive the coronavirus? 

At this dangerous time it is especially galling and upsetting to hear Trump's nonsensical and self-serving lies. Please allow the health experts to speak directly to the American public."
2020-03-08 17:23,I am sure our government has been told more about the conditions of the coronavirus than China is telling its citizens.  The Chinese communists have some of the worst human rights abuses in the world.  They censor their media coverage and are not to be trusted.

Instead, we get propaganda and political slurs from Trump; allegations of hoaxes, claims the media is using covid-19 to get Trump, Trump calls Governor Jay Inslee names for telling the truth; reassuring, isn’t it. 
I’m sure I’m not the only person who realizes that a lack of test kits effectively conceals the extent of infection, and that Trump’s clown show has also figured that out."

I read that the US was ordering 500,000 respirators. Seems a little late when the world will need 10’s of millions. Do we even make any here and where are the parts sourced?"
2020-03-08 18:55,"The White House response to this public health menace is consistent with Republican responses to other social concerns:   They really don't care about the problem--until it affects them personally.  Same-sex marriage?  Cheney had a sudden change of heart when his daughter came out.  Abortion?  Well, when the mistress of one of these Republican adulterers gets pregnant, there have been plenty of instances when the man encourages/pays for the abortion.  The list of examples goes on and on.  So who in the Administration actually needs to contract Covid-19 such that there is an appropriate response?  Pence?  Trump?  Who?  Because the only way we will see true concern is when one of them is affected."

2020-03-08 16:50,"News Flash:  Trump makes another boneheaded remark.  And media loves it!   Since this article is about truth, why isn't anyone talking about how this is a two tier virus: Tier one is the young and otherwise healthy.  Tier two are the unhealthy either by age or underlying health condition.  

Tier one has very little to be concerned about.  They should go on with their lives as before, but more aware about the value of good hygiene to ones own health.  If they catch the virus there is a 99.9% chance their symptoms will be no worse than the flu. This is 90% of the population. 

Tier two is another matter.  Fortunately it is only 10% of the population to begin with.  But if they get the virus it's very serious, including the possibility of death, in about 15% of them (stats from Korea experience).  Fortunately the vast majority of tier two folks are retired, so they can become semi hermits for awhile without risking their livelihood, if they value their lives.  If not, that's a personal choice no more than choosing to be a smoker is.  At least they won't be making it any worse for the young and healthy if they choose to ignore their own well being.  

 Baby boomers have already made life so bad for the young they're looking to a communist for answers.  Let's not ruin what's left of it for them to save some aging boomers and beyond that don't even care about themselves enough to stay off cruise ships."
2020-03-08 16:54,"Trump wants to keep the appearance of virus less than it is even if it's a lie, which has and will cost many lives.  Yet, he has a chance of winning the election again. More than medical care for all, we need quality education for all.  Hillary was completely qualified for the job, Trump has no qualifications for the job.  How is that not understood by so many?  I can see why dictators don't support education."
2020-03-08 17:21,"So, some didn't too much care for Barack Obama when he was president.  Some say he was a failure. Think about that. 

Could you have done better with Trump on the outside, hollering that YOU were not born in America; McConnell on the inside proudly saying: my job is to make sure YOU  serve only one term.  And yes, there was this third fella, named Putin, the last leg of the trifecta, to harm America.

You may not have cared for Obama.  But let's face it. He's better than these three dudes I just named, individually and collectively. 

He would have assembled an effective team, people with intellect and character, to deal with this virus. That we know, based on his experience against the odds. 

Luckily, we have Biden now, to undo the damage that's been done to our democracy by the current administration.  We've a mission come November.  Let's do what we must do."
2020-03-08 16:18,"The fact that one of the CPAC attendees has been diagnosed with the virus is a head shaking irony. I would like to see a campaign ad juxtaposing this discovery with footage of Mulvaney and others speaking there nattering on about ""Democratic hoaxes""."

After being in a public place, wash your face, your eyes, the insides of your nose, and your hands with soap and water.  Think about washing off after being in a dust storm.

Stay home if you have a runny nose, cough.
Go to a designated urgent care that have test kits if you develop a fever. Ask for a mask and gloves to protect yourself and others when you get there.
Every PATIENT and every healthcare worker should be wearing mask and gloves to avoid spreading the virus on counter tops, chairs, exam tables."
2020-03-08 18:12,"This is basically a cold virus. No matter how the government spins it, I don't see how we can possibly stop the spread of it. There will never be enough testing kits. We will never be able to control the population's movements, and in the long run, neither will China. The virus will just re-enter that and every other country. You can't lock down entire societies permanently. For every known case there are now likely unreported/undiagnosed multiples. We will not be able to disinfect our way out of it. There are likely thousands or tens of thousands who have had symptoms who will avoid being tested for fear of their freedom.

So there's actually nothing Trump can say one way or another. His best course of action was probably to try and say as little as possible. But of course, as usual, he can't stop from running his mouth. It's not like he had much credibility to begin with, though."
2020-03-08 18:37,"How can you not conclude that the administration is staffed by the  Trump reelection team. We thought we had Americans serving America and its citizen in their time of need.

2020-03-08 19:35,"As someone who works in Public Health at one of the leading Universities in this country, I first want to say that the COVID-19 caught the USA flat-footed and it came here through travel and then incidental transmission. My great grandmother died from the Spanish flu which was made far worse due to the inactions by Woodrow Wilson, similar to what we are seeing now. The simple truth is that we are presently behind the curve and when we can roll-out testing much more extensively we will understand more about the N of COVID-19 in the USA. 

Our country is different from all others and the invocation of a mass quarantine is unlikely to ever happen other than keeping people on a cruise ship which will lead to the deaths of those most susceptible to this virus - people 70 and older or people with a pre-existing condition which the virus will attack. I pray for the best but prepare for the worst. I believe that all locations which house our seniors need a lock-down to help save the lives of the residents. My mother-in-law lives in a very nice place on Long Island with over 1000 residents. Introduce COVID-19 into this facility and it will be a sure death to 15-18% of those residents IF there was a hospital close enough to take on the resulting cases. 

This is what Trump does not understand and will not take heed. Read up about the Spanish Flu time cycles. It was the movement of people back then which made things much worse.

Just tell the truth."
2020-03-08 18:26,"I don't like the Trump Administration at all but in all fairness I think any administration would have initially made missteps though they may have been different. Generals always to prepare to fight the last war not the new  one that may occur. I believe that the Public Health establishment at all levels was focused on bio-terrorism for the last several years in reaction to 9/11 and they didn't anticipate a more generalized threat like a coronavirus. Federal funding was also more focused on BT rather than a threat like COVID-19. What is also worrisome is the lack of hospital beds for the number of very sick we may see from COVID-19. This issue wasn't created by the Trump folks but has been a multi year result of the focus on hospital efficiency, according to the current issue of the Economist has wiped out excess capacity in US Hospitals. We may need Army field hospitals  set up in big cities to handle the overflow."

Then she paraphrases Trump saying he does not want the US infected tally to increase. I would add another motive: He wants to be reelected. Remember, he uses the media to rally and reassure his nationalist base. By telling his trumpers that he disagrees with the science and would rather not risk contaminating a country he has already made ""great again"" with more sick people than necessary, he has a better chance of getting their votes in November. (Yeah, you can go ahead and interchange ""sick"" with ""brown."" To trumpers it matters not. They see both as threats."

I agree, I read a paper on the demographics of a group of thousand patients from Wuhan, analyzed in Lancet and the study was virtually useless information. I also heard that there are young people affected in Italy. So now we need to wake up and realize the trouble we are really in. Is the strain in Italy different. I am loathe to believe it affects smokers etc. This almost sounds as if certain people are genetically programmed to set off a cytokine storm and there is nothing in our medical arsenal to help them recover. In short folks, we have encountered a fatal flaw in our human program and now are in a load of trouble with this runaway reaction. In the UK there was a company a long time ago that was trying to manufacture a block that would affect this switch the ox40 receptor on the T cells and the ox40 ligand on activated B cells. A company named Xenova, trying to address the same problem encountered in influenza. Then they disappeared. I say anyone out there figuring this out, please work overtime."

Bernie Sanders is a socialist who will destroy our country and Joe Biden is a very confused man who has memory lapses.  He does not appear to have it all together.  

I think President Trump is doing the best he can under very difficult circumstances.  The coronavirus has affected over 90 countries.  I cannot remember when we have seen such a tremendous scourge.

233 deaths and 2% death rate means 233x 50 cases 3 weeks ago, or 11,600. The number doubles every 4-7 days, so they NOW have 90,000 or more. 

Italy only knows about one case in 20 despite intensive testing. They've appropriately closed down schools and shut down travel, but possibly too late.  The time to do that is when the FIRST known case appears, because at that point, there's 100 more cases you don't know about.

Like everyone else, Canadians were riveted on China's ability to contain the virus. Now that China seems to have had unprecedented success, according to the WHO, we seem to be facing a much greater threat across our border with the U.S.

We watch with growing alarm the lateness and ineptitude of the U.S. official response (all levels of government have had seven weeks to prepare); the confusion generated by sharp contradictions between the now-galvanized medical community and the foot-dragging Trump administration; and the inability of the country's central leadership to comprehend, never mind deal with, such a potentially devastating disease outbreak.

Canada's 5,525-mile border with the U.S. (including Alaska) is the world's longest and most traveled. A major spread of the coronavirus among the U.S. population means a similar spread in Canada's, with the impact being proportionally much greater due to ours being one-tenth the size. We hope the White House will quickly shift focus from the President's desires to the U.S. population's needs, but it's a faint hope."

The chain of command Trump destroyed was set up by Obama following the Ebola outbreak of 2014 to coordinate the several departments needed in an infectious disease outbreak. The NIH, CDC, State Department were designated the sources of scientific and diplomatic information and advise to the White House agencies: the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security. In response the the chaos of his response to covid 19, Trump said he could quickly hire more doctors. He still doesn't get it; it's a coordinated chain of command, not just individual doctors that we need in a pandemic. 

I wonder why the Democrats and, especially, Biden who loves the reflected glory from Obama, have not made use of this information. Those of us volunteering with grass roots groups to flip the Senate, keep the House and get out the vote would appreciate some help in getting Trump out."

Trump, who claims to be the most brilliant, most successful business man on the planet (maybe for all time), should be aware of the aphorism, ""you must measure to manage"".  Left unsaid is the obvious point that the measurements should be accurate and shared with everyone doing the managing.  

If individuals, households, schools, cities, states, and the government are to manage this ""situation"" they need to know the facts, the measurements, that allow them to properly manage. 

You can't make stuff up (because it's what you'd like to be true) and expect anyone to make the proper decisions about how to proceed.  Maureen Dowd's op-ed had it right - for Trump, he lives in a Fox News construct not unlike ""Westworld"" wherein Trump plays the man he hopes and thinks he is.  

Let's hope that Trump's version of Westworld gets canceled on November 3, 2020."

2020-03-08 16:29,Trump's final comment about liking the 'numbers' without ever referring to the humans who constitute them is reviling. He is willing to sacrifice anything to make himself look better. I think he'd like to deny that there are any cases in the US. He'll take personal credit for all good news & assign blame to others for anything negative. He's tried to gut the part of government that was formed to handle this type of crisis. Take a look at the persons he has put in charge of those departments. The initial response from the Trump administration was way too passive.
2020-03-08 16:47,"The threat and the model for progression is certainly clear enough to know that the US faces a major health crisis — just a matter of time before the hundreds of cases already present burgeon into a full blow epidemic. 

The stumbling and incremental ratcheting up of the federal, state and municipal level responses was inevitable given the stark failure of leadership from the very top in Washington from the get go. 

Add in the blatantly politically driven damage control in place of expeditious, coherent and forthright action based on a worst case model and the prognosis for containment becomes uncertain at best."
2020-03-08 16:53,"What to tell the public?  It's simple: the truth.  

While we don't want panic, we also don't want falsehoods, like saying that the virus isn't serious.  We don't want Americans left to suffer on a ship rather than getting good care in a safe facility.  We don't want healthcare workers getting ill because they don't have proper personal safety equipment. 

We don't want a president who ""can live with those numbers"" while not wanting to bring Americans home because the numbers would double.  Trump would get far more respect if he told the truth and allowed information to be freely disseminated without political spin.  Even the Surgeon General uses spin. That's not reassuring."
2020-03-08 17:49,"No doubt the Trump White house is mishandling the communication about the virus to Americans. My worry is much more on our federal agencies who are performing worse than third world countries. Even 2 months after China alerted the world about the novel Corona virus, CDC did not have a functioning test and until last week did not allow anyone else to do the tests. FDA only woke up last week to loosen the rule for the private labs to be permitted to conduct tests for this virus. WHO used the German test to use world wide, all because CDC slept at the wheel and at the very least should have ditched their own trials and adopted the German test protocol. FAA also failed badly in certifying the Max 737. Only after China suspended the license and the world followed did FAA follow Chinese FAA. FBI too hid some information from the secret court FISA court. Yet Trump has asked the Republicans for a ""clean"" extension of the act so FBI can secretly access American citizen data  even when there is no evidence nor suspicion. Congress is not doing its duty and   Americans continue to be polarized and are willing to forgive the agencies if their party is the administration. Here too the comments are only about the Trump administration. Not a single federal agency is up to the mark these days. FEMA failures were blamed on Bush. But the malaise in our over bureaucratic federal agencies continues."

Sure it’s making a lot of people sick and is seemingly far more deadly than the usual flu infections, but that is not what worries Trump. The reactions for reducing the threat to people is threatening economic activities and most worrisome, stock markets. This is what Trump finds most frustrating. He is up for re-election in just eight months and a recession will remove his main argument for being re-elected. The sooner these reactions to the pandemic are over, the less of a problem for Trump. He deals in perceptions not in real accomplishments, so appearances are about what he focuses."

The lateness and ineptitude of the U.S. official response is alarming (all levels of government have had seven weeks to prepare). Sharp contradictions between the now-galvanized medical community and the foot-dragging Trump administration are generating widespread confusion. The country's central leadership seems unable to comprehend, never mind deal with, such a potentially devastating disease outbreak.

Canada's 5,525-mile border with the U.S. (including Alaska) is the world's longest and most traveled. A major spread of the coronavirus among the U.S. population means a similar spread in Canada's, with the impact proportionally much greater due to ours being one-tenth the size. We can only hope that the White House will quickly shift focus from the President's desires to the U.S. population's needs, but it's a faint hope."
2020-03-08 16:19,"The first priority in everything the Trump administration has done during this epidemic has been to protect his re-election prospects.

Unlike the fake sycophant child that Trump has appointed, who feels it necessary to politicize and praise The Dotard (undoubtedly by Trump's direct order), a REAL SG would have anticipated this outbreak a LONG time ago (let's say about 3 years at least) and had the necessary mechanisms in place to actually contain it, and certainly to be able to develop a vaccine faster than we are now.

I am grateful that Congress approved emergency funding and that POTUS signed the bill. I am fearful, however, that, like everything else in this clown car of an administration, that funding will be held up if someone in the administration decides that a particular governor or state health care professional doesn't share/agree with/express the administration's views. I'm imagining the same sorts of scenarios that Puerto Rico experienced after the hurricanes, and like Puerto Rico, the consequences of neglect, incompetence and/or disagreement will be dire.

A particular case in point was his bizarre fantasy about hurricane Dorian. While his high-visibility reporting that the storm was on path to Alabama at first seemed like inadvertent ignorance, his insistence on his hand-drawn weather forecast after he had been repeatedly told it was false proved that Trump was not misinformed, but intentionally misleading anybody who would listen. 

Consequently we should not, and cannot, ever believe a single word that comes out of Trump's mouth, especially when it comes to public health and safety.

This autocratic president overruled the people, represented by both parties in Congress, to declare a false emergency at the southern border in order to build his wall. Now he should declare a true emergency in public health, and order government production of massive quantities of test kits, personal and household sanitizing supplies, and face masks.

There’s not going to be any containment, organization or planning.  And without widespread systematic testing, we’ll never really know how the contagion spread and all numbers will be estimates.  And the Trump Administration numbers will remain low, much lower than what we’re seeing with our own eyes already.  A little like Puerto Rico during Hurricane María in slo mo.

The ""preparation"" this administration has done thus far is to simply claim the problem doesn't exist, and to persuade his rabid base that the virus is a hoax. Under this ""president"" our federal government has done nothing but worsen the problem. Expect our ""president"" to continue to lie to us about this virus. Expect our ""president"" to continue saying it is all a ""hoax"", even though several hundred community acquired cases have already been documented in this country. Mike Pence as ""Virus Czar""? Positively Kafkaesque. 

And expect that the ""president's"" supporters will believe him. This means that 45% of our citizens will not take even the most basic of sensible precautions. Trump has primed tens of millions of his adoring fans as nothing more than disease vectors. If this virus spreads rapidly, they'll be to thank for failing to take the crisis seriously. 

So expect that the truth will not be reported. Expect that medical resources will not be available when they are needed.

Then the penny dropped that his fanatical base all loved their guns more than people, especially young people and Trump totally caved and reiterated previous support for the medieval IRA. So much for the caring Trump, gone in a puff!  Since then any sign of any caring Trump is invisible as is any sort of true Leader, a leader who can rise above partisan politics.  His behavior since the start of this coronavirus has especially reeked of cheap politics. To be fair, Trump had nothing to do with the cause of the virus and that should have been his cue to behave like a true leader.  Instead of letting the science and medical experts drive the response he has at first been in denial and then let his narrow political world vision drive the government response. Now thousands are at real risk! And putting Mike Pence at the top of the process is worse than farcical, especially considering his record.  Of course it could be worse, he could have appointed dumbo Donald Jr in charge. He would have shot all the infected people in a a cull.  Who can really trust Trump in a crisis now?"

Yes, it is causing some deaths among HOSPITALIZED PEOPLE who are tested for it.  But it is not uncommon for people hospitalized by flu-like symptoms to die.  It never has been uncommon.  The flu is serious and can kill.

With that said, I think that people are getting an unrealistic vignette of the real risks they face.  For most, the primary risks facing us today are obesity, smoking and alcoholism and traffic accidents.  Mental health is also a significant cause of deaths.  Coronavirus is a flashy topic but this may all dissipate in the next few weeks.  It is not yet worth all the panic.  Perhaps it is, and we should panic now.  Or perhaps the panic, and the damage it caused, will simply not be justified.  As always... don't let Trump emotionally trick you into losing a scientific argument to him.  He may be right."
2020-03-08 17:43,"This crisis was something Trump is unable to manage. 

Pandemics can destroy complex human societies. They are always caused by unfamiliar new life forms to which existing life has not adapted. There are no simple and well known ways to control them. People must learn and find new adaptions. This requires information and hard working through very difficult problems, sound thinking an intellectual honesty. It requires separating facts from fancy, courage and honesty not trying to dominate in relations with others. 

Trump has raised himself to be utterly incapable of confronting this challenge."
2020-03-08 21:30,"“A debate raged ...”.  

Hmmm. 

We live with news that follows Trump’s preferred style of tabloid journalism.  Granted, it generates more profit and satisfies the seemingly pathological trolling tendencies of the public.  Trump loves this,  Sadly, it applies to nefarious leaders of history, as well as the present day.  

For Trump, there’s less substance and credibility to “news” when it follows this path.  It makes him less accountable.  It also weakens the power of a well-informed citizenry.  (And it can be dangerous to argue or reason with passionate, mistaken groups or people).  Some companies love it too! 

As citizen-consumers move away from their first-world positions into second-class stations, political and economic powerhouses eliminate the tools of governance that represent the majority’s common interests.  Those arms-length mediation tools between government and economic activity are necessary. 

The citizen-consumer, in a globalized, first-world order, is the only thing to stand between the anarchies of dictators and self-governance.   

If people want the benefits of individual liberties and to survive on a global scale, what are the options?  Do we need to build systems of mutually assured destruction at the most granular levels?   Personally, I would rather that than some sort of Armageddon in the hands of a few."
2020-03-08 21:32,"All of the terrible things this article and the commenters are saying about Trump are true, of course, but he is still standing, despite it all, because of his vast legions of enablers...  Senate, Cabinet, SCOTUS, Fox, talk radio, voting base, etc.

Meanwhile, there persists a residue of polite ""both sides"" equivalence in some media coverage where accountability opportunities are missed all too frequently, in my opinion.

Thanks to this NYT article for turning the screw a little more...every bit helps, I hope."
2020-03-08 21:40,"Trump's lucky star of no vital crises for his first 3+ years is exploding before our eyes and he is proving to be astonishingly ill-prepared, ill-informed, and ill-tempered, treating it as a personal nuisance. We need leadership and we're getting smoke screens."
2020-03-08 21:55,"Mr. Trump has said recently that the ""fatality rate"" from the virus is ""only"" 3.4%. I don't have a clue what he's talking about and am left to guess where that number comes from.  Could it be a recent report - I think it was from WHO, but aren't sure. - that indicated  107,944 cases worldwide so far with around 3.4% of them resulting in death - so far?  But the same report also indicated that only around 54% of these 107,944 cases have ended in recovery - so far.  If this is where Mr. Trump's 3.4% comes from, - and I don't know that it is - it seems strange to call it a ""fatality rate"" unless none of the 40% plus who have not recovered or died, so far, remain at risk."
2020-03-08 21:56,"Hope we are all around, after the crisis is over, to hear what the scientists really think about Trump's level of competence, especially after--big surprise!--he claimed that all the doctors marveled at his understanding.
As far as I know, there is no known vaccine that prevents the kind of obvious, wanton and dangerous foolishness that Trump so happily puts on display.  Fortunately there are remedies for getting him out of the office to which he was elected by a minority of voters.  Let's hope the most obvious one works in November, now that craven Republican Senators prevented using a perfectly appropriate and called-for remedy."
2020-03-08 22:04,"To all you believers and followers of your messiah Donald Trump,  how’s this all working out for you?  Still falling for all his lies and false promises?  

I guess ignorance is bliss.  

Ignorance is one thing, stupidity is all together very different."
2020-03-08 22:05,"If, as geneticists in Japan and Taiwan assert, Covid-19 first saw the light of day in the USA and has been building strength since last September, then we are in for a replay of 2009's H1N1 outbreak, which had similar origins and lethality.

Is it any wonder that the Chinese refused admission to our officials? Based on the evidence of past international investigations, they probably feared that Covid-19 was another biowarfare weapon, created in our many purpose-built labs and released by our servicemen when they visited Wuhan for the Military Games in November. 

Now it seems that its origins are quite innocent: a weakened government agency, incompetence, lying, coverups, a wretched public health regime, and indifference to human suffering.

If this latter is the case the world, having witnessed our cruel and mean-spirited excoriation of Chinese health authorities (while every public agency praised them), will further discount our claims to leadership of any kind."
2020-03-08 22:08,I watched the video of Trump's visit to the CDC and paid special attention to Dr. Redford who was following Trump around like a lap dog.  He had this dumb smile on his face looking up at Trump that made my stomach turn. We've given this bunch control of our health and the health of our children.  God help us.
2020-03-08 22:25,"Why haven't there been polling with this question:

Do you trust President Trump to tell Americans the truth about the Coronavirus?

What would happen if the headlines were of how many Americans didn't trust Trump, and how many Republicans didn't trust Trump to tell them the truth?  What would happen if Americans read non-stop that the majority of Americans didn't trust Trump to tell the truth and that caused even more people who weren't sure to decide that Trump was not to be trusted?

I find it very odd that those polls aren't done by the media which has absolved its job to report the truth in favor of taking whatever coherent but meaningless statement Trump offers among his lies and presenting it to readers to make Trump look as coherent as possible."
2020-03-08 22:30,"None of this administration's sloppy response to this health problem should come as a surprise.  Everything this administration has done to stimee the truth and protect lies should have been a clue.

That end will come with the 2020 election."
2020-03-08 23:19,"How about telling us the truth?  Save a lot of closed door meeting time and respond like adults talking to adults.  How can we prepare and what should we expect?  Clear communication and hard facts are more likely to stop panic than rumors, misinformation, and random tweets."
2020-03-08 23:25,"The doctors, the medical researchers around the world, including the Chinese, are going to discover how to handle this virus.

On the other hand, dealing with Donald Trump and his delusional lies and stupendously ignorant and totally erroneous statements, is another matter.  There is really no good way to deal with abject ignorance, egoism and the astounding, mind boggling stupidity that spews from the mouth of the man child, Donnie Trump.

Donald Trump needs to go away.  The sooner the better.  All our lives depend on this."
2020-03-09 0:02,"Neither Donald Trump nor his ardent supporters seem capable of ""handling the truth"" as Jack Nicholson might say.  Trump lives in the self-created mental universe of his own imagined greatness.  Any contrary realities just aren't allowed in.  But, as Greta Thunberg recently reminded the EU, ""you can't make deals with physics"".  The COVID-19 virus will spread according to its own nature and, while we can slow its progress, it will be very very difficult to completely stop.  It certainly won't be stopped by Trump simply deciding what number of infections he can live with.  This is the president who removed the people charged with preparing for a pandemic.  So, if we are to have any hope of dealing with one, we will probably first have to remove him."
2020-03-09 0:11,"I honestly tried to watch Trump's first press conference about this with an open mind. As a school psychologist who works in a school district where keeping a sick child home is a luxury a lot of working parents can't afford, I really wanted to be reassured that our government was equipped to handle a national health crisis. 
The only good thing about Trump's responses was that he didn't slur his words for a change. I also heard some useful information about the process of developing a vaccine (as in don't expect one anytime soon), but that didn't come from Trump.  
Other than that, there was a bunch of confused statements and misleading information from Trump. He tried to blame the stock market's recent performance on the Democratic candidates, called Nancy Pelosi incompetent, gloated about his approval ratings, mocked Chuck Schumer for requesting more money to fight this virus, kept downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 by comparing it to the flu, rambled on about how frequently he washes his hands, lied about the mortality rate and disputed the 2% figure, claimed (without evidence) that his  travel restrictions have stopped the virus from spreading to the U.S., whined about being called a racist, and could not give a coherent reason for appointing Mike Pence to coordinate the administration's response to this.
I wasn't reassured. Not in the least."
2020-03-09 0:24,"When Trump was asked why in 2018 he had shut down his White House Directorate for Global Health Security & Biodefense that dealt with infectious diseases, he couldn’t justify it. Instead he stammered as he gave an incoherent answer. 

“Well, I just don’t think — I just don’t think that somebody is going to — without seeing something, like we saw something happening in China. As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially — not from the White House. I mean, you know, we don’t need a lab in the White House. But they saw something happening.”"

2020-03-09 0:41,"What to tell the public.  The very young Surgeon General today with Jake Tapper failed to delineate as nearly everyone has, what IS AN UNDERLYING 'CONDITION' which is susceptible to a fatal Covid-19 experience. 

Is it someone receiving chemotherapy for cancer treatment? 

Is it someone who has suffered sepsis in the past, and has blood tests results which demonstrate an infection in the past?  

Is it someone with intermittent bouts of herpes virus?  

Is it someone with MS which is chronic, debilitating, an on and off and then progressively worsening disease? 

It is someone with Parkinson's disease which is disabling, neurologically? 

Exactly why would someone with a ""heart"" condition, (what do they mean by that) and why would that person be suscepectible? 

Everyone understands that if a person has a chronic respiratory illness (there are many of those) that such individuals would be vulnerable to a virus infection of the lungs. 

But diabetes?  Isn't our population suffering from obesity?  Doesn't obesity and diabetes go hand in hand?  Wouldn't it make sense for our nation to go on a sugar diet, or sugar abstinence. 

Most sufferers of chronic conditions do not passively lie around but engineer their health with varied things:  exercise, specific diets, abstinence from specific chemicals (drugs, alcohol, allergens), and maybe even dietary supplements. 

The medical community which is almost never proactively preventative in its communications, should be now."

We are, after all, dealing with a situation where the data is imperfect.  Mistakes will be made.  No president will be immune from that.

HOWEVER

The real problem is that instead of an crisis being managed by a  President with a firm hand on the wheel who speaks to the American people with the calming voice of reason, we have loud mouth Uncle Ernie in the driver's seat of the  family minivan, telling his passengers to unbuckle their seat belts because he's a great driver (BEST EVER!) as he crashes into the guard rail and other vehicles (LOSERS!)......all while checking his rear view mirror to see if his image has been damaged."

There are plenty of Chinese-Americans/Europeans who detest the Communist rule back in the Mainland, but they're often caught between a rock and a hard place by Westerners who view all Chinese (and non-Chinese Asians...I mean who could possibly tell the difference, right?) as CCP cadres and attack indiscriminately, whether through words or violence."
2020-03-06 17:29,"Why is the US government so ill-prepared for Corvus-19 despite widespread knowledge of its infectiousness? It has fewer test kits than Canada at this moment.

Why is China criticized for the US government’s inadequacy?"
2020-03-06 17:30,China has lost all credibility of becoming the world leader it aspires to.
2020-03-06 17:33,China has been trying to rebuild the tributary system where other countries essentially feed the country with raw materials in return for manufactured goods.  The Asian version of colonialism.  The failure to contain the virus is going to cost the world hundreds of billions of dollars in costs and lost productivity.
2020-03-06 17:36,China should be pressured by the rest of the world to shut down permanently wild (and endangered) live animals markets. All major viruses of recent have originated from them.

However, that does not erase the fact that their poor initial response accelerated the spread of the virus within their own borders, which led to its later spread around the globe.

They could also try being magnanimous. Clearly their priority is fiercely protecting their reputation. Instead of “keeping score” on who treated them badly, their reputation would improve much more by admitting their mistakes, forgetting old scores, and committing to help any country that needs it. If entire industries are rethinking their choice to be so integrated with China, they won’t be able to reassure them by suggesting that the virus could have originated elsewhere but even if it was from Wuhan, we fired those incompetent officials already so everything should be fine."

Xi stood next to Obama on the White House lawn and stated point blank that China would not militarized the South China Sea. Now it's an arsenal.

The CCP exploit our openness and laugh at us behind our back. It's time to wake up and demand reciprocity. When it's not forthcoming, propagandists like Hua should lose their propaganda privileges, starting with their Twitter accounts."
2020-03-06 18:02,"China bashing became a favourite sport for some in West, and it is extremely ill informed.

Let's talk about few facts to illustrate how so:
1. Coronavirus started in China, that is an indisputable fact.
2. Chinese government banned wet markets after SARS on 2015, all it did is to move it underground. As long as there is economic need for it, it does and will exist. 
3. China quarantined entire provinces to slow down its spread and is putting all it could to developing a cure or a vaccine.
4. China informed WHO of its progress, findings and sick people from day one.

Diseases do not respect borders, ideologies, religions and skin color. 

This is time to respect each other and act in solidarity, not bickering. China bashing needs to end, because it is neither fair nor productive to do so."
2020-03-06 18:19,"In a year or so, it will be interesting to compare the infection rates across countries. By infection rate, I mean the total confirmed cases divided by population. If the Chinese numbers are to be believed, the infection rates in provinces outside Wuhan are a tiny fraction of a percent. The Wuhan infection rate is much much higher. Before casting aspersions, let’s see if other nations come even close to the low infection rates seen _outside_ Wuhan. All the data is at the Systems Science Center at Johns Hopkins. Of course there is a measurement problem since we don’t know the true count of cases due to limits of testing. But it is a start."
2020-03-06 17:16,"China still has millions of people locked up in Wuhan, now for over two months.  I suspect they have many deaths not reported, and many more infected.  That these people are receiving the food and care that they need is hard for me to believe.  Now that the coronavirus is active in other countries the humanitarian crisis in Wuhan doesn't seem to be a blip in the collective consciousness.  From what we know of the availability of ventilators, ICU space and medical personnel, most health care systems around the world will fall short in this pandemic with a resulting increase in mortality. I doubt, however, that other societies, unlike the Chinese leadership, will resort to locking people into their apartment buildings."
2020-03-06 19:13,"A challenge. Rather than indulge in more China bashing, why doesn't the West, and in particular the US, show them how it's done? While COVID emerged there, even enlightened Nature worshippers can bring something home (Hanta- Yosemite). The test is how such a crisis is dealt with, both to protect a nation's citizens, but also the world. So, are we able to show that a Western,  open, democratic, free market society can do better? Are there fewer lies and obfuscations? More transparency? More competence? So far, Team USA is faring quite poorly despite plenty of warning, time and information, compared to what was available to the Chinese at the beginning. Talk is cheap, let's see some action."
2020-03-06 18:58,"I mean I feel like most U.S. media has a bias toward CCP. I'm from Hong Kong, but I really support CCP's measures of blocking cities and greatly restricting traveling but not the silencing of press. You can criticize the CCP for silencing dissents as much as you want. But they successfully contain the spread of the coronavirus and possibly save millions of lives. Some people in the comment section say China doesn't deserve the sympathy. Truth to be told, I was shocked to see such a comment. Perhaps the CCP doesn't deserve the sympathy since they didn't handle this right at first. Nevertheless, we're facing one of the most dangerous virus in human history, I don't think this is the right time to talk politics. And Chinese people DO DESERVE YOUR SYMPATHY. They are dying and struggling. Don't let politics alienate us as we human beings are facing the coronavirus together."
2020-03-06 20:16,"Virologists say that open societies with open information and a non-hierarchical system are best to get in front of a pandemic.  

But governments can't do all that much about a virus.  Once it gets going and really takes off, a hierarchal authoritarian government is best able to move fast with the necessary draconian measures like barricading 50,000,000 people.  

This is no ordinary flu since the fatality for seniors is more like 20%, not the 2% average for all ages.  It's also very easily transmitted and may mutate to transmit faster.  The problem with any virus is it is a moving target that changes and adapts fast.

Because this virus has not yet ramped up in the US our response has not yet been tested.  We might find that China's health care response is far superior to ours, as our healthcare system is ranked 27th in the world."

It could be that it was spreading for months, maybe starting in early September or October, deaths labeled common pneumonia.

That having been said, after a bad start, China has effectively stopped the outbreak in its country, and its response recently will be seen as among the most effective responses, compared to say Italy or Iran, whose infections are spreading uncontrollably."
2020-03-06 19:31,"I remember not too long ago many people, including this paper, saying China’s lack of freedom and democracy allowed this virus to get out of hand.

There will be another dangerous virus, we have already had SARS,MERS,Ebola Virus and now COVID-19.How about all countries cooperating with the World Health Organization to set standards and practices-during my lifetime WHO led the successful effort to eradicate Smallpox from the world.Boasting and boosting leader’s egos moves the cause of better health in the wrong direction-we are actually all in this together."
2020-03-06 20:39,"I would like to read something in the mainstream press about the reports that the COVID-19 was bioengineered and accidentally released by a virology lab in Wuhan.  Supposedly, it has the markings of an altered virus.  If so, that would explain the CCP early reaction, suppression of information, etc.  

From what I have read and heard from people who actually know something about this stuff (not me), the concern is that the virus will mutate as it spreads, which would make it harder to fight.  The good news is that it may recede as the Northern Hemisphere moves into warmer weather."
2020-03-06 20:43,"The virus has been linked to China's unregulated markets selling wild game for human consumption.   This is not the first disease out-break which has been linked to that source.   However, the Chinese government has seen fit to indulge this market because of political considerations.    This calculus, although no unlike to United States catering to the gun lobby, has and will cost the Chinese dearly.   Hopefully, this will bring about much needed reform."
2020-03-06 20:45,"There is a huge difference between chinese in and outside China. As an ABC, I really wish the western world stop bashing us as root cause of the virus. We are all in this together and we speak freely among everyone about its virus cause and possible cures.

But unfortunetly, many medical research labs throughout the USA are under funded. I really hope people can come to there senses that its these advances in research and development that help eleminate these types of outbreaks. Way too much funding was wasted on things like the building the wall or war with iraq."
2020-03-06 20:56,Interesting how China's government's instinct matches Trump's: to treat everything as principally a PR issue. They'd both have a lot more of my respect if they'd stop putting so much effort into keeping up appearances and just let reality land where it lands.

Perhaps that's true of many governments, but the Western Democracies have a free press, and that means we can verify our governments' statements. We can't do that with China.  We have no idea how bad it is. Just look a the photograph of President Xi Jinping. It's utterly staged. Look at the body language of the scientists around them. The whole thing is a show.

2020-03-06 20:33,"Sorry, but lead stories in the NYT on China COVID-19 are minimum two days behind the real story. Plus they consistently harp on an allegation that China was slow to respond. 
The real story is that new confirmed cases in the Wuhan epicenter reached a peak number of 50,633 on Feb 18, and then constantly decreased. The number of discharged patients has now outpaced the new patients. One of the temporary modular field hospitals built exclusively for confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 has discharged most of their patients. The number of new cases is about the same as in December, 2019. Sources: Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection & WHO.
Some Chinese private government organizations are donating respiratory personal protection to other countries now that domestic production is again enough for Chinese internal needs. The online private retail company Alibaba donated 1 million medical masks to Japan. The Shanghai government donated 100,000 surgical masks and 400,000 N95 masks to Korea.
With regard to the allegation of slow response, please name one country in the world that can match the speed and scope with which the Chinese people tackled the COVID-19. Where there was slowness of response, it was centered within parts of the Wuhan government. Once those officials who did not recognize the threat removed, Chinese government official done at all levels moved within credible velocity. But that is a story that the New York Times has to date chosen to ignore."

2020-03-06 20:27,"If POTUS has his way the USA will resemble China in its complete lack of transparency. When a country's reputation is as unreliable, untrusted, as China's and a disaster like this strikes, we can see that the financial fallout is tremendous. The same fate awaits the USA if POTUS is allowed to continue to undo the rule of law, which has already been violated repeatedly by him, Barr, and the enablers of the GOP. Our long-term economy will be harmed by autocratic rule, not to mention the loss of precious personal freedoms.

2020-03-06 20:36,"Unfortunate that China is the origin of the 2nd coronavirus. The country has grown very fast for many years and its people can travel around the world, most freely. However, many are still clinching to thousands of years old tradition and eating exotic animals and foods. Strangely, the more rich one is, the strangest foods one eats!!! It is a way of showing someone's richness!!! Sadly for the rest of the world, whatever diseases China gets, the rest gets it within days or weeks. The diseases do not stay in one location and die in one place anymore. The world gets goodies from China and also gets SARS and CORVD-19 from China as well."
2020-03-06 21:09,"I will be convinced of China's leadership when they permanently ban, with enforcement, trade in Wildlife destined either for food or for medicine. Anything less than that shows that China is not sincere in any effort to avoid the development of future viruses."
2020-03-06 21:10,"As a step towards improving its image, China should take more decisive and clear action to ban wildlife trade, close any and all loopholes related to using animal parts in medicines or for culinary usage, institute humane livestock management practices, and actively enforce all of the above."
2020-03-06 21:36,"I would like to know the origin of the Coronavirus. 
Did it come from an exotic animal marketplace or somewhere else?"
2020-03-06 21:07,"People here naturally suspect China may under report its infections and deaths. At this brink of COVID-19 breakout in the US, my suspicion on CDC's report on its incidence and preventive actions also grow. Look at the real-time numbers, can one believe, US only has 267 infections but already 14 deaths? If so, the death rate > 5%. 
An Harvard scientist estimates 20-60% of the global adult population will ultimately be infected by this virus.
So if given the lower end of WHO official estimate of death rate, say 1%, this would mean > 10-30 million death. Are we near the end of world?

Luckily this is not true. Strict actions have been taken in China and elsewhere. The facts: China keep track of its vast population for travel history and screen for any possible infection when many cities are now resuming work. Earlier in January, thousands of medical workers from around China volunteered to go to the severely infected area of Hubei. Wuhan has swept its communities and households in February to check for untreated sick people, and filled more than 10 newly built hospitals in Wuhan. All the expenses for the care and tests are taken care by the government. Now the growth rate declines steadily there. Given the concentrated medical force, Wuhan is perhaps safer than many other big cities in the world.

As an American Chinese(one of the last) who was raised by KMT cultured parents who were robbed by and left for dead by the Commune, China's largest problem is that it was led by the uneducated, lazy, and incompetent. Does that make China the ONLY nation to have this no. But we all know China does have enough of this in the culture especially with precision, and safety standards, health standards, and petulant ways of managing people. The time lost and the lack of precision information shared on how Covid19 affects humans is the issue with China. 

If they spent as much time and money on getting top talent or actually intelligent leadership, instead of trying to repress the first Chinese doctor that tried to warn the world about it, that could have been more time for the world to respond.

China today is an exact reflection of the priorities' of the leadership and most of the constituency."

The other day Mr Trump was pounding his metaphorical fist and exclaiming that ""China must let us in"" to help and to study. Then I saw that Harvard scientists were already on their way to China. As with everything else, Mr Tump simply speaks from his own shallow knowledge and awareness base without bothering to assure that he has reliable information."
2020-03-06 21:18,"I keep coming back to the fact that, in the early days of the discovery that an extremely communicable virus had been unleashed in his country, President Xi took no steps to curtail travel in and out of the country.

It is going to take them some time to recover, in part because they won't allow accurate data to be reported, so they don't really know what is happening.  That is going to delay the restarting of their factories, which will effect our economy.

If Trump goes to the CDC center, a trip now up for debate as the CDC workers digest the ""fact"" that Trump's visit had been previously cancelled due to an infected worker (news to them), I expect a similar photo event.

Except Trump won't be wearing a mask. How can he lecture us if the mask garbles his voice. Instead the dumbest guy in the room, the 'leastest' scientist present, will be nodding his head while he fantasizes about his next fish burger. Then he will come up with another confidence building doozy; so you've tested the flu vaccine on this virus? You sure? Cause my gut is telling me maybe you haven't tested hard enough.

infected people are flying all over the place.  what foolish country would keep that going? Stop travel, bailout the airlines, minimize intermingling of people. 

I don't see the federal or state governments telling schools or uni's to skip spring break. Just teach through it, stop the travel intermingling. Now everyone will come and go, infection spread and schools everywhere will be canceled even sooner. 

No common sense.  Why would another country let a foolish one fly in and infect everyone? China won't be having a Wave 2 of this. Rest of the world might have 2, 3, or 4 over the next 48 months of nonsense."

For clarity, non-invasive means no ionizing radiation or elemental tracers, and no more tissue/fluid intrusion/extraction than for currently-approved testing...

It's been wasted – with the notable exception of baseline sequencing technology – on the entrenched and sclerotic diagnostic health care ecosystem in this country...

Perhaps China could take the initiative, along this line...

Had done the same (commented etc…) – regarding energy – for small modular reactors…

And for about as long…

About 18 months ago, panic set in on that one – because we finally woke to the fact that the Russians and Chinese were about to leave us in the dust…

And so, we may just come out OK – or even on top – in that area…

2020-03-06 22:02,Here is a crazy thought - should rest of the world send the bill to China for causing Coronavirus damages?  It may not be so crazy after all.  It sends the message to countries which intentionally suppress or delay timely information sharing to avoid unnecessary or more than usual flare ups. Money certainly can make them talk.
2020-03-06 22:16,"The photo is obviously supposed to comfort the Chinese that Xi is doing what he can, but it is very Kim Jung Unesque - the great leader instructing the nations scientists on how to stop the corona virus. It's almost like the great leaders Trump and Pence when they talk over Anthony Fauci and other scientists!

And, China deserves sympathy but also criticism for its failure to stop the trade in wildlife and general conditions in its public markets that has been the source of three global viral outbreaks by my count."

2020-03-06 22:11,"Grading on a curve, looks like China merits an F in health safety for its unregulated animal markets, but an A for addressing the coronavirus once the outbreak was detected (ok, an A- because it took the death of a doctor who warned about it in Wuhan, but on the other hand they stood up a brand new hospital in 10 days and Xi was ubiquitously in view leading their defence).

In contrast the US had plenty of advance notice  given that we could observe China, and still we stumble. Not to mention Trump’s dismantling of our preventive health architecture. So we’re the laughing stock in this case, worthy of an F."

2020-03-06 22:25,"The Chinese are worried about their image? The first thing they can do is ban the raising, trading, and eating of all wild animals with NO exceptions. Then they can divert sufficient money from their military build up to have a modern, functional medical system for China's citizens. The Chinese evidently didn't learn much from  the SARS epidemic in 2002. They got the world into this mess and now need to show us they're serious about making amends."
2020-03-06 22:18,"The problem with China's government is that they care more about their own image than the problems it is their job to fix. Of course, better than Trump who cares not at all about the problems and only about his image."

2020-03-06 22:21,"The Chinese government, predicated on the suppression of free speech deemed harmful to the Party, tried as long as they could to downplay the reality and severity of COVID-19. In doing so they enabled the rapid onset of a pandemic and are partially responsible for thousands of deaths related to the disease. The above statement isn’t racist and it isn’t an opinion, it’s factual. Any loss of goodwill the Chinese government experiences domestically or abroad is both well-deserved and long overdue."
2020-03-06 22:22,"I hope that every company that has lost money and stock value in the last few weeks finally understands what China is up to and how dangerous it is for the rest of the world.  Maybe companies like Apple should re-think their supply chain.  I've been in China, not only is there a market for endangered species, the market there not only exists, it thrives.  Children have been poisoned by baby formula, in the US, people have had their homes filled with toxins from sheet rock.  Meanwhile around the world, ports and railways are being built by China, only to be given back when the a third world country like Sri Lanka can't afford to pay back the loans.  Huawei is not the only company that steals intellectual property, but it is one of the biggest.  While SARS and MERS did not turn out to be a pandemic, last year more than a quarter of the world's pigs had to be culled, because of swine fever, brought to us by China.  China continues to be a major polluter and contributes an enormous amount to global warming.  They've stopped taking our garbage and that is a good thing, because maybe we will find sustainable solutions.  They are buying up vast amounts of properties off shore driving up prices.  The promote birth tourism to get citizenship.They are building islands and depleting world fisheries, with enormous trawlers that take vast quantities of other species as well. Maybe for Corona Virus, we should send THEM the bill!"

2020-03-06 19:20,"I understand that most people have a lot of fear (as do I), but I’ll say it until I’m blue in the face, we need to stop blaming China.  What good does it do?  It just adds unnecessary hatred and racism.  Are there things that the Chinese government could do better?  Yes, but at least they’re handling the outbreak with iron clad testings, quarantines and regulations (this is where communism is helpful—controlling populations).  America, for being so developed, can’t test many patients because the CDC is being so weird—and also b/c there is a lack of testing kits though the govt has known for a few months about the outbreak.  Talk about an underwhelming government response.  Also, viruses can start anywhere humans are. . . America is just more privileged with its infrastructure.  Please let’s focus on what we can do."
2020-03-06 22:48,"A pulmonologist friend of mine told me that the reason so many Chinese have died from coronavirus is that their lungs have been compromised by decades of air pollution throughout the country.

Ergo, we should most certainly not expect a mortality rate anywhere close to that of China."

Poor little China, the developing nation.

They’re developing so much that human rights are thrown out the window! Not only their Muslim community has to deal with this, but their professional community as well! The very same medical doctor who called in the alarm on Corona was ridiculed, reprimanded and silenced by the Chinese Government!—Now he’s dead, killed by the very same virus he tried to warn people against!

I’m sorry, but that leaves a very sour taste in my mouth and there should be severe consequences due to that! Are we of the free world to allow this kind of awful behavior from the world’s second largest economy? I sure hope not, because it’s inexcusable!"
2020-03-06 22:50,"It is beyond credibility that this epidemic was caused by a few cases of this disease brought about by eating some contaminated food or contacting some contaminated animal.  If people were to look at this objectively, the real virulence of this disease and its ability to spread so easily points to a man made virus which escaped from a germ warfare lab.  
The Chinese owe the world an apology, and admit their foolish mistakes."
2020-03-06 22:33,"Sorry man. I've been racially abused twice in a month for no other crime then heading home from work because I look Chinese. I'm not born there I never lived there.

2020-03-06 22:50,"Don't kid yourself, China's government is more open about the coronavirus than our government.  Under Trump's incompetence we have tested no one, for all practical purposes.  So we could have tens of thousands of people in plain sight, infecting tens of thousands. 
Mike Pence is having a press conference as I write this and he is deflecting, dodging and stammering his way through announcing...nothing.  Trump and Pence are ""taking all measures possible"" which means they have no plan at all.  They have no tests but ""because of Trump's leadership, the risk to the public is low.""  
Pence can say over and over ""we are ready"" and every rational person knows that they are adrift."

That's three strikes, and we should be out, but we're apparently fouling this one off without calamitous death rates.

No business stores all their critical data on one server in one location, why should the great minds of business think making China the point of origin for the majority of manufactured goods in the world any less susceptible to a critical incident such as this? Given China's penchant for forcing it's will on  other nations and the diverse ethnic groups that live within its borders I think  China is  the deserving recipient of this karma. No population deserves to suffer but this pandemic is a wake up call to the world both from a business perspective, a health perspective and a governance perspective."
2020-03-06 23:03,"“Now that the rate of new infections and deaths in China has slowed...”

No! It has APPARENTLY slowed. This is China, where the MD who first flagged the problem was censured. Even if they are lying, we do not know the testing rate. Newly reported cases will decline if the Chinese are exporting so many test kits that they’re testing fewer people at home."
2020-03-06 23:03,"Only one thing is certain - the US will do all it can to vilify and demonize China.  The US and its media do one thing well, they emphasize any problem or misstep by any nation that is not a vassal state, negatively caricature such states, while ignoring the problems and missteps at home and painting a picture of the US as being above it all and qualified to prosecute, judge and condemn other nations.  This is the greatest danger that the US and its ""democracy"" and ""free press"" present to the world, utter hypocracy and an agenda and propaganda system that depends on our mainstream media and the fairly tale propaganda about the US."

The virus is exposing and fully exposing some of the fundamental weaknesses of today's China related to corruption, a lack of transparency and accountability. The population has put up to a large degree with these factors in exchange for economic growth.  Now that the economy will tank hopefully the CCP will see the reckoning they deserve"
2020-03-07 0:12,I am so fearful that the reason we are not testing adequately in the US yet is because our government does not want us to know the truth about the numbers of infections. I hope I'm wrong.

2020-03-06 20:10,"Please. It would be naive and more than a bit disingenuous to suggest that in the current environment an event like the emergence of the coronavirus would not be eagerly seized upon by the US to advance its geopolitical interests with regards to its ""existential systems competition"" with China. 
It's too good an opportunity to ignore. Up until the virus the US hearts and minds efforts to hobble China had been largely ineffective and more than a bit embarrassing; a litany of flop sweat infused public diplomacy and US media abetted failures; efforts to critically hobble China's new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) ended in complete failure -76 countries joined the AIIB. A related campaign targeting China's Belt and Road iniative - more dire warnings more reams of negative press - failed to control the narrative outside the US. Most recently US efforts to derail China's Huawei and its world leading 5G technology at  unbeatable prices. Another huge hearts and minds campaign another US PR failure. Even Germany and the refused to ban Huawei's technology with the former head of the UK's NSA equivalent; the GCHQ describing US claims regarding Huawei as ""nonsense"". Ouch! 
The coronavirus is just the latest fodder for America's propaganda war on China and an eager US media with the NYT in the lead - is in it up to its neck."

As Chinese ""local"" governments now quarantine Koreans for two weeks, many flights are cancelled.  Many illegal Chinese in Korea call for a  quick return to China.  
It is too early to reassess the efficacy of Chinese governmental system.  It has been arrogant, unilateral, secretive and oppressing like in the past.

Look at this real-time numbers: <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries"" target=""_blank"">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries</a>
How can one believe, US only has 267 infections but already 14 deaths? If so, the death rate > 5%. 
An Harvard scientist estimates 20-60% of the global adult population will ultimately be infected by this virus: <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/hundreds-of-u-s-coronavirus-cases-may-have-slipped-through-screenings"" target=""_blank"">https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/hundreds-of-u-s-coronavirus-cases-may-have-slipped-through-screenings</a>/
So if given the lower end of WHO official estimate of death rate, say 1%, this would mean > 10-30 million death. Are we near the end of world?

Luckily this is not true. Strict actions have been taken in China which would remove 1.4 billion people from the above estimate. The facts: China keep track of its vast population for travel history and screen for any possible infection when many cities are now resuming work. Wuhan has swept its communities and households in February to check for untreated sick people, and filled more than 10 newly built hospitals in Wuhan. Now the growth rate declines steadily there.

Also read this article from Nature.com, genome studies find the virus may not originate from Wuhan: <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w</a>

Do not believe rumors but compare notes!"
2020-03-06 22:43,"The last authoritative pronouncements from China were published on February 24 in official Chinese media.  China’s president for life Xi Jinping told officials at a Communist Party meeting February 23rd. that the coronavirus epidemic was “a crisis and a big test” for the country. 

I visited the Chinese media’s official website (link below) which carried a report on the speech, and translated the text from Chinese into English.  Xi used such words as “grim,” “complex’” “ordeal,” “critical,” “crushed.” And then there is “bite the bullet."" 

Anyone who has studied communist party political phraseology and vocabulary will know that such language is meant to communicate a dire situation inside the country, far more serious than that which Chinese media and spokesman are portraying publicly.  And now that China has shifted rhetorical gears, I'd submit that the situation in the country is WORSE than it was two weeks ago.

2020-03-06 18:23,"Shocker.  Another world leader refuses to take accountability for the very problems its helped create.  

Oh, and Obama's responsible for the Corona virus.

The world's most immature people run the world.  I truly can't remember the last time I saw an ounce of real leadership on this planet.  Its been far too long."
2020-03-06 18:40,"In the case of SARS and now COVID-19,,, and also the likely source of two of the EBOLA epidemics,,,,

Bush meat.  The killing of wild animals, exotic animals, and then taking those animals into market and selling them,, or into the kitchen to eat.   4 major epidemics ,, all in the last 20 years,, and all linked to bush meat.

Hmmm..  Ya think maybe that practice should be stopped?

We kill wild animals for trophy horns we hang on the wall,,, powdered gall bladders and horns to cure limp  'ahem' appendages,  and wild cats to eat.  I think maybe we should stop."
2020-03-07 1:38,"China's traditional practice of slaughtering mass numbers of wildlife, many of which are on the brink of extinction, has been immoral and inhumane all on its own. And now, these greedy and nefarious practices, largely in the name of ""traditional medicine,"" i.e., snake oil, have resulted in a global public health and economic emergency.  

China -- and China alone -- once again has unleashed a novel virus, this time causing a pandemic. No amount of preening and pluming, subterfuge and spin will erase these facts."
2020-03-07 1:38,"It was not China's Coronavirus outbreak that 'damaged its image,' it was our mean-spirited coverage of it. After all, EVERY public health specialist who visited the country and observed the measures it took praised it fulsomely.

But our meanness may come back to haunt us. It seems that virus-hunting has improved greatly since we allowed H1N1 to kill 300,000 people in 2009-2010. In fact, we're even revising our own timeline of that outbreak: it actually showed up months before we initially thought.

Ditto COVID-19. 

It seems that COVID-19 made its first appearance last September in a developed country with a weak public health system.

Which developed country? Well, here's a clue: its media led the attack on China's handling of the outbreak."

2020-03-06 21:36,"You don't deserve sympathy China, you deserve unprecedented amounts of scorn and condemnation.  Your governmental culture of lies, deceit, denial and oppression is the reason this outbreak was not contained in the first place. The whole world knows the story of Dr. Li Wenliang now, and there ain't no puttin' that one back in the box. 

Your levels of pollution are surreal, your cities are unhealthy and your people appear largely uneducated about the dangers of consuming certain animals (bats alone carry a huge number of known pathogens).  

You are responsible for roughly 50% of the annual amount of plastic waste that goes in our oceans and 33% of annual greenhouse gas emissions.  SARS, influenza and now COVID-19 are some of your more notable exports. 

Just as Chernobyl was the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, I hope this appalling debacle is the beginning of the end for your mendacious, oppressive, totalitarian regime. China, you are just plain bad for the planet."

Little by little it is being realized no country is prepared for this virus – and it was seventeen years from the last such encounter. China now is finally doing as well a can be expected in containment, but small enterprises without ‘family sources’ are doomed – my favorite dumpling shop locked up forever.

However, in the case of China, I do agree with some of his policies including a tough trade policy.  In addition, I do think we should bar Chinese visitors for the next several months until they completely contain this virus and are free of new infections for several weeks.  I would also applaud stern measures to limit IP theft from our companies, our universities and national labs.  Including a 100% ban on Chinese students and researchers in STEM fields until the Chinese agree to tough anti-piracy laws enforceable by US companies in the US and in China.
The Chinese mistake our openness for weakness.  Time to show a iron fist under the velvet glove."
2020-03-06 19:23,"China has given the world the gift that keeps on giving and is taking away and destroying.

ALL the deadly virus pandemics (with the exceptions of the MERS and Ebola pandemics) which have plagued the world, including the current version, SARS and all those going as far back as the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more people than who died during WWI, have all originated from China.

China manages its economy on the cheap as the sources are China’s unregulated livestock industry which is a cesspool of dangerous viruses and bacteria. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

If the coronavirus reaches Africa or large developing countries in south Asia (India, Pakistan, etc.) or in the west Pacific (Indonesia, Philippines, etc.) then it can spread to be a global disaster. This is because these countries do not have the infrastructure to deal with or control coronavirus.

What will China do to compensate the civilized world for the mismanagement and abuses of its economy and society, its unregulated reckless industries and its immeasurable vast theft of intellectual property that have taken so much away from the West?"
2020-03-06 19:42,"The virus and its spread is China's fault. That's plain and simple. The government knows that live wild animal markets are responsible for species jumping viruses, it covered up the outbreak and then would not allow external medical personnel in to assess the situation. 

They should be sanctioned, both as an incentive to shut down all aspects of the markets and as punishment"
2020-03-06 20:02,"I have no sympathy for the Chinese in this instance. The wet wildlife markets were the source of the outbreak, the CCP intentionally lied to the global public about the severity of the disease, and the WHO report is essentially a love letter to authoritarianism and Xi’s personality cult. 

It’s not racist to distance oneself from Chinese nationals during this period, for they are essentially extensions of the party and its misinformation apparatuses. It’s not racist to criticize the Chinese when their folk remedies have foisted this disease onto the world stage. And it’s certainly not racist for the US to reconsider our society’s relationship with this repressive, autocratic regime. 

The CCP seems to be adeptly playing liberals concerns with racism and representation to shield itself from actual critique."
2020-03-06 21:35,"China may be trying to fix its ""image"" with the naive and uninformed. We in the West need to really understand the Chinese and their agenda. Unless we do, we will all become beholden to them.
This Virus is a Chinese creation, maybe literally! It started there through their modes of eating all sorts of foods or perhaps manufactured in the lab there. We will find the truth about this in due time.
The Chinese people here in Canada and in the rest of the world are an extension of the Chinese government, its communist party. Often, I hear words, from Chinese folks, that in China I did not do something this way so why should I do it here.
China expects all its ""daughters"" to be dutiful daughters and I see it everywhere that Chinese women look for Canadian men to marry and indoctrinate them into sympathy towards China and what it wants. All this, and more, tells me that China has a plan to ""educate"" the world to be Chinese, like it is doing to the Uyghurs.
If we want to maintain our developed and western ways of life, we must become aware of the Chinese culture and understand its ""code"" so we can better deal with them. 
I recommend reading a book on culture codes by Raphael Clotaire."

2020-03-06 16:16,"In some ways, it's not hard to see this as a market over-reaction.  I'm also leery of the media's lack of perspective -- even with all the recent losses, the S&P 500 is still above all of 2019, with the exception of a brief window in July-August of 2019.

Of course we don't know where the bottom of this crisis is economically, but it's not impossible that spending related to the virus -- whether it's government spending or consumer reactive spending -- offsets losses related to virus-related issues.  Making a billion N95 masks and a billion vaccine doses is economic activity as much as consumers buying a couple hundred million unncessary smartphone upgrades."
2020-03-06 16:22,"Coronavirus is not Ebola, it is more along the lines of a nasty strain of the flu. Influenza will kill far more people this year, next year and the year after that.  Always has and will continue to do so long after we leave this planet.

There is no sense of scale anymore, thanks to our over reliance on information and the web media. Everything is  a ten or a one, there are no inbetweens. When was the last time the forecaster predicted a 3 inch snowfall? Nowadays snow has two forms, either a blizzard or its a flurry. 

Coronavirus is serious, but not a game-changer. Lets keep it in perspective."

seasoned professionals have had the caution flag out for at least a year."
2020-03-06 16:25,"One of the reasons that the market is reacting like this is that it is obvious when one looks at the distribution of cases in the US, the frequency of deaths compared to reported cases, and the structure of the US medical system that the number of actual cases in the US must be radically under reported. It does not help that your president is a pathological liar, who has appointed a group of ideological incompetents in his cabinet and gutted your social and regulatory infrastructure. The stock market is not overreacting given this reality. PS wash your hands, don’t travel or hang out in large groups unless you absolutely have to do so."
2020-03-06 16:36,"Seems to me overblown. Compare it to the Spanish Flu of 1918 and it’s just a cold killing off old people in nursing homes. 
 It’s not going to hurt healthy young folks like the one that started in Kansas around 100 years ago, a pandemic so deadly you’d be fine in the morning and dead by night. People were bleeding from their ears and dying of thirst because others were too afraid to tend to them. 
 Estimated to have killed 100 million in three waves it was only eclipsed by the Great War in Flanders. Now that was a thing to fear. They didn’t even have 747’s!
 So relax, all this virus is likely to do is breed complacency."

He puts most things at risk only to lose, just as he did with his businesses; the difference of course, is now the loss comes at the cost of life, loss of wealth and overall security. 

You may believe in his immigration policies and like his stances on guns, abortion, etc. but at this great a risk to your health and wealth and security?

For the Trump supporters, it is worth revisiting what you think you value and being honest with yourselves about the risk trump poses to you personally. The risk is real; from stripping away healthcare, to ensuring all communities have clean drinking water, and of course, everything mentioned above and more. 

The communities at the biggest risk, are the ones where his base lives."

The CDC website has not been updated. Why? We are getting the real numbers from John Hopkins CSSE website, which shows 14 deaths, and 238 cases in the U.S.  The Stock Market reacts poorly to misinformation."
2020-03-06 17:07,"The stock market has become a bully market. When the demands of the stock market and other investment markets run against the well-being of human civilization such as what is happening now with Covid-19, their voices should be diminished.  When a market guru says “There really isn’t a response from the administration or the authorities telling people to calm down and there’s a plan,” said Mr. Goldberg. “It certainly feels like there isn’t a plan and I feel like that’s what the markets reacting to.” It shows that investment markets are in an irrational panic where they are demanding guidance when in fact the knowledge needed to act either individually or collectively is available if one screens out the verbiage coming from uninformed individuals."

It is what it is — a highly contagious and deadly new virus regardless of other other known viruses. We barely know anything about it. People are relapsing. People are dying. Comparing it to seasonal flu promotes a false sense of security among the general population, who have proven to be less than hygienic and compliant regarding outbreaks. So let’s focus on this virus, on the situation at hand, and take action to contain and stop the spread, and treat those affected. Take precautions, don’t panic, but also don’t go to work or out in public if you show symptoms. COVID-19 is NOT the flu."

This is not a president, like others before him, that has the ability to learn on the job, much less learn period, and grow with it while managing with grace and skill the  challenges that a great country as ours is destined to encounter. 
Trump, as a president, has no policies, he has an attitude that clearly is not what we need.

2020-03-06 18:13,"The divide between those saying this is overblown and those saying it is a big deal is largely the divide between those focused on individual risk versus population-level risk. 

Those diminishing the threat tend to draw comparisons to the flu. It is true: in any given year, you as an individual are very unlikely to die of the flu. Yet it is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. So, from a population level, saying it is roughly as contagious and lethal as the flu is little comfort. From a given individual’s view, it might be quite a bit of comfort, given the individual in question is relatively young and healthy. 

Framing it another way, had the world had the technology to recognize and control the flu when it first emerged, effectively acting on that would have been an incalculably positive service to all humankind."

Sorry everyone, the big ride is over!"
2020-03-06 18:12,"If Trump would take his head out of the sand, he would stop disputing the coronavirus. He needs to take action at the bully pulpit to tell the truth and reassure the public with FACTS. And let the CDC and NIH do what they know best to do in a pandemic."
2020-03-06 18:16,Trump is liable to tear his hair out if this continues. His grasp of business and economics is purely magical with the stock markets being his Oracle of Delphi guide to the future. The stock market is a mixture of rational trading of monetized wealth and casino gambling which in the short run does not much conform with the economy nor opportunities for businesses. But the more serious problem is that Trump is not helping to mitigate the crisis due to this pandemic simply because he had no idea that the government was an important factor in mitigating unpredictable crises like pandemics. At the very least medical practitioners should have been able to test people to determine who might have the virus.

If the stock market is down because of supply chain issues from Asia and concerns about a drop in consumer activity, then why on earth would lower interest rates help? Does it boost Foxconn’s supply output to Apple? If you’re staying away from restaurants and movie theaters because of a virus, is a lower interest rate going to change your mind? Of course the market is still down; none of the bedrock concerns driving the downturn are addressed by lower interest rates.

Shovel more cheap cash to the financial elites. That’s the Fed’s way of using our money to fight COVID 19. 

Perfect. 

How can this economic system NOT be seen as designed to mainly benefit the wealthy and other shareholders? 

No, I am not a Democrat who wants COVID 19 to take Trump down. I simply want the majority of us to see how our present economic system is not working for the average American.

All events are cancelled, except for my fundraisers with contributors of more than $1M.

Schools and businesses should encourage working from home on-line.  I have recommended this to my WH security detail.

Overreacting is another thing. People need to realize that far more deaths have occurred in our country from the flu and pneumonia than the coronavirus.

Trump is not diplomatic so his enemies for looking for any weakness to exploit in the USA economy. The USA weakness is it's lack of free health care and hospitals. Another weakness is the private medical insurance schemes instead of universal health care. Joe Public has their private insurance schemes rapped up in the USA sharemarket. USA sharemarket is wrapped up in retirement shares and healthcare shares.

2020-03-06 19:22,The Trump Slump will drive a lot of moderates who held their noses and voted for Trump and Republicans to finally turn on them. Most people vote their self interests. Death from an ill handled disease and a declining stock market is a bell for whom tolls Trump.
2020-03-06 19:23,"The news is: the coronavirus Covid-19 is spreading here, and the Trump administration seems more focused on the health and well-being of the economy than the health and well-being of the public.  With their major misstep in only having 75,000 test kits not the 1 million promised by Vice President Pence, it means many who have the virus will go untested and it will continue to spread it causing further damage to our consumer-driven economy. This is a national emergency ton the verge of a national tragedy hat demands a leader who cares about others as much as himself.  Over and over again, Donald Trump's blatant narcissism with its attendant lack of empathy has kept him from being that leader. The devastating consequences are now becoming apparent to all who've chosen to ignore it before while the economy was serving the rich and powerful."

2/24/20: the ""stock market is starting to look very good to me"" 

2/26/20: “I really think the stock market is something I know a lot about” 

As trump noted, he, and he alone, is the expert on everything, and as he states, the market is looking very good to trump.  

Thus, all trump followers, put your money where his mouth is.

  Such a bad job was done by everyone in charge that the last chance may be to literally put the whole country in a 14 day quarantine except for army , medical staff , police, fire department, etc, and a do a restart .
  Two weeks will allow us to get a handle on this , while we work on test kits.
  As crazy as it sounds this might work, certainly if you don’t have it you will not get it in quarantine . 
  Until Donald Trump takes direct action the stocks go down so thank you Wall Street.
   We can watch the NCAA tournament while we are in quarantine , the tournament played in empty stadiums of course.
  By April and the warm weather we come out , with a better game plan and the hope that the virus fades and maybe by that time do will have come up with the perfect way to fight it."
2020-03-06 19:27,"It is a -global- pandemic. It crosses borders, it crosses industries, if affects ""socialist"" and capitalist countries the same... I don't think the markets are 'over-reacting'. It is unclear right now if the coronavirus is 'ramping up'; is 'being contained'; or is 'fading out'... although the last possibility appears to be fabulist rantings at this time.

The markets appear to be seeking safe havens when confronting a threat that reaches everywhere - the reaction selling maybe seems extreme, or 'panicky', but there's not a lot of places the coronavirus doesn't seem able to reach, and not a lot of economic sectors that will be unaffected.

Global agencies, able to reach across borders and take fast action would be an effective way to handle this.. border walls won't work. But that doesn't seem to be the way our current world's leaders are taking us. Maybe the coronavirus, or the next pandemic after, will take care of them, too."

2020-03-06 19:38,"Nobody knows the real number of jobs created, and having jobs created does not mean the jobs are filled with people.  When the report says ‘created in February’ what that means is ‘published by corporate.’  Labor Statistics knows only jobs as reported by the States and they by local business services units; and remember, the States cannot accurately report jobs created until, minimum, one year has passed and, minimum, 3 quarters of wages  have passed.  Until such time a job creation report mostly is wishful thinking or just outright fakery."

Well, the recession may be “short-term” for some.  But combined with the virus, it may mean recession effects for much longer for those who have lost time and money working, while being smacked with huge medical bills.  

Trump may imagine he’s reassuring the airlines and cruise lines and other corporate entities, but failure to address the coming woes of ordinary citizens is inexcusable.  Their suffering will be very real.  And their sense of despair will ripple effects, like PTSD due to the virus and its effects on them.

It is all the more vital that we must vote Trump out this November."

The Fed interest rate has nothing to do with stimulating activity among average consumers and their day-to-day spending!"

Also, our government National Superannuation fund invests mainly in NZ start up businesses that are privately owned and not on the stock market. Also our retirement National Superannuation fund investments have to be ethical so our government won't be investing in lots of stuff globally.

Ordering testing kits in January or using those provided by the WHO.
Having an overall strategy for communicating with state governments, the medical community and  citizens current,factual and meaningful information.
Lying 
Tweeting incorrect information 
Being on top of the facts and relaying them correctly

Remaining in DC and overseeing the Coronavirus response rather than fund raising and golfing at Mar-a-Lago.

First, CDC estimates that the annual deaths in the U.S. from influenza over the nine seasons ending with 2018-2019 was 37,500. Hardly anyone outside of the health professions notices. Second, a story in today's Washington Post suggest that Covid-19 may be no worse, and less contagious, than the other strains of flu behind those nine years of data.

Washington Post as the afternoon of 6 March: “As of Friday afternoon, the United States had 14 deaths among 240 cases, a rate of 5.8 percent. But testing has been slow in the U.S., and as it becomes more widespread the rate will plummet. Your denominator is going to explode, which will push the case fatality rate down. But it will also push the number of affected persons and communities up,” said Kathleen Jordan, vice president and chief medical officer of Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco.”

Fourteen deaths within an average loss of 37,500? 

Today is indeed brutal.  I’ll guess the market will reverse by Wednesday, March 11."

2020-03-06 21:08,"Panic pandemic is causing stocks to fall. For the day after super Tuesday on Wednesday, there was hope that the socialist democrat, Bernie  will never be the nominee of the Democratic party. Panic selling last week was due to unjustified anxiety about Corona virus spread and this week it is due to uncertainty among the democrats whether they have any chance at all to replace Trump with their nominee. The pandemic of Trump derangement syndrome is frustrating those who see gloom and doom if Trump is reelected after all attempts to remove him from office have failed miserably. 

The new wave of worry hitting Wall street will sink those who sell at a loss and they deserve to, because they have lost faith in the stock market and have already made a large profit. The volatility will not hurt those who take a long term view and hope that they are not left holding the bag. At the same time this a golden opportunity for those who have cash in hand to buy good dividend stocks of established large corporations at bargain prices. 

With an astounding low employment and new Jobs in February and the low interest rates, the economy is basically strong and extended rebound should be taking place in the near future when we realize that Corona infections are no big deal but a short term dip.

While giving a trillion-dollar tax cut to the gilded wealthy & adding the same debt to be paid back, passed on to workers. 

Imagine a credit card that someone else spends on & you have to pay for?  Whatever happened to those soybean harvests China never bought? In previous bailouts, it seemed to save jobs/industries & trickled down. 

Any current bailout should go to no-cost healthcare for the sick, high support for health care workers, help for the stricken. 

ISOLATION CLINICS need to be set up in every community. We don't want our emergency rooms infected. Free clinics.

No hospital bills & family support grants for poor & middle-class families to cover quarantine costs and loss of income should be the focus of any bail out this time. 

Immigrants and undocumented residents need to get free and no restrictions access to our isolated special clinic centers. No questions asked.

Trump only cares about getting reelected. Milk that.

We could have and should have paid down that debt when the stock market was good,  not give tax breaks to billionaires. I recently paid down debt while the stock market was high and before this happened (I was having premonitions of a big correction).  

Trump has put us in this financial crisis with his hubris and lack of foresight.  He thought he was responsible for and took credit for the steady gains in the stock market, started by Obama.  How about now?  Will he take the blame he deserves or will he blame Obama.  

Trump has declared multiple bankruptcies and in the mid 1990s we the American people bailed him out of nearly a billion in business debt.  The question is, who will bail out America?"

Thanks to central bankers and their the irresponsible too-low-for too-long interest rates policy the ammunition locker is empty. An expansion of the free money policy will eventually see economic and political turmoil, and perhaps brown shirted marchers in the street. 

This coronavirus epidemic has a cost and it is not in paper money, it is in lost output of valuable goods and services. The appropriate response is a rise in income tax to soak up the excess liquidity that will be now injected, with emphasis on the wealthy paying the most. Any other approach will see people eventually doing the electronic equivalent of pushing a wheelbarrow load of money to buy a loaf of bread."
2020-03-06 21:59,"Yes, the market was due for a correction. However I think the panic associated with this virus and its impact on the market can be put at the feet of the incompetent leadership of the Trump administration, starting at the top.

My wife and other daughter were planning a spring break trip to Seattle. But now, since my daughter in Seattle works for Microsoft and she is basically restricted  to working at home AND there isn't much to do in the outside world, that was cancelled.

While there will be pent up demand to be met after all this passes, as it will, there will be hundreds of billions of dollars of lost sales and wages that are gone forever.

This proposal to buy assets other than government guaranteed debt is a classic case of the second part of the Privatise the Profits and Socialise the Losses policy of the free money economy that has been running of late. If the owners of debt proposed to be bought cannot find a buyer other than the Fed then perhaps they are expecting steep losses if not bankruptcy?

	Every time you buy something with a credit card, the banks bleed us. It costs the credit card company the same amount to record a million-dollar sale as a one-dollar sale, but they get a percentage. We need a law to make that a flat fee. The credit card fee system is a big reason for rising inequality. Banking and finance have 40% of the economy now. It used to be 10%. Every credit card swipe transfers money from the 99% to the 1%. Pay with cash when you can. The fee is on the seller, but it gets passed on to the buyer. MasterCard 2.6%. Visa 2.4%. Discover 2.3%.

At that point we will still  will not have a vaccine and most people will not have immunity due to prior exposure.   Furthermore we know that current anti-flu drugs barely show any efficacy even if given within 48 hours of exposure.

Nevertheless, the wild gyrations of the stock market, and other  financial markets portend the setting for a severe recession, along with a severe falloff of hiring in the job market. All of these will more likely result in Trump's abrupt and severe fall from grace, as his electibility numbers abruptly and severely commensurately fall off as our nation falls into a profound recession.

Compare him to some of the greedy dullards of today, those worshipped billionaires and sports stars who always want more, and think the works revolves around them.

Social distancing: really important that we limit contact socially like work, sporting events, conferences, music concerts, theaters, pubs, restaurants, churches, malls, stores, anyplace that groups more than ten people together.

Food supply: at least three days and probably two weeks 

Water: without it you die, get some and keep it around-for pets, double your supply

Disinfectant: bleach (a gallon is good) for disinfecting household surfaces

Hey, airlines, oil companies, restaurants and hotels: maybe instead of suggesting handouts (spoiler alert: there is no money, you have it all, remember?), you could try to pressure the federal government (ie, Pence and Co) to (1) actually care and (2) do something.  Your customers will not come back until they feel safe and they will not feel safe until the government comes up with a thoughtful coordinated plan, tells everyone what it is, and implements it.  And stops muzzling the scientists.  Sending emails telling us that you are disinfecting your plane regularly and waiving the change fees that you only recently implemented on Mosaic customers isn’t going to cut the mustard (looking at you, JetBlue).

Oh and maybe you could suggest to law markers a tax increase on business so that we actually have some money in the coffers to fight this thing.  Let’s be honest: you folks own our government, you might as well start acting like it, but you know, this time in a positive way.

As much as the super rich like to pretend their money will save them from the worlds problems, the virus doesn’t care how much money you have, or how much power you hold.  In the end, you can’t take any of it with you."
2020-03-06 11:03,"Again, fellow Americans, you are on your own. The “million” test kits for coronavirus or COVID-19 didn’t arrive in your state and currently your state public health labs have been working overtime to determine how many people might be infected in your state.

2020-03-06 13:17,"The cruise ships that have been quarantined are the equivalent of a closed laboratory experiment. Despite attempts to limit person to person contact, the virus spread to many. That may indicate a hidden reservoir for this airborne virus. 

On those ships, every person was exposed to the ventilation system. Have those systems been thoroughly investigated? If ventilation systems are a viral reservoir and a source of contagion it would represent a cause of why the virus appears to spread so rapidly and possibly why it might represent more of an urban than a rural problem. Just about every person who enters an urban building might be exposed. But it would also represent a target to contain and control widespread exposure. 

AS A PHYSICIAN, I STRONGLY URGE THAT VENTILATION SYSTEMS ON THE CRUISE SHIPS AND WHERE EVERY KNOWN CASE WAS PRESENT BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED!"

It’s very simple. This is going around like the regular flu but it’s effects on the elderly or those with underlying health conditions can be severe and devastating (more so than regular flu). Those who feel vulnerable and/or are ill and the elderly should take action to stay out of harms way and others should limit their contact with the elderly or infirm. Those who are healthy will probably recover with no issues if they catch this and should probably not disrupt their normal routines but take more care over hygiene. 

It’s too late for isolation, quarantine and travel bans, this thing is everywhere. Do what you need to do to be safe, based on your circumstances. Roll with the drama and waves of overreaction from others but maintain a sense of calm and act with common sense and chances are you’ll be fine."
2020-03-06 13:32,"It is hard to accept that the US, the most advanced nation in the world according to our politicians, or at least a very advanced nation was caught totally unprepared by the corona virus crisis.
Hard to accept because we had plenty of time to prepare, as the world knew about the infections in Wuhan in mid December of last year and China reported the existence of the new virus to the World Health Organization on Dec 31.
Today, more that two months later we do not even have the test kits to try to find out how many cases we have and the health personnel does not have protection equipment..
I personally  here in South Florida have been going to places like Walmart and CVS looking for alcohol bottles and alcohol wipes. Not in stock. Also for face masks, even of the surgery variety. Not in stock.
Texted several friends and asked them to inform me if they found a place with those items. All of them responded in the negative.
Hard to accept that these items are so difficult to make that we in the US can not make them. Even more difficult to understand why our Government has been sitting on their hands doing nothing for two months other that lying about the availability of the tests, the extent of the infection in our society, the risk of transmission, the mortality rate and just about everything related to the virus."

-  For instance, the virus is 'not' heat-resistant and short lived at a temperature based on fact?

Dry throat at the onset, followed by a dry cough with high fever, symptomatic of pneumonia, leading to fluid in the lungs, should be reported to a medical office?

Hot liquids for the above symptoms are recommended for hydration and no ice?

“But they don’t work!”
How do you know? There are no studies demonstrating lack of efficacy for this virus and studies, even posted on our CDC’s website, showing efficacy for flu. Yes, the virus is small enough to penetrate, yes there are air leaks, but it’s likely that the virus travels on larger droplets of liquid from the infected patient that a mask can stop. Then, of course there is the prevention of face touching."

2020-03-06 13:22,"People are not heeding advice about not spreading their germs.  I was at the bank a couple of days ago.  There was a man wearing scrubs on line in front of me, which indicated he works in the healthcare field in some capacity.  He kept coughing without covering his mouth.  I just moved away from him, shaking my head in disbelief.

Recently, the receptionist at my doctor’s office coughed into her hand and then handed me documents to fill out without using a hand sanitizer first.  Nearby was a posted sign about what not to do when coughing.

At a store, the cashier kept licking her fingers to open the plastic bags to hold my items.  If there was a self-checkout line at this store, I would have used it.

At a pizzeria, the owner coughed into his hands.  Without washing his hands, he proceeded to shake hands with a customer.  I have not returned to that pizzeria since.

I'm also beginning to seriously consider that keeping the numbers artificially low, may be this administration's primary policy tool when it comes to how they plan on dealing with this situation.

The solution is to think locally.  Find your area public health resources and news sources.  Prepare to be able to isolate yourself if you need to.  Once we're through this, we need to remember the lessons of it and finally push for the changes that will help keep events like this from being so regressive - mandatory paid sick leave, healthcare not tied to employment, and proper funding of our scientific and medical institutions.  These are best at the national level, but still meaningful at the state or city level."
2020-03-06 12:28,"Down here in Houston, local government is taking the opposite approach to the folks in New York.  In New York they have been very transparent about the cases, the locations, quarantined folks, contacts, etc.  In Houston, cases are not announced until confirmed by the CDC.  A whistleblower on Reddit is giving more details about the other things,  including contacts, locations, and quarantined folks--predictions that always turn out to be correct.  Local government is hiding information from us. Shame on the local government officials in Houston and Harris County, who seem more concerned about protecting their current rodeo event than the people down here."
2020-03-06 10:53,"The US is woefully unprepared because Donald Trump is more concerned with winning the media day than doing his job.  It’s all about him and now more people will die because there are fewer precautions, fewer testing kits and a disinformation  communications.

2020-03-06 13:51,"Call me cynical, but somehow I see a dramatic' rise' in virus numbers around election time when Trump will demand a national quarantine, preventing people from going to the polls.

Meanwhile, I'm rooting for the scientists laboring to produce an effective vaccine.  According to Dr Peter Hotez, who is testifying before congress, one has been on the shelf for a few years, but there was no money for testing it."
2020-03-06 14:00,"Clearly, only testing the seriously ill catches only a small percentage of those infected. Ideally, the US would plan to give out tests to everyone in the major areas impacted (New York, SF/Bay Area, Seattle). Also— work from home and time of school should be established, immediately. Half of my office was out sick yesterday. If even one of them has it, we’ve all already been exposed, and are continuing now to pass it around without knowing it. It’s dangerous and goes against scientific understanding."
2020-03-06 14:02,"Here in Oregon they've apparently tested only about 70 people in the last five weeks, and TPTB have now declared that they're not going to expand testing significantly because they want tests to be available ""for those that really need them.""

Thus the past few days I have been greeted with local headlines along the lines of ""no new cases of Coronavirus in Oregon."" 

What the headlines should actually say is ""no new positive test results for Coronavirus in Oregon (out of the scant handful of tests we're administering each week).

This virus is here,and it is spreading every single day. That is a certainty. And yet without adequate, widespread testing, neither public health officials nor the public itself have any way of making rational decisions about how to proceed."

As Margaret Thatcher said, eventually you run out of other people's money, and then you run out of beds, and then the other people who hung on to their money find themselves in the same dangerous state as everyone else as an epidemic is unleashed."
2020-03-06 14:08,"It is sad to see the Korea-Japan rift at this time, and surprising to see only Japan's perspective (with Korea being made to seem unreasonable). I think what may the underlying the reaction is that Koreans believe that Abe's government in Japan is under-testing (they tested 699 in the last day, as opposed to Korea's 18,000), perhaps intentionally. Given the close relationship and constant exchange and travel between China, Japan and Korea (a skip and a hop), Koreans believe that Japan's initial exposure to the Coronavirus must have been at least similar to theirs--but that Japan has much lower confirmed case numbers because the Japanese government keeps their confirmed case numbers down by not testing. That way, Japan would deflect attention (after the botched Diamond Princess saga and under Olympics scrutiny). They also find it strange the Japan took draconian school closure measures when their numbers were quite low...so it may be an way to stem the spread without involving testing. The lack of transparency, Koreans think, maybr endangering Japan's own citizens as well others. It is all circumstantial, but South Korean society is very politically vocal, so they are speaking out about this as well..."
2020-03-06 14:11,"The way to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) is to let people with respiratory symptoms and their contacts stay home (paid time off) until they are no longer infectious (at least 2 weeks) or test negative (free testing for all). However, considering our economic and healthcare realities, this is unlikely to happen as people can’t afford to stay home (no PTO, no culture of taking days off for minor respiratory illnesses) or seek medical care (too expensive, no universal healthcare). So we can expect the virus to keep spreading in communities in US for foreseeable future until it becomes endemic and no one cares anymore (like what happened to other respiratory viruses including flu).

(Healthy people wearing masks in public and spraying public places and transport with disinfectants is NOT going to stop this epidemic. That is simply cosmetics and PR by governments to pretend as if they are doing something)"
2020-03-06 14:14,"I am 65 and will do what I can do postpone exposure. I'd rather wait until there is at least an effective anti-viral and not just supportive care.

What I see occurring is exponential spread.  The number of cases in the US increased almost 30% today. If we assume that rate of growth continues (epidemics tend to grow exponentially), we will have almost a thousand cases in a week, 160,000 in a month, and it could infect nearly everyone in the country by early May.  If the death rate is 2% now (low estimate), it will become much higher when the hospitals are full, the healthcare workers are sick and all services break down.

I believe that if people self isolate, the GDP will drop. If self-isolation (canceling group meetings, working from home etc) is not instituted, the infection rate will dramatically increase.  Either way consumer consumption drops and the market is reflecting this. In my opinion, we have a global recession is in the making.

We will know more in 1-2 weeks as more info becomes available."
2020-03-06 14:16,"We’re in NYC with two kids and a two week Spring Break coming up. We were supposed to go to London for 1 week to see family but cancelled that - it’s not so much fear of getting sick as not wanting to risk quarantine abroad or issues getting back to the US.

2020-03-06 14:19,"Free markets can’t deal with pandemics. Free markets only capitalize on it through their ability to opportunistically gouge society.

There’s no ungodly amounts of money to be made from prevention and certainly not from cures - that’s bad for business. We have a medical and pharmaceutical industrial complex owned and operated by wealthy profiteers only interested in constant and ever increasing revenue streams from maintaining a sick society. One only needs to see how candy displays are front and center as you walk up to the pharmacy counter to pick up overpriced diabetes prescription.

Antibiotics, vaccines and drugs that actually cure patients - that kins the pharmaceutical industry avoids - needs governments to invest in a public version of pharmaceutical R&D and production capability - kept away from the profiteers - that will handle production and supply of vaccines, antibiotics, insulin,  even testing kits, etc all in the public health interest - like infrastructure and defense. Leave the as seen on TV overpriced designer maintenance drugs to the private sector.

Pandemics are also a wake up call to overpopulation of our tiny planet with the inevitable high concentration and close proximity of unsustainably large populations - population growth only benefits Wall Street and the profiteers at the top."
2020-03-06 14:20,"In NYC, they are refusing to test potential cases for a variety of reasons, including not enough tests and a stringent criteria. There have been several people who have come back from Italy with mild symptoms and doctors tell them that they are too young or not symptomatic enough to get tested. 

There was a case in Brooklyn recently where a man came back from Japan with fever and resperatory issues and the CDC told him to go back to work, refusing to test him. If cases like these continue to happen, it's only going to continue spreading further."
2020-03-06 14:29,Pence said on Monday a million test kits would be available by Friday. A million test kits aren't available today.  So why is that ?
2020-03-06 14:32,"Part of the reason there aren't enough masks, test kits, purell, etc. is that pretty much everything is made in China.   Those factories have been shut down.  The sooner we reduce our dependence on China for just about everything we need, the better.  Better for national security, better for human rights, better for the environment.  We need to be able to make emergency supplies here in the US and not depend on (unfriendly) foreign countries."
2020-03-06 14:32,"As a healthcare worker, I don’t understand how nurses lack training or equipment to isolate patients.  I mean, nurses isolate patients for respiratory viruses every day. The protocols are no different than isolating for flu or other viral pathogens. What am I missing?"
2020-03-06 14:20,"Korea has a significant outbreak, but by testing more than a hundred thousand people, treating people who have the infection early (before the virus is getting too deep into people's lungs) – the deaths per infected person is at only 0.6% there and they have managed to keep the infection largely contained in one part of the country (and out of Seoul). That should be the new global gold standard."

And I strongly believe it is the Trump administration."
2020-03-06 14:37,"If one goes to the site Worldometers, which has counters for among other things coronavirus cases worldwide, one gets statistics that of the cases so far, 41,275 are active (the rest are ""recovered"" or dead).  Of those, 85% are ""mild"" and 15% are ""severe or critical"".

Obviously, the rate of ""severe or critical"" at 15% of known and active cases far outstrips the percentage of dead which is at 3.4%.

So I have a question, which hasn't been reported at all as far as I can see:  How many people who have had the virus and no longer have it have permanent damage to their respiratory functions or lungs?

During the 1918 flu, there were a lot of deaths.  But there were a lot of people who were left with permanent lung damage (emphysema, e.g.) for the rest of their lives. Does this virus do the same or not?"

This is an unprecedented situation; it's not always obvious just what governments should be doing, that they're not already doing.  Given how quickly things are changing, it's also not surprising that there are seeming inconsistencies in statements from different public officials.

Over-reaction by governments can produce panic, panic that can do more harm than the virus itself. Such panic seems to be afflicting financial markets.  But inadequate action can allow the virus to spread.  Finding the right balance is not easy.

The press and media have not been perfect either.  Much of the reporting seems designed to politicize the situation rather than report the situation.  The current front page opinion piece headline in the Times  calling the administration's response ""calamitous"" is overwrought and not really helpful.

 On Monday, the Times prominently printed the headline in an opinion piece suggesting ""Big Pharma"" was interfering with vaccine development.  This is nonsense, and frankly the sort of hate mongering that makes a bad situation worse.

We have a total lack of leadership in this country as we potentially face a national crisis.  Instead we have a President who seeks targets to blame such as ""the Democrats"", ""the liberal media"" rather than take charge and responsibility.

We may be lucky that this virus will run its course with only a few fatalities etc.  But we are certainly not prepared for the real possibility that it's going to be far worse."

I guess we should wait for the media to tell us when it is time to worry."

Trump fiddles trafficking in hunches, conspiracies, and petty score-settling while the crisis multiplies. Fear of the virus is already having drastic social and economic consequences and could spiral and ultimately do more damage than the virus itself. History will not be kind to this feckless bunch and I hope the electorate will speak with one voice to wipe away this smear of an administration which only knows chaos and their congressional enablers. 

I pray local leadership will be strong enough to guide the good people on the ground through this, but it's already clear that in many places this too is failing. The picture you show of Korean workers disinfecting a crosswalk illustrates this—pointless theater, wasted work. The science says they would be better deployed disinfecting touchable surfaces on mass choke points.   It's all very depressing."
2020-03-06 14:06,"At a time when America needs a leader...we have Trump. His history of lying multiple times on a daily basis means that even if he’s telling the truth he can’t be trusted.

Pence botched an HIV epidemic by refusing to back a needle exchange program. America lacks trusted leaders."
2020-03-06 14:13,"Italy is reporting a strain on availability of ICU beds. Irregardless of the percentage of cases needing ICU, if the number of patients outnumber the # of ICU beds available the death rate will increase. This undoubtedly has occurred in China.

I believe that mortality may take weeks to be correctly assessed while the infected deteriorate and that availability of ICU beds inversely correlates with mortality.

 <a href=""https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200305-sitrep-45-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=ed2ba78b_2"" target=""_blank"">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200305-sitrep-45-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=ed2ba78b_2</a>   Contained in  the above link is Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed CIVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through 04 March 2020.   This is an exponential epidemic curve.

In my opinion, the main mortality is from viral pneumonia, and the only preventative is immunity via vaccine, which is still many months away. Once you have viral pneumonia from this virus, you need intensive supportive care in the form of ICU with IVs and a medical ventilator (which are going to be in short supply if this thing really breaks out of containment as it appears is now the case). Beyond that, you are in the hands of your immune system."

I went to an urgent care center this week, and they told me there was nothing they could do and suggested I call the CDC or NY health line if I wanted to be tested.

Called a hospital, who told me if I already had a chest x-ray, CT and MRI that confirmed a lung infection, they could try to find me a test to take. So, I basically need to spend $3-5K to maybe get tested.

The Ny health line put me on hold for two hours until I fell asleep waiting.

The one upshot is that after a week of commuting back and forth to work on subways and buses, feeling horrible because I don’t have sick leave, my boss said I could work from home.

Hopefully it’s just a bad cold, but this whole situation is clearly a mess.  Our health care system and model of work is broken.

This virus is also hitting at the worst possible rime for most people: most deductibles and out of pocket expenses ($3-7K and $10-24K for individuals and families) just restarted after the holidays.  Nobody with a HDHP will want to spend the money if it “just feels like a cold.”"
2020-03-06 14:45,"Question: Since other countries are doing extensive testing,  what test(s) for coronavirus are they using?

Deliberately keeping vast swaths of a society in entrenched poverty should be a crime. For decades, this nation has refused to pay a living wage or to make healthcare affordable. Those twin engines make life tolerably miserable in the best of times. In a crisis, they, themselves become vectors of contagion. 

The very fact that we cannot produce in a timely fashion (having had a months head start on China and other nations) enough test kits and masks is inexcusable. 

And can we please inject a dose of reality into the notion that washing our hands is the one tool at our disposal?  You can wash your hands a hundred times a day (and would have to come darn close to that given the sheer number of times you touch or pick up an object). All it takes is the one time you don't wash for a disease to be spread. This notion that hand washing is the great panacea is dangerous nonsense. 

It's time for some bitter truths. We are not remotely prepared. Had this been the proverbial ""big one"" we would be in dire, deadly straits. Pure dumb luck has given us a moment to reassess and learn from this debacle. We need to start planning now for the next one.

With climate change , the change is gradual and requires greater insight and intelligence to ameliorate and prepare for than our present leadership has demonstrated.  So that there Trump can get away with his ""hoax"" thoughtlessness.

If you think the US is under-reporting that's your LOCAL health authority NOT Trump. In NYC, the mayor supervises that with a testing lab in Albany.

Beds, local testing, schools, gatherings; all of this is handled at the state or city level.

As well, any state can gain near-complete control of there health service by declaring a state of emergency. If your upset your state seems to not be taking things seriously. Why are you blaming Trump for your disinterested Governors and corrupt state Legislators?

In Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard demanded the right to have her state go around the bottleneck at the CDC and purchase testing kits directly from Japan and got her state all they needed. If your state reps are not going to bat for you that's on them ( in NYC Chuck Schumer seems more interested in waging war on the supreme court than corona virus )

If you continue to let your local authorities off the hook because you have fallen down the rabbit hole of ""all roads lead to Trump"" on every little issue; then take off your ""blinders of Trump hate"" and provide oversight on your local authorities who have far more control over this than they would admit or you could imagine."

1)Seasonal flu
2)Shingles
3)Bacterial Pneumonia
4)TDaP

Unfortunately, there may not be a deployable vaccine against CoV for another year. But then we are not panicking because we have no vaccine against HIV and no cure but one rarely dies of it lately because there is an effective treatment  that can prevent HIV infection to progress of AIDS. 

My father in his 101 st year lives in his own home and sleeps in his own bed and has round the clock care givers present including visits of a competent Doctor. Unfortunately all his friends of his age have passed away, but those alive who want to see him are expected to sanitize their hands and leave their foot wear away from his bed. My siblings and I are committed to whatever it takes financially he has to receive prompt and effective medical attention. All his life he fought for dignity for the seniors and the retired persons.

1.  High number of cases in Italy and Iran may correlate with industry-specific back/forth travel.  In the case of Italy, agriculture and luxury goods – both being produced in China, but globally marketed as Italian brands.  Conversely, Italian tourism demographics may identify another modality.   Iran is likely about energy, and field and refinery maintenance  

2.  As the disease progresses in China, infection/ mortality rates will be beyond all but the worst-case scenarios for the US – and let us peer several weeks into our future.  And how effective mass quarantines and travel embargoes are – especially given the catastrophic economic disruption they are causing

3. Cases in Japan and Korea are less anomalous – both are close to China, and likely have broad maritime-based pathways for proliferation.  But with that, four separate nations and genomic demographics – contrasting and comparing outcomes will be deeply informative

(1) You are reporting the numbers of infected and dead with a little too much certainty (e.g., 100,000 infected, 3,000 dead). These numbers should be reported as “98,000 officially detected cases” as opposed to “100,000 infected” since it is almost certain the 2-100x more are “likely infected but not yet officially detected/reported” and this undercount due to insufficient testing is skewing the official numbers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere. If you can find multiple qualified experts willing to scientifically estimate the undercount, and explain their methodology, this would be hugely valuable information for the public to understand. (Right now the public thinks there have been only 10 deaths in the U.S. from the pandemic, but maybe the real number is 100-1000 if other cases accidentally/erroneously attributed to old age, the flu, and other respiratory problems in the past 30 days were included.

(2) You are reporting breathlessly that the WHO and other leaders are imploding “now is the time for governments to act”, but you are not following up to get the exact details of *how^ governments *should* be acting, and what they should be doing (according to expert health officials). What, exactly, should be being done?

Thank you, so much, for your COVID19 coverage"
2020-03-06 14:50,"The WHO should follow examples of political messaging to reduce panic over updating the labeling of the virus to pandemic.  In other words, WHO should probably declare Coronavirus a pandemic on a late Friday evening after all global financial markets are closed but allow for the weekend of reflection, planning, and news distribution to occur.  This will likely minimize financial market and journalistic shock and disruption over the official designation.

Clean linen should be covered.  Hand cleaner with at least 60% alcohol content should be at every patient site.  Equipment was being wiped after every use with alcohol wipes.  A window with a good mesh screen was open to provide cross ventilation.  Some infection control procedures are universal - until we should be told otherwise, we have little else to go on.

Yes, I understand the immediacy and tradeoffs acceptance during emergencies, but when I look at cost / benefit over time, I think we can make better short-term decisions (quarantine) with much more positive long-term effects (less deaths from not only immediate virus but longer-terms deaths related to the unintended consequences of poisoned environment)."

That would accomplish two things: ONE, it would help to control any spread of COVID 19 in case some of his attendees might be infected and TWO, it would put on hold the further spread of all his lies, disinformation and fake accusations of all who he sees as his enemies. I could then breathe a sigh of relief for once not having to see his angry, orange face ranting to his base about how unfair the world treats him."
2020-03-06 15:10,"In response to the coronavirus in the U.S. , the issue at the national-level is not one of science, but one of politics.  Why are testing kits to identify those with the virus the available on a widespread basis throughout the world, but not in the U.S.?

The inconvenient truth is, because of vanity, the U.S. did not chose to accept the coronavirus testing developed by the W.H.O. 
Look no further than the fact that Pence was appointed by Trump to lead the national response to the pandemic as opposed to a world  recognized expert in infectious viruses. Look no further than the fact that Trump destroyed the pandemic response structures put in place by the Obama administration for the purpose of addressing situations like the one presently upon us.  In addition, Trump cut the budgets of the C.D.C. and N.I.H., as well as restricting access to quality healthcare for millions for millions of Americans.

To add insult to injury, on almost a daily basis,  the President distorts reality as it relates to the current state of the nation's readiness to respond to the pandemic.  At this juncture, because of  lack of credibility of the Trump administration, perhaps the best thing for the nation is to provide resources to fight the virus to State and local health agencies and for the federal government to get out of the way.

 And by all means, keep Trump off on national television. He is creating panic in a population that understands a different reality from the one he is presenting."

2020-03-06 15:17,"The best way to get the economy back on its feet is widespread testing, particularly of mild cases.  Without testing, mild cases cannot be distinguished from the flu or a bad cold.  As long as people live in fear and uncertainty, they will shelter in place.  Once folks are sure they are immune they will resume shopping, eating out, attending sports events and traveling, etc.  

They can also help folks who will be severely affected.  They will need it.

2020-03-06 15:17,"For a very long time the veracity of government reporting from authoritarian regimes such as China and and the former USSR has been questioned. Life there was always good, the sun shined every day, people were well-fed and incredibly happy. None of it was true, and everybody knew it. You could never trust much of anything that came from a government spokesperson. Chernobyl was the disaster it was because of this.

Now the US has become much the same. The endless distortions of the truth, outright lies and self-serving proclamations --- greatest economy in history, climate change denial, blame and aspersions cast on everyone, everywhere --- have all but destroyed our faith in getting a truthful answer about anything. While this is often fodder for late night TV comedians, when a health crisis such as this one hits, it's no laughing matter. 

Much of what is being reported about the spread of the virus and the government's response is being questioned, the underlying sentiment being that nothing can be trusted, regardless of the difficulty in identifying how many cases there are. In the end, this mistrust will exacerbate the fear and panic, especially when (not if) we reach the point where it has taken hold in the US.

This --- and not some ideological or religious faith --- is why some minimal level of trust in the honesty of government reporting is so important. During a crisis we must have some level of faith in what we are being told. Do we have that?"
2020-03-06 15:14,"The Trump administration including Trump, keeps babbling about this is not a problem, a Democratic hoax, and just go to work, etc. No problem.

If that is true why did Trump cancel his trip to CDC? A possible case there involving a worker? He doesn't even take his own advice.

As a microbiologist I can tell you that Coronavirus is a risk and transmissible. It can be controlled by proper precautions until it ""burns out"" as happens in any epidemic. I can also say it could very easily return next year when the weather turns cold and you have more people living in close proximity for longer periods, and when people start to get careless with protection measures. This is a typical pattern."
2020-03-06 15:16,"I wonder if perhaps doctors should disregard the virus and treat the symptoms. Perhaps elderly people if kept comfortable and if the pneumonia is not allowed to progress further, will not need more invasive procedures with ventilators which will now introduce contamination, sepsis, collapsed lungs etc. the real reason for their deaths. And of course now they will be pumping in antibiotics etc chasing after yet another intruder germ. Why not focus on the human biochemistry, maintain it as stably as you can......Before folks pounce on my layman speculations, may I suggest to the NYtimes, this is not a time to let only specialists think this out. There is no time. Yes, the infection appears mild, but this virus obviously changes and now you have more than two strains. It will be a matter of time before a really nasty one also makes its appearance. Dr.Sanders, write this as a problem and throw it open. It will let a world of out of the box thinkers also address this problem. Ideas may appear that the medical community may not have as yet thought of."

The draconian measures by Chinese government to lockdown cities & to contain the virus spreading should give us a warning about how seriousness of this disease.  

Hopefully China will get their production back in full speed soon so that medical and healthcare material can be produced and sent to places in need.  With Covid-19 in essence is trapped and contained, China will provide more medical supply to outside world.

Impose general quarantine and get hospitals and staff ready do deal with the cases that will develop the disease.

We should be seeing hospital construction everywhere, new warehouses being filled with supplies, greatly expanded education for healthcare workers. We should be preparing for the pandemic which will follow Covid 19, for universal healthcare, and for the inevitable increase in natural disasters caused by climate change. Global supply chains are disrupted? Suppose China becomes an enemy instead of a competitor. Our corporations should be strategically bringing  back some of the manufacturing they outsourced, so that at least any supply chain disruptions could be more quickly addressed, knowing that it is easier to expand national facilities and “American know how” than to develop them from scratch?

It was just mentioned that President Trump IS going to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.  He has also signed the senate bill for $8.3 billion to conquer this dreaded disease.  He is not sitting on his laurels and doing nothing.

2020-03-06 15:45,"Oregon has two official cases.

Earlier this week, the state estimated that hundreds in the state are probably walking around with the virus.

We have some tests here, but the state is holding on to them. Instead of using them to try to understand the spread of the virus, they are waiting to confirm the worst cases.

Sure, we want to have some on hand to confirm the worst cases — those that most likely have it. But why confirm only what is more or less obvious and hold on to the rest?

Unless I am really missing something, testing doesn't make the worst cases better, and not testing less severe but possible cases encourage the spread, adding a false sense of security."
2020-03-06 15:45,"Perhaps the numbers are incorrect. China has had 80,000 cases for about a week now. If that is the total cases through the whole event then they apparently have stopped the spread completely. I doubt that is true. I doubt their deaths have stopped as well. They have stopped reporting new cases and deaths

I guess that we get numbers that are meant to not frighten people and thus protect markets. That is not going to help and it just serves to show us that the media and governments really only care about the markets. If this thing really does kill 0.5 to 2 % of cases, there is no protecting the market.

Our leaders should be doing what they can, which is likely little now, to slow the spread. I see no real action. I see no real plan. Governments are showing themselves to be fake. They lusted for power and they claim, as they all do, that they are for protecting the people. They are proving to us that they are incapable of anything more than farming the people for profit."

The hysteria that has now metastasized in market damage, the needless frightening of millions of people for something that will be an actual threat to very, very, very few. This outbreak is too sensationalized and I really wish the coverage from the NYT and others would dial back. This is not a time to panic, not a time to pull out all of the stops, not a time to cancel events, it is a time to live on and live our lives in a sensible way. For some reason, we need to keep people whipped up about something that they cannot control, that governments cannot control and can subverted by simple means for the average person. 

The hysteria that is caused by the fixation on this event is the real problem and that is worthy of attention, not the virus. The virus will spread, but the media hysteria about this is what can be controlled. I ask the editors at the NYT to start thinking about this as the coverage is overblown and is only creating a feedback loop, which is not welcome right now."

As he signed the spending bill at the White House, Mr. Trump said the report of an infection at C.D.C. had turned out to be negative. “So I may be going,” he told reporters. “We’re going to see if they can turn it around.”]]

So, the aide lied. But Trump still avoided any personal stress or effort. Then he dangles the (fake) possibility of going in the future and leaves himself the out that other people must “turn around” conditions there. 

He will, of course, never go, the issue will be forgotten and if it reappears he will say “they” never got back to him...but that “they” are doing “terrific” work over “there.”"

2020-03-06 15:59,"We should be comparing the apparent results in China with the rest of the world.  Some call the isolation measures China used as draconian.  Based on the declines in China compared to increased cases elsewhere one has to ask which approach will stop the spread of this disease and limit the short term damage to their  economy. Europe and the US are both taking a business as usual approach hoping that some miracle occurs that limits its spread in the near term.  After all, the slow approach we are witnessing is really driven by the perceived damage to the economy rather than STOPPING the spread of this pandemic."

2020-03-06 16:34,"I would love to see more coverage from the front lines: our hospitals. Are there people with symptoms requesting tests and not getting them? What are the stated reasons? According to the news reports coming out of China there was a surplus of patients and insufficient tests. Is that happening here? If so, where and how broadly? 

How is it possible that the positive cases in the US be so low if the volume of fatalities have now surpassed that of Japan, a country which has one of the highest caseloads outside of China?"
2020-03-06 16:42,"It’s hard to believe that the states are all working in step with the CDC. They appear to be taking radically different approaches. My family recently moved to Seattle from Brooklyn and we are astonished by the lack of decisive, quick and focused action which is needed in a situation like this. There are daily reports that residents and staff (including those with symptoms) of the Life Care Nursing Home still haven’t been tested. In addition, people who have visited the facility during the course of the outbreak have not been able to get tested or clear guidance on how to handle their exposure. 

Earlier this week (days after the first death was announced), the Governor spoke via a general public press conference to the families with loved ones in the facility and said that there was no need to quarantine if you had visited the facility unless you have symptoms. Meanwhile, NY has thousands in quarantine and California has managed to test and quarantine an entire cruise ship. 

The Governor called for Washington’s citizens to be leaders in this fight. The wavering recommendations to the schools, citizens and those in most critical need of help does little to convey a spirit of leadership or direction."
2020-03-06 16:57,"China’s draconian isolation measures appear to be stemming their epidemic. It’s too early to tell if a directed public health campaign where cases and contacts are identified and triaged as necessary will do as well. 

My fear is we’ll fail miserably, mostly for lack of testing early enough. It’s not helping that the president and his boosters are downplaying things. The experts should be front and center with the whole unvarnished truth and no political spin. 

People seem overly focused on the exact mortality rate. It’s clearly more dangerous to infected individuals than the average flu. And we should expect a lower mortality rate here than in less advanced countries. But it’s not a trivial test of our hospitals if 1 in 7 infected persons need hospitalization and 1 in 20 need intensive care, as Chinese statistics indicated. 

For those who don’t know, we have very little flex capability in the vast majority of our hospitals. And staffing is just as tight. Add in workplace exposures and resultant quarantines of essential staff, and the whole system could easily collapse. Rural communities where hospitals have closed for lack of Medicaid expansion may be out of luck if the epidemic isn’t soon brought under control and spreads nationwide."
2020-03-06 16:58,"I think the biggest problem is that very few people talking about it seem to understand what the goal of the WHO and CDC is. I keep hearing people say things about “staying safe” or “most people will recover.” These statements suggest that the goal is to prevent deaths. But the real goal is to prevent it from becoming a pandemic that returns every year like the flu. The last thing we need is another seasonal flu to deal with. 

We have a chance to contain this virus so it never comes back. But not if we don’t even know that that’s the goal."
2020-03-06 17:13,"People at my job have decided that the Coronavirus is nothing more than media created pandemonium, a news cycle.

2020-03-06 17:19,"Here in Europe in the distant past when plagues ran rampant, anybody showing symptoms would be confined to their house and all doors and possible means of exit were nailed closed for a couple of weeks and a big red cross was painted on the door. Obviously we have progressed beyond that, but confinement (isolation) still seems a really good idea. Here in the UK, if you do have the virus you will be financially compensated for not working, if you isolate yourself. I don’t believe that this is the case in the USA (but I could be wrong). Anyway, the less infected people roaming around, the better and mass reliable testing is absolutely essential, anything else is a recipe for a pandemic. Here at the moment, the number of cases is doubling on a daily basis, which is a concern. But like all viral infections, it will end eventually, but it  helps if you have somebody at the top who tells you the truth, without a fantasy political spin on it."
2020-03-06 17:19,"Frankly, it was time to ""pull out all the stops"" more than a month ago.

The nearby hospital just reported 3 more deaths since yesterday. There have not been enough tests to test everyone there or other places. The care facility was also not quarantined, meaning residents were not always separated from one another. There are residents who have tested positive. The CDC, although sporadically on site, is not managing this situation. My friend’s mom passed away, over night yesterday...they received a call at 3:30am. Then, another call at 10:30am...saying “just calling to say Mom is fine.”"
2020-03-06 17:04,"We should just assume that our government is not going to be truthful with us about this and educate ourselves through the available scientific literature to protect ourselves. We are dealing with a president who drew on an official weather forecast with a Sharpie because he thought Alabama was on the Atlantic Ocean — no bottom to his ignorance and brazen lies. 

As a person living with relapsing-remitting MS who has learned how to avoid germs to stay healthy, I recommend that in addition to proper hand washing and not touching your face, everyone should use antibacterial wipes to wipe down anything you take out in public, and to do this as soon as you get back home. I always wipe down my phone and the surface I place it on to sanitize it, and I quickly throw my clothes into the washing machine if I’ve been in a crowded place. 

The key is keeping anything you touch frequently as free of germs as possible. Don’t touch anything when you get back home until you’ve washed your hands and sanitized phone etc. Your car is also a place germs like to hide, so wipe down your steering wheel and dashboard, etc. It’s really not that hard to get into this routine, and it has done a world of good keeping me from getting the flu for three seasons now. I had the flu in January 2017 and it literally almost killed me. After that, I became vigilant about germs. May sound crazy, but I’d rather be crazy than dead."

In the meantime, they are handling ""take home"" bottles which are returned  by other clients (aka: patients). In other words, a person whose hands could have been anywhere (like in their own pants) hand used bottles to the nurse, who in turn hands me a cup I drink from along with the ""take home"" bottles I receive. They also recive urine samples. I cannot think of a better way to spread this virus. I can't get in touch with any local health department. It is outrageous. I have hounded them for months about their unsanitary conditions. The answer I received less than a week ago was ""I will bring it up at our next staff meeting"". They are so behind by not dealing with this, it is criminal. The only upside is I have been tapering down for many months (ultimately) to zero. Right now, I am 3/4 of the way there."

  Our narcissist-in-chief cannot keep his fragile ego out of the way and actually act as the leader he was elected to be, yet has NEVER BEEN.  No, instead he contradicts his own health officials, all but suggests those with mild cases ought to go to work, and minimizes it as nothing but a cold, because he personalizes the corona virus.   Trump has no credibility with the American people.  His transparent lies, this void of leadership, and failure to calm the masses has further depressed the stock market.  Appointing Pence as the ""czar"" is a joke.  It's no wonder we are unprepared.  Our administration has failed us, again.  Mr Obama HAD a pandemic organization within the Govt.  Trump abolished it.

But still as administrators they did little and downplayed the situation until it got very out of hand.

Washington State should declare MARTIAL LAW to quarantine towns. Now we have cases in US reported from travel from the epicenter in US. Today China reported  ZERO cases outside of the Epicenter. They locked Hubei Province and we need to do same at State level. I am not pro-China but they applied what common sense will do to save more lives!

In response to your comment to me:

I am very aware that the senate bill he signed for $8.3 billion for the coronavirus outbreak was bi partisan.  He has said all along that he would do anything to assist in this dreaded coronavirus and he is delivering.  He keeps his promises.  How refreshing."
2020-03-06 16:46,"It would be helpful if on the map adjacent to this piece showing the number of cases worldwide, the Times would cite the number of people in those countries as well.

Even though Wuhan, China was the source of this outbreak and it spread undetected for 6-10 weeks, they have 80,000 reported cases out of 1.4 billion people. That is 0.005% of the population. So, after more than three months 99.995% of the people in China have NOT been infected with the Coronavirus. 

We have 200 cases out of 350,000,000 people, most from overseas travel. You do the math.

It would be helpful if Wall Street recognizes this as well."

I've lost count of the number of times I've heard people say ""it's just a flu"" or ""it's a hoax."" They're literally quoting Trump and Hannity as they cough and sneeze. 

Florida is NOT widely testing for COVID-19. Thus far, only 100 tests have been performed in a state where 23% of the population is over 60 years of age. 

There are 3 State labs for testing, but they are understaffed and overwhelmed even with the old criteria of testing only known contacts or hot-spot travelers. Testing at healthcare facilities, according to DeSantis, is ""months away."" Source: Miami Herald

Orlando/Orange County health department held a press conference last night. The mayor focused on losing $154 million in cancelled conferences, but that ""Orlando is open for business!""  What was truly worse--unbelievable!--was a top-level health dept. official repeatedly referring to THE FLU. ""If you think you have the flu..."" and so on. It's all about the flu. This, from a health department official. 

Though the CDC has published excellent guidance, for example, to colleges and universities, the guidance is based on whether or not ""cases are identified"" in a community. No testing = no cases = no action taken. Just rapid transmission of COVID--19 all over the place. 

I have completely lost faith in my local, state, and federal government. This is dangerous."

I am on a listserv with medical personnel and often hear comments about how ""at the JCAO audit they dinged us on (insert insignificant issue here)"".

The US has tourism from China but also educational and business ties.
Why India with no reported cases seems odd.  Perhaps universal health care and a history of dealing with communicable disease?

Lots of fruit, lots of juice, maybe lots of sugar but since most don’t have diabetes it’s perfectly lovely. I can’t at my age get gluttonous on fruits so folks, I am chomping my daily vitamins, eating my Vitamin A in anything orange colored and gobbling lots of Vit C (thank you Linus Pauling) and Vit D. And of course an occasional glass of Gatorade to balance my innards. Burning lovely smelling incense sticks to channel the calm bat in me. I don’t care at this point about how the WH is directing this effort because honestly that would scare me into the virus zone. Honestly the house smells great, lots of home cooking, not too bad having everyone connect over a common topic, less driving, less pollution....we might just purge our environment and our bodies of horrible pollutants :-)))). Maybe corona is the push we need to pay attention to the nonsense we are doing to the world and our bodies. This virus is causing an evolutionary jump in our thinking, habits and environment."

The article explains in details the entire case .
In February the infection spread to several northern italian regions and it has been proven that the genoma of the German Coronavirus is the same of the Italian , French etc .

A week an a half after my first Seattle stop, I developed a cough and began to feel as though I had a cold.  By last weekend (just over 2 weeks after Seattle), I felt like I had the flu.

I called my doctor's office on Monday, was told there were no appointments and was sent to the local hospital's lab for a flu test and chest x-ray.  The flu test was negative, but on Tuesday they entered a diagnosis of ""acute bronchitis"" in my chart.  I called back and asked about a coronavirus test, but they said I ""didn't meet the criteria"" and to call back next week if I was still sick.

If I don't meet the criteria, folks, NOBODY is being tested.  I have self-isolated the last half of this week, but I was around thousands of people in the two weeks prior.  I hope you weren't one of them...."

The price for playing ostrich by refusing any community testing unlinked to China for 2 months will be a stunning increase in documented cases as soon as testing ramps up nationwide.
Given the report on the molecular analysis of isolates from Washington State I strongly suspect the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus has been circulating in the US for several months already, creating cases of the ""Flu"". 

On the other hand, more widespread testing should also increase the denominator used to determine severity and mortality rates, which I expect to end up below 1%."

In reality, the markets are not reacting well to the lies and cynicism of the administration."
2020-03-06 19:25,"The number of cases by itself is irrelevant: the important number is the number of deaths associated with the infection.

The other thing that needs to be repeated, over and over again, is that for the majority of people infected the disease is merely asymptomatic or modest.

The people who are dying are, for the most part, older people with underlying serious systemic medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, malignancies, or diabetes.

The worldwide panic is unfortunate and unnecessary:  education, caution, and precaution are important."

They told me that I might have it, I might not (it could be bronchitis or flu), but since I have no underlying health issues I should just self-quarantine, drink lots of liquids, and when my fever has been gone for 72 hours I can go back to work. They do not have enough tests to test me. My doctor has not even returned my phone calls and emails, they're so overwhelmed.

They also told me that if I WAS diagnosed with COVID-19, they'd tell me to self-quarantine for 14 days. But since they can't test me, that doesn't apply....nevermind that they can't/won't test me.

If I have bronchitis, I need to go on antibiotics, but I can't get an appointment to be checked out for that, so I'm relying on hot tea, rest, and ibuprofen to make myself better. 

This is absolutely ridiculous. 

I'm a teacher at a large high school. The school has so many teachers like myself out right now that they couldn't find subs to cover the classes, so my colleagues are using their prep periods to cover other classes such as mine.

Like any new and unpredictable situation, there are going to be mistakes. Test kits are going to malfunction, people are going to hoard supplies, etc. 

But schools have been closed, transportation systems are being sanitized, vaccines are even pursued ! I think we are doing just fine. 

There are reasons to believe that more people than they know have been exposed, which means the death toll is even lower than reported.

Because we are near defenseless. Up against the wall, from this viral mutation which is NOT ""corona flu"" Trump claims. That notion serves his narrative hoping to prop up his poll numbers and the markets for another day but blowing off the potential severity of this epidemic is dangerous and irresponsible long term strategy. But he can't see it. 
Trump suffers from ""narcissistic thought disorder"". It leads him to believe that he knows it all resulting is his numerous errors of fact, like a child, while contradicting those educated in complex sciences. 

America's for profit hospital model does maximizes return on capital by restricting capacity. Consequently hospitals running full in winter have minimal room for an unexpected bump in traffic. We need to buy time. 
Given that testing, ventilators and hospital rooms and providers are reported by experts to be severely restricted, our only protections are social distancing, quarantines and common sense sanitation.

Let us pray that some scientist somewhere in this world of 7 billion people can figure something out.

If Trump doesn’t act soon, he must be forced to act, if even Wall Street crashing and people dying doesn’t move him , then this might take divine intervention."
2020-03-06 19:46,"it wouldn't surprise me at all if trump took most of that coronavirus  scheduled money for his mexican wall. is that money going directly into a virus fund, for which we, as citizens, can know how much of the money is going to its designated destination? if not, don't be surprised to learn where it ends up."
2020-03-06 19:46,"A study in the New England Journal of Medicine says, “The new Coronavirus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.”

Good news, this crisis might go away soon and sunshine still is the best disinfectant.

Not so good news, what do you say to those deniers who argue global warming is a good thing?"
2020-03-06 19:47,"Personally, I think we all pretty well know  why nothing was being done and when we look back at this time will instead be kicking ourselves for having let our cowardice prevent us from doing anything about it."
2020-03-06 19:45,"""The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention compiled a study which was based on 72,314 patient records and 44,672 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Mainland China as of February 11, 2020.""

""The paper found that the fatality rate gradually increases with age. For example, there were no deaths among children aged nine or younger while it stood at 0.2 percent for people aged between 10 and 39. It increased to 3.6 percent in the 60-69 age bracket before rising to 8 percent among those aged 70 to 79 and 14.8 percent among people in their 80s or older.""

So good luck to all those elderly people going to Trump's rallies believing his ""gut feeling"" that this is really nothing."
2020-03-06 19:46,"Let's not forget, this administration is headed by corporate hacks who are only concerned about crises in terms of message control. You know how when the Deepwater Horizon disaster was gushing millions of gallons of crude oil into the Gulf Of Mexico and BP representatives were on TV talking about ""containment"" and whatnot?"
2020-03-06 19:49,"It is the first time in a long lifetime that this reader is hearing that The World Health Organization has declared a very high risk of the spreading of an illness on a global basis, urging the governments of nations to take action now, and not tomorrow.

China is taking 'draconian' measures to contain ""The Wuhan Pneumonia Virus"", and it appears to have subsided for the time being.

America is not in 'panic mode' yet, but preparations are being made for this outbreak.

The virus does not flourish in the heat, and our children should expect early school spring break this year, where they continue to study from home by remote-control;

Dry throat discomfort, followed by a dry cough and high fever with chest pain, are some of the symptoms to be monitored and checked soonest with medical offices;

Nasal drip and a mucous cough are more symptomatic of a cold.

The virus does not last in the laundry heat, and clothes should be washed more often, placed in the dryer or in the sun.

Drinking hot water is another cautionary measure, ensuring hydration, it is good for one's health and slows the virus from entering the lungs.

Visiting homes for the elderly is discouraged for the time being, and for those of us employed, the government could request that the private and public sectors give their workers and employees more extended sick leave, with pay.

Public-Awareness is key; this is not a 'Hoax'; follow updates from W.H.O. and International Times coverage."
2020-03-06 19:56,"Interesting stats...published today by the BBC

""The national health institute [of Italy] said the average age of those who had died so far was 81, with the vast majority suffering underlying health problems. Just 28% were women.""

81 is the *average* age?  Italy must have a significant number of very old people.

That more men than women smoke I'm guessing is the reason for the lower mortality rate among women."
2020-03-06 19:57,"W.H.O. is urging to take actions.
our administration federal and local tells us to go about our life as this is just a ""flue on steroids"".  
imagine what would have happened in Woohan, if people would just ""go about their lives"".

the proclamation that anybody can be tested is a lie. my daughter tested negative flue strep with cough and 103.7 fever - the hospital apparently did not receive the updated CDC protocol - it was not sent to them. it was only proclaimed on TV.

People in NY and NJ in extremely populous area are encouraged to take public transport  and come to work even thou they can telecommute.

there is a hope that there might be seasonality to the virus and spring can slow down the spread.
why we are not receiving a message - if you can stay home - stay home.
it would at least somewhat spaced out the spread and reduced the burden on strained health services.

why is the government  doing the opposite . is that so the virus takes its course  swipes through the country the fastest  so  they can press the reset button sooner and go back to ""fixing"" the stock market ? all of this while keeping the infected numbers artificially low to be able to declare ""containment""."
2020-03-06 16:35,"The catastrophic failure by US authorities to even provide adequate coronavirus test kits, over 2 months into the crisis, beggars belief--this is worse than ""third world healthcare"", it's a total system collapse in American public health that's terrifying the general public and investors (hence the stock market collapse) and crippling morale in the healthcare sector. Countries across the world--South Korea, France, China, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands--have been aggressively testing millions of people with WHO validated protocols, to help pinpoint and control the pandemic. Over 10,000 a day in Korea alone! Meanwhile, US doctors and nurses are reduced to begging for scarce CDC testing for patients who clearly exhibit the COVID-19 clinical picture and test negative for flu, pneumococcus or other classic pneumonia causes, having no recourse but to discharge them into the community without a diagnosis to likely spread the pandemic further.

Health care workers in particular are being hard-hit by this debacle. Many are showing worrisome respiratory signs and symptoms, but without the capacity to test, we have an impossible dilemma. If we self-quarantine without a confirmed diagnosis, we risk exacerbating an already frightening healthcare staff shortage tearing across the nation. Yet if we carry on and later turn out to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, we risk a calamitous spread of the virus to other personnel and non-infected patients. We need those test kits now! This is outrageous!"
2020-03-06 17:32,"Thanks to trumps eggshell ego and arrogance, there is no concerted effort between the states and the Federal government. Even in a time of crisis, trump preaches lies and deviseveness. The gop props up a clown instead of calling for leadership. God help America."

2020-03-06 19:55,"The administration is scrambling and I don't expect them to come out and say; ""hey, we were caught off guard here.""  But I do expect them to do something more than what we've seen so far which amounts to a dumpster fire.

So far we have:

- A science denier in charge of a nationwide medical crisis.  Someone who is ill-equipped both professionally and intellectually (I'm not kidding)

- Medical experts being muzzled

- A president who releases false information like he's handing out candy on Halloween

- Messaging that seems to be coordinated by a group rivaling the Three Stooges

- A president blaming market volatility on the Democratic debate (baffling)

- Leadership incapable of coordinating any effort that is comforting the American public (just see the equity markets and the lack of toilet paper on store shelves)

It's a disjointed mess being led by Super Don and his merry band of court jesters.

2020-03-06 19:55,"My doctor gave me a pneumonia shot last autumn which is likely to help minimize the effects of covid 19. Why don't US doctors offer this to people most at risk? They would just be taking care of the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. I know I got my shot free because of our health system but even with your system doctors could offer it at an affordable rate. It could even save a few lives. Hopefully, your government - state or federal - will get on this."
2020-03-06 19:54,"We know President Trump could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and his base would still love him. Will they still love him when hundreds or thousands of Americans die - including their family and friends - due to his mishandling of the crisis? Probably, because Fox News will tell them it’s the Democrats fault, they’re trying to make Trump look bad."
2020-03-06 20:01,"I note that Trump in the picture with this column looks extremely dire and worried, so he should be, as literally the lives of hundreds of millions of people are in his hands.
I hate to say this, but the UK Tory Government, have been much worse, than even Trump as they have taken zero measures to protect the UK population up until this week, when we have been subject to an onslaught  of media propaganda simply to wash our hands. Cases of COVID-19 have jumped from virtually none to 160 in one week and the Johnson Government has moved from containment of  the virus to delaying it, so the numbers of seriously ill people do not overwhelm the NHS.
 However the Tories have cut 100,000 beds from the NHS in 10 years of brutal austerity, there are only 15 high dependency beds in the whole of the UK and the NHS because of the hostile environment created by the Tories post Brexit is tens of thousands of nurses and doctors short, because EU doctors and nurses are leaving the NHS in large numbers. The NHS is so underfunded and understaffed that many doctors and nurses retire early and are totally burnt out.
Johnson put forward what he thought was a great idea which was to coerce or possibly force retired doctors and nurses back to work. The Guardian newspaper was contacted by over a hundred retired medics and virtually all these retired medics could never envisage going back to the NHS because they had been burnt out and abused by their former NHS employer. 
So much for this great plan."
2020-03-06 20:01,"Since Americans seem to be having a hard time distinguishing between the 0.1% mortality rate of the flu and the 3.4% rate of COVID-19, perhaps we should take out the decimals and just say the coronavirus has a 3400% higher death rate than the flu."
2020-03-06 20:01,"Let's see how that $3.8 billion will be spent.  If it's up to Trump, everyone will get what they want. Spending has never been a problem for him."
2020-03-06 20:02,Nursing homes have a vested interest in not being perceived as incubators of communicable diseases.  It would be a direct reflection on their management and staff and profoundly affect their bottom line if all their patients started dying and they couldn't get new ones.
2020-03-06 20:04,"It is not a surprise where the virus has been found.  These areas have good public health labs and I would expect these to be sentinal sites. The virus will not be found in certain states until it is way past the ""tip of the iceberg"" stage."
2020-03-06 20:09,"South America recorded low cases, but I think Brazil and others countries have more cases of coronavirus than they claimed."
2020-03-06 20:11,"How can we contain an outbreak if we don’t have testing capability to understand its breadth and depth? Spread is occurring in the U.S. way more rapidly than we see in the numbers. It’s unbelievable how unprepared we are, and the impact and deaths that will be direct result of poor planning."
2020-03-06 20:15,"Just by comparison, the health systems across the developed nations are in a better position for surveillance and control of epidemics. As large and rich as the US is, our health system is fragmented and leaves huge segments of our population without any coverage. In a larger outbreak our healthcare system would easily and quickly become overwhelmed. Denial of the requirement for socialized healthcare is difficult to rationalize when faced with an epidemic. Testing in US has not even reflected a fraction of the population up to now. Virtually no surveillance of our population is being done. The numbers only reflect the sickest cases which have emerged on the public scene and their contacts. We have no idea how widespread the virus is. Epidemiologists are not able to give estimates of it's rate of spread or mortality."
2020-03-06 20:21,So more tax cuts for those who don't need it.  I guess that is where the 8.5 billion will go.
2020-03-06 20:23,"1) We don't have the data to know how many people have had the coronavirus.  Therefore, the mortality rate is unknown -- we can only estimate.  

2) we don't know the transmission rate.  Wuhan is bigger in population than NYC and more densely populated.  Most of the country, except places like NYC, aren't that densely populated and people don't use mass transit.  Our experience here in terms of number of cases, could be much different than Wuhan simply on the basis of less population density and we know the importance of hand washing etc.  

3) whatever the actual rates, we have to assess the reduction in coronavirus transmission from doing nothing to a complete shutdown.  How much better would a full scale quarantine of the entire country do than people washing their hands, staying away from large gatherings and self-limiting social contact -- plus locking down our borders.

4) a US wide quarantine would destroy our economy.  High tech companies where all workers can work remotely would survive, but many small businesses would likely go bankrupt and many people would lose jobs that wouldn't immediately come back.  The travel industry would be destroyed - so the economic impact of a month long quarantine would be many times than 8% of GDP.   So, any actions we take  must take that into account.  Sure if a full quarantine would save 1 million lives, quarantine.  But what if it's only 1000 vs essentially people self managing?"
2020-03-06 18:28,"A few thoughts...

I wish we could leave 'politics' out of discussion of the coronavirus.  I'm not the biggest fan of Donald Trump either, but there is only so much anyone can do to combat a threat that masquerades behind a facade of innocence.  To wit:  there is no easy path forward.  Patience and understanding, please.  Things are bad enough without all the rancor.

With the rising number of education institutions turning to online teaching rather than in-classroom, at least for the duration, how many will decide later that---hey!---this 'online' method is a heck of alot easier and cheaper than the real thing.  Let's stay with it.  Attend Harvard, without leaving your bedroom in Boise!

2020-03-06 20:13,"The advice in the NYT story about what to do if you're sick is less than helpful and full of contradictions. How do you get to the doctor if you don't own a car and shouldn't take public transportation or a cab? Fly? How can you wear a mask to the doctor's office if there are no masks to be found? 

While the CDC, Azar, Pence, and Cuccinelli spend all day aiding Trump with his disinformation campaign (Everybody can get a test? Really?), it appears that the NYT is forced to make up its own recommendations."

Before I lean into panic and cynicism, I want to first commend my school district's communication and response to the community regarding Covid-19. They have not only provided up-to-date information regarding hygiene practices, case numbers and the scope of the virus in CO but also have been working with janitors to make sure the schools are being sanitized. Last week, before our first case was even confirmed they were emailing staff about what to do. What's disheartening, however, is my school district leadership has provided more information than the President of the United States.

I think it's apparent by now that federal management is not going to solve this crisis, which is an utter breakdown of the role of federalism (can you tell i'm a Social Studies teacher?). If my local school district can communicate better and more timely factual information than the federal government, I sincerely worry about the state of trust in our nation following this crisis."

2020-03-06 20:12,"Trump's lack of credibility after 3 years and 15,000+ lies means no one believes him when he says he's rallying the forces to fight coronavirus.  

When the POTUS is a narcissist who hates anyone offering a negative word about his policies or motives, then America is likely to learn actual difficulties and pitfalls of the federal government responding to a pandemic.  

Congressional Republicans need to step into solving problems alongside Democrats sooner when seeing the POTUS failing at the helm.

That is higher than regular flu-about .14 %, but much lower than reports of 2-3%.  Those 2-3% reports are almost certainly the result of faulty and sparse testing, especially in the U.S.  A second point revealing the absurdity of  some of the 'experts' advice. OK, so they all say 'masks are unnecessary, don't buy a mask.""  But then, every 'expert' then says 'if you have symptoms and test  positive, you have to wear a mask.'

2020-03-06 20:03,"“Seasonal flu kills 100,000 every year in the US….”, I only have figures from Public Health England, but this statement appears to be UNTRUE.

2018 Flu figures for England (population 56 million [1]).  
Confirmed influenza A+B types [2] cases: 3245, Deaths: 330, ICU admissions: 2924, 
ICU case fatality rate: 9.3%.

2018 Confirmed influenza cases (with severe respiratory complications) admitted to specialist centres for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment: 79.

Even given that the US population is 6-7 times bigger than England’s, these data do not suggest ‘100,000 deaths’ annually.

The ‘thousands of deaths’ usually being quoted are actually deaths ASSOCIATED with the flu season – not proven consequences of influenza virus infection. This is measured as the increase in baseline ‘all causes’ mortality observed at times that flu viruses are known to be active – usually winter. 

The FluMOMO component of EuroMOMO’s mathematical modelling of European mortality (partly corrected for coincident hypothermia deaths) shows that for 2017/18 there were 26,498 deaths in England ASSOCIATED with influenza.

Whatever you make of these English figures, there’s no direct evidence that Covid-19 can be laughed off as ‘just like seasonal flu’. ‘Associated with’ is not the same as ‘caused by’.

2020-03-06 19:58,"It is to late for containment. Most public health officials are only worried about moving the Epi curve to have a long slow burn vs a spike. A long slow infection will provide enough hospital beds for sick people, whereas a spike will overwhelm the health system.

Experts know for a certainty that the actual number of infections is much, much higher, and that the reason we don't have a better grasp on the actual number is the inexcusable and so far unexplained bottleneck in testing.

Yes, there are shortages but they are being addressed. There may be closings and changes in our daily lives and vacation plans but we will get through this. This is the year 2020, not 1917-18. I would recommend watching the task force in which the heads of the CDC, NIH and National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases report the facts as best they are known. Their reports are on television and one hears directly from Dr. Fauci and the others. They do not mince words nor do they feed on rumors and hindsight.

2020-03-06 21:01,"I spoke by telephone today with a friend whose adult daughter is recovering from a severe flu-like disease. She lives in Dallas but was attending a business seminar in NYC last week. 

When she became symptomatic, my friend and his wife brought her back to their home here in Bucks County. They are all self quarantined in their house.  The mother is an RN.  They're getting food deliveries from a local supermarket.  They're voluntarily and wisely doing the right thing.

Her symptoms were so severe that they took her to Doylestown Hospital twice. She tested negative for flu. The hospital has no corona virus test kits. Despite their best intentions and efforts, this family may have carried the virus to the hospital. 

This is a very affluent suburban area occupied by highly educated professionals many of whom work at Merck or Johnson & Johnson.     The virus may be here and it may be affect health care workers and pharmaceutical researchers.  Another friend, a Merck retiree, says that development of a vaccine takes a year or longer.  Human testing and evaluation of potentially harmful side effects take time.

The lack of test kits (let alone a vaccine) leaves us essentially defenseless.  We cannot know where the virus is lurking.  Not everyone infected will do the right thing and self quarantine."
2020-03-06 20:50,"Could the NYT find out answers to these questions?
1. What symptoms of a common cold or flu are absent in a covid19 infection? (E.g., I read a rumor that a runny nose is NOT a covid19 symptom)
2. Should we leave our shoes outside our houses?
2. Should we wash our clothes every time we return from being out?"
2020-03-06 20:34,"Is a reporter at the NYT working on a story about how/why the CDC has been sooooooo incredibly, unbelievably incompetent in handling this outbreak??? Is it because they cut funding for the agency? Because the person in charge doesn’t believe in science? What in God’s name is going on in there???

I’m not even a health care professional and I feel like I could be doing a better job managing this. 

Also: why haven’t we called up the Koreans to get tips from them? They are doing this right. We should be following their example. Testing aggressively is the best way to keep the immune-compromised and elderly protected. 

What is going on??? I feel like I’m totally in the dark and don’t know if it’s because of politics or incompetence or what."
2020-03-06 19:29,"I live in a city of 500,000  and it has been reported that the health department has 5 test kits. That is ridiculous, incompetent, and wrong! Come on Washington you saw this coming!"
2020-03-06 21:25,"The real math to this thing is in plain sight.  The estimate is that .5% to 3% of people who get the virus die.  That means in the US where there are 14 known deaths that there are anywhere from about 500 to 2,800 cases in the US.  The 100 number being used is woefully low.  Worldwide there are about 3,200 dead so far.  That means 105,600 to 640,000 cases worldwide.  So the 100,000 estimate is at the low end.  There are many unknowns and a lot of spin.  Pay attention to the number of those who have died and then do the math."
2020-03-06 21:31,"Wearing masks is important especially when some carriers could be asymptomatic.   A home sewn cotton mask (or even origami mask) would help cut down on the virus transmitting through the public.  I watching youtube videos and there are so many tutorials out there.  Keep in mind that wearing home made masks will not protect us from getting the virus, but at least it can mitigate one of its primary transmission route somewhat."
2020-03-06 21:33,"I think we should consider alternatives to PCR based testing for COVID-19. Non contrast chest CT has been shown to be more sensitive than PCR testing, is already widely available, has been used extensively in theWuhan out break, provides instant results.
As we wait for test kits to be distributed, let’s learn some of the lessons from Asia."

2020-03-06 21:38,"Here's one prediction I have about the virus. We just had Super Tuesday where millions of voters jostled together and stood in lines sometimes for hours. If the virus is such a national calamity I would expect to see a vast increase in infections due to all those people in close contact. If not, maybe we should relax a bit and apply those common-sense protections. And our highest priority should be protecting our elderly, infirm citizens, friends and relatives."
2020-03-06 21:45,"How different are the corona virus test kits from other viral test kits that they are in such short supply ?  I can understand laboratory protocols for PCR testing would be unique for COVID 19, but the test kits for collecting samples shouldn't be so different from other viral test kits for swab samples."
2020-03-06 21:45,"Let's do the numbers again.

New York City has enough test kits for around a thousand people. New York City resident population = 8.4 million. The commuter population adds between 1.5 to 3 million people. Let's call it a cool 10 million on any given day.

You'll probably need a scientific calculator at this point.

1,000 ÷ 10,000,000 = 0.01 percent. New York City has the ability to test 0.01% of the population. That sounds about right. My state scored 0.013% not including non-resident travelers. Yep. We're in trouble."
2020-03-06 21:50,"It is inevitable that the Covid 19 will be seen in the United States.  There will be many undiagnosed cases regardless how prepared we may be.  We should take precautions and do our best to limit the spread.   The press is not helping the situation. I hate to say it but the press is creating hysteria.  Store shelves are bare of many items.
The use of reusable grocery bags is not going to help limit the spread of the virus.  New York State and all other states that have banned disposable plastic grocery bags should immediately reverse that decision.  People should not be bringing bags which cannot be sterilized into grocery stores, placing them on check out counters or carrying them in public spaces.  They are only go to help spread germs.  The use of hand dryers in bath rooms also needs to be discouraged.  There is ample evidence that these devices spread germs.  Disposable paper towels should be the standard.   We cannot sacrifice people's health for the environment."

2020-03-06 21:46,"We now have somewhat more data on the real fatality rate. Of all the countries which have had a coronavirus outbreak, South Korea has had the most robust large-scale testing completed. The fatality rate estimate in South Korea is 0.64%. The overall fatality rate reported by the WHO (3.4%) is grossly overstating the real fatality rate as it includes cases tested during January in China, when testing was limited and only for those with strong obvious symptoms.

The first paragraph beneath that should have noted comments from CDC and NIH officials that they expect the numbers to ""explode"" once testing becomes more widespread.  

In an interview yesterday, an NIH infectious diseases expert stated that he believes the death rate is much lower than the 3.4% being reported because there are many more total cases that are being unreported.  He opined that the true death rate could be as low at .1%.  What he did not point out is that if that untested hypothesis is true, then given the number of confirmed deaths in the USA already then the total number of cases is at least ten times higher than the official count.  His entire argument did nothing to downplay how many people will die from CoVid-19.  Instead, he only said that many more people will get it and not die."

I eat less and am getting my body ready for a time in case their are food shortages , I was eating too much anyway.
I picked up the Bible for the first time in years , I thank god every day for the years I have had .
I try to limit my contact with people, I use my credit card to gas up. When I touch the hose handle I use a glove or ziplock bag, 

I conserve everything , I discard nothing unless it had food on it, I use one Clorox wipe over and over , conserving it in a ziplock bag.
I only use gloves when I am touching something really bad, I have learned to use ziplock bags rather than gloves in most things.
I wear a mask when I go out among people and goggles that are snug to my face .
I use Amazon for most of my shopping, why go to a store when Amazon can deliver it. When the Amazon person comes to the door I tell him to leave the box near the door and open it when they leave.
If I order take out , I pay by credit card , even the tip, I tell them to bring it in a paper bag and leave it by the door. Before I eat , I reheat the food just in case.

I try to stay off the internet many people will try to frighten you, I go to the WHO webpage or the CDC, they will know much more than some fear mongers on the internet. 

I don’t read the comments in the Times anymore, unless it is truly helpful. How do I know someone who says they are a nurse is really a nurse and not someone trying to spread fear.

I turn off the news at a certain hour and watch my favorite shows, especially comedies, laughter is the best medicine , and negativity is bad for the heart 

At age 55 I am right at the bottom of the spectrum of people in most danger , so I am improving my odds by getting as healthy as I can 

I have trained my mind to not concentrate on the worse that can happen, and concentrate on the best that can happen.

I live in the moment and do not let my thoughts rush ahead 

YouTube is an invaluable  tool, I learned how to make my own face mask . 

I am getting into meditating 

I am losing weight and I find my knees no longer hurt 

My favorite show is Ken Burns The Roosevelt’s, I watch it over and over. It inspires me . 

I believe there are great scientists in the world and one will have a breakthrough , until then I will do my best to keep Corona out of my body I have learned from every cold I have ever had, where I got them, how I got them.

2020-03-06 21:19,"Quit politicizing this.  Do you really think things would be hunky dory if saint Obama was still president?  The only real complaint might be the lag in getting the test kits out, but do you really think we'd have fewer cases and fewer deaths if Obama was still in office, or HRC?  The reality is that many people had arrived in the US who had coronavirus before we had any idea that we might be confronting an epidemic, and they then exposed others who exposed others.

Most on the left seem to be using this as an opportunity to bash Trump, maybe win the election -- but the reality is Trump has done what needs to be done.  He's put together a team of experts, they are updating the public on a regular basis while pushing testing kits and the search for a vaccine.  Congress has passed an emergency spending bill to help fight Corona and Trump will certainly sign the bill.  It's premature to shut done travel or to quarantine the country IMO so I'm not sure what else you want Trump to do.  We don't know the transmission or mortality rates.  We believe, probably accurately and agrees with what with what happens with flu and other viruses, that mortality rates are likely higher for those with pre-existing health conditions, particularly the elderly.  So those at highest risk should be particularly careful about washing their hands and keeping social contacts to a minimum.     

And Trump is almost certainly correct that the 3.4% mortality rate is way too high."

NYC is reported to be capable of testing 100-200 people/day.  We can't even test the people we KNOW need to be tested in NYC, not to mention all those other unknown cases out there.  This is a profound failure of our health system.  It is inevitable that widespread closing of public gatherings will be needed in NYC.  Yet, no one is coming out and saying it.  They continue to downplay.  Be honest with the people so that they might prepare rather than panic later.  For shame all around."
2020-03-06 21:15,The pattern of the virus spread and the number of cases (likely under-reported) is starting to resemble that of the early days in China. Looks like we are just getting started here.
2020-03-06 21:20,"Many of the these 250 victims of the coronavirus will be mild cases.  With the proper care and quarantine precautions they should recover fully.

2020-03-06 20:48,"I've kind of informally created a rule of zeros with this administration. If circumstances are bad for Trump, then add two zeros to the numbers they are claiming. If it's good for trump, take off three zeros to the numbers they are claiming. You'll arrive at a plausible answer to whatever is in question."
2020-03-06 21:46,"The CDC said over a week ago that they would start doing surveillance testing, which is when the samples of people with the coronavirus symptoms would be checked even if they hadn’t had a known contact or travel flag.   This type of study helps to show how/whether there is general spread of the virus.   Since then, they have basically fallen silent (silenced, no doubt, by Pence).   No study results have been released.  Their last media telebriefing was on March 3rd.  We are being kept in the dark and sick people aren’t being tested."
2020-03-06 22:08,"It's beginning to look like near-ubiquitous infection is the most likely scenario as the year unfolds.

There's lot of talk about a vaccine. Does anyone know of any coronavirus disease for which there is a working deployed vaccine (SARS, MERS...)? 

There is a further concern about the immunity that surviving an infection produces. How is this for other coronaviruses? Hopefully it's not like Norovirus which we get over and over again.

Here is my point: the biggest factor in how bad the situation will get is whether the healthcare system is overwhelmed. With the right care (starting with simple oxygen and going up to artificial oxygenation) the death rate is way down compared to warehousing the sick in makeshift ""hospitals"".

So maybe it's time to mandate flu vaccination. It won't reduce the number of COVID-19 cases, but maybe there will be chance of finding a ventilator with 60% fewer flu cases."

Invoke Article 25; let men in white coats drag Trump out of the Oval Office; fire Pence, Kudlow, KellyAnn Conway and other spinmasters; appoint a president who actually knows what he's doing and surround him with medical professionals who know what they're doing. And get rid of Trump's Senate enablers. How many more people must die before the incompetence of this pathetic reality show president actually convinces them that he is a clear and present danger? The Taliban violated his ""no violence"" agreement in Afghanistan before the ink was barely dry. Iran now has enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb because he tore up Obama's nuclear accord. Kim Jong-un continues to make nukes despite all the love letters he has sent to Trump. And we now have a pandemic because Trump's ego won't let him admit he's out of his depth."

Annual deaths from the flu in the US 8-10,000. Hospitalization this year in the US from the common flu: 142,000. Deaths so far from the common flu in the US this year: 8.200.
I hate to sound like I might agree with Trump on anything, and while I agree it is overplayed, it is certainly not aimed at him.

You SHOULD have been anticipating the crisis like most of the rest of the world.

As testing ramps up, watch the ""total"" shoot up. They were there all the time, spreading the pandemic as no one watched. Kudos to the CDC for doing their best, but after 3+ years of being ignored by The Idiot Dotard, even the best minds can't work miracles.

As we ALL know, Trump is REactive and in the moment - he has no idea how to plan and takes no competent advice. Hannity, Carlson and Ingraham (not to mention Graham and the rest of his cult) are partisan political fools and even worse than he is.

Accordingly, we have what I can only describe as DEFCON 2 heading for DEFCON 1 in the sense that American is under a biological attack (and yes pandemics not involving Soviet era genetically engineered pathogens are still ""biological attacks"" as well as a natural disaster requiring Pentagon war gaming and a coordinated federal, state and local response to prevent harm to the US Homeland and the degradation of US military preparedness). 

Due to Trump's utter and total unfitness for the office he holds and his gross incompetence magnified exponentially by  that of his administration (the ""D"" and ""F"" teams) of grifters and partisan hacks, the USA in the midst of a ""biological attack"" is politically decapitated and we have no effective  federal government leadership, preparations, pandemic preparedness, public action plans or coordinated responses to adequately defend the US Homeland and save American lives from a pandemic threat.   We have grossly insufficient resources in every category.  This is much worse than December 7 1941, when we at least had great SIGINT but no intelligence Infrastructure."

2020-03-06 21:59,Weren't we just told yesterday there are enough tests for everyone to have one?
2020-03-06 21:23,Let’s not forget that this abject failure of adequate planning and management has happened on Trump’s watch.  He should be shouldering the primary blame as Commander in Chief.  I give his management and leadership a straight F so far.  He has a lot of work to do to get to an E grade.

2020-03-06 22:38,"I wonder how many kits are in the White House and Capitol    
Another way for trump to punish New York is to deprive us of kits    Would not put it past him"
2020-03-06 22:48,"Where are those ""one million"" test kits that Pence promised? California has only 5,000 test kits available, with more than that number on the watchlist, and 60+ confirmed cases. The administration response has been abysmal."
2020-03-06 22:51,"The NYT wrote a wonderful piece about the ability of tech companies to follow people everywhere through their cell phones. It pointed out that this data was being  collected and saved. It was a clear example of how technology is making privacy difficult in the era of the ubiquitous smartphone. 

And the CDC, or any medical authority, when they test for Covid-19, they presumably ask folks “where have you been?”

In the USA I don’t imagine asking people for their cellphone id, correlating that info for the last 14 days and publishing that info to really understand where contagious folks have been would go over too well. 

But China doesn’t seem to care about individual freedoms in quite the same way. Perhaps they are already doing this.

Regardless, their should be a good cache of historical info to learn from.  And this is not the only pandemic our rapacious species is likely to have, so learning is our main hope to understand how to spread novel viral  diseases."
2020-03-06 22:53,"Didn’t the government sequester the protective masks?  Isn’t there a 3M factory in South Dakota that’s supposed to be manufacturing 24/7?  Why not give a set amount to everyone as a means to help protect even if it is limited, it has to be of some help."
2020-03-06 22:57,"Everyone is concerned that not enough testing is available. They are focused on the accuracy of the death rate percentage. That entirely misses the point. The bottom line is that whatever the mortality rate is, the same number of people will die. Widespread testing of minimally symptomatic people is basically an epidemiologically tool. It helps find out where the cases are and factors related to how it spread. As the pandemic unfolds, the number of minimally infected people is not really what is important to know. It is how many ventilators will we need? How many hospital respiratory isolation beds will we need? How many special respiratory critical care units will need to be started up? How will primary care be delivered when the patient encounter becomes a high risk event for the provider?

And where are the expert individuals who are looking at these questions in an impartial environment and guiding us through this disaster and looking out for our health?"
2020-03-06 23:07,"Pence-nocchio has learned well from his boss. His press conference consisted of spewing all kinds of numbers about Coronavirus testing, none of which were reassuring. Both he and Dr. Hahn of the CDC referred to the swab test kits as the actual tests. But the testing is done remotely at a collection of labs. Apparently, also according to Pence, this crisis is all about cruise ships and the vast majority of people in the US have nothing to worry about."
2020-03-06 23:11,"It's a good thing we in America pay twice what the rest of the world pays so we can be covered by our beloved private health insurers rather than the government. Imagine the waits for tests and the rationing that would be going on if we had government-funded care! And the $3,000 charge is so low, we can be sure everyone will be tested (if the kits ever show up) and the pandemic controlled."
2020-03-06 23:12,"We have case here in Nebraska now, not the people quarantined from the cruise ship. 
Lady that came back to Omaha from the UK. Apparently had respiratory symptoms for 12 days and finally decided to go the doctor, and tested positive for coronavirus."
2020-03-06 23:21,It’s surprising that companies in the US don’t know how to manufacture protective clothing and masks. It doesn’t seem that high tech to me.
2020-03-06 23:23,"We have 50 State health departments 100's more local health departments,  a 1,000 private labs, 100's of hospital labs, 1,000 more college and university labs, plus the pharmaceutical labs. Only the CDC test kits are allowed. this is exactly how not to respond to a pandemic, central Federal control. The CDC should release the test protocols to all qualified labs immediately. Where necessary Governors can commandeer  lab capacity.  instruct Chemistry and Medical students in how to perform the test and get moving."
2020-03-06 23:30,"In the US the number of cases has also doubled in three days, as in Europe. The previous doubling in case number in the US took four days.   This is what exponential growth looks like."
2020-03-06 23:40,"Think the virus is not in New Mexico? How would we know? So far only 10 people have been tested in New Mexico according to the NM Health Department website and the test guidelines are still if you traveled to one of the affected areas abroad and are showing symptoms that have already been tested to rule out flu. 

We have a lot of tourists coming to New Mexico to visit Taos or Santa Fe from different countries and parts of the US. We also have many older retirees here. Why have so few people been tested? Couldn't have anything to do with not wanting to affect tourism can it? I see no effort by the federal or state officials to get accurate answers about who is actually infected. They conveniently keep forgetting to mention that people can be asymptomatic and spread the disease.

In the meantime, we walk around not knowing if the coughing person in the line at the super market has the virus. And all this talk that the death rate is lower than what the WHO said (3.5%)--until they have actual data in the US from millions of tests to back it up, they should shut their mouths and start testing as many people as possible. A little transparency would help calm fears."
2020-03-06 23:43,"Sitting near if not in a COVID 19 epicenter, I would like to hear about all the thousands of people who have had the virus and are doing just fine. How about a balanced perspective. Influenza is still way ahead in terms of people affected and lives lost."
2020-03-06 23:44,"I wonder if Trump is thinking after rolling out $8.9 billion in emergency aid and testing kits, "" Maybe Obamacare is not a bad idea after all?""  Doubt it ,but the fact if the Trump Administration has the gall to continue its push for repeal after we get passed this crisis will certainly and hopefully wake up our Nation as to how even more important healthcare for all in this Nation will be if crisis like this becomes the norm ."

2020-03-06 23:19,"Yes, but *why* can't New York create it's own test kits? Why is it reliant on the obviously stalling CDC?"
2020-03-06 23:45,"""On the East Coast, a cluster has emerged in New York State. All but a few of its 33 confirmed cases as of Friday were liked to a New Rochelle man.""

I hope people realize that the reason this cluster has emerged and that most positive cases are linked to this cluster in New Rochelle, is because, well, those are the lucky select few that have been tested.

I wonder how many such ""clusters"" are in New York...and at what point it will seem as if all those ""clusters"" confusingly start to blend into one another, almost seamlessly, as if the virus were widespread already."
2020-03-06 23:14,"If this doesn’t wake people in this country up to the need to have universal healthcare then I’m not sure what will. Our society is a ticking time bomb. Millions of Americans will avoid care due to not being able to afford testing or costs associated with health care. Millions more will be unable to take time off from work and get even more people sick. It’s moments like these where all the structural issues and decay in society and our institutions reached a breaking point. 

This is why we need fundamental reform in this country. From the healthcare system, to our work policies and culture, to our education system and the ignorance and propaganda being spread by right-wing media in this moment, we will all be doomed in the end unless we take a major look at the state of this country and start demanding more. The status quo is broken. Our nation is a house of cards and many people will suffer if we do not change things."
2020-03-06 23:56,"We’ve all known for weeks that the virus is spreading undetected yet testing was still restricted. It’s unacceptable for a nation with this amount of resources to be unable to provide enough tests for anyone who requests one and disrespectful to vulnerable populations. The CDC, despite the funding cut, should have been able to get this worked out. I certainly hope there’s no political manipulation (i.e. bungle the testing and blame Trump) going on when lives are at risk."
2020-03-07 0:00,"Just a note to everyone:

CDC is not responsible for certifying labs to conduct coronavirus tests.  That is the FDA's job.

Neither of which is able to do its job in this ""smaller government utopia"" we've gotten ourselves into."
2020-03-06 22:48,"I just saw a video of a Trump supporter who denies the existence of COVID-19 because it is a ""Democratic hoax"".  Words have consequences that can be magnified 1000 fold when the lies come from the President.  If his response to a true global health emergency doesn't awaken the country to the menace he is to all we value, we are in even worse trouble than I could have imagined not long ago."
2020-03-06 23:06,"What is the federal government doing to stop the spread of this virus?  Trump downplays the dangers and tells us it’s under control when it clearly isn’t.  We’re going to see the number of cases double daily as they have in Europe and Iran and Trump will not come out and advise Americans on best practices for stopping its spread.  It will be local governments, schools, community-minded individuals, and ethically run news organizations who will stop the spread if anyone does.  Elections matter!"
2020-03-06 23:39,"It's widespread.  Containment is over.
You will probably get infected.
Take solace in the fact that it will be mild for most.
Many more will die.

It's almost as if we don't have any leadership, international standing, ability to coordinate, scientific trust, or community empathy.  

Oh, wait."
2020-03-06 23:54,"I just watched the Coronavirus Task Force news conference. Talk about non-transparency. First of all, why did they only test 46 people on the cruise ship docked off San Francisco? My guess is once they found out that 21 out of 46 tested positive, they stopped testing because that’s a 46% positive rate and with 3,500 people on the ship that would equate to 1,610 people. Those numbers are too high for Trump’s PR campaign, his reelection, and the stock market. And we all know those are the only three things that matter to him. Jim Acosta asked twice if any American went to his doctor over the weekend and wanted to get the test done, would they be able to get it done? They evaded his question. Then Pence ended the news conference after 30 minutes or so and yet reporters still had a lot of questions. I guess there are more important things taking place than getting the information out to the public. And how many times do we have to listen to people on the task force thank Trump for his incredible leadership on this matter? Yet, according to FOX, Trump is a strong leader on the coronavirus situation, even though he has told many lies about what’s really going on and delayed ramping up the manufacturing of test kits (because he doesn’t want high positive test results?). It is hard for me to believe how many people in our country are drinking the Kool-Aid."
2020-03-06 23:30,"21 tested positive ... OUT OF 46 people tested.

That is over 45%.  

The headline should be:

2020-03-06 23:43,Simple. The US (the Wall) and Europe ($6 Billion aid package to Turkey) are more interested developing intricate plans to keep out non-white people than people who carry highly infectious viruses.
2020-03-07 0:02,"If you go on Fox News, on line or TV, information about the virus is literally buried and a mere footnote. Shame on them for not doing the right thing and giving their viewers up to date information. Fox News aka Trump news is nothing more than a state run media outlet."
2020-03-06 23:50,"Not surprisingly the administration manages the news of this, so that it didn’t come out till way after the markets closed.  When yesterday we’d been told they would know the results “in the morning.”

Par for the course."

2020-03-06 23:20,"The Princess Complex Strikes Again. Currently, what is happening is pure Western arrogance, when we saw a viral outbreak we started pointing fingers at what people ate, how people ran their government, whether we could ""trust their numbers"", etc. instead of preparing.

Even in this article, the Chinese anti-virus approach to quarantine was called ""draconian"", while the Russian, called ""precautionary"" and ""successful"". Italy's incompetent and fatal error of releasing a positive patient into the public is not discussed. The US's ""quarantine"" that allows positive patients to go out in public is not questioned, labeled, or even mentioned.

This article never even mentions the lies told by our own government, the silencing of scientists, the trivialization of the virus' impact, the misuse of statistics in reporting, the fact that Iranians are dying in part due to a lack of medicine prohibited by increased sanctions, etc.

In a nation that focuses more on viral videos than how to stop viral infections, there is no battle to end this coronavirus in the USA - perhaps the Airline lobby's political contributions afford them the right to sway proper health guidance. The only concern is this fetish of proving we are true individuals who cannot be chained, but in these situations, only two things matter, life and death, who is keeping people alive and who isn't. Let's focus on the former."
2020-03-06 23:44,"Still waiting: Who in the Trump administration made the decision to refuse the WHO Corona virus test used by the rest of the world? And who refused again when it became clear that the CDC test was seriously flawed?

Ask Mike Pence!"
2020-03-06 22:55,"It is very beautiful to behold.

The Reverend Mike Pence in front of TV cameras fielding questions as to why the number of infected cases is going up, the lack of test kits, the disconnect between Trump’s “we’ll have a vaccine in 3 weeks at the latest” versus the CDC’s “it will take about a year for a vaccine, and that’s a very positive projection.”

Pence is wincing in every answer, basically mouthing to his god to deliver him from this evil.

So very beautiful to behold.

Pence will not be surviving this COVID-19 tragedy.

And the best part? 

He cannot answer back to Trump for setting him up for a very spectacular failure.

Beautiful!"
2020-03-06 23:21,Has Trump had to cancel his “rallies” yet? That’s the moment I’m waiting for. He says “go to work” if you feel sick. Ok. Let’s see how that turns out with his over-50s crowds.
2020-03-06 22:22,What is Trump's administration doing to get more testing kits out faster? Surely the Great Businessman and his Czar could do better than this!
2020-03-06 23:25,"I very much enjoyed Herr Trump's remarks concerning his hunch that the actual mortality rate for a virus we are unprepared and unable to test for is not 3.9% but well under 1.0% for all infected cases.   

How reassuring to hear from the CIC and POTUS that the civilian/military death toll from this ""biological attack"" will ONLY be in the range of 780,000 deaths if 0.04 is the case mortality rate  or perhaps 1,950,000 deaths if the case mortality rate is 0.01   assuming a conservative 60% infection rate for 325 million Americans.

Had POTUS actually prepared the US to test for COVID 19 he might be able to prove that his hunches are correct,  but POTUS burned the clock since DEC 19 and accordingly the US critically lacks test kits for COVID 19 and accordingly deaths from COVID 19 may not be accurately tracked and reported.   

Within Wuhan and environs, the reported case mortality rate has been reported as 3.4 and 3.9 percent, which if accurate, would convert to between 6,630,000 million and 7,605,000 deaths from 200,000,000 million infections (assuming an infection rate of just 60% among 324,000,000 Americans.

And yet our POTUS and CIC verbalizes how 780,000 or 1,950,000 deaths would not be so bad?    

There really is nothing like a self-inflicted political decapitation strike before a biological attack on the US Homeland.   I pray that America will take heed of Trump's dereliction of duty to defend and protect the US Homeland."
2020-03-06 23:44,Just like the cruise ship a few weeks ago in Japan.  It is essentially a hermetically sealed tube complete with a uncontrolled covid-19 dispersion system.  Appallingly unconscionable keeping healthy people in an environment where catching the illness is almost a certainty.

Trump doesn't want America to know how many Americans are infected with the coronavirus.

That's why there is a shortage of tests available.

Hey Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer.

How about diverting some of the millions you were going to spend on defeating Trump to purchasing and donating coronavirus testing kits.  It would be a good deed and it might actually help expose Trump's incompetence in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.

America needs to know immediately how widespread the coronavirus is.  Testing kits are the only way to find out.

America needs those testing kits.

The media, Times included isn’t asking a simple question: Why is every American death ( save one) associated with this virus happening in Washington State? Apparently 13 total.
This has nothing to do with testing, Trump  or even funding.
It has everything to do with the woke policies of the Seattle City Council in regards to 12,000 homeless in Seattle violating every norm regarding sanitation and common sense.
That council has created a Public Health catastrophe in the name of political correctness."

From my vantage point he is failing miserably and again living in his own self made distorted reality. Good grief!"

There was a lot of food at all hours but quantity does not always mean quality.  After the coronavirus outbreak, I would not ever get back on a large ship again.  I do feel sorry for the cruise lines because I think they will lose a lot of money.  People will think twice about going on a cruise for a long time to come.

I did go on a Christmas markets river cruise about 10 years ago and loved it.  There were a fraction of the people on board that you found on a humongous cruise ship.  The food was delicious and the other travelers were lovely.  I had a great time and would not hesitate going again once this coronavirus virus is behind us.

The coronavirus along with other viruses is a long term problem and if it levels off during the spring and fades in the summer it does not necessarily mean that it is gone.

--Now like all great dangers, it would be natural for people to be aware of such a problem. It would be natural to want to evaluate the problem and figure out how to best deal with the threat... to survive it. People will naturally look at history to learn how to deal with what is happening now and in this case, people have a period of history to learn from... the Spanish Flu.

--This problem, being global, naturally needs a government's authority and resources to deal with it. It should be brought to light that the government for varying reasons like the Spanish flu was poorly dealt with because the government wanted to hide the effects during war while Trump's government doesn't want the people to know the effects of this virus because they don't want it to effect the ""economy"" because Trump is hanging his hat on it in an attempt to be reelected... that is a war against the American people by as always, Trump is lying to the American people/"

I called my doctor's office on Monday, was told there were no appointments and was sent to the local hospital's lab for a flu test and chest x-ray. 

The flu test was negative, but on Tuesday they entered a diagnosis of ""acute bronchitis"" in my chart. I called back and asked about a coronavirus test, but they said I ""didn't meet the criteria"" and to call back next week if I was still sick.  I just called again because I'm still sick and was told that they ""just got the tests in and haven't been trained on them yet"", so the only way to get one is to be hospitalized.

If I don't meet the criteria, folks, NOBODY is being tested. I have self-isolated the last half of this week, but I was around thousands of people in the two weeks prior. I hope you weren't one of them...."
2020-03-07 1:40,I saw on MSNBC that the reason we have tested so few people in contrast to other countries is because they used kits from the World Health Organization. We rejected their tests and began to make our own.  The first significant batch turned out to be faulty. Now they have to make more. Ain’t isolationism great!

I don’t know if people are over reacting or not . But I firmly believe this shows the mistrust we have for our government, Trump especially. Not enough tests. His constant denials about how serious this is, contrary to the World Health Organization briefings. . Meanwhile the “ updated” CDC figures are never accurate ( they’re always lower than what is reported here and elsewhere). 

I hope this is Trumps undoing. He has blundered along far too long."
2020-03-06 22:19,"The administration’s handling of coronavirus has so far been abysmal. Where are the “one million” test kits that Pence said would be available this week? California, with 60 confirmed coronavirus cases only has a total of 7,000 kits. We are two months into this, and you think the administration would’ve been more ready. You can’t stop what you don’t know         exists."

2020-03-07 0:23,"Pence at the podium and hour or so ago (Friday/1730) indicated that some 50 or so were tested on the cruise ship with nearly one half (1/2) testing positive.

Pence alluded to the small number of being tested.  He gave the false impression, the total ship was tested..it was not..just 50 or so with half testing positive.  The ship has a capacity of several thousand passenger..If the ration holds to the initial test, the more than 1000 people would test positive for the virus...perhaps many more when considering half of the infections were crew..no doubt those who interacted with the passengers.

Bottom line:  The cruise ship is highly infectious with perhaps as many of one half of all passengers infected..as total passengers as 3500 according to the NYTimes reviewed a moment ago.

Pence perhaps wanted to public not to understand the depth of the infection on the cruise ship, as he could of been much more forthcoming.

Like just about all in the Trump inner circle..they rarely tell the truth and march to the deceptive and false assertions of their leader."

""While both the flu and COVID-19 may be transmitted in similar ways (see the Similarities section above), there is also a possible difference: COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near.""

Will some of his supporters finally come to recognize his absolute failure of leadership in the face of a genuine crisis. The lack of preparation of this administration has already caused increased exposure for all, without adequate test kits for confirmation of infection and isolation and treatment of patients. Once again, relying on his gut rather than accepting empirically-validated science, Trump flails around spewing misinformation and dangerous pronouncements. His incompetence is exacerbating this crisis. Is this FINALLY the tipping point for this ill-informed fraud? I know, how many times have we said already this, and yet he persists. How can this circus possibly go on unrecognized?"

Instead, pence spends the first ten minutes praising the coast guard for flying tests to the ship.  With all due respect to our great Coast Guard, that’s their job.  What about the other 2950  stranded crew members and passengers?  This is an outrage.  They still don’t have a place to quarantine and test these stranded people.

That's what this has been from the start for him and his administration.  It's all statistics (number of confirmed cases, % of fatalities, etc.) in an attempt to show everyone what a ""great"" job he is doing and it isn't his fault. The ""..I don't need.."" says it all.

Obviously no one wants it to spread, but many are weaponizing it against Trump.  Oh, he didn't order 330 million test kits, one for each of us including illegals. What an evil man he is."

2020-03-06 23:20,"I remember back maybe 20 years ago and Trump was asked whether he was considering running for president. He said that he was thinking about it in a rather flippant manner. He smiled and sort of walked away as if he was tossing up to buy a real estate block or not. It struck me as odd at the time. It reminds me of his current flippancy about this dire situation.
If you still think that he cares about you or any other American for its own sake rather than how it looks for him, you are seriously deluded. Informed conservatives have left the GOP in droves. After Access Hollywood it should be a badge of honour to be a Never Trumper. He and his grovelling cohorts use the term as some kind of sinister moniker for people who can see through him. There should be T shirts saying Proud Never Trumper after this appalling debacle. It is humiliating for your great nation to have this narcissistic buffoon as leader

Coworker had been in northern Italy three weeks ago and yesterday developed a cough and a fever but was still at work   Sent to the emergency room but COVID19 test was not done.   Instead,  routine flu tests were done.   If they are negative then a COVID19 test is done.    When we asked why not just do the right test and take away any doubt, they said that the test availability is limited.   
We should have had widely available test kits in every clinic and emergency room and doctors office.  Otherwise we don’t really know what’s walking around out there."

Could a combination explain some of the variation in mortality rates?"
2020-03-07 2:16,I understand a lot of people are afraid of the coronavirus so that universities have canceled classes and employers ordered employees to work at home. On the other hand the caucuses of Democratic Party have been held all over the country gathering thousands of supporters. It’s not easy for ordinary people to judge how serious this unseen disease is. Should people cancel all events and meetings which may lead to the spread of the disease? The excessive cancellations would also bring serious damage to society. The balance is really important in such a situation.
2020-03-07 2:29,"So in the interest of saving test kits because the US doesn’t have thousands to spare, they only tested a handful first, before deciding to test the rest.  Leaving anxious passengers who have to wait yet longer...  Given that this illness can be asymptomatic, it makes no sense to drag things out the moment it was known that a passenger had tested positive for the virus ... except for the shortage of kits, which should have been ordered the moment the outbreak was known to go beyond China, at the very least."
2020-03-07 2:29,"In many aspects, Donald Trump is very successful in business.  As such, he should understand that one can not manage, what one will not, or can not measure.   Testing of citizens infected with coronavirus is absolutely essential if there is any possibility of containing the pandemic.

2020-03-07 2:32,"Today we had a video of President Trump saying he wanted the people on the ship to stay there, so the number of infected people wouldn't go up.  He also said, ""They're not our fault."" He can't envision that this is nobody's fault.  So far, it's a welcome relief to have Vice President Pence in charge. He's testing all the people on the ship, despite the President's objections; admitting we don't have enough tests; and he's working well with all the governors.   I am waiting to see if he continues stand up for what is right as the numbers go up, and Trump can only view this in terms of his reelection."

If China not suppressed the emergence of the virus that would have bought even more time to prepare.  Quit ironically the Dr. who was warned about disclosing the new and dangerous virus died from it proving his point.

This is in part the price of globalism and open borders.  Let's continue to lower corporate taxes, and cut regulations so industries, such as drug and antibiotic production can return here.  Corporate taxes are ultimately paid by individuals.  They take money that could grow our 401ks, pay higher salaries, or lower the cost of products.

It's not fair we should have to have those numbers."" It appears the President is trying to hide Covid19 numbers in this outbreak. While still at the CDC he called Governor Inslee of Washington State a snake. In the President's first press conference he called Corona virus a ""Democrat hoax"".  Instead of ensuring America's preparedness during the early weeks of the outbreak in China,  Trump attended 11 rally's! Leaders in science are alarmed that the CDC website has blocked the current number of cases. John's Hopkins is in coordination with each state and reporting the most accurate numbers.

Truly, we are paying a direct price for the failure of our education."
2020-03-07 2:09,"What we are seeing now is the tip of a huge iceberg.

The good news is the death rate is much lower than what appears, because only the most severe cases are detected.

Every year, only 10% get the flu, because of vaccines and herd immunity (immunity due to frequent low level exposure without getting actually sick).
  
The bad news is, neither vaccines nor herd immunity apply to the novel coronavirus, meaning that probably everyone is going to get it, except maybe a few hermits in Alaska. Thus, even if the death rate is the same as flu (0.05%), the total number of deaths could be 10x that of the flu."
2020-03-07 1:33,"Over the course of a single day we hear that 200 cases becomes 300. What if the US actually had an adequate number of test kits?

2020-03-07 1:23,"As a German currently residing in Thailand, it is quite striking how different the various regions react to the crisis: after the Chinese officials' disastrous mishandling in the first weeks, allowing the virus to turn into a pandemic, it was it's draconian measures which brought it under  control outside Wuhan. While effectively sacrificing Wuhan is obviously very problematic and definitely not possible in democratic countries, with the forewarning the world has, such measures should not be necessary. 
Other East Asian countries demonstrate how to react decisively and effectively without obvious breach of basic human rights - particularly Korea demonstrates how an advanced medical system can bring even a massive outbreak under control. Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand showed how the mentioned forewarning can be used to avoid massive outbreaks despite being the countries with the highest numbers of Mainland Chinese visitors in the world.
Comparing the handling of the crisis in Europe, it is depressing how Italy,  Germany, France, Switzerland etc, countries with huge ressources at hand, seem to be completely helpless, despite everything they could have learned from East Asia before the virus reached them in large numbers. And the situation seems to be similar in the US. 
My impression is, officials just did not take the problem serious, assuming their health systems to be so superior to East Asia's that they just will deal with the problem in auto mode. Recipe for desaster!"

Wiping out the affordable health care act and constricting medicare is sure a dumb idea right now.

2020-03-07 0:53,"The Chinese approach worked. The most important thing it accomplished was to buy time. We can't prevent all infections, but we need to stagger them. Covid hits up to 20% hard. What we need to manage is how many are infected at the same time. 20% of 10,000 is 2,000, bad, but manageable. 20% of 100,000 is 20,000 which is unmanageable. We can't let our medical services be overwhelmed. Fine, if we want to add some American flavor, but it is time to take the Chinese approach."
2020-03-07 3:02,"How about this.  Everyone who is at risk of severe complications from the virus isolated at home for four weeks starting now.  Everyone else should immediately get the virus and get over the virus.  That's right, cough on everything and everyone.  You have one week to infect everyone.  In 14 days it will be over. 
Then we clean everything. Once the community is immune,  us high risk folks can come out of hiding and we can all move on.  It one month of knowable, certainty of outcome, pandemic. The fragile will be completely isolated, and not die.  Everyone else will now be immune.  The stock market can cool it's heels, everyone can calm down.  And I won't have to spend the next six months to a year hiding out in a bunker with my existing respiratory illness and fragile heart.  This plan rest on our certainty that only people over fifty with preexisting health conditions are at any risk of dieing.  That twenty percent of the population that might die of this virus can more easily be isolated than our current attempt to isolate everyone from the virus.  
One last point.  For this to work, at risk population need to be honest about their health.  Those of us who aren't health must stay home thru the infection/healing process.  No cheating!  Are you a male over fifty with heart disease and currently have high blood pressure.  You will have to admit this and stay in hiding.  Can we do it?  I'm willing to try."

Plus those extra 450 people would surely rather stay well and not risk death.  The authorities should get the passengers off of the ship and into a land-based quarantine immediately.

2020-03-07 1:48,"The uninformed are busy with the hysterical comments--so some facts: 

CDC estimates that influenza was associated with more than 35.5 million illnesses, more than 16.5 million medical visits, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths during the 2018–2019 influenza season. 

The press has no data that this flu will have a higher mortality rate."
2020-03-07 3:23,"I know an older person with all the symptoms, prolonged contact with someone from Seattle area, and a recommendation from an infectious disease doctor that they be tested. Public Health representatives here in Indiana say no--they do not have enough test kits and the case does not meet the overly stringent CDC guidelines to warrant a test. They are self-quarantined but denied testing. Pence's statement is false and I would say politically motivated to keep the number of cases low.
The virus itself cares little whether we acknowledge it or not; however, we can now look at countries where testing is extensive, information is open and public, and the populace conforms to government public health suggestions. And, we can compare the rate of increase of cases in those countries with that of others where information is not gathered or hidden from and/or not shared with the public and the government gives contradictory policy recommendations or even outright denials. 
The US leadership has placed us firmly in the latter group, despite having the scientific and public health capabilities to contain this."
2020-03-07 2:13,"The estimates of the cumulative burden of seasonal influenza are subject to several limitations.

First, the cumulative rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations reported during the season may be an under-estimate of the rate at the end of the season because of identification and reporting delays.

Second, rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were adjusted for the frequency of influenza testing and the sensitivity of influenza diagnostic assays. However, data on testing practices during the 2019-2020 season are not available in real-time. CDC used data on testing practices from the past influenza seasons as a proxy. Burden estimates will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available.

Third, estimates of influenza-associated illness and medical visits are based on data from prior seasons, which may not be accurate if the seriousness of illness or patterns of care-seeking have changed.

It's hard, I did have to get groceries, I went with a mask.  I have not traveled to any outbreak areas, but I'm playing it safe.

I called her doctor’s office, but still no mention of testing her. Now I am feeling sick. We live in a tourist town that has people flying in from all over the world everyday.

Given that this is a national emergency that could potentially affect anyone, it seems rather inhumane and cold hearted to quarantine potential carriers and then invoice them. Quarantine would potentially save hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

Also, given the incredible tax breaks incorporated into the recent tax laws, it is hypocritical for the government to give tax breaks to the wealthy and then penalize everyone else affected by the virus because it can't afford it. Total hogwash!"

2020-03-07 4:24,"There are many, many more people than the 300 cases currently admitted to be infected by the coronavirus in the United States.

We lack the capability to come anywhere near to accurately tracking the spread of the coronavirus.

We need many times the number of testing kits that exists to even get close to knowing how many people are currently infected and contagious.

When the bodies start piling up at a rate that cannot be explained away, then we will begin to have a better idea of what we're really dealing with.

That's most likely going to take about a month before it cannot be hidden or explained away.

2020-03-07 5:11,"I just looked at the CDC website which lists the number of coronavirus cases in the USA at 164, almost one half fewer than the numbers reported elsewhere.  This is so far behind the number of actual cases that I think they may be being muzzled.  I rely on sites like worldometer.com for my information.  Their stats are quite a bit more scary, but I would rather know what's happening."
2020-03-07 5:03,"I am stunned that there isn't enough media attention paid to the lessons learned in Korea, which has been dealing with this for weeks.
1) Some numbers first: as of Mar 6, ~178,000 tests have been performed, with ~13,000 tests today.  6,767 positive cases, 45 deaths, for the fatality rate 0.66%. (Estimates for flu: ~0.1%). The rate could increase, as many are recently diagnosed, but it could also decrease if the situation is handled better. The NEJM paper last week about Wuhan cases found 1.4% fatality. In Diamond Princess, >705 tested positive out of 3711; 6 died (.85%)--all >70 yrs old.
2) The highest risk factor is age and existing medical conditions. The elderly and those with other conditions, e.g., COPD, must be hospitalized first. In the early days, this triage was not done properly and the medical system was overloaded, making it difficult to treat the high risk group. The hospitals must triage properly, given that the testing kits/hospital beds are lacking.
3) Masks are in short supply. The government has created rules to  distribute the limited number of masks equitably (starting next week, each person can buy two per week). Intervention is needed to ensure that the high risk group gets adequate supply.
4) Much more to write, but there is a word limit!
Personally, I wouldn't go to a hospital to get tested since I'm not in the high risk group--that's where one is most likely to get infected!"

But right now, it doesn’t feel prudent to be working hands on, face to face with up to 100 members of the general public for several hours. I’ve been told we’ll continue programs and field trips until the government says stop. Seriously, should I— making 40k a year— have to put my body on the line so the public experiences no disruption in our schedule?

2020-03-07 4:20,The Grand Princess had 46 tests with 21 positive for Corona Virus. 3500 people on board and we are told they all will be tested. What wasn't made terribly clear was that this cruise with the positive cases and one who has died were on the first part of this same cruise. They departed Feb. 11 from San Francisco to Mexico. Then they returned to San Francisco 10 days later and 2500 passengers got off! Then the ship went on to Hawaii that same day Feb 22 for a 15 day cruise. 62 passengers and crew stayed on the ship from the earlier cruise to Mexico. On return at the end of this trip it was held off the coast of San Francisco before it could continue to Ensenada. The death of the passenger and the sick passengers who have tested positive were from the earlier trip 3 weeks ago to Mexico. Now there are positive cases in Hawaii! No surprise there. The fact that 2500 people from the earlier trip are dispersed now for weeks is concerning. This would make sense why Governor California declared a state of emergency.

California has become nothing more than a facade, once you step off the beaten path, it is a very scary place. Add to that, it is poorly managed state by every metric. For over a decade, CA has been examining and planning 11 new reservoir sites, but either the local officials or residents don't want them projects to begin. 

On any given year, the city of Los Angeles has half a billion dollars in pending law suits. The costs of the state prison system, the pension liabilities, capital flight, mass exodus, the exorbitant rents, commuting at $500-$700/mo on gasoline, and the problem of the homeless. You would think that with all of those issues, plus the risks of wildfires and earthquakes, the state of California would pull itself together and take on the Coronavirus with every ounce of energy and preparation. But no, that is too logical.

I really want to feel sympathy for CA, but it's as if the state leadership is addicted to incompetence. When I first visited Los Angeles, I took the metro into downtown. As I waited for a coffee from a street vendor, I watched a homeless man and his friend getting drunk on mouthwash. I was flabbergasted then, but my cycling trip finally explained why two humans had sunk so low and the city around them went on as if nothing was wrong."

First, I will get a test tomorrow because it is available even though it isn't. Second, because I'm over 60, I'll stay close to home  even though I've been told there is nothing to worry about to travel throughout the United States. I'll head to the office even though there won't be anyone there. I won't worry about being infected even though hundreds of new cases are reported daily.

2020-03-07 3:39,"There's one point regarding the wearing of masks that is very confusing/ambiguous...

I've heard it repeatedly said that 'unless you yourself are sick, you should Not wear a mask... wearing a mask really won't prevent you from catching the virus...a mask is only effective when a sick person wears it, to prevent them from spreading their illness to others...'  

But...what about instances where people around me may in fact have the illness, but not yet have symptoms?  Or what if I myself have the illness, yet no symptoms yet?  For that reason, shouldn't 'everyone' wear a mask, just in case?  I mean, does wearing a mask hurt in any way?

Also, I just saw somewhere else in the NYT, another related story talking about people who've been quarantined.  And in that story it said 'if someone in your home has the virus, then everyone else in the home should wear a mask'.  So that seems to refute my first paragraph.

Me, I'd rather err on the side of caution and wear a mask, just in case I'm in early stages of the virus (and don't know it yet), or in case others around me are sick (and since a mask certainly can't hurt...)"

Pence might not have to pucker-up much longer; by all reports Trump is getting ready to drop him as running mate in favour of Nikki Haley in hopes of swaying the minority vote. 

Pence also announced plans to disembark the 3500 passengers from the cruise ship off California. Trump said he'd like to keep them all onboard. His rationale is that - until their feet are on dry American soil - they are not part of the official Coronavirus count. Trump may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but even he can grasp the reality that as the COVID count rises, his much bragged-about stock market falls and with it his chances in November.  

Next Trump will demand the FAA refuse landing to any airliner found to have anyone with flu symptoms onboard. If they can't land - Trump would reason - they can't add to his miseries."

Second, having a healthcare system that is incredibly conplex with many payers where each has different rules is a nightmare.  When you have a single payer, you can treat everyone equal which greatly simplies the care.  You also have a central billing dept.  The balkanized system here makes it impossible to enact policies that can be applied everywhere. Plus, you have a large number of people without any insurance. Add to this a large number of people who are poor and have no sick leave and you have a situation where stopping the spead is next to impossible."

Second, anyone who dismisses the panic as unreasonable...it's like you've never heard of exponents.  And hospitals treating covid will have fewer resources for other things too, so there will be knock-on effects. If you're a young, healthy 22 year old maybe you won't have to worry...unless you come down with car accident trauma or cancer or high-risk pregnancy...."
2020-03-07 3:45,"“We will be testing everyone on the ship,” he said. “We will be quarantining as necessary.”

Look, I don't WANT to have to quarantine all of them. But if they test clean on Sunday, given the hibernation of this virus, who knows what it will be like in 7 days.

By comparisons, we rounded up and ""quarantined"" thousands of legitimate US citizens who happened to be of Japanese heritage in 1942. By first hand knowledge, destroyed the antique business of a family in Chicago.

Best as I know, no one got infected or died.

Trump wanted the membership  lists of ALL mosques in the US ... since those 2 million might be such a risk.

People screamed that anyone who had been near the source of Ebola should be quarantined for 30 days, and no Africans should be let in at all."

He insults our intelligence with his disinformation about testing availability and containment of cases while the number is actually rapidly expanding. His concern is not for the patients on the ship off San Francisco, but his desire to not have “the numbers” increase by letting them be evacuated for treatment. Then he boasts of his great scientific expertise. This incompetent man is a toxin, and the body politic needs to expel him from office as quickly as possible if we are to recover our health and sanity. Vote Blue no matter who, up and down the ticket."

Using the 1918 pandemic as a model, it will take about a year for COVID-19 to burn out.

We only have about 94 thousand intensive care beds, so how long will it be before this system becomes overwhelmed? And what are our governments plan for when this happens? What happens to the uninsured? For even those insured, how long will it be before our 'private' insurance companies go bankrupt?

So many questions. It sure would be nice if our Federal system would provide answers, instead of trying to hide under rocks, and let the 'free market' go solve its own problems."

His statements regarding testing, and wanting the cruise ship passengers to stay on the ship to keep the number of cases low is remarkable. It got even worse. I can't describe how amazingly shocking this press coverage at the CDC was. He bragged about his ""perfect"" phone call, he bragged about how smart he is, he called the Governor of Washington State where the epidemic is intense and people are dying, a ""snake"". The remarks were so uncaring and cynical all while amazed professionals stood next to him not knowing what to make of it. You can't make this stuff up."

Perhaps it's just their utter incompetence or as nuts as Trump is, he may very well be doing his best, to keep testing, and therefore the number of cases, as low as possible.
As he said, he didn't want those cruise passengers counted in the overall numbers. Some of his surrogates (Kudlow and Conway) are telling the public the virus is contained.  
How Trump followers can justify their allegiance, is beyond belief."
2020-03-07 3:00,"Maybe the shortage of test kits is not attributable to incompetence. What is the possibility of two sequential screw-ups; the initial kits were defective, and subsequently they become available in extremely limited quantity. Is it possible the CDC is that incompetent?

I have a weakened immune system so when it hits I’m not planning to go much of anywhere sheltering in place with food and water reserves. My worry is my wife who’s work doesn’t have a policy in place yet for sick leave. We are just praying that we will both make it through this spared of contracting it.

The worst part for me is the people with asymptomatic cases that are contagious for 2 weeks and may not even realize they are sick and spreading it. 

If memory serves, we had drive-thru testing during the swine flu and likely will need it again. I mean even South Korea quickly got drive-thru testing together

2020-03-06 23:05,"This is ridiculous. As an engineer and scientist, my position is the test kit thing in the US has been bungled from day one. One the kinks were worked out on the basic design, there is no reason why manufacturers all across the country cannot be churning these things out. Their are many labs and third part pharmacy companies that can make them. CDC and NIH need to get more aggressive and put public pressure on Czar Pence to get off his backside and earn his pay. Trump is beyond Hope since every utterance he makes on this subject is false or stupid. Or are the slow walking the testing so it will continue to show an understated number? Would not surprise me since this is how a Trump rolls. But, still, at the end of the day, other countries can quickly ramp up production and distribution of tests that work and we cannot? Unacceptable!

2020-03-07 3:58,"Newsflash! The Trump administration has figured out a way to contain the number of cases of covid-19: Ensure that there are so few testing kits available that no one will get tested. Voila! Containment accomplished. If you make it impossible to diagnose any cases, according to Trumpian notions of medicine, then there must not be any. The Republican, small-government, no-funding, ""hands off"" approach relies upon people staying at home and taking care of themselves. Don't bother going to a hospital for a test, because they haven't got any kits for you. Just stay home, and don't inflict yourself on anyone else, expecting help. You won't get any. What do you think the U.S. is, a society or something? Trump's best advice: Please go away and die by yourself, out of his sight. You and your illness are both icky -- so many germs!

___The president wore his re-election campaign hat and interrupted the event to ask a Fox News reporter if his town hall on the network had good ratings.
___He attacked CNN.
___He called the governor of Washington state, the epicenter of a major outbreak, a 'snake' and 'not a good governor', and said he disagreed with his own vice president saying nice things about the governor while visiting the state.
___Trump said he has not considered canceling his rallies and is not worried about risks.
___He made false and exaggerated claims about the availability of coronavirus tests, ignoring the reality that his vice president has acknowledged, which is that there is a shortage among US healthcare providers right now.
___He said he would prefer if people on the Grand Princess cruise remained on the ship so that US numbers would not go up.
___He gloated about his 'natural ability' to understand the epidemic.""

2020-03-07 2:00,"Based on John Hopkins website information and if I extrapolated the data learned from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship that was quarantined in Japan, I would speculate that there is currently 401,311 to 1,250,810 people infected with the Covid-19 virus worldwide!

I would also guess that 10,632 people have already died!

The 'Case Fatality Rate' (CFR) for the Diamond Princes was 0.85% and despite being contagious, the people on board were on a floating Petri Dish, ignored quarantine rules/regulations/areas, while confined on ship that wasn't designed for quarantine and taken care of by a crew that had no training or experience dealing with a novel virus.  

Over 700 people became infected giving us a rate of 19%, which is surprisingly low given the situation.  6 people died - all over the age of 70 and who had pre-existing medical conditions.  Again, surprisingly low numbers given the situation!

As a registered Democrat, I am disappointed that so many people want to blame the Feds.  

Folks, the Feds job isn't to save you - that job belongs to you, local, county and state - in that order!

We need to focus on the population that is most vulnerable - Nursing Homes and Hospitals... not schools or planes!

Past epidemics show that the danger was always overestimated by factors of 3 to 10 and this is no different. This virus isn't as dangerous as the media & politicians claim!

We are only surprised that he has not yet blamed Mexican and other immigrants for spreading the virus, at the behest of Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, in order to divert attention from Hunter Biden.   We know he wanted to visit the Centers for Disease Control, but was unfortunately forced to cancel the trip because his bone spurs were acting up."
2020-03-06 15:05,"Right now, my tendency is to believe that the MSM is magnifying this all out of proportion in order to attack Trump.  Sure, the corona virus is real, but we actually have little data to go on other and what there is is heavily weighted by China. 

We don't know how contagious or fatal corona is.  We simply don't have enough data to tell.  Certainly, we don't have enough from the US to judge what the real risk level is in the US.  Certainly we need to be careful, wash our hands, that kind of thing.  And it might be reasonable to not make that trip to China or Iran for now.  But do we really want to ruin our  economy, see the stock market go down in flames.  Does it make sense for us for example, to close grocery stores and starve people so they won't catch what might in all likelihood be something like a cold?  Of course not.  Does it make sense to close schools?  Not based on the data we have at present -- and what we do have suggests that people under 50 have little risk of having a serious case of the disease.  

Sure, let's get the test kits out there and find a vaccine ASAP.  But let's not blow ourselves up in a panic.

There have been provisions made for mass graves, including Hyde Park in London to be turned into a giant mortuary. I really wish USA would wake up!

He said in a positive, encouraging way that downplayed the situation that most people were getting better by “hanging around, you know, and even going to work.”  He thus essentially gave the green light to those who don’t understand or take seriously how contagious this is.  Trump dismantled and defunded the agencies and teams that Obama had proactively set up to coordinate responses to and contain future pandemics. And now the face of the government response is Mike Pence who is an avowed science denier.

My own mother was devoted to this soap, and I personally knew a few of these women who, to put it mildly, were fanatically good hospital floor cleaners,

I believe this soap is still commercially available, but I greatly regret to say that these good women are no longer with us.

I made a personal vow to myself a long time ago to stay out of hospitals unless and until some adequate substitute can be found for these women, and it again becomes safe to eat off of hospital floors, which currently and for the last 30 years it has not been.

2020-03-07 1:08,"I want to share a few thoughts on Coronavirus.  I am a physician.  What nobody in the media is discussing is the fact that Coronavirus may be nothing more than a bad cold in many, many people.  Recently, I was sick for a few days.  I had a low fever and a dry cough.  Then I got better.  Maybe this was Coronavirus?  Maybe this is all Coronavirus does to a lot of people?  Yes, SOME people will get very sick, bit this is no different than a bad flu season.  The hype is crazy.  My advice.....go about your business, and buy heavily into the stock market.  You will make a lot of money when the madness subsides."
2020-03-06 22:46,"The president just stated at his CDC visit this afternoon (Friday)  that anyone who wants to be tested should go get a test Testing kits aren't available!!!


He either doesn't know what he is talking about or is lying. In either case, he isn't fit for office. His statements are dangerous."
2020-03-06 23:13,"Mortality rate of Coronavirus.
Compare to the fact that regular seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.

China     3.7%
Italy       4.2
S Korea  4.6
Japan     1.4
Iran        2.6
France    1.3
Spain      2.0
USA        5.5

USA has way too many death cases(15) to the total cases of 272.   Let's assume the US mortality rate is same as French rate, then the US total cases will jump from current 272 to 1200.  This is about right."
2020-03-07 0:15,"We all need to work on our viral immune system it seems.  I'd like to know if Black Elderberry and tree sap resins and the like could be broadly distributed.   

Our nation not only needs health care for all we need preventative and nutritional health education and nutritional foods for all.

New York's govenor and legislation represents the kind of leadership we need federally.

If anyone is going to act and be like this, in my view its Bernie, who fights for people first and profits second.  

That aside, almost anyone other than Trump, who has even a single public service bone in their body would be doing much better.

""Just staying home"" for people who are sick will not contain this extremely contagious virus.  In the meantime, personally, I'm ordering large quantities of black elderberry extract and drinking lots of purified water.

Let's hope that career public servants will do what they can to overcome the massive leadership gap at the heads of our government at this time.  

I'd love to know what other preventative anti-virals are out there than black elderberry extract like found in Sambucol in drug stores.   For full disclosure, I don't have any financial or other interests in Sambucol and I purchase black elderberry extract from a different source that is organic and doesn't have near as much sugar."

She woke up this morning with a sore throat and froggy voice, the result of a slow-burn cold I got over a week ago.

Its not the Coronavirus. Its not. Its mild, low grade, long-lasting sniffles. Mine lasted two weeks. Mine was barely noticed by others. I had to blow my nose some. She has a deadline tomorrow (Friday). So...she takes two weeks off now??

This is going to happen with each of the employees in her office who haven’t yet gotten the flu during this flu season. Its going to be interminable."
2020-03-05 17:58,"The Small Business Administration, if it has not already done so, should set up a program for small businesses adversely affected by the coronavirus to get the kinds of loans that are available to businesses adversely affected by other natural disasters, such as hurricanes.  Extensions of time to file and pay income taxes should also be granted to those in areas materially affected by the coronavirus.  The time to act is now, before economic panic sets in."

This is probably still in the first quarter of the match. The game may even up, it may get lopsided in the virus’ favor or a strong containment/vaccine comeback will close this chapter of pandemic epidemiological management may come through. The only way to the exit is going through to reach it."
2020-03-05 18:01,"The absolutely crazy thing about all these precautions, risks and steps Americans are expected to take, is why didn’t our government do the same before this?   I read how scientists were trying to get funding and support to complete a vaccine in 2016; why was there decline from government? Why weren’t major corporations doing everything they could to support the same, as they had to know how impacting an event like this would be?  It makes me mad that us poor peons are now being expected to do more than our government, which exists to protect us?  Is it realistic to expect 60 percent of families in America who earn less than $40,000. to do what our government should have done with our tax dollars and major corporations should have supported to protect us?  Good government leaders, please be sure you do ALL you can to be sure this never happens again.

The COVID-19 virus is no doubt causing a health emergency in the US but the other emergency is caused by the Republicans and Trump who continue to play down the serious health condition in both the White House and Congress.  Wearing a gas mask to Congress is deplorable when many families have loved ones who have lost their lives.

When Americans depend on their government to protect them, Republicans continue to gaslight and give fake information."
2020-03-05 18:38,"People will blame Trump because that is the answer to everything, but this is a much more systemic problem. There wasn’t a good plan four years ago or fourteen years ago. You can always count on the government to be unaccountable and mismanaged. Politicians are never concerned about the future. Just the next headline. This is why the government should be involved in as little as possible. Don’t call for the federal government to take over healthcare. Don’t call on the government to take your guns and be your only protection. The federal government can’t take care of its basic constitutionally designated responsibilities. Why would anyone expect anything different this time."

I said I do have a cold but that's the problem.  I've become obsessed with the fact that I might have coronavirus.    They told me not to worry about it and hung up.
2020-03-05 19:09,"“No one has a playbook for this,” said Dan Levin,
That is true but this is not the first epidemic we are facing  There were other epidemics recently similar to the COVID-19 like the SARS, MERS,  did we learn anything from that?  Those epidemics were quickly forgotten. what did we learn from the SARS epidemic of 2003, another coronavirus? 
 Transparency is the best policy but the Chinese did not learn this basic thing from the SARS epidemic.
  Although nothing was known about the SARS coronavirus at the time when the disease first struck, we soon realized that some of the affected countries did not acknowledge openly and squarely the presence of SARS, downplayed its extent, and attempted to prove that it was something else.
   Perhaps, if there had been prompt and accurate reporting of the full facts so that others could have been forewarned and taken preventive measures, history may have taken a different course."

His tone of voice reflected approval, and even a suggestion, that people just motor on. Listen to it. His subsequent protest that condemnation of his gross irresponsibility is “fake news” is absurd.  This is your president, America. Vote Blue."
2020-03-05 17:54,"The reality is that relatively well-off office workers will be fine working from home. It is, of course as always in the United States, the poorer who will be at a greater risk. Not only because of your country’s lack of sick leave and basic protections for workers, but also because those less well-off might be scared of the cost of testing for the virus.

Will be very insightful to see how this is handled in the US."

The mid term hope is the much maligned pharmaceutical and medical researchers. In the meantime failing to prepare is preparing to fail.

So we tend to cut corners on safety in hopes the odds will land in our favor. I hope those with “only a small cold” going to work anyway are right that it isn’t COVD-19. I hope the working poor can survive interruptions to their no-benefits multiple part time jobs that barely stretch as it is. I hope Wall Street gives businesses a pass on increased profits this quarter. I hope we can all afford to suspend our expectations of instant Amazon Prime gratification for a while.

For example, Amazon and Facebook knew that Northern Ca. and Seattle were an epicenter with on-going community transmission last week.

That was the time to ask their office workforces to work from home, and to ask all of the many employees that continuously travel to and from their many other buildings across the world to also work from home lest they unknowingly transmit the virus before they are symptomatic --as it is known to be the case with some individuals.

Still now those employers are awaiting for crises vs pre-emptively asking all that can work from home to do so all across the country and all across their offices everywhere."

In Chicago the International Housewares Show was cancelled, they expect area hotels to lose 47K days of bookings.  Ditto a lot of air travel.

2020-03-05 20:10,"What are we waiting for?  Large firms should immediately tell ALL employees to work from home except for essential services required for pubic health and safety. Further, large firms should guarantee salaries for ALL workers if they are unable to work anytime over the next 6 months.  Federal and State government should IMMEDIATELY  guarantee and provide adequate temporary unemployment benefits to ALL workers at small companies.  Likewise, Federal and State governments should provide IMMEDIATE cash grants to small businesses so they don't go bankrupt.

If we do that now, we greatly mitigate the impact of a potential recession that will come in a few months in the event of a serious pandemic.

And if the pandemic doesn't materialize - we saved some jobs, small businesses and people  from the suffering the short term fallout from the virus - and that's not a bad thing."

And Seattle has the outstanding Medical Care, World Class Hospitals, Personnel and extremely driven Talent to overcome the challenges. The State and Local Governments are truly Science and Data driven, and will respond to a logical and rational manner. The Public will stand firm, follow directions and avoid Panic.

Over the past three years my colleagues have kept the federal functions we all rely on going - our organizations have a lot of built in resistance to change. That's been a good thing: we just keep on doing our work every day, as defined by the laws and policies created over the past century or so. Most of us have been able to do our work without paying too much attention to the chaos at the top of the government (with the exception of a few high-profile agencies targeted by the administration, of course).

But this epidemic demands fast adaptability to changing conditions, something the federal government machinery is not very good at.  We need competent executive leadership for that. So while our built resistance to change has been good for the country for the past three years (in my opinion, of course), it isn't serving us well today. 

I hope state governments will lead the way, because the federal government, in its current condition, does not have the capacity to respond to this crisis well."

Don't forget budget cuts, funding passivity, and all the clamoring about AR-15s, transgender bathrooms, and third-trimester abortions when we should have been clamoring about things like our public health infrastructure and ecological defense.

Nobody wants to invest in public health and prevention infrastructure because, when it works, we all forget about it and take it for granted. It's not sexy for politicians clawing for your dollars, and it's a money loser when all goes well.  But when it doesn't go well....refer to the next 18 months.

For all those tens of billions of dollars people have made on autonomous vehicle what-ifs, passive fund algorithms disasters, and foolish advertising apps like Facebook and Instagram, all I can say is I wish we had invested some of that in emergency preparedness, vaccine research, etc.

The CDC's recently announced 'death rate' exceeding 3.2% - based on reported cases - was loaded with caveats, ending with an expert assumption, based on experience, that the actual death rate may wind up being less than 1%.  At this point, COVID-19 is less lethal than SARS and MERS; less contagious than influenza and less dangerous than driving your car.  None of this means we treat it lightly.  But it does mean that we need to put it into perspective and continue to pay attention to the opinions of medical professionals, and not just sound bites, and not social media, and not some news outlets that don't tell the full story."

2020-03-05 22:11,"American capitalism is fantastic at generating wealth, fostering innovation and encouraging efficiency.  However, it has also helped to leave the nation highly vulnerable to a COVID epidemic.  In swine flu, the working poor in the US were 7x more likely to be sick, which helped spread it nation wide relatively quickly. Sick leave provisions are a luxury and many will simply not be able to afford taking time off when sick.  Healthcare is basically unavailable to a significant percentage  of the population.  The ICU capacity severely hampered from a lack of ICU doctors and nurses as it is a highly challenging and rewarding specialty, but one that is expensive to operate (~$5000 per bed per day) and relatively poorly remunerated in the US with highly unsocial hours and high stress levels to boot.  Hence the country is short around 6000 ICU physicians alone, and triple that in regards to ICU nurses.  Similar comments could be made about public health.  They are essentially both very necessary specialties which are not valued in a capitalist model as they don’t generate income very well.

How much production and travel and running around to meetings is really necessary? If it's so easy to stop, to stay home from work, maybe what we are doing isn't so important anyway. Have you seen the images of the clearing of pollution over China? Now the NYC subway system will be systematically cleaned with high grade cleaner. I'm not trying to see the bright side, but this is definitely a global wake up call. It's sort of like when you get a bad diagnosis and clean up your diet and start exercising--sometimes an illness is a gift, a motive to make needed changes."
2020-03-05 22:20,"Rather than our government and the Trump admin telling us little people to stop buying and hoarding masks and safety gear because health professionals need them they should start telling the 1 percent to stop hoarding cash and wealth because the country needs more investment in affordable Public health, education and a rock
solid safety net for workers and a modernized infrastructure. Health insurance companies and health conglomerates need to cut their CEOs salaries and equip their hospitals with equipment for their employees for crises like this. 
If the GOP didn’t restrict Obama’s budgets of investing in health care and infrastructure during his years and didn’t focus solely on cutting taxes for the uber rich during the Trump years as well as gutting our agencies that keep the American public and the environment safe we would have plenty of masks and equipment for our frontline health workers and be more prepared. 
This is what hoarding of resources looks like.  this is what the 99 percent feel like when we see wealth being siphoned off to the top and our Gov. doing zero to stop it. 
And it if it’s ok for the rich and corporate America to hoard then it’s ok for working American to hoard in order to protect themselves. 
Only the little people are expected to sacrifice themselves and their resources for the greater good. 
The rich never are."
2020-03-05 22:33,"An idea is perhaps for FB, Google, the NY Times, other employers and governments is to have their non-essential employees telecommute. This would prevent the rapid spread of the viral infection thereby reducing the time shops will be closed. Plus the potential for lawsuits from employees that were required to report to work while the potent virus was making havoc. Prevention is the best course of action. China had a slow reaction but then it took decisive action reducing the spread of the virus. So what about employers and government being proactive and taking responsibility for their work environment rather than insisting than employees wash their hands while the workplace is virulent? Washing hands goes only so far!"
2020-03-05 22:38,"One challenge is that people will inevitably lose their jobs at some point. Blue collar and white collar workers. This is taking a hit on the economy. Businesses will have to reduce hours, manpower, etc. I understand that this seems wrong but it’s inevitable. I am a small business owner, if I don’t make any income for three months, do you think I can keep up payroll? Airlines are reducing flights - ie everyone from captain to service crew have fewer shifts. 

We can decry the lack of social safety net but thats not a constructive complaint at this time. 

Not everyone can get bailed out, small businesses are certainly not TBTF (too big to fail), and the reality is that many people will suffer (not just warehouse workers and manual labor)."
2020-03-05 22:43,"For health workers who are not frontline ER and intensive care workers, there is almost no direction on what is necessary to prevent spread and protect employees and patients. I suspect the people working the front lines have been told next to nothing useful either.

I am astonished that we have come to the point where there are cases in the region, and no directives offered by the CDC on what precautions and protocols should be observed in doctor's offices. I think we added ""wipe down door knobs"" to ""wash your hands."" That is true preparedness.

For our own practice, one or two of our coworkers are in an at risk class, and a huge number of our patients are. They skew elderly and with underlying health problems.

2020-03-05 22:49,"I think working from home is the best remedy not only to avoid spread of infections but also for slowing climate change by not commuting in gas guzzlers and for paying more attention to kids and pets. I applaud all corporations and businesses that have already being encouraging their employees to work from home and getting s much done on their home computers for most of the times as sophisticated or even more sophisticated. Speaking for myself, I have a faster computer at home than provided to me in my office and I get a lot done faster. I also take lunch breaks that are much shorter and make healthier meals for myself and walk around the neighborhood during my breaks. I hope working from home becomes a continuing trend that increases even after Corona is wiped out from the face of our planet."
2020-03-05 22:52,"“When I talked to some state officials, there was a sense that the tests would not be administered to people that were mildly symptomatic,” Vice President Pence said in an off-camera briefing. “We’re issuing clear guidance that subject to doctors’ orders, any American can be tested.”

This is the reason why we need a coronavirus czar from CDC or NIH health officials rather than a politician. You have to test everybody with symptoms mild or severe so that the patient can be quarantine if found positive to avoid spreading to other people in a pending epidemic here. 

South Korea carries out an aggressive surveillance test drive through, anybody wants to be tested can be tested. The health official have identified double digits cases to 5238 confirmed cases with 33 deaths in two weeks. The mortality rate is 0.6%. US has reported 12 deaths so far, even with mortality rate of 1% ( the range is from 1-4% ), you know that there are at least 1200 infected patients not being identified."
2020-03-05 22:53,"Not to mention all hospitals.  My experience at my local hospital this week when i went in and was tested for the flu  which it turns out that i have type A influenza,  is that the Er staff aren't prepared and many are dismissive of the Corvid-19 virus.  their protocols quite frankly, stink.  No mandated use of masks while in the hospital ER area ore in areas open to the general public.  they have security guards and volunteers who just stand there as you enter.. no masks or handsanitizers available and only the most dillgent of staff wil ask oyu to put a mask on in the ER area.  the hospital itself is not designe dot handle infectious disease patients  , not even just one, nevermind dozens or hunderds if a huge outbreak were to occur.  And this hospital is brand new, opened just for a couple of months now.   one partial solution: prevention by mandating mask use and hand sanitizer use when you first enter.  Next,  a separate intake for ER  infectious disease patients, whether they may have a cold or flu. Keep them away from otherwise healthy ER patients who are there for other emergencies.  you will walk in healthy and leave a sick person.  Now, is this the way our health care system really works?"

If you are not insured or have high copayments or deductibles, are you going to show up at a hospital or a doctors office if you have a cold or flue like symptoms? knowing that a simple blood test and nasal test is going to cost you 1500 $ if you are insured and over 3000 if you're not. A year ago a I went thru surgery that required an 8 day stay a hospital, my deductible was 3000$, not including medical charges that amounted to 2000 more $.

2020-03-05 20:34,"Testing not Isolation seems to work in Korea

South Korea is experiencing the largest virus epidemic outside of China, where the pneumonia-causing pathogen first took root late last year. But unlike China, which locked down a province of more than 60 million people to try and stop the illness spreading, Korea hasn’t put any curbs on internal movement in place, instead testing hundreds of thousands of people everywhere from clinics to drive-through stations.


It appears to be paying off in a lower-than-average mortality rate. The outbreak is also showing signs of being largely contained in Daegu, the city about 150 miles south of Seoul where most of the country’s more than 5,700 infections have emerged. South Korea reported the rate of new cases dropped three days in a row. 

Perhaps the United States should think about really extensive testing rather than focusing in isolation."

2020-03-05 20:08,"Getting away from Trump for a minute (whew!) it's interesting to get a fresh view of how overtly political the NYT's coverage is, and how out of touch its readers are.

Yesterday the head of the WHO indicated that the virus is about 10X more deadly that the flu (bad but already known), less transmissible than the flu (good news) and not generally transmissible by asymptomatic subjects (good news).  But the bulk of reporting emphasizes the the first without the context of the other two facts in order to foment public panic and undermine the economy to affect the election.

Comments from those starting to feel that panic seem to imagine a world where everyone works at a desk, without an understanding of the physical, proximal reality of most of the economy.  Those of us who serve you and protect you and make and deliver the things you order on Amazon don't have that luxury.  While it may be that Amazon could afford to stop doing business for a month (or a year) while paying its employees, the bulk of our economy is in small businesses -- shops, tradesmen, salons, dentists -- that would be put out of business by a lost month of revenue.   

If you feel sick, stay home.  Minimize French kissing strangers.  Wash your hands.  You'll be fine."

2020-03-05 23:15,"As I read other comments, it is clear that COVID has provoked many emotions.  Unfortunately, people want answers that are not available, even with months of experience that has been shared from other countries.  

This week's New England Journal of Medicine has two articles on COVID that answer some questions relating to planning.   Person to person transfer of virus during the prodrome, the period before the serious symptoms occur, has been documented.  We also know that some people will seem to have recovered from the serious aspects of the infection, but they may still shed virus.  One case demonstrated that although the patient felt recovered, he still had a cough and positive viral markers.

In effect, these articles confirm the common-sense approach that has been advocated by the CDC and the WHO:  People with any question of symptoms should stay home.  People need to augment their hand washing techniques.  Try to avoid touching the face, nose, eyes (a mask may help prevent such contact).  No hand-shaking.  Use a lot of alcohol-based disinfectant.  If possible, limit social contacts, work from home.  

Large employers should have made plans for a variety of business disruptors, including computer crashes and weather-related events.  For a modern corporation not to have plans for a viral epidemic would almost be negligent, given that we have had three  major threats since 2003, and there are many infectious disease consultants who can advise a business plan."

Why is it that some school districts in WA state will allow their students to learn remotely amidst the outbreak, and other districts are being super lax? One school in a district is canceling after school events but the school itself remains open. Teachers are calling out sick left and right. One school in the same district is closed, but the rest aren’t. And there has not been any communication about what people should do if they had been in direct contact with a student who has an infection. Itinerant staff, like physical therapists, move from school to school. There are medically fragile children in the district, who need G-tubes and may have poor immune systems. Please be firm, be consistent, and stop being so lax about this! And let people work from home and start learning remotely!"

It’s not just about whether someone’s sneeze or cough reaches your face...

ii) masks remind others to keep their distance - another way to prevent infection. 
These are two good reasons to wear a mask that are not being discussed."

Risk of exposure is far greater than say, walking past someone in the grocery store. The mask used for isolation patients is an N-95 mask; filters out 95% of airborne particles. They are not 1 size fits all. RN's need to be tested for fit every year. Something like a weight loss/gain could change mask fit. Persons with facial hair may need different masks. My full bearded RN husband wore a very different mask than I wear. RN's also receive special training on proper use. They MUST be applied, and more importantly, removed correctly or you will contaminate yourself. Also- they are uncomfortable and can make it seem hard to breathe. There's a strong impulse to reposition or touch the mask to get some air flow in around the edge, which  renders them useless. This is where the special training comes in- you must use them correctly for them to be of benefit! Loose fitting surgical masks won't prevent the inhalation of droplets.

 To be clear, I am no Trump and anti-science deniers. Science is real. Even if you don't know much about the more technical aspect of science, vaccines and medicines save lives; prayers don't even if they too can give you a psychological boost and good for morale. Science and faith are two wings of a bird.

But I also remember the hysteria of AIDS in the mid 80s. HIV positive individuals were treated terribly then. And that lasted for a long time. Until the disease got de-mythified and there are better medicines to treat and manage it.

So, don't be cavalier like the Trump gang on one hand and don't panic yourself to hysteria on the other. One should still be able to go to work and live with others. Most of the infected will get cured and live. The old and vulnerable will die one way or another. Be sensible!"

Family support exists for some but not all of the healthcare establishment. Hard to run medical facilities without enough nurses or housekeeping and support staff.

When you have a President who is in denial instead of moving forward with clear and transparent mitigation measures, business confidence will slump radically as reality starts to seep in. Calling the WHO's mortality estimates into question on Fox News because of a Presidential ""hunch"" doesn't help. These figures are based on the Chinese experience. What the President overlooks is that the vast majority of cases have been in Wuhan and at one stage officials there were instructed to go door to door to assess who might be infected. There has been little chance of evading detection and thus skewing the data and China does not benefit from skewing data upwards. My ""hunch"" is that the WHO's estimate is based on sound analysis. Certainly high rates of mortality are being seen in South Korea, Italy and Iran - the countries at the forefront of outbreaks outside China. That does not bode well for business or the community in other countries. Places like Singapore and Hong Kong have done relatively well so far in containing the disease but that is because they have been very proactive and have kept their public extremely well informed, unlike many other countries.

I suspect that by the time coronavirus dies out, if you add all the claimed losses, the sum would rival the GPP (gross planetary product).

You would have thought that the Spanish Flu, HIV, and Ebola would be etched on peoples' minds. Complacency, however, has had the upper hand.

The problem with contagions is that halfway measures may leave the impression that ""at least something is being done"" but that's like saying leaping off of a ten-story building is twice as safe as jumping off of a 20 story building. Not really. Halfway is, in actual fact, mathematically far less than half of what a responsible solution would have yielded. You can't measure black and white (either the virus spreads or it doesn't) in shades of gray.

Those in a position to allocate the money and other resources: 1) have made inadequate advance preparations, and 2) hesitated when confronted by an actual crisis. Both are proving fatal.

Avoiding cramped, highly-congested spaces like airplanes, cruise ships, theaters, auditoriums and public spaces is recommended, especially if travel and attendance is discretionary.  All attempts to bail out big corporations who yell ""Too big to fail!"" will be all too reminiscent of 2008 when the needs of the public were also neglected.

Instead, we've started managing our own business. What a novel idea. Stay focused on finishing the work we have. Hiring freeze. Take vacations while you can even if they're going to be stay at home.

I call it unfounded, irrational  and unwarranted panic selling  caused by the California Governor Mr. Nuisance calling an unjustified state of emergency in his state and then saying it is not about money.

2020-03-05 20:25,"It needs to be noted that Covid-19 is significantly less deadly that SARS (~6%), and likely much less deadly than most current estimates (2-4%).

The numbers for Hubei province (with Wuhan) are 2902 / 67466 = 4.3%, likely reflecting how an overwhelmed public health system is unable to devote enough resources on tracking cases with low levels of symptoms.

A better estimate of mortality comes from a well studied cohort, the cruise ship stuck in Yokohama harbor, since testing was performed on most if not all on board: 6 / 706 = 0.85%.

Taking into consideration that the cruise passengers average age was relatively high, and thus at high risk for severe disease, it looks like this virus will end up on the high end of the influenza spectrum, usually quoted at 0.1%, but variable (the 1918 pandemic flu was around 2%)."

While it is true there will be a serious economic impact from this, what is really troubling is the Trump administration is using all possible tools to keep the stock market up, as though that alone were some kind of a popularity poll on Trump and Republican policies.  What are they going to do when the real economic fallout if a fully global pandemic (with thousands of cases in dozens of countries, including the US) actually manifests?  They'll have burnt all possible responses just not to look bad in the short term.  Dealing with the health crisis now and the economic impact later accepts that there will be a recession (as there would be anyway), but desperately attempting not to look bad now and ignoring the fallout longterm will result in a full-blown depression later; one that will last for years, regardless of the outcome of the health crisis."

I don’t think Americans generally know but there are Chinese airlines that have seen up to a 90 percent reduction in traffic since the lunar new year and are still still flying reduced schedules, their losses have to be staggering. Parked airplanes only generate costs but zero revenue to offset those costs. 

In our own case the restrictions on travel from one country to another are going to make it impossible to schedule the pilots to fly the planes. Currently if a pilot lays over in Japan for a day he can’t then fly to China for a minimum of 14 days. Israel just put out a list of countries to long to list.

This virus is extremely contagious, and its worldwide spread is inevitable, regardless of prevention efforts, at least until some sort of vaccine is created.  So any effort to eradicate the virus is futile.

At what point do we accept that we are up against something that we don't really have much control over?  Unless an effective vaccine is near completion, is it worth total disruption to merely slow down the inevitable spread of the virus?  Obviously we should take reasonable and practical preventive steps to avoid the spread of the virus, especially for at-risk individuals, but some of the efforts thus far (e.g., quarantining of cruise ships) seem overly drastic, given the inevitability of the virus's spread.

As a businessman I am aware that running an airline is, in the best of times, a razor-thin business model. Once you start flying your big rigs half empty, they make a net loss. If you have to park them, they still cost a fortune in storage fees, maintenance and often in multi-million leasing contracts that still need to be honored. Then there are the thousands of well-paying jobs that disappear. 

My manufacturing business will survive this crisis. We build stuff, our supply chain is unperturbed, our customers are still buying. But we are not traveling for business anymore. We don't even accept visitors from countries like Italy or China anymore. Every interaction with external stakeholders is moving to online conferencing. Employees are discouraged from taking vacation that involves flying to foreign destinations.

2020-03-05 21:23,"Unsurprisingly, Trump's strategy is to tweet nothing but lies about the present situation. And as the virus spreads - and it will - his lies will continue to tank the market, as it becomes even more evident that we are rudderless - that our government's top priority is to make sure the president looks good.

I went cash in January so no harm to my pocket but I realise I live in an economy where my income is driven by other people’s spending so it will hit me too just not in my stock portfolio.

2020-03-05 22:08,"What concerns me is a president who will do anything to gain reelection. Trump already squandered the first step — an interest rate cut — so now I expect corporate welfare in an effort to prop up the market indices. The righties who screamed at Obama’s post-2008 measures will no doubt cheer while the government chooses winners and losers. Of course, the ultimate losers are the taxpayers, especially our kids who will be burdened forever with the bill.

The markets constantly go up and down.  Recently, I've heard a down swing attributed to coronavirus and an upswing attributed to the primary results.  From the outside, it feels massively subjective - like there are always a million reasons it could go this way or that, and whoever is writing the headline has free reign (and the cover of confusion) to claim that this or that caused the change.  Who accounts for the claims based on markert fluctuations?"
2020-03-05 22:13,"I would like to see this global crisis impel the US to train and educate far more doctors and nurses than we do now, so there will be enough skilled medical people to care for underserved hospitals and rural areas and to deal with epidemics.

2020-03-05 22:15,"Maybe if there is a silver lining in all this, is that humans have to accept and meet a new ""two flu-like virus"" world together.... We need to figure a way together that crosses nation boundaries. The endgame of today's coronavirus times may in fact be when: ""On my, I have a real case of the flu!"" and ""Oh my, I have a real case of Covid-19!!"" finally have the same freak-out factor for kids, Moms, Dads, CEOs and Generals etc.  Of course we have to firmly establish how equal the two viruses are.  But its looking that they pretty much are. We need invent new thinking, new education, new wellness training, new social psychology that can get us to a new ""old flu plus this new flu"" normality (it may be the best also unavoidable outcome ).   We must move forward together around the globe to realign thinking about what is flu danger and risk: adjust the old well accepted influenza standard.  It can also help teach us how to do human community design without borders? Gotta hope. Could be applied next to climate, water shortages, food production? They're coming."

However, I’m having a difficult time finding pity on domestic air carriers and the notion they might lose some revenue.

But for now the powers that be or rather the algorithms that be are churning, buying like mad today and selling like mad tomorrow to get the commissions while all the pundits say it's the virus. Up a 1000 yesterday, down a 1000 today..who wants to bet it's up tomorrow?  The trick now is to figure when the markets will stay down BECAUSE of the virus and plan accordingly."
2020-03-05 22:33,"Trump gave away the treasury with tax cuts to the wealthy and corporate CEOs who squandered the money on stock buybacks. Now they're cashing out, with ordinary workers and retirees holding the bag. He squandered a rate cut, leaving fewer options for reviving a recessionary economy.  Trump will be tossed out of office in November and sent to jail soon thereafter. A democratic placeholder president will take over until 2024, when another democrat with at least half the brain-power of Elizabeth Warren takes over. My only hope at this point is that placeholder president reverses the tax cuts on DAY ONE and plans on a huge infrastructure project starting almost immediately. Oh, and a Democratic Senate and House is required. Otherwise, keep selling your shares and wash your hands."

2020-03-05 22:38,"Finally, ""the chickens are coming home to roost"".

The ""Stable Genius"" can't escape that the appalling readiness to be in a position to detect, mobilize and quickly and accurately follow the necessary path to cope with a viral epidemic, which is well on its way to becoming a pandemic.
Without belabouring this, even the tools to scan, detect and access the necessary materials to be in a position to determine and act are either faulty or in short supply.

The first approach was to downplay such a reality, with his pronouncement that this will disappear in a few weeks.

Now, the whole exercise is being categorized as an over-amped Democratic stunt which now includes the financial market reaction and consequences.

It can't belong until he will fire some token loyal staff in an attempt to pass the blame along.

The prospect of 4 more years of this playbook is almost beyond belief."
2020-03-05 22:39,"We seem to have now entered into the realm of complete panic in the marketplace.  The reaction from this pandemic seems to have triggered a long overdue correction of what was a way overpriced market.

But now it's headed to declines that are beyond a reasonable correction reaction into the area of manic pandemonium.

Probably nothing can stop this from running its course.  No Fed action can stem such a panic and it's as likely as not that anything Trump says will be inappropriate, self-serving and somehow he'll blame it all on Pelosi, Obama and the Democrats!"

Sadly, his mercenary instincts are probably spot on—if the market is up, he probably wins re-election; and if it tanks, he loses.   Who cares about people's actual health?"
2020-03-05 22:30,"My guess is that the stock market wouldn't be hurting so badly if investors had confidence in this so-called administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Perhaps they should have set aside some of the money used for tax cuts for the rich, border walls, missile strikes, and the presidents many trips to rallies, golf courses and ""secret""meetings with North Korea's leader. 

Perhaps they should have kept more scientists and doctors on the payroll.

2020-03-05 20:02,"The fundamental problem with a guy like Trump has always been that sooner or later, he’s an idiot who always runs out of luck—and has always gambled with money he doesn’t have, alienated or just plain attacked anybody who works for him or deals with him, counted on crashing anything that might get in his way, and depended on getting out of the consequences by easing it on down the road to the next sucker. 

That’s fine, I guess, if you’re just a dodgy real estate speculator who shows up on TV a lot. There’ll always be new horizons, especially if you’re really aggressive and completely amoral. You won’t even bang your nose on material reality all that often, and whenyou do, you can always just bellow until it goes away.

But as President—well, you better stay really, really lucky. Because sooner or later, Something will always happen. And then, since you’ve trashed everything that the job depends on, and there’s no place down the road to ease it on down to...

Well, you got two choices. You can amp up the crazy even more, and hope everybody bursts into tears and surrenders. Or you can do what Trump seems to be doing currently, which is to flail around helplessly.

Myself, I have this sneaking feeling that an awful lot of Trumpists, up to and including Mike Pence, have had a nasty, embarassing, brief thought at least twice in the last month:

2020-03-05 22:54,"The headline is very appropriately phrased. Market plunges because of corona virus ""Fears"".
Without in any way suggesting that this virus should not be treated as a serious health risk, I cannot understand the degree of fear, even panic, and often irrational reactions to it.
The reported cases of corona virus are but a fraction of a fraction of the cases of flu currently afflicting countless Americans. And, like the flu, the fatalities from the virus predominantly result from age or underlying physical conditions.
Arguments that there are probably far more instances of corona virus than have been reported are probably correct, but that serves to prove my point. Symptoms have for the most part been manageable and the people who got it recovered in full health without ever knowing they ever even had the virus.
The corona virus is simply another virus of the type that affects tens of millions of people each year. It is not Ebola. It is not the Plague. It is a virus from which the overwhelming number of people will readily recover.
Yet,  many are in a sheer state of panic. Any attempt to inject reason and context into the matter is met by derision and contempt. God help he politician who even suggests that the reaction is overblown.   
All we need to do is take the precautions that we normally  should to prevent spread of disease.

Although there have been sensationalist reports of stores selling out of some items, every store I visited the last week has been well stocked with just about everything,  even sanitizer and masks at stores that normally sell them.

If cases hit 50K, the U.S. could hit up to 1,000 deaths before it’s all over.  Probably not, but it’s possible.

In other words, it will be about 1/25 to 1/40 of a regular flu season.  For example, the U.S. already has over 16.000 flu deaths, with 18,000 to 45,000 expected in total.

If he can only keep up this pattern, he is sure to be re-elected."

2020-03-06 1:05,"I think there is a strong possibility we haven't seen the bottom of this yet. Nobody seems to question the very basis of the stock market which is since shareholders have ownership rights the value of the stock they hold should be based on future earnings. I simply don't believe in that premise as the only real value a shareholder gets (other than appreciation which is highly uncertain) is the dividend which is based on present earnings and doesn't pay hardly anything in comparison to the stock price. So what does this all mean? It means the stock market is not based on economic principles such as payouts to shareholders, but on what direction the majority are guessing the future earnings are going. This is a very shaky basis for determining value as the future direction of a company's earnings is generally unknowable. So how does this relate to today's stock market bottom? A lot lower than it is even today after an 8% loss so far."

This corona virus is bringing things down to earth. It hasn't done it's job completely as yet. The asset prices really need to come down 40 to 50 percent or even more to make them affordable to everyone. I am shocked to see Apple and Samsung phones costing upwards of $1500. That is simply incredible. There is too much profiteering. 
China has created so many corrupt millionairs that they decimating the local economies...so in my view the virus is doing the correction.
The market corrections are a good thing, it is a good disruption. I haven't seen much effect in some sectors of the economy here and for that I want to see more of this Virus.

What has changed is the attitudes of the public which is what governments, businesses, transit systems, etc are trying to react to pre-emptively.  Why?  Cancel culture, that's why.  Charging hoards of people in the internet ginned up by the constant drumbeat of media looking for clicks will be demanding that heads of state roll, airline presidents quit, school districts be sued . . .it just goes on and on.  Unless you keep me from getting a flu.

Some of the hysteria may be sincere ignorance but unfortunately a lot of it is typical attempts at manipulating politics AT ANY COST and grabbing ANY issue.  That behavior is unconscionable, if insincere, and unfortunate if the cause is real ignorance.

I also cry as a gay man in my late 70's for all the people who died needlessly because an earlier administration refused for a long time to acknowledge that HIV was a problem that we needed to care about. 

I also feel great pride that there was a firestorm of protest in the 1980's, led by ACT UP, Project Inform, and others that under the banner of ""Silence = Death"" forced American politicians to deal with HIV as a public health and medical issue; and has made it clear that we must never ever again ignore a communicable disease just because we don’t like some of the people who have it or that it presents an inconvenient truth to those in power who want to pretend that everything is fine."

Life is fatal.  This virus is not a huge deal.  Every time I’ve had the flu I’ve wondered if I’d live.

The stock market needed a correction.  It used this opportunity well.

Yea, it’s a bummer to die early from this.  Yea, especially if it can be prevented.  But before we had a flu vaccine, this would have been pretty mundane.  Yea, the epidemic of 2018 was bad, but they didn’t have computers then.  Computers will show this just hastened the deaths of many due to die soon.

Considering how many more people are free to move around the world in comparison to 100 years ago, within the scope of peril that has been placed on this 'outbreak' one would think there would be a great many more cases. Plus, it seems the tests are only being administered to those showing symptoms and to those in close proximity to those with symptoms. Considering there are those who test positive but show no symptoms, there must be many more who elsewhere are carrying without having a reason to test. 
Unless we see several orders of magnitude of new cases within the next month.. the situation is gonna give lotsa political ammo to those who can justly place blame on the media for contributing to a brush fire that has definitely damaged a lot of nest eggs. Then they will vote with their wallets."

2020-03-06 8:34,"Almost 50 years ago, I was on a motor trip through the Sierra mountains of California.  Every town border in California had a sign, with the name of the town and its population.  I remembered specifically Kyburz California, because its population was 7.   A month later, I was home in New Jersey, watching a news story about a forest fire in the Sierras.   And on the news story, it was declared that ""the entire town of Kyburz California was evacuated."".   It was never mentioned that the population of Kyburz was 7.

It was then that I learned that the news media tends to sensationalize events in its reporting.   We seldom get the information to judge the seriousness of a situation.   Corona virus is not a hoax, but to judge its impact on public health, we should compare it to normal annual flu in the USA.  Annually, over the last 10 years,    The Center for Disease Control says this about our annual flu season:

""While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.""

Thus, every year we go through an equivalent contagion without the economy grinding to a halt.   But I see the media fanning waves of panic over Corona virus.   I worry more about the anti-vaccination people spreading measles."

Today, it is ”sell on rumors, buy on news if you still have cash left.”

This behavior of buying everything off the shelves - why is anyone surprised?  Folks behave in most irrational ways when confronted with unknown.

That brings to mind Rumsfeld on unknowns:

”.. there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.”

2020-03-05 22:07,"Nothing is ever as bad as the media portrays it, and the real news remains well below the surface.  This Caronavirus hysteria will soon pass, probably because the virus is mutating to a less lethal form.  But if it scares the markets into waking up to our financial and political reality, it will have performed a service.  Our financial structure is in a state of advanced corruption.  Morality and money must keep each other company if either is to survive.  This is the reason that Calvinistic Scots became the leading thinkers on economics.  We are currently led by a bankrupt casino kingpin/con artist who fits the profile of a classic psychopath.  So-called ""conservatives"" are acting like spectators at a bullfight, unaware that they are surrounded by a deadly virus and sitting in an arena that is about to collapse.  Yes, when you hear the timbers groan, panic is the appropriate response."
2020-03-05 10:52,The posting re: coronavirus antibodies being checked for clearance does not make scientific sense.  Antigens are the part of the virus that antibodies (which are made by us) identify and fight to extinguish.  Antibodies stay around after the virus has been cleared and can help with immunity against future infection.  The link in English says they are using checks for antibodies to see if people are infected in the first place.  It would make sense if they were checking for clearance of antigens to see if the virus had been killed.  I would double check what was written.

Maybe the vulnerable groups need to be protected, such as restricting visitation to hospitals or nursing homes. Kids don't seem as vulnerable so why close schools? And with the disaster that is American health-care, we're all going to get it anyway. My daughter just went to the doctor with a sore throat. The doctor determined it was a virus, but no mention of coronavirus, no questions about contact with anyone and obviously no mention of testing, perhaps because there are no testing kits. I couldn't afford to pay for a test anyway. She's home with a doctor's note excusing her through Friday. My husband went to work with a runny nose. I don't know what to think."

And now a week later - so far so good.  Washing hands frequently does seem to help.

At this time of emergency - not the best time to talk politics.

But I can't help but wonder how California thinks it can get away with a declaration of emergency - to protect itself from suspected Wuhan patients.

But when POTUS declared emergency to stop unlimited flow of illegals across our southern borders including California - why, he was called all kinds of names."

I bet our academic researchers are talking to theirs every moment.  Their observation, discoveries and experiences in this fight against COVID-19 continue published in our and other medical journals around the world fast.  Their willing to share is tremendous.  It is a human fight against virus, which doesn't recognize borders.

This is a crisis but also an opportunity to understand more about China and its system.  We still have many journalists and media organization in China.  Our probing expertise should provide domestic audience a fresh look and new thinking about China."

People here routinely travel for work and pleasure. Soon, we have college and prep school kids coming back for break and then spring break travel, spring holidays, etc..  The medical center services NH and VT.  This virus is being sent far and wide from our sleepy little town...

Corona is similar to a virulent flu strain with a higher mortality rate, especially for groups with compromised immune systems.  Like the flu, corona will run it’s course. Until then, wash your hands, treat your symptoms and stay home if you’re sick, just like you would with any other flu or virus. I’m sorry for the families who have lost loved ones, but this hysteria isn’t helping anyone."
2020-03-05 13:40,"It seems to me that some of the reporting implies that the availability of test kits has been the reason we don't really have a good idea of the extent of the spread of the virus in the US.  That would also mean we don't really know the fatality rate per thousand infections.  Isn't the test kit only used for taking a sample or specimen which must then be sent to a laboratory for the actual testing?  The administration is claiming that nearly one million test kits will be available by the end of the week.  Sounds impressive but the real bottleneck appears to be the lab test of the specimens, which is reported to have a capacity of 10,000 per day by the end of this week.  Ten thousand per day seems like a lot but at that rate it would take a full year to have test results for about one percent of the US population."

Trump doesn't accept nor know any of the science behind the coronavirus crisis.

With his lies and lack of knowledge and unwillingness to accept the opinions of experts, trump and his administration have failed us.

2020-03-05 13:47,"Given the facts that the disease can take days, or even weeks, to incubate before someone shows symptoms, and that some people have no or very mild symptoms and continue to go about in their communities, what is the point of health officials’ continuing to try to trace contacts?  It seems like their time and energy and resources could be put to better use.  I just flew in and out of Tampa, most likely near the time when the person who came back from Italy with a case of the virus was traveling through the Tampa airport too, touching escalator handrails, tram handrails, etc.  Is it reasonable to expect officials to try to track contacts in that case?  No, it is not."
2020-03-05 13:36,"The big and unanswered question is whether or not people who have been asked to ""self-isolate"" for 14 days will do so.  Or if they even understand what that means - stay HOME!  No quick trips to the conveniience mart or the coffee bar, etc.  if you live with others, they, too should self isolate.
NH's first case was a person who ignored orders to self isolate (though diagnosed presumptive positive). He chose to attend a party for the Tuck School of Business, held at a local venue in White River Junction, VT.

 Our region is coping with the results of this person's arrogance and selfishness. (He is now under an ""Official"" order of quarantine).  

The event venue bears the cost of additional cleanings and potential loss of revenue from other events whcih may cancel.  Some of the bartenders and staff who came in ""close contact"" with the ill person must now self-isolate for 14 days. it is unlikely they have paid sick leave, so they are facing loss of income.  At least one of the patient's colleagues has tested positive.

At least 4 attendees of the event are now being tested for COVID-19.

This person works at our regional hospital.  We are told he does not have contact with patients - but - did he walk through the corridors?  Buy coffee in the cafeteria? 

His refusal to self isolate was at a minimum, irresponsible. As said earlier, selfish and arrogant, too.  Our community suffers the results of his actions.

Epidemiologists can identify the number of deaths, but not the number of infected patients, so any statistical analysis is inaccurate or premature. The incubation period isn't well defined, nor when people who have it--who may or may not have symptoms--can spread the infection to others.

Computers would fail, no electricity countrywide, no cell phone service, general chaos would ensue for months if not years.  The clock struck midnight and nothing happened.  So far, nothing has shown the corona virus to be anymore contagious or deadly than ordinary influenza.  In South Korea, where medical facilities are on par with those in the U.S., the death rate is less than 1%, comparable to influenza.  The incubation period, although as long as 14 days, is normally 2-3 days for corona virus, similar to influenza.  Fear is driving this ""crisis"", not facts."
2020-03-05 14:58,"The Washington State outbreak is just the tip of the iceberg.
The CDC was negligent sending thousands of malfunctioning testing kits .
Millions of Americans lack health insurance and many more millions are underinsured, precluding access to healthcare because of cost and facilitating the spread of the infection.
Many of Americans don’t have sick pay  leave , forcing sick individuals to work instead of going into a self imposed quarantine.
Statistics show that the number of infections is directly proportional to the number of testing .
When next week nationwide testing will be available in the USA , I am afraid that we will be shocked by the enormous number , unless politicians will interfere rationing testing in order to contain panic."
2020-03-05 15:05,The closing of schools will be a big tipping point for the economy but it will curtail transmission. Some parents are a little more careless/fatalistic than others about dropping off symptomatic kids at school.

Maybe they can’t take the time off from work but this is definitely not the time to be cavalier with the health and well-being of others.

They also say that ""asymptomatic persons are potential sources of 2019-nCoV infection"" and this ""may warrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of the current outbreak"""
2020-03-05 15:13,"I was troubled by the story about the Dartmouth student diagnosed with the virus who was told to self-quarantine, but  went to a mixer at the school and may have infected others. It reminded me of those few people who were arrested during the AIDS crisis for deliberately infecting others. We are fortunate in that those diagnosed with coronavirus are allowed to quarantine themselves, rather than being forced to go to a government facility. If people don't listen to health officials who tell them to stay home, I'm afraid the government will institute much harsher actions to keep them separate from the healthy. It's up to us to keep this from spreading.  Be responsible."

That's because of the coronavirus my local Starbucks in Pasadena is refusing to fill my own personal insulated travel cup, the one I paid a lot of money for years ago to save the planet from unnecessarily wasted paper cups.  Now they only hand me a paper cup full of coffee with a great deal of fear in their eyes that I have to pour myself into my own cup that they're afraid to touch and then throw theirs away.  Nature wins every time.  I'm hardly surprised however that they'll still touch and take the money I hand them.  No possible virus transmission from that I'm sure."

2020-03-05 15:10,"None of this reporting is helpful. Infections are reported implying they will be fatal, as if everyone infected is at death's door when the truth is many who are infected show minor symptoms or sometimes none at all. 

Also, when a death actually occurs, the age and general health of the victim should be noted since many already had underlying ailments, as did the gentleman on this cruise ship. 

The media is being very irresponsible in creating panic and contributing to the growing hysteria."

I can get a pneumonia vaccination without a prescription.

Why should we interpose this costly and time-consuming step between the patient and the test?

Getting to see the doc may take 2 days.  The doc may not want to see you if you are presenting.

Hopefully a vaccine will be developed before long and we will learn more about this terrible illness.  In the meantime, we should take health precautions and be prepared.  Wash hands, use hand sanitizer and sneeze into a Kleenex. This is something we should do on a regular basis. And do not shake hands.  Hopefully this too shall pass."

Yesterday, March 4, six weeks after the first known case and four days after people from that facility were critically ill and began dying, they start testing at the nursing home. Presumably by the end of today they will have all been tested. Then there are all the family members and visitors to the nursing home as well as the first responders who are now quarantined. And their families. 

It is clear that this outbreak is not being well-managed. Communications from our county executive and health department have been confusing. And yes, thank you for this reporting."

I find it hard to believe that cruises are still operating anywhere in the world and that people are still taking them.  Now, we have yet another potential debacle with the Grand Princess, only this time it's our problem rather than Japan's problem.  

Let's hope authorities learned from the earlier mistakes and get people off the ship and into some type of quarantine facility on shore, if necessary.  Of course, this will force them to deal with several thousand potentially exposed passengers.  That requires a staggering amount of public health resources in California.  Is Princess Cruises footing the bill for any of this?  The state of California should sue the cruise line to recoup the costs."

2020-03-05 15:37,"Why would anyone board a cruise ship in these times?

In truth I have never understood why people board cruise ships at any time.

It would seem to qualify as self-destructive behavior which might have warranted involuntary commitment in earlier days.

Of course, if we involuntarily committed would-be cruise goers, they would probably get COVID 19 in the confinement facility."
2020-03-05 15:59,"It is a virulent strain. Worldwide travelers in 2019 was estimated to be 1.4 billion international arrivals. Airlines, cruise ships and mass public transportation are incubators. A moratorium on travel and quarantining cruise ships like the one that traveled to Mexico onto Hawaii and then San Francisco is all one needs to know about why an ounce of precaution now is worth a pound of cure given the complexity of today's world. That's real."

Over-compliance vs laissez faire.  It  doesn't help that the public is still receiving mixed messages from public officials and social media, instead of confining guidance to one set of reputable websites: medical journals, repubable print media, the CDC, etc.

While panic won't cure the virus, neither will refusal to listen to aut horities.  God knows there have been enough missteps without adding new ones to the process."

2020-03-05 15:42,"Donald Trump went on Fox News last night and said his “hunch” is that the fatality rate for the coronavirus is less than 1%.  This from a known germaphobe and science-denier.  The numbers so far indicate a 2-3% fatality rate and even if those numbers are a bit off because many with milder cases haven’t been tested, less than 1% seems preposterous.  It is beyond irresponsible and dangerous, and need I say, selfish, especially when he has effectively silenced or censored reports by federal health experts.  We need leaks.  We need facts."
2020-03-05 15:23,"How can they make the same mistake again? Quarantine means separating the sick from the healthy population NOT trapping the healthy with the sick in very close quarters.They need to immediately disembark the ship and quarantine them in separate quarters on the mainland, then send the ship out of commission for however many days it takes germs to die. Same with the air fleet. Take down the planes in shifts so the planes get degermed by staying out of use for a few days. Then switch out another set of planes for a germ break. Yes, some will have to postpone vacations and businiess meetings, but so they will if they become gravely ill."

He's a dumpster fire surrounded by apologists and yes men.  We need leaders, not excuse makers.

It bears repeating; Leaders lead when leadership is needed."
2020-03-05 15:09,"Our leaders so far are failing us on this issue.  VP Pence misled the public making it sound like one million coronavirus tests would be performed nationally by the end of the week.  It isn't even clear that public health departments will have that many testing kits let alone be able muster the resources to collect samples and do the actual testing.  Then Pence says criteria are now that any person can get tested if their provider (not all providers are MDs) approves it.  Patients often cannot event get in to their primary care provider for weeks so ERs and urgent cares will be inundated for this and worse persons who have no insurance or are underinsured will likely not even go to be seen and tested.  Then today Pence assures us that private insurance and Medicare will cover tests.  In a potential public health  emergency the government should be providing and administering the tests for free to anyone.  No discussion of insurance, incomes, or immigration status.  Quickly train public health care workers at all local public health care departments to screen and administer the tests (government needs to fund this of course).  Trump should just keep his mouth shut about issues he is ignorant of especially in this situation.  Wasn't he saying just two weeks ago infections in this country were few and burning out and there would be none very shortly? Then vaccines and a complete misreading of the WHO regarding fatality rates.  Ugh."

You could also wear dress gloves which would take a conscious effort to scratch your nose.  
 Push open doors with your elbows for your safety and for the safety of others.
 Rubber gloves also will be helpful. If you're going to wash often it would make sense to wash rubber gloves you are wearing than wash your skin an unlimited number of times a day.

I heard this advice reiterated on Amanpour & Co by Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University who is fresh out of quarantine after traveling to China, where he was studying the coronavirus outbreak.

My question therefore is what about the surfaces of millions of products being unpacked by consumers who buy them from retailers, who in turn source them from factories overseas? Surely a small but deadly proportion of these may have passed through infected environments overseas. Doesn’t covid19, which as a virus is not a living organism, survive inside packaging and surfaces being shipped around the world?"

Of course it is possible that they are just doing a super job of containment. Or that they are not testing, or not reporting. I wonder which."

Even though you would have thought that the catastrophes of Black Death, the Spanish Fly, HIV, and Ebola would be etched on peoples' minds - complacency has had the upper hand. 

The problem with contagions like these is that halfway measures may leave the impression that ""at least something is being done"" but that's like saying leaping off of a ten-story building is ten times safer than leaping off of a 100 story building. Not really. Halfway is, in actual fact, mathematically far less than half of what an optimal, responsible solution would have yielded.

Those in a position to allocate the money and other resources to maximize the response: 1) have made little in the way of advance preparations, and 2) hesitate when confronted by an actual crisis. Both are literally proving fatal.

You don't fight fire with the garden hose. You call in the Fire Department and extinguish the blaze forthwith. Take a look. That's not being done.

Day-by-day the projected losses keep escalating and the failure to spend billions now on a coordinated global response will undoubtedly cost trillions in the near future. Trillions in lost income, productivity, and economic development.

2020-03-05 16:38,"I think this Coronavirus outbreak highlights how helpless we can be in the face of an outbreak like this. Governments are struggling to contain it, regardless of their economic or governmental system.

I also believe this highlights the importance of preventative care vs. curative care. A lot of people don’t care for their bodies or minds enough and only care when they are actually sick. The US healthcare system, education system, and lack of access to proper nutrition as a whole supports this way of living, as so many people can’t afford to shop healthy and can only eat lower quality fast foods. Visits to the hospital are exorbitantly expensive and many people can’t afford it.

If people, and the government, emphasized preventative care and holistic living, the population as a whole would be much healthier. This means healthy eating, exercise, and mindfulness activities. Unfortunately, this is too “new age” for many people, and more importantly, it keeps people healthy, so hospitals can’t make money. 

Moral of the story: if we valued preventative care in all aspects of American society, the Coronavirus outbreak would be much less intimidating."

I suspect that as for now population wide screening will show that in every country a certain % of the population are corona virus carriers. Very informative in this regard are 2 recent medical articles in The Atlantic 1. You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus Most cases are not life-threatening, which is also what makes the virus a historic challenge to contain.JAMES HAMBLIN FEBRUARY 24,. Professor Lipsitch a Harvard epidemiologist says that with in the coming year, some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus ,and It’s likely that many will have mild disease, or may be asymptomatic.

But under Republican pressure, refused to fund free drugs, masks, and medical care. Nothing is unbelievable from these greedy barbarians.

The agency created to deal with epidemics was abolished by Trump, who now blames Democrats and the media, with no rebukes from his party.

2020-03-05 16:27,"I have just left Disneyland today, March 5th, I arrived on Monday, the 2nd meeting up with a group of 8 children and 6 adults.
 
I was shocked to see absolutely nothing about precautions to take to reduce the spread of illness. There is no signage to remind people to wash their hands, there are no extra hand sanitizer stations, nothing to remind people to not touch their faces, cover coughs, etc., no mention AT ALL about a public health emergency; you would never know there was a virulent, very nasty and potentially deadly illness rapidly spreading worldwide.

Clearly Disney doesn’t want people to have to think about such things on vacation at the “happiest place on earth”, understandable, but totally irresponsible given the current situation with COVID-19

I asked why there were no reminders of the precautions we have all been told we can take to help prevent the spread of a very nasty and potentially deadly virus, I was told that my concern would be taken into consideration. 

Public health. Disneyland is FULL of the public, the global public. People and families that fly in from all over the world and then stand in close proximity to each other while waiting in lines come there to have the times of their lives so it would seem Disney might want to help protect them.

You can’t ignore a state of emergency."

It is completely irrational.

This widespread panic would make a bit more sense (just a bit) if Covid-19 was ALREADY infecting 160,000 and killing 160 Americans every single day. Yes, I mean daily. Ironically, those seemingly apocalyptic numbers are already happening, except it's the seasonal flu doing it. It happens every year (if it's mild) and no one bats an eye about it. 

Yes, this is just the beginning of Covid. Yes, it could get worse and it surely will. But even in China, where arguably the worst has passed, they had 80,000 infections and 3,000 deaths in two months. That is, we would all agree, just a blip compared to the roughly 50 million infections and 50,000 deaths China gets on that same period from the seasonal flu. 

Americans should get a grip. We can't be this frightened when the toll is this low. Otherwise, when The One pandemic finally comes (and it will come), when the mortality rate hovers around 10% (like SARS) or 30% (like MERS) and doesn't spare children (unlike COVID), then we will be so paralyzed with fear our society as a whole won't be able to survive."
2020-03-05 16:39,"The world's population of wild animals, fish and birds has fallen by a third and some species disappearing altogether because mankind continues to live beyond its means.

It said with lot of truth that humans are consuming about 25 per cent more natural resources than the Earth can replace.
James Leape, WWF director general, was brutally frank while observing  'No one can escape the impact because reduced global diversity translates into fewer new medicines, greater vulnerability to natural disasters and greater effects from global warming.'

Modern Human bears a over whelming direct responsibility for the cause of new pandemics and it will food hardy to expect Corona like out breaks is one off occurrence.

2020-03-05 16:49,"I am worried, pretty much about everything.

No, it's not the coronavirus.   No, what worries me is the effect, perhaps longterm, that the virus, or rather our panic over it, will have on human relationships.  At a time when the internet, smartphones, social media and ideological polarization have already taken its toll on the way we behave with one another, now it's only going to get worse.

Take France.  The French minister of health just issued a formal edict banishing 'le Bise', the near-hallowed institution of greeting one another with a kiss to both cheeks.  And when COVID-19 is quashed, squashed and otherwise relegated to a bad memory, will le Bise return as a practice?  

If history is any guide, it won't.  Once society moves on from one thing, and becomes accustomed to another, that's it.  We managed to say fare-thee-well to alot of things that way---seeing people off directly at the gate at airports, manners, dressing up, three-martini lunches, dessert.

In a larger sense, I do wonder what kind of chill is being put on romance as fear of human contact grows during the virus.  Real, honest-to-goodness sexual intercourse has already taken a hit with the rise of internet pornography, and gosh knows that romance is practically---or maybe already is---a dying art form, much like singing 'By The Light Of The Silvery Moon' to your sweetheart while sitting on a tete-a-tete loveseat, a chaperone, ever watchful, observing from nearby.

Is this the death knell of intimacy?"

The Covid circus is media hype to a sickening degree. That is the virus that seems to be making us ill, by fragmenting our society through fear and intimidation."
2020-03-05 17:28,"The plain fact is that America was caught utterly flat-footed due to this administrations' war on government and science.

Some of the biggest cuts have come from infectious disease prevention.  For example:
Emerging and Zoonotic Infections (-$64.9 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for Emerging and Zoonotic Infections by $64.9 million.

FOX News is repeating Trump's lie that the ""CDC has more money now than it's ever had before.""  The NY Times and other reputable news sources need to tell the true story of how we got here so we don't make the same mistake again.

Despite having the second-largest outbreak after China, they have the lowest reported death rate (35 deaths out of 6088 infected, or 0.6% as of 3/5/20).  They attribute this to rigorous testing (over 140,000 tests done so far).  This not only identifies sick people early so that they can get appropriate care before a viral pneumonia can intensify, but it allows mild or asymptomatic cases to be aware of their status and not spread the illness further.  The US never does a good job at learning from other nations' approaches, but this is a model we need to follow."

Congress should be passing immediate legislation mandating fines against price-gouging creeps profiteering off an epidemic. And outfits like Amazon providing a platform for third-party price-gouging vendors should likewise be fined. And all the fines for all offenders should exceed the profits they took in, so it amounts to a real punishment and a deterrent."

“The federal guidance is, like, if a physician wants a test, he can order it,” Shirley said. “We do not have that capacity right now. We’re hoping to get more tests.”

It is very simple but sad that American health responders are trained to look at the dollar cost first and then make decisions. Among all developed countries, America is probably the least prepared with a health care system which excludes many and where extra costs such as corona tests are not included.

Canada has no community spread and the country has not banned flights to and from other affected countries.Our response to the new corona is led by public health persons-not politicians. We also may get corona tests free-if needed- as part of our healthcare packages across Canada. 

It is just normal scientific  sense for Canada to put public health persons in the front line instead of politicians.

They are reporting fewer new cases than at any time since they started reporting on the virus in January.  What they are doing is draconian but it may be saving millions of lives.  IMHO, when millions of lives are at stake, draconian action is warranted.  Every country should be taking the extreme measures that China is taking.  In the United States, that will require far more than the $8 billion that congress has passed."

Some people will take stringent precautions and others will just stay at home, with little or no protection for family members, visitors or anyone else they may come in contact with.  

Unless detailed instructions and absolute restrictions are laid out for people who test positive and are told to self-quarantine at home, and those restrictions are monitored, it's a ridiculous method for trying to contain the spread of coronavirus."

During his time there, patients saw massive price increases on drugs treating diabetes, osteoporosis, attention deficit disorder and heart disease.  Lawyer Azar was paid millions by Eli Lilly for getting this cost gouging done.  His work as a pharmaceutical lobbyist was a major reason that Trump picked Azar to head the HHS.

Last week, Azar went before Congress and them that he “can’t control” the price of any potential coronavirus vaccines or treatments.  He further stated that he can’t guarantee that vaccines will be affordable for every American.  He said we need to count on “the private sector to invest.” 



The WSJ is reporting that the White House is considering paying hospitals and doctors to cover patients who can’t afford visits.   

Is Alex Azar, as HHS Secretary doing everything he can to protect the public from the effects of COVID-19, or is just looking out for the pharmaceutical company interests that he profits from?   The answer is obvious.

I will not go out. I will not let anyone in. If I haven't got Corona this very minute it is highly unlikely that I will get it. I will wait until things are a bit more under control. You will see my comments here more often. I got a lot of free time now...

2020-03-05 20:44,"The “right kind” of people need to embrace Donald Trump’s message: that this is all going to blow over and everything will be normal very soon, especially when the “new vaccine” makes its debut shortly. 

After all, only experts (it seems) can explain the difference between the S and the L type mutations (the later being more contagious and deadlier variant more prevalent in the United States) of the virus through properly explaining Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Can Trump understand SNP? Can he explain it? Does he know what it is? Can he even spell it? No, no, no and no. In the decades long education of a virologists or epidemiologists this will be covered in week one. When did our dear leader get such a grasp of the science? He didn’t?!? He probably missed that day in school. So why not wing it? You know, for the sake of the markets, and the base (they’ll believe anything). 

To believe Trump in his pronouncements that a vaccine will be along shortly is as misguided as believing that you can make a baby in one month, if only you can go out and make nine women pregnant. 

So I would encourage the Trump believers to make their way to the Mega churches, to you know, pray over speeding up the vaccine (if they’re inclined to “believe” in vaccines). Meanwhile be sure to embrace your community with lots of handshakes, glad handling, and hatreds of those trying to make the president look bad with this (novel) virus “hoax”.

“It’s hugely beneficial for us to know that there is no difference in the incidence of viral respiratory transmission among healthcare providers wearing the two types of protection,” said Christine Nyquist, MD, MSPH, medical director of Infection Prevention and Control & Occupational Health at Children’s Hospital Colorado and site lead investigator.

Commenters under self-media articles (which most people read every day on wechat) have universally condemned the practice of wildlife consumption with indignation. Almost everyone I know is annoyed about those who consumed wildlife. There's a recent law banning wildlife for food. I truly hope the ban will be effective. I hope this extends to a ban on wildlife for medicine too, and as a responsible citizen, I'll try to make my voice heard by posting my view and reposting similar ones on Chinese social media. 

As a Chinese overseas, I am also concerned about the overgeneralized perception of such practices: under many media articles I've seen demonizing, obviously untrue comments like ""'The Chinese' (in general) eat everything/rats/bats"" or ""they all have unsanitary practices"", which has been hurtful. Most people don't eat wildlife!! It's a country with a huge population, with its bunch of irresponsible folks, undeniably, perhaps just like what antivaxxers are for you guys.

While both the flu and COVID-19 may be transmitted in similar ways (see the Similarities section above), there is also a possible difference: COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near.

Also, based on the numbers, if even a small percentage of the population is infected with coronavirus (COVID-19), it will mean that most ICU beds in US hospitals are occupied. It really doesn’t leave room for others. Do the math, our healthcare system is not equipped to handle a major national health emergency. 

This is when you follow advice from scientists and medical professionals to limit exposure for you and your family, practice social distancing, good personal hygiene and have enough food, paper goods and disinfectant to last at least two weeks. Eat healthy and take supplements to strengthen your immune system. The “million tests” for the coronavirus should be available by tomorrow (?), and even if those test kits were available, can your state handle more than maybe a hundred on any given day? I live in Oregon and received notice from OHA that, due to volume of tests, results would be available tomorrow.

Again, as citizens we need to protect ourselves and families. The most vulnerable among us are the elderly who seem to have a much higher fatality rate. I would like to see some private companies like Amazon, Costco, and  others make home delivery of groceries and essentials more readily available for those age 60 ."
2020-03-06 10:05,"Fear not, the Space Force will surely save us all."
2020-03-05 17:42,Not just nursing homes. There are many elderly  and disabled living in independent senior communities and assisted living communities. We need to be vigilant about helping those who are most vulnerable.
2020-03-05 17:49,"Inspections of nursing homes has been lacking at State and Federal level. Reason of course is that the for profit nursing homes have lobbyists and make large donations to the elected officials. Even when inspections show serious or repeated violations,  they often succeed in having penalties mitigated . Nursing home workers are often minimum wage workers while the administrators are well paid. As more and more people reach advanced age and need nursing home care,  it will be important that ti.ely and honest inspections are made to make sure residents receive the quality of care they deserve and pay for. Medicare and Medicsid pay for many and they must do better job of I specting and enforcing rules"
2020-03-05 17:50,"I have several close relatives who have worked in nursing homes.
They all  left the profession primarily from exhaustion from understaffing.   They were CNAs,  social workers and  LVNs.

Most of the staff are CNA workers paid minimum wages and are overworked.  Cynical doesn’t come close to describing them.

Regulations and oversight are not strong.   Greedy owners cut corners because they can."
2020-03-05 18:07,"Would like to know how many other patients have died from the flu since January at Lifecare Kirkland, or what the average flu deaths are at nursing homes in general.   Some context would be helpful."
2020-03-05 18:08,"The nursing homes are one of the problems.  Homeless populations will be in the headlines in a few weeks, and it won't be pretty. The control over them is almost non existent."
2020-03-05 18:27,"I have watched this deterioration of nursing homes for many years. The profit motive for investor owned homes is a real estate gold mine to them and a death threat to patients and staff. Health care workers do not have such lobbyists. It is interesting that the owners of Life Care Center did not respond to questions by Matt Richtel. And obviously missing is reporting from nurses, nurses aides, rehabilitation therapists and other employees is not reported at this time. Don' t they have a voice in this as they dodge the virus bullets? Or do they have voices that are not listened to because these corporate entities can choose not to hear because of the money talking so loudly in their portfolios. Well that is, until they or their loved ones get infected. But maybe their wealth protects them. Time to read the next article in the Times about how the rich do in times of pandemics."
2020-03-05 18:28,"The most serious problem at this time is that there is a severe shortage of testing kits. Without the ability to test those at risk and those with symptoms of the virus appropriate quarantine protocols will not be taken.

I strongly believe that Trump has sent out the order to stand down on preparing and distributing test kits because it keeps down the statistics of those infected.

I call upon the media to begin investigating why so few testing kits? We Americans deserve answers. Lives are at stake."
2020-03-05 18:35,"It is probably far above my pay grade to do anything about this or future pandemics, but ensuring a robust care system to respond is ALL our responsibility. It is times like this when we see how for-profit healthcare including assisted living fails us. That we have allowed the AL and skilled nursing industry to prevent even the kind of reasonable regulation necessary for basic patient safety in the name of ever bigger profits speaks volumes. Until state health authorities, the public and large payers with no profit motive (Medicare) require caregivers to provide sufficient staffing along with other scope of care rules, our loved ones and eventually we ourselves will be more vulnerable than we should be. In short, let’s train staff to wash hands properly, but let’s also make sure they have time to do it, too.

PS. My heart goes out to the staffers of LifeCare Kirkland who have no doubt run themselves ragged trying to care for patients with complex care needs in the face of an unknown, deadly illness, who have to follow what seems like dumb rules in who is tested (we haven’t had enough tests even of the sort-of variety) and who being few in number, have to try to deal with fear-gripped family and public blaming for what is ultimately a much larger, systemic failure. They aren’t paid enough."
2020-03-05 18:36,"Thirty years ago as a new doctor I was tasked to be our clinic's nursing home rounder.  One of the older docs smirked and said something like, ""You're it, bud, have fun!""

I told him the nursing homes were a mess, and he shrugged his shoulders and said nursing home patients got second-class care and that was way it always was and always will be.

He was right.

I quit that job not long after."
2020-03-05 19:11,"I don't have any suggestion for a solution, but I hope something can be done. Because of the chronic understaffing in so many of these facilities family has to stay involved in a daily basis to keep patients healthy and cared for - who knows what decrease in ability and cognition and health will have occurred in the surviving patients."
2020-03-05 19:13,"Interesting article.  However, the ACA actually measures readmissions from long-term care to hospitals, so it should discourage sending ill patients to the nursing homes.  I think your comments in this area should be reviewed."
2020-03-05 21:27,"The issue is not nursing homes specifically:

A primary issue is people living in densely packed conditions, the same conditions that created plagues thousands of years ago."
2020-03-05 17:54,The pay is low. The supervision is lacking. The lowest level employees are often immigrant women who don’t have the culture to speak up to their white bosses in the chain of command. These are run as ‘for-profit’ which means the biggest cost variable is payroll. Wage rate x number hours of labor. The residents don’t have the compunction to revolt because they are frail. It is really up to caring family members to band together with other families’ members of the residents to fight for their collective rights.
2020-03-05 18:08,"The situation with the most vulnerable and their caregivers is tragic. 

The President reassures the world that many patients are “recovering while going to work”.

When world leaders see the President lie again and again about an epidemic, how they they trust him with the health of their nations, their children...or themselves?

Along with all the rest, isn’t this what Putin wants?"
2020-03-06 1:16,"This concerns the ability to monitor the health and wellness of those under care.  if you are a family member or custodian of someone in quarantine or in a managed care facility, you may want to consider establishing a monitoring service.  Something as simple as a home monitoring or “baby cam” device can work wonders.  If a facility pushes back, which happens,  fight them on it."
2020-03-06 3:38,"I am a registered nurse. I've worked in hospitals and nursing homes in Connecticut.  In the hospitals, I've received hands-on training to don and doff PPE, however, in the nursing homes this was not the case.  Also, in these hospitals designated equipment was used for patients whose conditions warrant isolation.  In the nursing homes the same equipment, i.e. blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, mechanical lifts are used for all patients.  These items not disinfected in between residents as I had learned in the hospitals.  The infection control personnel at the nursing homes lacked the training I had received in the hospitals.  They were not amenable to my insistence that this was not proper practice."

All this, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and medicare pays $432 a day per person FOR ALL THIS.

Please tell me how it can be done better, how staffing problems can be solved and every elderly person can be given the quality of care they need, when our government values the care of SNF residents at $432 a day.  Staff work at these care facilities not for the wages (atrocious) or the caché (zilch) but because they have a heart for the elderly.  If you can do better, then step up."
2020-03-06 10:47,"One study indicated that more than 50% of nursing home residents are vitamin-D deficient which is very important for the immune system. Nursing home residents who spend a lot of time indoors and/or live in sunlight-poor locations (such as the Seattle area) should be given vitamin-D supplements to improve their immunity. I'm not saying vitamin-D cures the corona virus. But it is a well known fact that vitamin-D is extremely important for the immune system, which weakens with age.

They are a shameful part of our society which few want to even recognize.  They are, as a whole, dirty, run down and staffed by pretty much incompetent staff and led by profit driven administrators.  
As paramedics, one of the first things we do early on in our careers is when in an elevator in a nursing home, we look at each other and say, 'if I ever end up in one of these, you know what you need to do if I'm unable to'.  I understand they are probably a necessity for those unable or unwilling to be cared for by family and that may have no one, but there must be a better approach.  
Most lay day in and day out vegetating literally, often abused physically or neglectfully by underpaid and poorly supervised staff.  
We all need to be better informed in end of life care, advanced directives and better care for our loved ones."
2020-03-06 10:51,"The question remains how to limit transmitta, if we can.  Decent ventilation in spaces where many people gather.  Good hygiene -- put a washcloth doused with alcohol and Clorox in your purse... in fact put to (different colors)-- one to wipe down surfaces  -- and wash daily.  Hands away from face.  Wear a hat with netting over the face.  Wear gloves... cotton, wash em.  We have relatively clean air compared to China so our lungs may be healthier.  Get enough sleep, eat properly, keep up exercise but NOT at the gym.. most of us will be fine.  Why are we panicking?"
2020-03-04 18:18,"This is not just about the coronavirus.  Controlling the movement of its people is a standard practice of totalitarian communist states.  During my life time, during the Great Leap forward, folks in China were not permitted to leave their assigned villages.  To do so meant arrest as a class enemy and ""wrecker.""  Many tens  of millions were thus kept under house arrest as whole communities unnecessarily starved to death due to Mao's ""plans.""  45 Million died.

Hopefully someone remembers this as the ""blue"" walls go up and drones patrol the streets with facial recognition technology and a loudspeaker to control its population."
2020-03-04 18:31,"China seems to be using the Covid-19 virus to further clamp down on their citizens, to further restrict liberty and any sense of freedom.  This is what their populace, even in the face of historic, global economic prosperity, has to contend with.
The global supply chain will not suffer the effects of the Covid-19 epi/pandemic to anything near the degree of suffering the Chinese people will experience."
2020-03-04 18:39,"The most important comment in this article is the effect the 'closure' of China will have on it's ability to service its debt. A credit induced boom works until one day it does not. Because the communists can print money, some say they cannot have a credit crash. I do not believe that. Early in their history, they issued the first paper money to pay their soldiers. On the day the soldiers ceased to believe in the money, it became worthless and the government fell to someone else who promised the ""mandate of heaven""."
2020-03-04 18:40,"To their credit, it worked and Chinese virus infections have been steadily going down. I just don't know if lesser measures would work.

What a strange take on events:
I cannot imagine an article on Italy in the Western press that begins “It was only in the second half of the nineteenth century that Italy was finally and painfully gathered into the present fractious nation from it’s disparate regions, and now, the state is again separating its parts ....” based on the fact that towns are being put into lockdown because of the corona virus.
Yet China, which has been a nation state for over two thousand years, and which has held all its present territories since the 18th century, (longer than the period during which the US has possessed its present territories), is constantly portrayed in this way.
What I detect is yet another politically motivated article."
2020-03-04 18:41,Translation of the Chinese characters on the blue barriers would add to this article.
2020-03-04 19:10,Italy is also locking down its towns. Strange I can't see any articles accusing Italy of separating their country and inhumanly treating their people.
2020-03-04 19:12,"As far as I know, almost NO ONE in China disagrees with this kind of isolation. The only complaint is WHY the government didn't take this effect sooner- to reduce the spread of Coronavirus. Can you imagine the infected cases for the whole country, outside the Hubei province where the virus began, are reduced below 10 these days? Considering the 1.4 billion people there and the high inflection rate of this virus, this was an astounding achievement and was absolutely benefited by these strick isolation effects.

BTW,  the great wall indeed had a clear effect to defend the nomads in the ancient period."
2020-03-04 18:54,"Dear New York Times,

A few weeks back, a NYT article asked us to see how the virus spread can be stopped by the “totalitarian” way (China) or the “democratic” way (South Korea).  Unfortunately, the numbers now are not so good for the NYT writer.  All sick and death wherever are tragic.  We shall not take this tragic event to advance a political agenda. Demonizing China and the Chinese people in this difficult time are not helpful to the fight stopping COVID-19.  The virus doesn't care ideology, religion, races, rich or poor."
2020-03-04 19:30,So when will the August Leaders of the Democrat Party vociferously complain about the Chinese putting up all of these walls? I’m waiting...
2020-03-04 20:14,"Completely false and misleading.

Almost all of the quarantine are organized by neighborhood committees, which are grass-root organizations managed by people living in these neighborhoods. These quarantine measures enjoy overwhelming public support. All over China, the epidemic is seen as a unifying moment where all of China unite to support Hubei and prevent further spread.

As of today (3/4), there are fewer than 10 cases in all of China except Hubei. The measures worked."
2020-03-04 20:24,"This looks more like a personal opinion of the reporter than the opinion of the general public in China. All the Chinese people I know of are extremely proud and supportive of the measures taken by their neighborhoods/communities. 
This is the measure that has to be taken in a global epidemic like this. Would you suggest an alternative of the ""Blue Great Walls""? Do we really want 1.3 billion people out and about on the streets and traveling overseas?
This is not the time to bash the Chinese to make the US government look good."
2020-03-04 21:57,"All of these unnecessary suffering, loss and deaths are simply because of the eating habit of one country -- China! 
Now that coronavirus is spreading like wildfire in the U.S, the very same people are hoarding daily supplies, food, water and safety supplies. 
I am angry beyond words!"
2020-03-04 22:23,"A question for the reporters:
I have read that China has told everyone to return to work. Are they moving too quickly?  Couldn’t this cause a second wave of transmission?"
2020-03-04 22:27,"There seems to be little rational thought behind the placements of the barriers. 
Dividing a large city into sections presumes that some sections have the virus and others do not. If a person in a section becomes ill from the virus do they live or die within their section or are they transported to a hospital?
The Chinese  growth myth seems to be just that a myth and the numbers of ill and dead are not to be believed.
But the Chinese people seem to be long suffering until things reach a boiling point and then explode."
2020-03-04 23:01,"If this extreme measure helped to control the outbreak, why not? Just look at the result. The outbreak in China is under control.
Can we set politics aside for a while?"
2020-03-05 0:05,"Hopefully a great wall will appear between humans and viruses. Let’s learn the lesson and reduce the selling and eating of wildlife. Potatoes, onions, banana peppers, instead of cats, pigs, chickens, and others risky meats. Why be exposed to a virus when you can enjoy rice, potatoes, and vegetables with maybe a little something else? CovID-19 favors smokers. Everyone needs to go on a health kick. Bat viruses attack humans, attack the economy, and attack wages. Let’s fight back. Find new jobs for traders. Help China become known for its green terraces of food."

2020-03-04 22:24,"In the beginning, we criticize China for not disclosing the truth about the virus. We then criticize China for violation of human rights for locking down the city of Wuhan. We were laughing at the Chinese for not having a health care system to handle the crisis.
Look at ourselves in the mirror. Today, our death toll has risen to 11. Yet, we have 135 infected. Really? That means our mortality rate is higher than 8%. Do you believe our government? I don't.
.....I know why. We don't have the test kits. Our government told us not to use face masks. Honestly, I can't buy them anyway. I can't even buy hand sanitizers or even rubbing alcohol. Look at China, they built 2 hospitals in a week. What has the US government done to prepare for this outbreak? We are charging the cruise folks for flying them. We are charging people $1500 for doing the testing."

I’m in Wuhan, have lived here part of the last 10 years, and am still under restrictive quarantine for > a month. I can assure anyone reading this that discerning what Chinese people think about almost anything takes years of knowing them and establishing a very close relationship...and they still will not tell you what they think about any topic that touches political considerations.  So, please, stop imagining what Chinese people think.

This is a remarkably complex time in China with far reaching implications for both near term and extended future considerations.  The article is filler material. It doesn’t mean or explain anything that actually matters regarding China or the quarantine.  Move along folks, nothing to see here."

Even if they transfer deadly virus from animal to man and kill 50 million people worldwide.
The US does not have it any better. The US ultra-rich folks fund think tanks at major universities, come up with legal strategies like Citizens United, buy lawyers to prosecute the lawsuit, and end up with a Supreme Court ruling that allows unlimited money in elections. So the US Congress is now ineffective because it is essentially bribed. US Ultra-rich people have gotten the taxes cut to recoup their investment in buying Congress and the President. US companies (Archer Daniels, Louis-Dreyfus, etc) are funding the burning of the Brazilian rain forests to install ranches, while fracking the heck out of the US under big tax breaks, ruining our weather.

1. The most important is our reliance for basic necessities on ONE country that is in deed and in spirit, our ADVERSARY. I have been troubled by this for several years and I am hopeful that more people are awakening to this essential fact. If manufacturing must be outsourced to countries with cheaper labor, why not spread it across multiple countries? Why not insist on labor and environmental standards? To the extent that this was not done, the whole globalization regime was about PURE GREED. Unfortunately, as always, the rich -- the ones who caused this debacle -- are well-protected. It is the rest of us who will pay the price.

2. Globalization has devastated labor at all levels in Western countries -- from high-value IT to low-value manufacturing and everything in between. It was never good for workers in the West. Globalization has decimated individuals, families, and communities. It has destroyed our base of talent and innovation. It has robbed our people of hope and agency.

The day our companies limit their exposure to China and start upholding liberal values about human dignity and labor, respect for the environment and animals is the day our world will start on a process of healing."

Education is the one thing that cannot be taken away from you.  
Education allows you to adapt to a changing world, a world where automation will be cheaper than labor costs.  Because automation reduces variation and increases throughput, manual tasks will be given over to robots.  
Education has been shown to be more effective in reducing radicalization than eliminating poverty from that same group.
Education is the one thing that people complain about when they get there money's worth.

1. Overpopulation. Our planet, as is clearly evident from climate change and its ensuing impacts, can NOT support 7 billion humans and growing. While we've beaten the impacts of drought and crop failure that often led to famine, it's been at a tremendous cost by overstraining the eco-system.
2. Mass production and global trade in food and agriculture products. Our industrial agriculture system has lead to the greater transmission of food based ills such as listeria, animal borne diseases, etc. can be directly linked to huge growth in the global food chain.

Overpopulation far outweighs food borne disease (and all other ills due to globalization outlined by Mr Goodman), yet these two combined need to be seriously checked if we're going to progress forward - or wither as a species."
2020-03-05 13:28,"Globalization has really been a new form of colonization. In the old days colonization was done to protect the economic interests of the colonial power. Trade was the key that opened to the eventual colonization of India. The same happened all around the world. All western European countries became colonial power, except Finland which is the only western  European one itself  colonized by Sweden and Russia. After WWII, maintaining political control over other countries became unsustainable. Globalization became the new form of economic dominance. Walmart can get its shirts made for a  paltry sum in Bangladesh, Nike gets its sneakers made in Indonesia for a few bucks that fetch hundreds of dollars, and Apple gets its iPhone, iPad and Macbook in factories in China that run in ways possible in China. The high priests of economics coined the tern ""labor arbitrage"" to justify the exploitation of labor in these countries, just as the colonial masters did blatantly. If Trump hates globalization, so do the leftist leaders in countries lime India. To be honest, I buy at Walmart, but the couple dollars that I save isn't worth the concomitant results. Actually, I have no choice. All clothes sold by upscale shops also are made in the same sweatshops in Bangladesh, Vietnam or El Savador.

Globalization is primarily responsible for the raising of living standards all over the world.  It spreads democracy.  It allows for entrepreneurship to flourish.  (Inequality is a product of unfair taxation and labor exploitation).  Globalozation suppresses international violence as you don't go to war with your trading partners.

The solution to eliminating diseases from infectious agents is vaccination.  We have rid the world of many terrible illnesses through the application of vaccines.  Guess what?  The way vaccines eliminate transmissible diseases is through globalization.  They have to used everywhere.

2020-03-05 13:51,"What the coronavirus has done is to highlight two major risks to our economy.

The first is the ""just in time"" lean manufacturing systems, so any disruption causes a halt in production. This is compounded by reliance on a single source of supply. In engineering terms, this results in a ""single point of failure risk"" - there is no redundancy to fall back on.

The second is that the economy is based solely on the consumer. Granted that the refrigerator not bought today may well be purchased in October, the trip not taken and the restaurant meal not eaten in March will never be replaced. So we will see a decline in economic activity that will not be fully made up for.

And by the way the spread of the disease was not caused by immigration, but by tourism."
2020-03-05 13:53,"What happened to the PSAs from my childhood encouraging the pu chase of American made goods?  Well, the companies moved manufacturing overseas for cheaper labor and the unions are decimated so no one ever makes this argument anyone but I still try my best to buy products made in the US even if a bit more expensive.  

Cars and other large, expensive items are one thing but for small consumer and household items there is no reason a country as huge as the US can’t manufacture more domestically.  It’s simple:  corporations will make a small amount less in profits for their investors and consumers will pay a small amount more for goods (and maybe throw fewer items in the trash heaps).  

This would also significantly decrease the environmental damage caused by shipping tons of cheap disposable plastic goods all the way from China to the US."

2020-03-05 13:55,"The operative phrase in this piece is,""the supremacy of shareholder interests"". Throughout history trade between nations meant that each country had its own goods to grow, mine or make for export trade. Modern globalization has shifted the grow and make to the area of lowest cost and therefore greater profit. When pharmaceuticals were made in the US, the cost of production was a mere 7 cents of the total. The rest of the dollar was spent on marketing, research, executive perks and shareholder returns. In order to reduce the 7 cents cost, American pharmaceutical companies moved their production to low cost countries, especially China, India and Ireland. Magnify this model across all manufacturing industries from air conditioners to automobiles to electronics and you leave 20 million workers behind. Guess for whom they will vote? A person who will promise a return of jobs, not a return on investment. The backlash against Globalization in American and Europe is too long overdue."

I agree wholeheartedly that the way globalization has been left largely unchecked and has caused severe social, environmental and economic problems worldwide. But that is capitalism left to its own devices. The nature of capitalism is to seek greater profits and growth. It is amoral as to how to do so. That is the job of governments to have guardrails that will ensure that economic growth is done in an ethical, equitable way. How to ensure that we have governments that will do so is another matter.

“But if some are inclined to use the coronavirus as an opportunity to write globalization’s obituary, others say that misses the point of an outbreak born in a global manufacturing hub, propelled by modern air travel and spread by the irrepressible human impulse to move around.

“This is just an indication that globalization is what it is,” said Maria Demertzis, an economist and deputy director at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. “People will always want to travel.

From Apple phones to bird seed too many companies have over-weighted their needs to  a small group of suppliers and geographies.   Leaving security concerns and intellectual property concerns to the side, it seems grossly irresponsible for a company like Apple to become so totally tied to China.  In this outbreak of coronavirus China is as much a victim, only tragically more so, as  Apple. However, Apple's management and Directors put themselves in an exposed position. Why? Clearly it was down to profits. That chase to profits blinded the company as to risk. Not a totally sound way to conduct business. Next time the threat may not be disease but something more man made! I don't solely mean to single out Apple and China as I'm sure many other companies have irrational exposures in other countries.

2020-03-05 14:43,"“Globalization” has many meanings and many implications. Like the term “elite,” “globalization” has lately been so overused that is has become almost meaningless, and consequently can be bent to serve almost any political goal.

For example, “globalization” can refer, variously, to factory locations; manufacturing supply chains; capital flows; financial hubs; consumer markets; communication networks; trade agreements; security pacts; immigration patterns; human rights; environmental policies; scientific research; and, yes, public health. 

Perhaps it is useful to think of the world as an airplane on which we are, all of us, traveling together. We breath the same recirculated air, eat the same limited supply of food, use the same few lavatories, and the plane has a finite fuel supply. We cannot get off the plane. The curtains that separate first class from business class from economy do not prevent the flow of recirculated air between classes. 

Like the airplane, the world is small. The world is a contained space. Like it or not, we are, all of us, living in this same contained space together.

But this corporate colonialism isn't sustainable.  We, and these corporations, are living beyond our means and beyond the earth's resources. In addition, rich nations and their most high-profile wealthy have set an example that poorer nations and their populations want to emulate, and they will pursue that goal by any means necessary, including the destruction of wildlife and their habitats that impact the earth's ability to sustain life as we know it.
What may be helpful is a sustainable balance to our lifestyles that includes more regionalization in all areas of commerce, including agriculture and manufacturing. It will mean a new business model that's not driven exclusively by profit margin - and the legislation to support it."

2020-03-05 14:50,"We can mitigate globalization in one of two ways.

Increasing inventories is one. However, the solution is only temporary. Businesses ignore the cost and risk of a long term disaster. Wall Street implicitly assumes governments are not only willing but capable of restoring normalcy in the invent of an emergency. The current coronavirus with the current White House has once again disproven the assumption.

The other method is diversifying our supply chains. Moving a factory from China to Vietnam doesn't help. You would want a factory in both China and Vietnam. Preferably you would have another one in Bangladesh and Europe and the USA as well. If disaster strikes one place, you simply scale up production in another. However, you need to maintain all the factories simultaneously in order to prevent prolonged supply chain disruptions.

You can't just diversify your supply chain on the fly. Everyone else is going to be looking for a factory out side the disaster area at the same time as you. Priority is given to the businesses who were already doing business at the alternative location.

This presents a problem stockholder optimization model. That's the real problem here. Representing stockholders not only prioritizes just-in-time inventory. You're also pressured to reduce diversity (a.k.a redundancy) within your supply chain. Scale means larger margins. Diversity means more but smaller scales. Hence, lower margins. Stockholders will choose a single bulk source every time."

I can't stand Donald Trump. & I agree with Trump on NOTHING other than  regarding the imposition of tariffs on China,  while  tariffs should have been imposed on imports many decades ago. The United States failed to impose tariffs on the countries which imposed tariffs on goods that were manufactured in the United States. The imposition of  tariffs and trade restrictions on countries  which imposed tariffs and  trade restrictions on goods that are manufactured would not have constituted fair trade practices, not nationalism. 

The failure to institute fair trading  policies was unfair to those who manufactured in the United States, and resulted  in may manufactures moving their plants to China  and to other countries where workers are paid slave wages and are forced to work under inhumane and dangerous  conditions that  were made illegal the U.S. following the Triangle  Waistshirt Company fire,  in which hundreds of factory workers were killed .

The majority of American  manufactures moved their factories to China. The result was the dependency on China, which has resulted in the U.S. finding itself in the situation in which it finds itself today, in terms of Coronavirus .

The price of a product is fixed and known.  But risk in procuring a product varies and can only be estimated.

Supply chain managers therefore tend to buy from China or similar countries based on price, without estimating the risk.  They simply make assumptions about the security and stability of the supply chain.

This is changing.  They must now accurately factor in a range of risks from purchasing overseas, including disruptions such as the current viral outbreak.

They will mitigate the risk by buying insurance and/or increasing inventory and/or producing in less risky locations.  All of this adds cost.

Other countries from Sweden to Germany to the Netherlands to France to Vietnam to Japan to Canada to Costa Rica all depend on foreign trade (in goods and services including tourism) to maintain employment, income levels and consumption patterns. Only the US derives a minority share of income from interactions with other countries, and that minority share would shrink to virtual insignificance if arms sales to nasty foreign states like Saudi Arabia were pulled out of the mix. The US, unlike England or Australia or Canada does not depend on foreign food production nor (any more) on foreign oil. So the US can go all nativist, roil in populists and xenophobes, build walls, etc. but no one else can (or would want to). The openness, diversity and welcoming of immigrants and refugees have actually strengthened the EU and Canada, for example. Globalization must include the movement of people as well as goods and services. In contrast, closed societies like Japan have been seriously harmed, despite being globalized in other respects. Japanese-style decline won't happen in the US because unskilled labour and skilled immigrants will continue to pour into the country, despite anti-foreign sentiment. Hollywood, American universities, much of the agricultural and service sectors, and the IT industry would dry up and blow away without them.

It is also about having enough for our workforce to do, and get paid to do it.

Such arguments do not lend themselves to effective sound bites, so we end up talking about whether globalism and trade protectionism are good or bad and voting for one or against the other.

They are both good and bad, necessary and disruptive. As a sovereign nation, we have the right and obligation to adjust the mix in our own best interest.

With regard to speed, the ease which with the coronavirus spreads creates environmental conditions that exceed even the market's short-run fixation.

Warren Buffett states that he did not heavily invest in IT firms during the tech boom, which ended in 2000, because he refused to invest in any business that he does not acutely understand. Similarly, those nations that survive the coronavirus most robustly, may be those nations whose leaders and citizens are most prescient and acutely aware of the biology underlying this exponentially expanding virus. As a result, public health programs may be more vigorously honored by these citizens.

To ""bet the ranch"" on the quick, short-run development of a vaccine may be the  least disruptive national strategy, but it is very risky. And, in cost/benefit terms, such a bet may or may not pay off.

Of course, what that requires is more activist and engaged government and here is where reality runs head-on into the fanaticism of right wing ideology. The mantra of deregulation has created and/or exacerbated most of the problems related to globalization. In the US, globalization has been incredibly successful; what has not been successful is the abject failure of the US govt to regulate and mitigate its effects by adopting better social welfare policies and redistributing wealth. In the end, I'm not worried about the long-term prospects of globalization. I am worried about the right wing hysteria that has stymied so much of the progress and change that the world desperately needs."

They didn't count on the anger of those left behind in the industrialized world when jobs flew to third world countries and CEO and executive pay soared hundreds of fold. They didn't quite grasp the idea that someone needed to buy the products they were producing, and  while consumer goods became cheaper, the working and middle classes were having trouble even affording cheap tvs and the like, not to mention that bankrupting the working and middle classes killed off stores and other busineses in those communities. They crow about globalization has  taken a lot of people out of grinding poverty, but they also leave out it didn't put them  in the middle class either, it made impoverished people merely poor. 

The real problem is redundancy, companies have all kinds of contingency plans for data centers and workers working from home, the internet is redundant, but with supply chains they pretend it will do fine, is insulated, from disruptions. There is something also not being said, the same companies denying climate change and their role in it, with all this long distance shipping, are setting the seeds of their own destruction, because climate change is likely to cause more and more pandemics (the corona virus cannot be  traced  to climate  change directs, any more than  one weather  even can, but data is showing that  the risk is soaring as the climate changes)"

I heard this advice reiterated on Amanpour & Co by Dr. W.

My question therefore is what about the surfaces of millions of products being unpacked by consumers who buy them from retailers, who in turn source them from factories overseas? Surely a small but deadly proportion of these may have passed through infected environments overseas. Doesn’t covid19, which as a virus is not a living organism, survive inside packaging and surfaces being shipped around the world?"

2020-03-05 15:28,"Peter, thanks for article and Ian's ""Butterfly"" book, but there's variance:

Xi already has a ‘Great Wall’ — so it’s predictable that our own Emperor Trump will misuse this well researched article to argue (on Twitter of course) for not just a ‘Greater Great Wall’ but for the ‘Greatest Great Wall’ in this entire World — which ‘His Greaterness’ already thinks he is not just Emperor of America, but Emperor of the whole World.

However, Xi’s “acting like an Emperor” is already causing some of the progressive and True Men out of his administration to speak-out against the whole concept of Empire (and Emperors) — which maybe, just maybe, will start a peaceful people’s global “Political/economic & social(ist) Revolution Against Empire” either here, there, or everywhere, which is what ‘we people of the world’ really need now in this Globalized World for people to vote for ‘global democracy’ over Global Empire!

As Xu Zhiyong recently and bravely said in China and which Bernie is similarly shouting-out here:

“True Men” had come forward to defend it. Now, Xu Zhiyong was pointing out caustically to Mr. Xi:

 “How can you expect there to be a ‘True Man’ when you, The Revered One, sit at the pinnacle with millions fawning at the foot of your throne? Autocracy encourages sycophants to crowd around the Emperor, but this particular Emperor’s new clothes are on full display for all to see.

Free trade people in the US, both conservative and more liberal, sold the idea that globalization was going to float all boats, that jobs lost to cheap labor markets would be replaced  by better paying ones for goods those countries will buy.  The problem was that was nonsense, that companies sent jobs to cheap labor markets that in turn, bought very little outside natural resources from industrial countries. Economists and  people like Hillary Clinton were ""shocked"" at the impact China had, but they shouldn't be, they were assuming China would grow the way other countries did, but it didn't, it remained a capitalist autocracy, where labor has no voice, where the government and business are pretty much the same thing.

2020-03-05 17:52,"Globalization has greatly facilitated global population growth by reducing dependencies on local resource bases.  It has also made the livelihoods of billions of people dependent on the global trade of materials and services, far removed from providing for the mere essential needs.    

This global system evolved under relatively benign global climatic conditions favoring the rapid evolution of industrialized agricultural production.  And it developed and continues to grow out on an energy base of cheap fossil fuels.  These basics propping up the global economy are now seriously threatened by climate change.  Which leads to a very inconvenient question of just how resilient a global economy can be, particularly in chaotic situations.   Are we, as Loren Eiseley proposed, becoming one giant maladaptive organism, totally dominating the organic future of life on earth?  

And would the future of life on earth be better served by diversification and localization of economies that would better protect and sustain their local resource bases of support?  And not living in ignorance (or living with willful spite) of the devastating environmental, ecological and climatic impacts of their resource procurement half way around the world?

2020-03-05 17:11,"Okay, understood.

Here are a couple more fundamental Front-Lashes re globalization (not off topic, at a different scale, i.e., survival per pattern recognition in an evolutionary time scale.)

Code Fail
“The rule of thumb is that the complexity of the organism has to match the complexity of the environment at all scales in order to increase the likelihood of survival.”  Yaneer Bar-Yam, physicist, complexity scientist — Making Things Work

Due to exponentially accelerating complexity, our coding, our relationship infrastructure now violates the rule of thumb — at both the biological & cultural scales.

We're not coded — biologically or culturally — to process complex global relationship information with exponential dynamics.
We're coded for relationship interface with local environs, primarily in a short-term manner with incremental dynamics.

Our bio & cultural coding structures do not match, nor can they support, the unprecedented environs we've generated.

In addition, there's this — from Dr. Robert Trivers book, ""The Folly of Fools.""
Dr. Trivers is citing work by Randy Thornhill & C. L. Fincher.

“Regarding the evidence, there can be little doubt. Across the entire globe, religious and linguistic diversity map directly on parasite load, as does ethnic diversity — the higher the parasite pressure, the more religions, languages, and ethnic groups per unit area.”

Organic boundaries, & mistrust of ""the other"" carrying pathogens or weapons, is, in part, an immune response."
2020-03-05 17:14,It's ironic those on the left criticize opposition to open borders while the very liberal governor of California just prohibited a cruise ship from docking in SF bay.

Immigrants don't cause  viruses.
Walls wont prevent their spread.
Building American factories is not a cure.
Ecoystem destruction and exploitatin allows novel viruses, previosly locked down in niches,to emerge, mutate and spread.
That is simply a fact.
My god we are so profoundly ignorant of the interdependent and inextricable relationship betwen our planet and ourselved.
We remain so at our increasing and obvious  peril"
2020-03-05 18:26,"""People will always want to travel. They will always want to trade. The answer is not to again build walls. You need more cooperation and clear information.” 
 And how do you get cooperation and clear information from China? The Chinese play by their own rules and do not release information, this is a perfect example of why globalization will fail, because at the end of the day some cultures and values are just not compatible. 

And if you read the article below it's obvious that the Chinese in China do not support globalization either 

<a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3065235/backlash-china-over-draft-rule-permanent-residency-foreigners"" target=""_blank"">https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3065235/backlash-china-over-draft-rule-permanent-residency-foreigners</a>"
2020-03-05 12:50,"The annoying thing is many people believe we can go back to a time where we can isolate ourselves and don't have to worry about the outside the world. The fact the Spanish Flu spread around the world when travel was restricted to ships across the oceans shows you can't successfully isolate yourself from the world. Maybe if you're on a small self-sustained island, but not for the majority of countries. 

Sadly more and more people blame globalization as the root of many problems when that isn't the case. Lets look at lost manufacturing jobs as an example. Yes, some have been lost on trade, but automation was already eradicating jobs. In fact, automation is eradicating jobs overseas now, so it was inevitable. 

Yet people blame globalization. Sadly the world is buying into right wing populism how it's immigrants and trade's fault for their issues and how their ideal culture of 40 years ago is gone despite how time will always change things. People need to realize it's an interconnected world, and trade and agreements have stopped another world war."

The world has become extremely prosperous due to our global interconnectedness and nobody really wants to go back to a time when we had fewer choices and higher costs for goods, travel, jobs and labor. The west needs to get back in the right to prevent refugees and China needs to outlaw the trade and ingestion of wild animals. That's all."
2020-03-05 16:03,"I like Professor Goldin’s take on it.  As it has been practiced, globalization is “an under-regulated, complacent form of interconnection that has left communities vulnerable to a potent array of threats.”  I’m not an economist or a diplomat but I call this approach “Gung-Ho Globalization.”  It appears, to my untrained eyes, to consist mostly of a rush to offshore jobs and manufacturing to wherever it’s cheapest - all else be damned.  It doesn’t matter if the countries allow terrible pollution, unsafe work conditions, slave-wages, and child labor.  And it also makes a point of destroying anything that slows or inhibits the free flow of goods and wealth.  That means tearing down important health and safety measures in the name of market efficiencies.

So I am not against globalization per se.  But I do think we owe it to the World to slow it down and be much more careful about it.  Granted as I said before, I’m an architect; not an economist."

Perhaps the destruction of socio/economic structures of North America and Europe, and now perhaps the health of North America and Europe.

Don’t forget that nationalism brought us to the brink of nuclear holocaust. Seventy percent of viruses come from Asia. We need to help the Chinese regulate the wildlife trade. The international community has the right to protect the citizens of China, and citizens everywhere, from weak water, air, and health regulations. China needs an independent legal system that acts according to principal not political interests. We need the rule of law in China. China’s human rights lawyers should be leading China not the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP is an old authoritarian regime. President Xi Jinping himself predicted that the demise of the Party would be due to corruption. Without a functioning legal system, the Chinese people, and everyone,  will be vulnerable to the viruses that incubate in bats."

Rest of the world become realize you reliant too much on Google, Microsoft, Apple, Boeing... They will cut you of at the time you need, or threaten to cut you off to gain leverage on you. We can see from the case of Huawei, in order to stop the increase the popularity of Huawei, they are willing to cut off the supply of Google in order to decrease the competition of Apple, ban Huawei from some hypocritical excuses with zero evidence to support. The ""Chief of Justice"" suggest US government to control private European companies, and unite them to compete with Huawei. The ""Economic minister"" jump in to say, the ban will harm US national security as it will decrease US competitiveness if Huawei chooses to use other suppliers.

2020-03-05 12:46,"It’s not surprising that right wing extremists seek to use the Coronavirus to advance their goals. It’s what they do. One need only look at the outrageous politicization of the outbreak by the Trump regime. They are using it to further close the U.S. borders to trade and immigration. By selectively hiding the full extent of the advance of the virus here, the Trump regime also pretends it’s effectively not expanding.

The problem with this approach is the states are telling the truth. So, too, are the few remaining legitimate public health experts working for the federal government (when they aren’t prevented from speaking). 

In the end, the truth is leaking out, and the public has further reason to disbelieve the Trump regime, since their lying has destroyed their credibility. 

One can hope the incompetence and mendacity of the current U.S. government is revealing a lot to more Americans about the need for replacing them in November. 

It certainly does with me."

There are actual differences in culture and values which are commonly dismissed by the ""everyone is the same"" mantra and accusations of xenophobia.  No, we're not all the same.  China suppressed information about the virus for a month, strong-armed those who wanted to reveal the frightening information (which wouldn't be that easy anyway because their internet is so tightly controlled), lied about what was happening, refused WHO and CDC access to the hot zone, and allowed flights in and out for a month before admitting there was a problem.  It's possible that the deaths around the world could have been prevented as well as the financial and social dislocations, which will apparently be huge.  And this is after they have stolen intellectual property for decades only to be rewarded with entry to the WTO and access to global markets.  They are not like us, and neither are refugees and economic migrants from the Third World.  Syrians are nothing like Nebraskans.  These differences are real, absolute, and not relative.  I don't want to rely upon a mendacious, brutal regime like China, welcome sharia advocates to my neighborhood, or import mass poverty in the form of illiterate migrants with five kids.

Even a concert performance of an opera will undoubtedly have at least a piano run-through with the singers to set tempos, etc. before working with the orchestra.  You don't want to be stopping and starting for singer issues when you're paying top dollar (or francs in this case) for the orchestra's time.  So it seems highly unlikely that the Lucerne Symphony didn't already have a pianist who knew the score of Salome intimately and was already working with them on it.

I talked with some performers, shook hands with them, and so forth. The festival was a huge success, and I had a wonderful time. The only hiccup to this came when I learned of the coronavirus outbreak in Washington. You see, the festival was in Bellingham, Washington, and I spent two nights in Kirkland. Oh dear. Do I have the virus? Am I doomed? Should I lock myself at home and avoid everyone I know for two weeks or more? I called a health care center and they said it was highly unlikely I had anything. I was in Kirkland, but not even near the nursing home. I admit I went through some stages of worry, paranoia, and uncertainty. Two nights ago I woke up with a pain in my chest. Then I sat up, burped, and realized it was just gas. I'm healthy, no cough, headache, or pain, and I wash my hands. I've calmed down. This virus is going to run its course, and a lot of us are going to be in my situation of learning after the fact that it was near. However, I suggest we don't panic, we remain sensible.

As some people at a daycare centre in Osaka were infected, now the government is wondering if they should shut all daycare centres to limit the spread of the virus....and also they have approved money for workers who need to take off for their children.

2. But this is different to the calculated number, the number of deaths compared to all the people infected with coronavirus.  What's that now?
3. When I last looked, Italy had put half their cases (of testing positive) in hospital, and 9% of their cases in intensive care.  And I've noticed about half of people in intensive care die.  What are these numbers globally?
Also, other questions.  What is the evolving danger to men over women, or is it just a smoking effect in China? What are the chances of death for each sex if you have no health issues at each age?  At present, only age groups are given numbers, e.g. 1.3% for all people in their 50s.  And an article on how can people improve their health in a useful way to reduce their chances of dying, would be good.  I suggest you get a science person on this - maths and biology!"

We must get accurate data. Panic is being fueled by fears about the mortality rate, yet we keep hearing that many may have it and not even be symptomatic. We need to do mass testing to get real numbers and control fear. 

As to the fear...many are being scolded for that. Those who plan for pandemics must begin to understand this: The fear and pandemonium, the panic shopping, and hoarding are not (alas) incidental to the disease. They are its chief symptoms and they must be planned for as carefully as we plan for the morbidity and mortality rates. Those impulses, deeply rooted in Darwinian survival instincts, are hardwired so they must be accounted for. 

It was a foregone conclusion from the onset that markets would fall, the supplies would dwindle, that people would panic and hoard. It's called human nature. Plan for it. 

Strangely enough, last year I began a novel (yes, yet another post apocalyptic one) about a species-ending flu. I told my husband at the onset that one thing I wanted to focus on was the exquisite interconnection of all of our systems, of how the very impulse to create a global economy and world would be the real vector for contagion, and contagion of the mind and body.

The Globe and Mail yesterday reported on a Canadian in his 50's who travelled to Beijing around Jan 13, met there with bosses from Wuhan and died on Jan 23. He had fever and was throwing up for several days prior to death, but officials refuse to perform an autopsy or test his remains for Covid-19 virus. Seems the death rate in China may be higher than the 3.4% rate noted in this article. 

More troubling is the world's dependence on ingredients for and drugs from China and India, including antibiotics and other medications needed to fight Covid-19. Perhaps it is a mistake to be so dependent on a few lower cost suppliers. An international strategy is needed to ensure critical supplies in this battle."

2020-03-04 12:10,"The new mortality rates for Covid-19 cited by the WHO are alarming, given the scientific rationale: years of flu vaccine and ""flu shot"" campaigns have helped Americans in particular build up some sort of immunity.

Now we have a brand new virus, no vaccine, a worldwide panic, and a call from the world's major health organization not to hoard medical supplies.

Covid-19 will be as dangerous as the cultural responses and leadership of individual countries allows.  If people panic, spread inaccurate information, and disregard what the experts are advising, the impact will translate into more deaths.  

If ever there were a need for strong leadership and firm guidelines, it's now."
2020-03-04 12:13,"What this administration has done by past cuts to our public health system is unacceptable and dangerous. That said, how does the WHO know the worldwide mortality rate? How does it account for mild and asymptomatic cases? How does it account for its focus on severe and critically ill patients (understandable but does not help with calculating a denominator)?

I have no idea if the current calculations of mortality are correct, but suspect it is too high. Sometimes this is what happens when experts argue. This does not mean we should not be concerned about a virus that may more than double our problems with the usual flu season. Much still remains to be explained by an administration that has cut our public health system and made it more difficult for the CDC to operate."

That number seems to track closely to the total number of reported deaths divided by the total number of reported cases.  The mortality rate in Wuhan should be much higher, given the large number of unreported early cases there.  On the other hand, it was mentioned that the mortality rate outside of Wuhan was 0.7%--where the total number of reported cases may more closely track (but still lag) the total number of actual cases.  While mortality may be much higher in small community groups, where vulnerability may vary, it seems from the numbers that the more largely based average is not 3.4%."

2020-03-04 12:50,"At least in America at this time, the numbers will be suspect.  There is no advantage in paying to get yourself tested for coronavirus infection, as there is no modulation of treatment. Thus the pressure to avoid perceived gratuitous  use of the medical system in order to reduce costs comes home to roost.

Out of curiosity, I'm wondering if a person went to urgent care or the ER (or their personal physician) if that person could even find out what the cost was at the point of service.  This being America, I suspect not;  by the time one found out the cost, one would be either dead or recovered.   Just another reason to decline."
2020-03-04 12:55,"First of all, this number is greatly exaggerated because of the numbers in Hubei Province, and Wuhan the city in the epicenter in particular. At the early time, there were rushes on hospitals; many couldn't get treated. As a result, many treatable cases became severe and even critical, which led to abnormally high mortality rate in Wuhan and Hubei. And I cannot trust the numbers from Iran, either the confirmed cases or the deaths.

Examining the numbers in China outside of Hubei gives a much lower mortality rate, well below 1%. So unless we also experience a rush on the hospitals, I expect the mortality rate in the US to be much lower than the 3.4% number from WHO, more likely to be closer to 0.5%. This is of course still a high morality rate compared to seasonal flus."
2020-03-04 12:57,"The problem with calculating the mortality rate is that although the numerator (the number of Covid-19 deaths) is known, the denominator (the number of Covid-19 infections) is not.

If (hypothetically) 100% of all infected persons exhibit severe symptoms, the denominator is small.  If only 10% exhibit severe symptoms, the denominator is much larger.  And if the vast majority of infected persons show no symptoms (which is quite possible), the denominator is huge.

What we may have here, and we simply cannot know it at present, is a disease that infects a large number of persons, but only a small number are symptomatic; however for that group the disease is often fatal."
2020-03-04 13:00,"I was just thinking the our government, in order to be prepared for something like this,  should have had the resources to distribute to the population hand sanitizer and disinfect wipes which is an effective way to combat this. As of now there is no hand sanitizer to be found."
2020-03-04 13:00,"What I am missing is a cogent response from the American Hospital Association on its recommendations for local responses to a significant outbreak of COVID.  Their website has no indication that their planning is advanced:  Meaning: (a) Do they have plans for staffing when significant numbers of doctors or nurses are on their own quarantine?  (b) Is their supply chain robust to allow for enough personal protective equipment for all who need it?  

Where I used to work, the hospital has senior leadership physicians, including the CEO, who are infectious disease specialists, so one would expect them to have detailed contingency plans to share and reassure not only the public but their ""troops in the trenches"", meaning the doctors and nurses on staff.  Alas, it seems that there is a dearth of planning, other than rules for management of patients on precautions.  A weakness for all hospitals is the supply chain, because, under the LEAN corporate plan universally used, supplies are kept on site and in hospital central supply usually to handle ordinary demands for 7 to 14 days.  The system depends on national or regional companies (Cardinal, Medline, 3M etc) to do resupply on a ""just in time"" basis.  Same for medications.  If we have a major COVID outbreak, for the first time, we will test how robust the supply chain is.  For a doc in this forum to note a lack of supplies means that the corporate plans or supply chain failed.  You can't fight a war without ammo."
2020-03-04 13:05,"There seem to be a lot of people surprised by this. Yet I calculated this exact number days ago when it was announced that there were 85,000 reported cases and 2,900 deaths. It just basic math. The big question is the accuracy of the number, because of the likely under reporting of both related infections and related deaths."
2020-03-04 12:52,"It appears that it is much higher in the state of Washington since 9 have died out of 27 diagnosed (but there are undoubtedly many who have it but have not been diagnosed).  It  also now appears that the death rate among older people for this disease is much higher even than SARS was, much higher than even the 3.4% that the WHO is claiming.

I remember well all those opinion writers, including some who wrote for the Times, who minimized this disease, claiming we should be concerned with regular flu instead of this disease, claiming we should just wash our hands and not worry.

It is now only about 7 weeks since the WHO refused to declare an international emergency, proving again that the UN agency is corrupt since the WHO admitted that its refusal was to protect China from economic loss (an outrageous desertion from the claimed duty of the WHO).  The WHO later even created a purposely meaningless name for this China virus in order to try to protect China economically and politically."
2020-03-04 12:48,"China's virus count is going down.....because they reacted forcibly and immediately.    Strict measures helped.

But the Republicans, who are in charge, do little to push him."
2020-03-04 13:02,"Trump could have ""built a wall"" around this virus months ago by preparing with $$, and having systems and equipment ready. Instead he silences people, makes it partisan, calls it another hoax.

Trump ascribes to the old father authoritarian style from the 1950's, the kind that tells the children there is nothing to worry about as he drives the car off the road because he will never admit he shouldn't be driving.

2020-03-04 13:08,"Isn’t there significant evidence that China under-reported deaths?

Irrespective of actual threat, individuals in increasing numbers are behaving collectively---self-isolating, hoarding, retreating from being the good little consumers we are usually known to be and what our ever so important 'economy' needs to keep the machinery of capitalism running!

Purely anecdotal, of course, but a sampling of headlines from local newspapers across the land from Monday and over the weekend, plus my direct communications with friends and family members from all points on the American compass---areas that are far removed from any actual known cases of coronavirus----I have gleaned that people are in the early stages of what, depending on one's view, could ordinarily be called ""a run"".  (Let's not call it a panic quite yet).

They are taking sick days.  They are buying up weeks and weeks worth of the expected toilet paper, frozen vegetables, hand sanitizer.  They are staying in; no more going to the movies, out to dinner, attending sporting events.  Most telling:  They have cancelled flight reservations and vacations to Europe, Asia, even Florida, New York, L.A..  Hardly scientific, but two of my friends have stopped using ride-sharing services in the interim. Make of that what you will

Those that aren't panicky, are poised and ready to be.  One word about their workplaces, or even communities, well....

We'll have our war, won't we."

2020-03-04 13:20,Can I add: how death rates vary by age has been under-reported but is vital information.  The death rate for people over 65 is 25x the death rate for younger adults.  The death rate for children is virtually nil.  We should be very worried about the elderly and special protections should be made for them.
2020-03-04 13:21,"I have traveled every week this year starting in January when I returned from Italy.  34 flights since then.  This past weekend symptomatic.  I called and found the test is still not available here in lawrence kansas.  Until testing is available for anyone who could spread this, might be a carrier, it will continue.  It is now March 4.    We are very far behind on getting a handle on the scope."
2020-03-04 13:22,"Can we get clarification on the mortality rate?  The 3.4% figure is very surprising, and is not supported by other publicly released numbers I've seen.

The 3.4% seems roughy to correspond to the number of deaths per diagnosed cases, but this is not the same as the mortality rate.  That would be the number of deaths per exposure, which has been very hard to estimate because we don't know how many people have been exposed.

This is a basic number.  Please clarify."
2020-03-04 13:29,"I'm sorry, but how can we possibly know this?  There is a formula for coming up with this number - Number of infections divided by the number of deaths.  There could be thousands if not hundreds of thousands of undercounted infections - and there likely is since we're told that so many people have few or no symptoms.  They are not being counted.  We're only counting the people who get sick enough to go to the doctor.  

I've really lost respect for both WHO and CDC over this.  They're making up numbers and that's not real science."
2020-03-04 13:33,"Absent consistent reliable data and widespread testing (you cannot cherry pick who to test when determining fatality rates!) and the very real possibility that many have had this and thought it a cold or the flu, we cannot have any sense of what the real numbers are. In fact, the fatality rate might be going in the opposite direction if millions more had it and it was so mild they didn't even know. 

I'm keenly aware that the opposite may be true too. This is why we must insist that widespread testing take place. A great starting place would be in schools and businesses where many work in close quarters. Bring the tests to these sites and do on the spot testing. Then we can start to talk real numbers. 

Until we have that, we're just spitballing (at a time when phlegm is the problem)."
2020-03-04 13:35,"Take a deep breath and remember the denominator problem.  When all of the assymptomatic and mild test-positve cases are added to the denominator after testing is ramped up, the rate will get smaller.  Assume most cases being used to calculate this rate are those who were tested for moderate or severe symptoms."
2020-03-04 13:39,"I had a disturbing conversation with one of my physicians approx. 2 weeks ago. 

He was raised in China. A prodigy, he earned his medical degree, completed his residency, and was working as a specialist by his mid-20's. He moved with his entire extended family to the US over 25 years ago. 

He has no trust in the information the Chinese government releases yet still has contacts with medical experts there. He stated that once democracies outside of China ran the numbers the supposed death rate of 2.9%, adjusted downwards to 2.3%, would be proven untrue with a rate much closer to 4-5%. 

The 80% of cases China labeled as mild was also highly deceptive because a large number contracted pneumonia and ""self-resolved"" only because of intensive antibiotic treatment. Among the approx. 8-10% who became critical yet survived, many sustained organ damage. 

He emphasized that beyond a lack of immunity, Coronavirus is not like the flu. It attacks the lungs, quickly damages them, and makes them highly fibrous. It is why it is increasingly difficult for those seriously infected to get enough oxygen. 

In Coronavirus infections the body must quickly regenerate lung tissue the virus destroys. In the young and healthy, who can rapidly regenerate, it is far less of an issue, but among those who are elderly, or not elderly yet have diseases like diabetes which hinder healing, the necessary rapid regeneration of damaged lung tissue is much more difficult."
2020-03-04 13:52,"Perhaps a medical or public-health professional can answer this question. If there no comprehensive testing has occurred, and, infected persons can be asymptomatic, how is it possible to derive a fatality-rate with any confidence?"
2020-03-04 14:10,"Perhaps I missed it in the plethora of comments and articles to date....


Is our government looking into a secondary wave of testing to test for covid-19 antibodies/immunity titers (as opposed to active infection)? 

Given that the symptoms are similar to more benign seasonal flus, it would be helpful to know if one has already had and overcome the Covid-19 virus. That would give people with immunity an opportunity to volunteer to help out (whether it’s in the realm of a skilled healthcare practitioner, elder care, airline employee, or simply in preparing foods/delivering supplies...)."
2020-03-04 14:11,"@ Jonny Walker

When the dust has settled on this, 0.6% will still be too high.  For the simple reason that these numbers can only explode if there are many undetected cases.  If all were identified and quarantined, the virus could no longer spread.

That being said, you also have to take the lag time from diagnosis to death into your consideration.  At some point, the new cases will level off, but deaths will continue to increase for another couple of weeks until equilibrium is reached.  Then we will know what the actual death rate is, assuming 100% of cases have been identified.

Which will still not be the case.

I think it is safe to assume that this virus has already disseminated throughout the general population and is mixed with all the cases of the flu and the common cold.  It is just the (elaborate, time consuming and rate limiting) testing that is catching up to it - slowly.

Once we have an ELISA and no longer have to rely on PCR, we will have better numbers.  ELISA will detect who has gone through the infection in the past, PCR will only detect who current has it.  Both numbers are required to calculcate an accurate fatality rate."
2020-03-04 13:23,I don't know why the WHO said such a thing that we all know will be sensationalized in the headlines. This is the epidemiological equivalent of Bill-Gates-walks-into-a-bar-and-on-average-everyone's-a-millionaire. You can't include the numerous early cases in China in the global average and arrive at a meaningful death rate because they are not representative of what's happening in the rest of the world.
2020-03-04 13:49,"The W.H.O. takes a “crudely constructed” number for the death rate of the new corona virus and then compares it to better known figure for influenza and makes a conclusion that corona is more deadly. They need to retake statistics.  They have a good idea of the deaths caused by the virus but no clue as to how many infections there have been. There aren’t enough test kits to determine that, and a vast majority of those infected have mild conditions (80%) that are not likely reported. It may be more deadly and it may not be. It may be less deadly. We won’t know for years."
2020-03-04 13:30,"I am a scientist.  We do not have accurate figures for transmission rates and therefore cannot have accurate mortality rates.  We will not have more accurate figures for some time.

My take on this is that we need to be doing everything we can to contain the spread.  We should consider closing our transport networks and effectively shut the economy down until the spread dramatically ceases.  Otherwise, the weakest and most elderly (and the wisest) in our society will die."

My understanding is that children are by and large safe and that healthy adults under age 65 have mild cases not requiring hospitalization. Having said that, if young asymptomatic people are killing the elderly, that’s still terrible."

2020-03-04 13:34,"A very large percentage of our common use medical supplies come from where?  They come from China.  We are having a trade war with China.  How does that foster international cooperation when such cooperation is the only way to beat this virus?

The WHO is not Chinese state propaganda.  A three percent death rate is highly significant.  Downplaying it by stating it mainly affects older people is no comfort if it infects your parents.

The virus is out there and it is spreading.  No way to stop that.  Free societies are not going to place entire communities on lockdown like they have done in China.  As with previous flu like pandemics, they tend to wane in the summer and come roaring back in the fall when cold and flu season returns.

What we need is a vaccine.  That is at least one year away.  That means next fall and winter could be a time of widespread infection.  That would be just in time for the election which is why Trump down playing this now.  The 'media hoax' line will only go so far when the hospital beds are filled."
2020-03-04 13:26,Fatality rate worse than seasonal flu. This is the first time I heard this. All along we have been told by the liberal mainstream media that the flu-related fatalities are higher.

2020-03-04 14:08,"Not true with the 1918 flu, which hit young adults with healthy immune systems the hardest."
2020-03-04 13:15,"Oh give me a break.  3.4% of ""reported"" cases have died.  But most cases are mild--young children often have no symptoms, for example--and surely there are many many unreported cases.  There are probably more unreported cases than there are reported cases.  

So the death rate is much lower than 3.4%.  Is the head of WHO incompetent?"
2020-03-04 13:27,"To err is human, though I believe this administration may go down as the most corrupt and incompetent in history. But the real lesson here is about the importance of universal health care in addressing pandemics. When those without health care seek no medical assistance a virus will spread more readily. When those with high deductibles seek no medical assistance, a virus will spread more readily. The rich will huddle in their filthy penthouses afraid to let their maids in. They won't go outside afraid of exposure. Their favorite restaurants will close because their rich patrons will be afraid their waiters might be diseased. An economic downturn will be much worse than it would have been if the government was prepared to deal with pandemics and the public was able to seek treatment. Maybe the 1 percent will see the benefits of universal coverage and loosen their purse strings."
2020-03-04 14:17,"""Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director general, said in a news conference in Geneva that Covid-19 was deadlier than the seasonal flu but did not transmit as easily.""
  Even from the beginning, it was obvious that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was much higher than the seasonal flu but the WHO was underestimating the risk. even the transmissibility is as bad as the seasonal flu according to some studies.
   The problem with the coronavirus is that there are a lot of things even the scientists do not know about the behavior of this virus but we do know a lot about the seasonal flu, many people have some level of immunity to the flu virus."
2020-03-04 14:15,"Mayor de blasio, Governor Cuomo how about a few common sense ideas.
No hording. Certain things like hand sanitizers and clorox wipes for example should not be horded. I mean its a simple rule, how about implementing it.

If you have a cough you stay home, stay off the buses, stay off the Train. I am surprised the MTA hasn't instructed their workers to walk out of this is not implemented

buy as many N95 masks as you can every New Yorkers gets one and wears one, open a factory in New York to make masks, believe me people will purchase them. it might not stop all Corona but it will stop 30 percent at least, and save some lives. If its true that Corona doesn't spread as easy as the flu( i don't believe it) this is the first bit of good news.

There are so many things that can be done, but it seems like nothing at all is being done, nothing preemptive that is. 

The most maddening thing about this whole thing is the lack of fight. The Mayor and Governors hands seem to be tied, afraid to disrupt the economy, but do you know what will really disrupt the economy-an Epidemic.

Believe me if you begin to fight this virus the way the Japanese, and South Koreans are, they will soon have their countries on the way to recovery, believe me if you create cough bans in grocery stores, on buses, etc, people will cheer.

This is a harbinger of what is to come.  We, as a species, can probably deal with it in its early stages if we band together and understand these forces.

2020-03-04 14:34,"There's two separate public issues:  the spread of the disease, and the treatment of the illness.

The spread of the disease may be slowed by normal flu-prevention behavior.  Wash hands, don't touch your face, stay home if you feel sick.  But just like the flu, the spread of the disease can't be stopped because it is infectious in asymptomatic people.  And, the personal and social economic cost of a one-month global quarantine is simply too high, even if it was feasible and even if it would stop the ultimate spread of the virus (and it isn't and it wouldn't).

So, as a society, we should treat it like the flu.

As for treating the sickened, that is where we can and must do better.  We need to devote resources to help people survive, instead of treating health care like the market for new cars or housecleaning services.  Everyone deserves care, as a human right."

High morbidity rate, with many patients needed Intensive Care unit admissions or ventilatory support is also important. It will strain healthcare systems in many countries and take away resources from other medical problems which are more endemic (or epidemic, like current flue season).The rate of Covid-19 infection is much higher among healthcare workers and they will be at least temporarily removed from workforce, further straining the system. Our hospitals are already in resource saving mode, due to predicted shortages of Personal Protective Devices and other medical supplies, mostly made in China.

  Last but not least, the outbreak is scary. Especially when a number of people who have gotten seriously ill don't seem to have ""underlying conditions"".

If it is just those which require medical attention, then from an earlier article we know that is just 20% of the total cases as 80% are mild.

So, if the 3.4% mortality rate is conditional on the 20% of the non-mild cases the total mortality rate is 3.4 x .2 + 0 x .8 = 0.7 %

Still much higher than the 0.1 % mortality of seasonal flu but not panic inducing like 3.4"
2020-03-04 14:53,"It’s pitiful, laughable is too strong a word, that you Americans spend so much on the “war against terrorism” yet you don’t have even the basic infrastructure to test against corona and other viruses. 

It has no doubt spread throughout the population but you are simply unaware of it. 

On the positive side, this may be the end of the man who once claimed he could stand on 5th Avenue and shoot some and that nobody could do anything about it.

2020-03-04 13:37,Seriously everyone needs to relax. Keep living your life! There are tons of viruses every year. Just act like this is normal flu season. Wash your hands and cough or sneeze into your hands. Everyone will be fine. The elderly are always at risk during flu season so check on your family members that are 65 and older and help them if they come down with something. The cancellation of schools and events and travel all seems too extreme! Nothing good can come from isolation and hoarding toilet paper!!! I mean come on people.
2020-03-04 13:24,"If South Korea and Britain have drive through testing, why don't we have it in the USA?"
2020-03-04 15:02,"There are a lot of comments that doubt the WHO's fatality rate because of this notion that there are a lot of mild/asymptomatic cases at the base of this iceberg and the fatal cases we see and count are just the tip of this iceberg. I would however, direct people to search out interviews with the WHO's expert Bruce Aylward who does not believe this to be the case. He was at ground zero in Wuhan and reports that the Chinese performed 360,000 tests and he did not see an iceberg. I understand that serological tests are the gold standard (which has been created by scientists in Singapore) but we should probably listen to an expert who has seen data and studies that we casual readers do not have access to."
2020-03-04 15:01,"This announcement is so irresponsible from WHO, and I'm surprised NY Times is publishing this headline and burying this very important piece of information:

""The figure does not include mild cases that do not require medical attention and is skewed by Wuhan, where the death rate is several times higher than elsewhere in China. It is also quite possible that there are many undetected cases that would push the mortality rate lower.""

Saying the mortality rate is 3% as a headline then following up with, ""oh yeah, but that doesn't count all the people who basically experienced a bad cold"" is extremely irresponsible in the context of the panic occurring tight now. 

The fact is this virus has been circulating for weeks in the US and the only reason we're catching some of the cases is by chance - someone with a non-serious cold/flu happens to go to a doc with access to testing."
2020-03-04 15:04,"For some of us the issue is not so much fear of getting it, it’s fear of being quarantined at home or abroad. It’s Spring Break season in two weeks. Many of us have plans. The airlines thus far are not reimbursing. That’s a lot of money down the drain. Yet who wants to be stuck in a hotel room for 2 weeks? Or have problems at the airport or not be allowed back?"
2020-03-04 15:03,"This is why people are panic buying and stores are running out of toilet paper, because of articles like this. We have known the mortality rate since the first case in the U.S. That is not ""news."" Stop trying to scare people."
2020-03-04 15:06,"basic takeaway: If you're under 55 in good health you're probably going to be fine even if you catch it. (you still can spread it to others who won't be fine and could end up in intensive care or dead) Be prepared that you might be stuck during or after trips and unable to return home. If you're older than 60, be cautious about crowds, wash your hands, disinfect all faucets and door knobs, and don't touch your face. Hospitals can be overwhelmed."
2020-03-04 15:06,"The WHO is an entirely useless organization that has fumbled and releases totally fictitious figures of mortality when there is scant data. By now, all schools should have been closed and folks who can work from home, do so, to enable our organizations to think and plan. But obviously we too seem to weigh humans against dollars and the latter wins resoundingly. I suggest to all Americans, that the time has come to plan for one’s own families. Stay clean, wash hands, use common sense and above all, do not share food or drinks with family or co-workers. If your kid is unwell, treat it as you would a cold, but let them rest at home. Your child may not suffer, but if exposed to the sarscov2 virus, might spread it to older teachers at school. For folks visiting doctors, dentists, ophthalmologists etc. stay away unless you are dying. The medical community seems quite unable to get a handle on how to curb transmission from their facilities to the public. It is singularly disappointing to see this slow lumbering approach, inability to project for the worst case scenario and hope for the best, by the American administration."
2020-03-04 15:16,"The WHO's update may already be out of date: Hong Kong's South China Morning Post is reporting today that Chinese researchers have established that the virus has evolved into 2 major types, one of which, type L,  appears to be far more infectious than the other. Perhaps this explains the great discrepancies between infection rates in different areas? This could have major implications for how containment is managed."
2020-03-04 15:16,"*Dr. Margaret Harris, a W.H.O. spokeswoman, said the figure was a “crudely calculated” snapshot of the disease’s death rate globally, and was expected to “change over time, and vary from place to place.”

The figure does not include mild cases that do not require medical attention and is skewed by Wuhan, where the death rate is several times higher than elsewhere in China. It is also quite possible that there are many undetected cases that would push the mortality rate lower.*

Passing on shaky stats like this is not helpful. It encourages irrational behavior."
2020-03-04 15:15,"What basis is there for saying it ""transmits less easily"" than the flu? I see no citation. Every estimate so far has put COVID-19's R0 at 2-3 times the level of seasonal influenza. Did anything change or is this a false statement?"
2020-03-04 15:17,"The numbers reported are grossly inaccurate, because they do not know who patient zero was.  You cannot after-the-fact paste on a fatality rate, when people in the community already had it AND they refused to test so many. 

The fatality rate is likely much lower.  The problem with the reporting is that they should now be using the expression, ""verified cases"", because we all know that there has to be many more unverified cases out there.  This has been confirmed by CDC officials in Washington and California."
2020-03-04 15:09,"I think it’s important to stay informed and take necessary precautions. But I find headlines like this, while factually correct, irresponsible.  Yes the information is there when you dig deeper, but so many people don’t and I think you need to do a better job."

No large gatherings, mass testing and quarantine/isolation where needed. These measures will prevent unnecessary illness and death! I am an infection control nurse and have responded to three major outbreaks in tow California counties. Washington State is acting as if this will just go away. There is still time to act. Take measures now!"
2020-03-04 15:17,"Considering the US has only tested a few people -- most of whom, in WA, were apparently near death or already dead -- I'm completely unconvinced the death rate is whatever they say. They'd have to test everybody, or at the very least, everybody sick, to get even a rough-accurate idea of the mortality rate. 

Currently, tons of milder cases -- probably the vast majority -- are not counted at all."
2020-03-04 15:18,"Here in the UK, we only have 85 cases detected, but that is almost double how many there were yesterday, I suspect the exponential rise will continue for some time yet.

Thank you in advance."
2020-03-04 15:13,"There is so much misinformation in these comments. The mortality rate is as follows; number of deaths divided by number of infected. Period.

3220/94301*100 = 3.4%

This is how mortality rate is calculated. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's basic grade school math folks. It's an estimate because mortality is effected by location (how good your health care system is), your health, and a lot of other variables.  We won't know the global numbers until this virus is over."
2020-03-04 15:25,"Every 72 hours will do NOTHING to prevent virus transmission.  Nothing.  If you are on a car with someone carrying the virus, given the six foot rule you are very likely to get sick.  I am shocked by how many people are still touching the pole with bare hands.

Ask the Prime Minster of Japan, who is fighting this with all he has, ask for help. We are not alone in this. There are ways to fight an epidemic. Trump is so disconnected from the man in the street he has no idea what is really happening, how frightened people are.

As we go to the polls soon we should keep in mind that it is not hard to tell the difference between casual liars and leaders who tell the hard often painful truth. 
Turns out our health care system might not be #1 given our failure to be properly prepared to deal with a viral mutation. 
And not because we couldn't see it coming but because of our tribal hate prevents us from coming together for our own good on big issues like health and fair wages. 

Many of us cheered as health care was reduced of taken from millions who should have had it as a basic human right provided by any intelligent and compassionate society. 
Intelligent to keep your nation healthy and up to date on vaccines for emerging diseases instead of wasting 5 trillion on chasing ""terror"" yet don't have face masks for our nurses to care for the sick. 
Compassionate because it is what Jesus would do if he was president of a real Christian nation which would not deprive the weak, the sick and poor of decent care.

2020-03-04 15:31,"In response to the complaints about WHO's stats on the mortality rate being artificially high...I think it likely is, but so are all other rates as well. It's still more serious than seasonal flu. If you have a-symptomatic flu you don't go get tested. In fact, even with symptomatic flu tons of people know what they have and do not seek a diagnosis or medical attention. Same goes for past epidemics. SARS, MERS, 1957 flu, 1918 Spanish Flu, etc. No one with mild cases gets care for any virus."
2020-03-04 15:33,"most worrying to me is the number of people who seem to have just woken from a deep sleep as if what has now reverted to being called the ""novel coronavirus"" hasn't been unfolding in real time for the past two months."

2020-03-04 16:05,"Would be good to read reporting on new cases being the L or less aggressive S type. 

Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.

A vast majority of companies have been skeptical towards concepts like smart working, home office and remote conferencing. As a result, an enormous amount of energy (read: CO2 emissions) is wasted every day in travel that could be easily avoided.

Until recently, every time I go to Zurich airport (the nearest to my work) I always meet people from my company. We seem to be in perpetual flux, with people moving constantly between customer meetings and visits to our manufacturing plants. Now, with the outbreak of the coronavirus we have put strict limitations on travel and we are ""forced"" to hold more remote conferences with customers and suppliers. And guess what -  business goes on anyway. I am currently working at home because I visited a region of Italy affected by the coronavirus, and as a result I have been quarantined for two weeks. Still, in one morning I have held several call conferences, and I have done everything I would have done at the office, minus the continuous distractions and the wasted time.

I am over 60 and will do what I can do postpone my inevitable exposure.

so far there have been 2,500 people who have tested positive for Corona Virus.
79 people have died, overwhelmingly the age of the people who have died is between 63 and 95
1034 people are hospitalized
229 in intensive care
1229 have mild symptom and are recovering at home
160 people have fully recovered.
Every single number is almost identical to the stats that came out of China.

So stop panicking this is not a world killer, many people probably got cases so mild they didn't even know they had it, they say it might have been circulating in Italy for up to 3 weeks.

People over 63 must take immediate precautions. All nursing home must stop receiving visitors, places that have senior recreation should stop immediately. The people who have the most to fear are senior citizens. The Italy numbers are almost perfectly syncing to the numbers from China. Seniors should take this very serious, stay in your homes, no unnecessary travel. If you are over 40 and have underlying health conditions take the same precautions.

With rampant rumors, understandable fear, profit-seeking hustlers, and political opportunists everywhere, there must be one voice that Americans can count on to present the best understanding of the nature of the disease and its spread. This is a moment when the individuals who work for the C.D.C. must stand up as responsible Americans and not let external political pressure influence their best judgement.

Thus it is quite problematic that the article, ""U.S. Plans ‘Radical Expansion’ of Coronavirus Testing"" stated, ""The kits had three components but some of the components were producing an inconclusive result for many public health labs using the test. On Thursday, the agency announced that labs with two of three working components could go ahead and use the C.D.C. tests....""

Why should we have confidence in results of the ""new"" test? If the C.D.C. originally thought that all three elements were necessary for an accurate test result, how does simply eliminating one problematic element solve the problem and produce accurate results? Why should this not be viewed as more of a political solution -- let's get lots of ""tests"" out there to look good -- rather than a genuine public health/medical solution?

""Test"" is somewhat misleading, as not all tests were created equal, let alone have been subject to evaluation and quality control. As well, the processing of the tests is still limited."

Sigh, and to think I have used Chinese star anise ( the original source of shikimic acid for Tamiflu) in my cooking forever safely. Perhaps what we are missing are the other molecules that balance shikimate and make it safe for consumption. In any case I have brewed cough potions with this seed and fed it to family and friends for a long time, great for coughs. The concentration of everything must be nice and low enough not to strain any organ and it sure helps ease the cough."
2020-03-04 17:25,"As a 70  year old with underlying health conditions, I can report that my friends and I are watching this like a hawk.  I’ve started spending more time at home, have completely eliminated all but essential travel by car and any form of mass transit is out of the question.  I’ve stopped going to the gym and senior center, won’t get near a crowd and do my best to stay at least six feet away from anyone else.  I carry and use disposable gloves when outside my home, wash my hands with soap and water several times per day and won’t touch my face until then.  If I had an upcoming dental appointment, I would postpone it.  I’m even debating putting off my next haircut.  Godspeed and good luck to all of us."
2020-03-04 17:41,"Seems that the unsung heroes in this mess are those who are clearly working diligently at trying to keep us safe. Not the medical folks who do deserve thanks and are getting it.
I mean those who are scrubbing and wiping and cleaning and disinfecting all those surfaces we touch.  And possibly exposing themselves to contamination. 
I salute them for their willingness to show up and do the job even though they may be worrying about catching the virus and what that would mean for them and their families. Do they get sick leave? Do they have adequate health insurance? What do they do if they get quarantined?
So, from at least one of us counting on you folks: Thank you for your service and dedication to the job and hand.
And, please stay safe."

2020-03-04 17:55,"“Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported Covid-19 cases have died,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, said on Tuesday at a news conference in Geneva.

Trump's response and take on that during today's Covid-19 briefing? “Had Warren endorsed Bernie, we would have had a different story now.”"
2020-03-04 17:21,"This Coronavirus is a tragedy on many levels! Additionally, pronouncing the names of some of these medical experts can be a challenge! Add to that, the New York Times ran a photo of President Trump, standing beside a Doctor that sure looked like Anthony Fauci, the highly regarded clinician, except for the fact he was wearing a smock, with the name, John Miliu MD emblazoned across it! Go figure."
2020-03-04 17:43,"Well, that's about it then.

With the announcement of new cases in New York, and again in Los Angeles, America's two biggest metropolitan areas, you can expect the public pulse to quicken and 'panic', for lack of a better word, to set in.

For all intents and purposes, a half-dozen cases of the coronavirus in L.A. might as well be a half-million.  People will not wish to gamble with their lives.  What's fine for a Vegas slot machine just won't do when it comes to mortality rates.  Sure, you could explain to all and sundry that---true---so far, COVID-19 is much less rampant than your average ho-hum flu season or that the mortality rate runs about even with the flu, but they won't see it that way.

Why?

Because nobody bothered explaining it to them?  Because the media has driven 'scare' headlines into them, first without explaining the caveats, second, for failing to put 'Coronavirus!' into helpful context.  Perception is everything, and perception is reality.

So, expect supermarket shelves to empty out by this weekend.  Expect restaurants, stores, movie theatres and other shared public spaces to close---that's close---by, oh, sometime next week.   And it's around that time that I expect President Trump to deliver an FDR-type fireside chat, reassuring the nation that...everything's swell.

And another guarantee:  Until Amazon employees and UPS drivers get sick, expect gazillions of empty blue boxes to pile up in the nation's garbage as we turn commerce (even more) online."

2020-03-04 17:41,"At this very moment there is a hearing on CSPAN3 about the President’s 2021 NIH Budget.  The representatives are asking probing questions about the coronavirus and the NIH experts are providing answers, no sugar coating, no wishful thinking, no miracles - just the FAUCI FACTS.

The hearing covers all NIH programs but I have heard the best coronavirus questions and responses.  The questions and answers are non-partisan, extremely informative, credible, science based and easy for a lay person to understand.

It is understandable that everyone wants to know why masks work and don’t work, why healthcare workers are more important than general public, what’s the difference between flu and coronavirus, how does one get it, when will testing start, what will starting tell us, etc

Now many people post excellent answers to reader’s questions but many people frankly do not know what they are talking about.  The solution is personal responsibility to educate oneself with info from the primary sources.

Congressional hearings are an excellent source of expert information.  One will be surprised by the intellect of many congress people.

slog through some hearings especially those with Dr. Fauci.  Also Representative Lois Frankel (FL) asks extremely practical questions that she calls supermarket encounters with constituents.  

CSPAN is also available as an app. Check it out.  It will make for a more informed community.

2020-03-04 17:00,"It is simply grotesque how the media has simply stopped reporting on China now that things appear to be seriously improving. The brutal measures imposed by the regime and the heroic sacrifices if the Chinese people bought valuable time for the world. Yet the criminal ineptitude of the US and other ""democratic"" governments have now ensured a pandemic by frittering away this opportunity. Politicians in denial, criminal ineptitude at the CDC and a cover-up, bad test kits never explained, the refusal to use the superior German test just to promote US Pharma-vultures, no testing to cover up actual spread...China is looking good by comparison. Still no real preparation, no actual measures to enable working people to take off work is sick. Coronavirus=Katrina 2.0"

Translation:   I know I am in trouble so let's blame Obama and his administration because I am the greatest president ever. 
So constructive.  Not!"
2020-03-04 17:42,"I guess it stands to reason that if we have a president who believes global warming and climate issues are ""fake news"" and refuses to believe, let alone even read what educated, skilled and knowledgeable scientists write, then why in the world would or should we assume or think he would take the coronavirus and its implications seriously?

Thank goodness for the World Health Organization, the CDC and the NYT because at least they continue to cover and report the latest updates to the world.  

I feel more informed and secure reading their stories than a single word I have heard uttered from the president or any member of his administration."
2020-03-04 17:51,"As usual with mainstream media publications, there are no facts, only opinions.  
For example: How many people have died in the United States from the virus?  Who are they? Where were they?  What complications die they die from?  How did they get the virus?  
None of these things are reported.  
We do not care about first respsonders who may not have masks, or ways to self quarantine.  We want to know facts about people who died and why."
2020-03-04 17:21,"Your (everyone's?) naivete in this matter is astounding. To make statements that ""first"" case found in NY or CA or anywhere seems very silly. Given the number of travelers coming and going, it's certain this virus as been everywhere for some time. It's just that no one tested for it or was too concerned given that most cases are so similar to the flu. Of course it's spreading in Manhattan - no matter how hard anyone tries, there are just too many  people coming and going to have any other result."

2020-03-04 17:09,"Inexplicable:  A full 2 months after the coronavirus outbreak and in Seattle we still see:

- Insufficient masks & gear for health care workers;
- An infected nursing home, Life Care of Kirkland, with vulnerable patients locked in together (our own Diamond Princess petri dish?);
- Critically ill flu patients transferred by staff and medics  who are *not* wearing protective gear;
- Insufficient test kits to test those with flu symptoms;
- Insufficient hospital beds to hand the serious cases predicted by science;
- Nearly unanimous opinion of scientists that thousands more are infected and infectious, but undiagnosed in the community.

But don't worry, we are all sneezing into our elbows as we go off to work or school."

2020-03-04 17:40,"Coronavirus-19 is not as infectious as seasonal flu.  It  may  kill a higher percent of  Americans it infects, but it will infect a much smaller percent of Americans than seasonal flu. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control, seasonal flu killed 34,200 Americans during the 2018-2019 flu season. So far there have been nine U.S. coronavirus deaths. The seasonal flu will probably kill far more Americans this year than coronavirus-19. 

Estimates of the coronavirus-19 fatality rate range from about two percent to about four percent, but the estimated fatality rate  will probably drop significantly once an accurate number of persons affected is determine. The fatality rates 0f  severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)—which was also a coronavirus—dropped from a high of about 10 percent to about 2.3 percent.  Coronavirus-19 may turn out to be only slightly more fatal then seasonal flue."

2020-03-04 11:14,"As few comments:

1. The NYT should drop the paywall for their Coronavirus coverage. 

2. The drive-through testing is brilliant. Bring that here.

3. We are sitting ducks in the US. Virus may be here but we’re going about our business mask-less and untested.

4. If masks are so useless why are their scarcity cited as a factor for spread?

5. The death rate makes sense. I said from the very beginning that the deaths from the Diamond were atypical when compared to other cruise outbreaks given there are three week cruises with similar demographics and when there are outbreaks, no one dies.

6. China trying to cover it up in December says to me that they knew something we didn’t. This likely came from the labs in Wuhan.

7. Trump and Pence are incompetent buffoons and so is the government they are running. This will likely rightfully cause them the election, especially if voters are given the choice to vote for someone like Biden, who has successfully run and been part of functional and competent government systems.

8. The lack of beds in S. Korea is terrifying. So many acutely ill at once. 

9& 10. This article had lots of different angles so my comments did as well. The swimmer thing confused me but I’m going to go drown my sorrows in my bathtub, pretend I didn’t read any of this and channel my inner Wuhan swimmer 🏊 and his contagious optimism. That’s a better type of “pandemic” anyway: optimistic denial. In the light of the failures of my own government, I’ll take it."

Don't forget that it about the only major city in the world that did not have a big celebration for the start of the new century and millennium. People commute big distances for work, there are big immigrant areas shot through with folk health beliefs, and lots of illegal migrants -- a million of them, in fact -- who do not want any contact with officialdom. Bottom line: trouble coming."
2020-03-04 18:29,"The global map which shows the extent of outbreak in different country’s of the world shows, with the exception of the continents wealthier nations, no activity. It’s important to note that the governments of these countries are often times weak, and often times have minimal capabilities to provide health care. Recent outbreaks of the Ebola virus in Africa prove this assertion. What is not being reported is the presence of an estimated 1 million Chinese citizens on the continent working in construction, mining, textiles, and other industries on the continent. Some of these Chinese would have headed home for the Lunar New Year. Some of those would have traveled to Wuhan, and returned to Africa. What’s become of them? Faced with limited health care options in Africa, what might they do?  Travel to friends and relatives in the U.S.A. or Europe where modern medicine is readily available? To Iran? The President is not intellectually curious, and his choice for Coronavirus Czar rejects science. Are they paying attention? Do they care?"

Publishing the outcomes of the model will go a long ways toward getting as handle on best practices for all of us. Just be sure to adjust for locations with very large populations as they tend to skew outcomes. We need science to handle this properly, not dim witted Vice Presidents and reality show actors like Trump and his administration.

Oakland’s close, and smaller, next-door neighbor, Berkeley, has, via its public health department, reported a case of the virus and declared a local state of emergency.  Meanwhile, Oakland, the largest city in Alameda county, home to several hospitals, and the county seat, doesn’t even have a department of public health nor anything meaningful on its website regarding a comprehensive plan."
2020-03-04 18:42,"NY = state of New York; LA = not Louisiana, but Los Angeles? Y'all may want to consider using CA for consistency and clarity's sake."
2020-03-04 19:07,"The genome of the first case to be identified in Washington state is identical to the virus identified in Fujian, China on January 21.  The virus appears to have been present in the Seattle community and undetected in the US since that time. The US is, today, basically where Wuhan was in early January. By June, there will likely be >100k confirmed cases and 3k or more deaths in the US. What this will do to the US healthcare system, let alone the political stability of the country is anyone's guess."
2020-03-04 19:13,"CDC cuts by the Trump administration appear to be partially responsible for the very poor initial performance of the CDC. The test kit fiasco and delay of new test kits. The virus is spreading but not well documented in America. The rest of the world is robustly testing. The spread of virus within the community is what surveillance is. Our government response appeared chaotic and unprepared. Strict guidelines limited testing because of a limited supply of tests. A woman in Vacaville walked into the hospital sick, later intubated and sent to UC Davis Medical Center. Doctors had to argue for her to be tested for Covid 19. The test was not performed for 8 days and confirmation took another 4 days! In a fast spreading outbreak the government appeared to be taking it's cues from an illiterate science denier our President who at his dismal and incoherent press conference proposed non science based information. Trump rambled on minimizing the seriousness and likelihood of spread of the virus. He claimed Flu is more serious. He appeared to not comprehend the basics of percentages and mortality rates.  Contradicting his own team of public health officials he promised treatments and vaccines that are not available.  His was a political attempt to calm the stock market to save himself first before the safety and education of the public."
2020-03-04 19:20,"My brother-in-law watches only Fox News and a die-hard Trump supporter.  He is also n 85-year-old dialysis patient.  He lives very close to LA county.  When my sister asked him to wear a face mask when he goes to the dialysis center, his reply is ""the government says that a healthy person does not have to wear a mask!""  He got annoyed when my sister asked him to wash his hands after he returned home. He said that the risk of community spread is low.  This is how the Trump administration and Fox News put people's lives at risk!  My sister is 73 and in the high risk group.  I worry sick that she might get infected."
2020-03-04 18:40,"I'd like to be simultanesously informed about the number of FLU cases as well as the number of Coronavirus cases.  Simultaneous reporting would allow me to compare the advance of a ""new"" virus (that we do not yet have a vaccine for) to the FLU (an ""old"" or known virus) which we do have a vaccine for.  This would promote ""weighing the degree of alarm"" that should or shoudn't be associated with Coronavirus cases. Example: Imagien there have been 135 instances of coronovirus in the US and 30,135 cases of the Flu.  Just saying it would lend more meaning to the reports."
2020-03-04 19:27,"First, Medicare for All will not solve the current crisis.  If anything, because health care facilities would be overburdened with patients suffering from other conditions, the situation would be even worse.  What we may need in the future are public health hospitals that can accept patients in large numbers who need to be isolated and treated.  We did have one in Seattle on a hill overlooking the city; the building remains and recently served as headquarters to Amazon before the company built out a campus downtown.   With the coronavirus the United States has received a big health scare.  Now is the time to allocate resources to the public health sector, which has, for too long, been a poor cousin to the acute care system."
2020-03-04 19:36,"We're way behind on this. Although I believe the confirmed cases are just the tip of the iceberg-- even considering the student at Yeshiva University, or at the Jewish high school, all students from those schools should now be under a 14-day quarantine. With the schools closed and students already possibly exposed, unless every student, teacher and administrator is quarantined it could continue its spread. And those are just two vector points."
2020-03-04 19:40,"Let's look and learn from what's working in Wuhan since the number of infections is declining.  To start, it seems to be time that we're tested at home if we become ill and not travel to the doctor/hospital/testing center."
2020-03-04 19:47,"The thing is this: Currently the only method of keeping the virus at bay is to quarantine people. I visited my doctor yesterday (Germany) and she told me that cases, all cases, where the virus has been discovered but not necessary causing sickness to the patient means mandatory quarantine for that patient and potentially his/her whole family and friends too,  etc. Everyone close by or having had contact with said patient needs to be tested in that case and that requirement could be the tipping point so to speak; it could trigger massive shortages of all daily-need items, not just masks!

I see it here in the German grocery stores: Rice and noodles from Asia including coconut milk are basically gone from the shelves, noodles and other products from Italy are gone too because Italy clamped down on transport.

If it would get worse and that’s a big if, very simple daily-need items could be hard to get. There certainly is no reason to panic, but prudence would dictate adding a few more items to the shipping cart, because when was the last time in your life that there was a shortage of anything in the western world? I’m 54 and there hasn’t been one single day in my life that I had to miss even one meal or miss toilet paper. Not one!

You get the idea."
2020-03-04 20:00,"Genuinely curious about the masks though. They say don’t wear it unless you’re infected but everywhere else is wearing it. Italians are wearing it and the medical officials in DC in this picture are wearing them. How are masks not preventative? If it’s the lack of products, I understand... but if it’s only to propagate and diminish panic, I’d say public health is far more important."
2020-03-04 20:24,"There is still no testing available here in Seattle short of being admitted with breathing difficulties. Six days of high fever and cough and my doctor still gives me a number to call about testing that automatically disconnects.

Last weekend I flew to a large party in the Bay Area. My husband has the same crud and he’s sharing a ski condo with six other guys in Montana. Without testing we can’t tell anyone How careful they should be. Its just gray probabilities and maybes. Contact tracing will be useless by the time we get any results. Too late."

Throwing billions at this problems inefficiently will do diddly squat. Deceptive hype and news about the spread by those who do not understand the nano sized viruses is just useless fearmongering.

Iran has contributed to the higher fatality rate.

Stop the fear mongering with deceptive headlines. Yes seasonal flu lately has a less fatality rate than the COVID-19 but that is because sensible responsible people get the vaccine against seasonal flu, especially the seniors. Recent fatality rate for COVID-19 has gone up due to its spread in senior nursing homes and Iran. IRAN gone mad was busy enriching URANIUM instead of developing their health care infrastructure and preparedness for Corona,  like China did in its fight against Corona, with a fatality of 2%. 
Panic and fear mongering about Corona virus remains unjustified except for those who want to politicize it.

2020-03-04 19:30,"We have been repeatedly warned by doctors, scientists, News Media, Hollywood and Sci-Fi writers!

1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic
Swine Flu
SARS
MERVS
Ebola
H1N1 Avian Flu (which has never gone away!)

The problem is that people have heard doomsday warnings so often that they stopped listening.  People won't even look in the mirror and take personal responsibility - instead, they want to blame elected leaders (as if our leaders could have actually done anything of substance that would satisfy everybody!)

Are we ready for a really serious Pandemic?  Nope!

Meteor strike?  Nope!

Is California or the West Coast ready for a massive earthquake?  Nope!

Think a new Administration would do any better?  Nope!

Think that manufactures will rush out a vaccine in 6 months, 12 months, 18 months or 24 months?  Nope!


If a vaccine is discovered, the manufacturers will stockpile the vaccine and refuse to release it until they are 100% indemnified - and most of the vaccines will be made in China, India or Europe - so new leadership will not change that fact!

Since it is the secondary infections that kill and not the virus... how many people are up to date on the CDC's recommended vaccines?  Few are!

The sad reality is that a lot of people against vaccines have no sense of personal or social responsibility - this also explains why people were outraged and complained about being quarantined or dis-invited to social events!

People also forget that during a pandemic - life will go on!"

The masks don't work when there is facial hair, as shown in the photo. The mask is supposed to form a tight seal around the nose and mouth. That's impossible with the facial hair. The straps are not supposed to cross. If they have to cross, the mask isn't fitted correctly. N95s have to be carefully fitted and fit tested.  And out of doors there is actually very little threat, unless someone is coughing directly into one's face. This is a waste of a precious commodity. At least have these people use the masks correctly! This is infuriating."

2020-03-04 20:24,"So Trump is back to blaming Obama for the delay in testing, saying he was prevented from testing by prior regulations.  If so, why did he wait to side-step those regulations like he does for anything he wants.  So now Pence proudly announces that the tests will be available for ""all Americans"" (once they finally catch up from the debacle of not testing or sharing information from CDC).  What does that mean?  My friend is Japanese and has had a green card for 10 years and contributes to society and pays a lot of taxes but has not become a citizen because Japan does not allow dual citizenship.   Is she prevented from getting tested?  What about all the other folks with green cards, the ""illegal"" immigrants whom we welcomed before Trump.

2020-03-04 21:24,"Containment is no longer a strategy. 

While epidemiologists devote hundreds of person-hours to contact tracing the select few people that have been tested, the hundreds to thousands of people that have not been tested yet carry the virus continue to roam freely, getting on flights, going to concerts, and taking the subway.  

The fact of that matter is that it is STILL far too difficult for even symptomatic people to get tested, let alone tested with a decent TAT. 

Good luck with that. Buckle in."

""Among people who catch seasonal flus, about 0.1 to 0.2 percent die from the illness,..."" and 
“Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported Covid-19 cases have died,”

You do realize those are two very different numbers and should not be compared? The first is the percentage of people who catch the flu while the second is the percentage of reported cases. The number of reported cases is often quite less than the actual number who have caught it. Our CDC estimates the actual cases of flu from the confirmed number using a model. 

When a model for estimating actual cases of Covid-19 from the confirmed number, a proper mortality can be calculated for it and compared to flu mortality.

The fact that the press continues to throw these numbers out as if they represent the same thing is irresponsible, in my view."

2020-03-04 21:54,"Can people get tested after they have just recovered from what they thought was a bad cold? (Ah, it might seem laughable, considering there are not that many tests available, but in an ideal situation with available tests.) I read that the incubation period for COVID19 is one to fourteen days, so one would think you could test people after the fact.

There could be many who've recently recovered from something like a cold or flu that with testing could be included in the numbers of COVID19 cases to better gauge the percentage of people who die. Of course, knowing that the elderly and immunocompromised are the most vulnerable.

I guess we rely on other countries' data where they are testing more efficiently."

This means people who have the virus are in Oregon society transmitting it (most of them).  At least our OEM is functioning, and it functions very well, thank goodness.

5% of 100 000 is 5000
5% of 1 000 000 is 50 000

The state on Oregon has at most around 300 ICU beds.  Washington may have around 500.  California has roughly 7000.  Most of these are occupied by patients with a variety of other problems, and ICU bed usage routinely hovers in the 95-100% range.  

Thus, for any hope of keeping the majority of the unlucky 5% alive with ICU support, containment is absolutely vital... wash your hands, cover your mouths when coughing, and avoid touching your face... slow the virus."

When hospital staff start coming down with symptoms... be sure to thank the Hospitals CEO, administrators and managers for the situation – because ultimately and all in the name of profit, it was their short sightedness that created the situation!

People forget that our hospitals and ER's are already stretched to the limits because of the current flu epidemic.  Next, throw in COVID-19, for which there is no agreed upon treatment or vaccine and see what that does to our health system.

Elderly people are more susceptible to contract the virus so best to limit your contact with elderly. At least 7 deaths occurred at Seattle area nursing home.  What’s wrong with this picture?  

People in nursing homes don’t go to Starbucks for coffee. They’re not social butterflies. Why? Because people in nursing never leave nursing homes. They’re too sick, weak, vulnerable. So how did they contract the virus? What risk do they pose?

We know people infected may be asymptomatic. Their immune systems absorb the virus, so detection of virus remains dormant. They appear—and are—healthy. They move about freely. They're lucky. However, they can be—and are—deadly. 

Furthermore, a high schooler tested positive for the virus, so their assessment about the elderly is unsustainable. That’s why this is a pandemic. 

Viruses do not discriminate. Especially one that creeps through a population slowly before symptoms appear—if they appear. So, once again, how did the elderly become infected? They blame the elderly for spreading the virus. But is that assessment sustainable? 

Consider who cares for the elderly. People from community who enter the facility. The elderly are the victims here. But not only the elderly, but entire communities. Those from the community who care for the elderly could be asymptomatic carriers who have yet to show symptoms. It appears that 1+1=2. Coincidental. 

They got it backwards.

“That was a decision we disagreed with,” he said. I don’t think we would have made it, but for some reason, it was made.”

It’s unclear what decision, exactly, Trump is referring to.

We are being lied to by our own government.  Pence is not leading an effective government response; he is the leading SPIN doctor pretending that the government is doing more than it is.

2020-03-05 2:28,"The WHO did not recommend travel bans, and still does not. The logic was that people would dodge the bans, that it would cause stigma and damage the economy. Meantime, the WHO has been praising China for using extraordinary internal travel bans. It sees different logic applies to travel bans inside countries compared to between countries. 

In the news recently was the story of a hospital employee who was told to isolate himself, he did not isolate himself, went to a meeting and later tested positive for COVID-19. So much for not restricting people leading to better outcomes. Even Australia is losing its nerve and saying that it cannot prevent travellers from every bad area. 

The WHO says that COVID-19 stigma is more dangerous than COVID-19 itself. I wonder if they mean by that that stigma has a 3.4% death rate and has killed more than 3000 people? 

The way to calculate death rate is deaths divided by deaths+recovered. So far, 3200 have died and 52000 have recovered. That is a 6% death rate. To be fair, that calculation for death rate decreases with time as it is the more severe cases that are detected at first. 

To protect myself. I have bought a few 3M welding-fume masks. They are so good at filtering things that they stop one smelling dead animals. Gasses are much smaller particles than viruses. Disclaimer: not a professional problem.

2020-03-04 13:19,"Pence which is a name rhyming with incompetence refused to say that the pandemic  is not a hoax. Parsing words and not offending the president was more important than just stating a simple fact.
I saw Trump questioning health professionals with a bullying smirk, about when  a vaccine would be ready. This was answered right in front of him days ago, the answer being 12-18 months. He kept repeating the question and trying to rephrase it as within a few months- even 2 or 3 months. The health professionals were clearly trying not to say it too directly to his theatrical clown mask. They they were obviously  afraid of answering although the answer was given a few days several times with him present.
On this occasion he seemed to be manically unable to accept the answer, which anyone paying attention knew was 12-18 months.
He just would not accept it. He seems to think he can alter reality to fit his personal convenience. It was sickening, repulsive, preposterous and downright frightening. It reminded me of those cabinet meetings when each GOP sycophant took turns to grovel shamelessly as he presided like a tin pot dictator. It did not seem very American to me- more like Papa Doc the anti-American Haitian despot."
2020-03-04 13:43,"For those who want to minimize the Coronavirus and say that it is lower because of undetected cases; keep in mind that if you calculate using current completed cases, the rate is a lot higher. Completed is dead or recovered. 51,026 recovered plus 3,214 dead is 54,240 completed. 3,214 out of 54,240 is 5.9%. So you are all correct, 5.9% will come down. The WHO is saying that will come down to 3.4%."

The Coronavirus is a reminder that regardless of our philosophies we are all human and in the face of this, if we wish to prosper, we must work together. With this challenge it is our pooling of knowledge, of expertise, of sharing what is working in one area with others, that will enable all humans to pass through this challenge.  We are all literally connected to each other, we are also good at different things and these two are what will get us through this crisis ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.""

Canada has tracked down and isolated every case and they say they have no community transmission to date.

The new coronavirus seems to be more contagious than most strains of the flu, and roughly as contagious as strains that appear in pandemic flu seasons..

And, he added, ""There has not yet been significant regulatory reform of diagnostics passed by Congress.

The buck stops at Trump's doorstep.  We dropped the ball.  The opportunity at the beginning of the outbreak was flawed here in the U.S. because there not only was a shortage of testing kits, but the early kits were flawed and not useable.  It is estimated that there were about six weeks lost with cases in Washington.  “A Seattle-area researcher said his genetic analysis shows the virus probably circulated undetected in the state for six weeks.”  This exposed more people.

Trump was concerned more about how the coronavirus would affect the Stock Market and his image than what was best for the people of this country.  ""South Korea as of 2/27/20 tested a total of 66,652 people for the COVID-19 coronavirus virus.  Japan had reported administering roughly 1,890 tests and the U.S. only 445.

2020-03-04 21:34,Can you give us any ACTUAL EVIDENCE that the stock market moved BECAUSE of Biden? No. Because markets don’t move because a candidate wins some primaries. I don’t care what it means to investors’ emotions. The market doesn’t work that way. It’s too big. Nobody knows for sure why the market does what it does on any one day. Stop shilling for Biden.
2020-03-04 21:35,"Last week the fall was based on the novel coronavirus, with no mentions of Bernie Sanders.  Yet a rebound after a steep fall is Joe Biden?  

Perhaps stock traders generally overreact to lots of factors.  The markets are not always linear or rational, but the rationalizations proliferate nonetheless."
2020-03-04 21:39,"Perhaps market also grew because of privatizing testing.  Pharmaceuticals, labs, and medical facilities will be over capacity. Medical debt collectors will be busy for years.  In addition, all types of antibacterial products are selling out nationwide.  Same with medical supplies and drug hoarding. Anecdotally, people are hauling carts full of bottled water, paper towels, tissues and such by the wagonload.  P&G?  How did their stock do today? And any tech that helps people work from home will gain.  
Loungewear should do well in the apparel sector!

Imagine, a man who might despoil the American dream of riches waiting for any man willing to put in a hard day’s work and leverage the fruits of that labour ten fold by betting big in the market. He dared take away that dream, and for what? Reasonable access to health care and education for every citizen? Living wages for a full day’s work? Trying to ensure the planet survives for his grand children? Imagine, standing in the way of the American Dream. Good riddance."

The reasoning was that Bernie would DEFINITELY lose to Trump, signaling a continuation of the low taxes and light regulation that investors love.

Now, stocks went up BECAUSE Biden did well on Super Tuesday. The reasoning being that it likely removes the possibility of a far left candidate.

These are very convenient after-the-fact rationalizations to maintain a consistent anti-progressive narrative."
2020-03-04 22:19,"“The strong result by Joe Biden in the Democratic primaries last night are a significant positive development for the market,” Marko Kolanovic, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients. “It likely removes the possibility of a far left candidate — a risk that was rattling markets last week.”

2020-03-04 22:36,"To the so-called moderate ‘left’: please stop buying what is being sold to you. The establishment ‘left’ has overseen the most unequal distribution of wealth in history. It has voted to repeal the separations between commercial and investment banking. It has supported legislation making it more difficult for working families to discharge credit card debt in bankruptcy. It has voted for the Iraq war. 
Is this what you thought they were campaigning for? Is this what aligns with your priorities?
To the people who can’t draw their attention away from Donald Trump: please stop engaging with the convenient fiction that he represents all that is evil. Our country is sick, and it’s not because of Donald Trump. But that narrative does conveniently help the truly powerful malign interests in our country. 
Just a friendly reminder in case you have been seduced, again, by the politicians and the media, and perhaps the (maybe secret) perception that the moderate ‘left’ will be better for your 401k."

Biden is reassuring to Wall St and the healthcare industry for the precise reasons that the rest of us should NOT be reassured.   With the middle class and the planet nearing extinction, and now with an epidemic facing us without  basics like healthcare and paid sick leave for everyone, we need CHANGE.   Not a restoration to 2015.

Beating Trump is an essential FIRST STEP, but remember: Trump and Trumpism are not going away.    We'll be in this fight for many years.  ""Healing the country"" cannot be done without taking on the causes of Trumpism: the loss of the American Dream as the utra-wealthy siphon the future from  our pockets.   Soaring rhetoric is not enough.

Biden may or may not be electable.  But until he indicates that he's willing to limit the perogatives and profits of Wall St and the healthcare industry---the interests that are now applauding his Super Tuesday success with stock price increases, I'm supporting Sanders.  

Think about it."

Ignore those variations and look for where the market will be after the election or after the first year of the new presidential term.  The main market mover at all times is the economy.  And right now it is being depressed by the coronavirus.  The effects of the epidemic have not been fully felt yet.  We can hope that those effects are short lived, say a month or two.  This is wishful thinking because Trump has yet to prove that his administration can stop the spread.  I live only a few miles from the heart of problem. King County testing is limited for now, with some potentially infected parties awaiting for promised testing that has been delayed for days, and failed to start weeks ago when coronavirus first threatened to come to the US.  In King County, gatherings have been canceled. My grandson's school will do teleteaching until April 13 to avoid kids spreading the disease in the classroom.  And Trump has rallies with more than 10,000 people!   This is not an effective way do stop the disease.  Whether Biden or Sanders is elected, we can expect medical care to be more available and affordable than Trump has delivered.   Only when coronavirus damage is stopped does the economy have a chance to recover, and with that the stock market.  Expect massive fluctuations up and down until that happens. Can Trump halt coronavirus?  I hope so but have serious doubts."

Those such as the homeless may well get tested as they really aren't likely to be pursued for payment but not those without medical insurance or with high-deductibles."
2020-03-04 14:21,"I called my Representative last week to suggest two things:
1. That the federal government cover all diagnostic and care costs relating to COVID-19 for all.
2. That the federal government give money to research institutions at universities and hospitals to study the virus as it moves. The information may help us the next time we face a similar threat. 

Both seem like great uses of taxpayer money to me."
2020-03-04 14:28,"Given the horrendous result if the Virus takes hold in the US the costs of the testing et al should be handled by the government - federal - state.

We all pay in different ways -hospitalization and/or death and the costs become huge.
Lets get our head squared away and pay for the testing and if necessary the hospitalization.  We will ALL benefit."

2020-03-04 14:49,"The government and insurers need to do some cost/benefit analysis.Making testing free and paying for hospitalization would be an incentive to have sick individuals come forward.They could be treated and prevented from exposing more people.Task one in a public health Emergency is to,identify and isolate-that is much cheaper than paying the costs for a full blown , widespread epidemic."
2020-03-04 14:51,"The fact that we have a private, for-profit healthcare system will mean the pandemic will look very different in the United States. People who cant afford big medical bills for isolation and treatment will avoid getting tested at all until direly sick.  Before then, they will stay in the community and spread the virus. This wont just be low income folks but also middle income folks who are living close to the edge.  Our choice of healthcare system will result in a much worse epidemic than other countries."
2020-03-04 14:58,"What about all those studies that allegedly show how much people ""love"" their private health insurance?  Could that somehow be an exaggeration or even a complete and utter falsehood by those seeking to preserve the current system?"

The Coronavirus/COVID crisis continues to worsen, not only in America, but across the world.
The testing fiasco is only one example, and it will not be the last.
Widespread testing on the West Coast and elsewhere will show thousands of cases of Coronavirus, and more deaths that had been attributed to something else.
Economic disruption from the pandemic will lead to a worldwide recession.

2020-03-04 15:13,"Ah, suddenly in a crisis we care about people having access to medical care? That seems to have more to do with making sure this administration doesn’t look bad rather than it does with the principle of ensuring people can access affordable healthcare regardless of their background."
2020-03-04 15:19,"The government, right now, should fix the prices that can be charged by doctors, hospitals, labs, pharmacies, ambulances, etc. for coronavirus related expenses and be billed directly - and make the penalties for fraud scary.

If there was ever a flashpoint moment demonstrating how crucial public healthcare is, this is it."
2020-03-04 15:19,"To the extent that reimbursement and access to care can be influenced at the start level, we may have an interesting experiment here.

Wow- what a concept. But why did it take to the year 2020 and a terrifying pandemic for this to be considered? Maybe the rich are thinking that a healthy population might just be the most important thing to ensure their own longevity and continued wealth...."
2020-03-04 15:33,"This is why we need universal healthcare. Stop the insurance craziness.  Yes people that are uninsured will avoid the emergency room and ambulances and they need to be covered, but a problem for the middle class, too.  Who wants to pay $14,000 for deductible?  Maybe the coronavirus will catapult us into Medicare for all."
2020-03-04 15:34,Under my ACA insurance plan I pay 100 percent of costs up to $7200. Being tested for Covid-19 largely needs to be done for public health reasons in order to do our best to contain spread of the virus and should be paid for publicly if the effort is to succeed.
2020-03-04 15:36,"Senator Murray must know that deductibles and co-payments are a huge barrier to care in Washington State. Hospitals make the problem much worse by suing patients afterward; bankruptcy is just the tip of the iceberg. In Jefferson County across the ferry from Seattle, nearly 10,000 patients have been sent to collection since 2013, and hundreds have been sued. The average gross wage of families who don't declare bankruptcy and whose wages are garnished? $36,000. Medical debt has become the number one civil legal problem according to a Supreme Court survey. Hospitals ignore charity care law.

Of course it's not as bad as Kansas where they throw people in jail for failing to show up for medical debt hearings.

Senator Murray, short of waiving deductibles and co-payments, please consider national legislation to outlaw sending patients to collection and suing them for medical debt which they do not choose, and which is driving Americans further into poverty."

Umm, why should this idea be restricted to symptoms of Covid-19? 

Yes, lets be sure to lolly gag around and  spend a LOT of time talking about this novel concept of not dissuading people from seeking medical help due to concerns over not being able to afford it."
2020-03-04 15:52,I hope the NYT will pursue this issue. I’d like to see the topic of payment raised at the daily briefing with the VP. Are the insurers at the table with the other response team members? It seems we ignore the significance of and direct impact on individuals of the cost of receiving heath care.
2020-03-04 15:56,"Waiving the fees and expenses for testing coronavirus and treatment of those infected is the only real solution in the US to ensure folks get help when needed.

Many people will not get tested and spread the virus if they are staring down a $3,000 bill just to get tested.  I hope every state in the union takes New York's lead."
2020-03-04 16:00,"This is a rather illuminating story. It seems incomprehensible that a first world country would need legislation to enable affordable access to medical care for treatment of a flu. We are not talking of a complex or resource intensive medical procedure here but instead a simple and relatively inexpensive test and corresponding course of treatment. There is no where else in the western industrialized world where such an issue would be a factor in devising a protocol for flu treatment.
  The simple conclusion is that private, for profit health insurance makes illness or injury in an otherwise civilized country a possible financial disaster. The ""competition"" that is supposed to naturally limit profit taking in the medical industry is in fact a competition to maximize profits.
  I would urge U.S. residents to re-examine their thinking regarding medical care; with a view to determining if profit at the expense of the individual's health and well being is a morally defensible position in 2020.
 You have a constitutional  right to life,  liberty,  and the  pursuit of happiness, founding principles that inspired the rest of the world. ... Perhaps now it would be advisable to let the rest of the world inspire you to consider the premise that these aforementioned constitutional rights are in-congruent with such a uniquely punitive and  outdated healthcare system"
2020-03-04 16:02,"In a medical crisis, if health care is not universally available to all people, we all are endangered.  this should be an important lesson about the need for universal health care in general too.

2020-03-04 16:12,"Well, it's true. I won't go and get tested if I feel ill, since 1) my doctor wouldn't see me for about 8 weeks, and 2) I have no idea how much it would cost. So I won't go. I'll stay home and hope for the best. And so will millions of others I'm afraid. Private health companies will make a profit until we die."
2020-03-04 16:17,"I think it will be good to make medical care free for coronovirus cases / suspected cases as well and not just testing. The less well-off are the ones most vulnerable to the virus as they cannot afford masks or sanitisers or others basic hygiene measures that the richer people can. Plus expensive medical care, they will want to get tested and seek medical care - thus increasing spread in the community. 

Paying for medical care for coronovirus is not new or novel. Some countries are already doing it, such as in the Asian country of Singapore, which allowed it to quickly put the virus spread under control in the country and people are willing to go to get tested."
2020-03-04 16:18,"The effete elite just don't get it. I've been working 60 hours a week with two part-time jobs, neither of which offered insurance. The better paying job has been precarious for a year and a half, threatening to shut its doors due to the poor economy. So during each ACA enrollment period, I didn't opt in, because I didn't know if I would have the funds to buy the not-so-affordable insurance plans. Sure enough, that job folded mid-January. The remaining gig? It pays $3 to $5 per hour. The only thing going for me is that I haven't procrastinated, and have been using gloves, Lysol wipes, hand sanitizers, hand washing and social distancing for at least six weeks. And I've got a two month supply of food and water stockpiled. Bring on the zombies."
2020-03-04 16:24,"Free testing is critical.  I can vouch for that from personal experience: as a former nurse, I’m sure I have CoVid19, but no way am I going to pay over $3,000 to verify it.  It’s unbelievable to me that our country got caught so flat-footed.  There was more than enough time to at least prepare for testing!  I’ve been laying in personal supplies for over two weeks, but our government seems to have done nothing.  That’s “American Exceptionalism” at work.  Hubris."

2020-03-04 16:53,The US is the wildcard in this potential pandemic.  The rest of the developed world has socialized health care where as the US has a pay for play system.  My fear is that people with the virus with avoid getting tested due to the potential costs which could  cause a mass outbreak.

2020-03-04 16:23,"Pence said Medicare and Medicaid would pay for testing.  How generous, Mr. Pence.  Just as the Supreme Court takes on the legitimacy of the Affordable Care Act - you know, the healthcare insurance that gives those afflicted with pre-existing conditions a lease on life?  

The ineptness, lack of medical knowledge, of those at the helm is almost mystifying.  They just have no clue.  Pence has no understanding of the resources of Medicare and Medicaid - and furthermore - Trump is threatening and pushing to defund those programs!  Also Social Security which affects people with disabilities to begin with! 

Too little too late.  While China was multiplying germs exponentially, what was the US doing?  What would we expect from Donald Trump?  Wake up, people.

Her daughter was told she can’t be tested because she doesn’t meet “criteria” but her father works for a company that has an employee with active infection. What’s wrong with this picture? Why aren’t free tests being actively deployed for any potential contagious person? We know people can be contagious even without symptoms! 

This is a breakdown of epic proportions due to: lack of preparation, poor communication with state & local governments; poor coordination & integration with state, local & international governments; lack of policy development at federal level; lack of protocols for testing; lack of safety standards & training  for quarantines and communication with state & local governments; and finally: lack of training, lack of protective gear, lack of testing kits & poor communication for emergency & health officials who have patient contact."
2020-03-04 14:29,"If the federal government and the GOP doesn't understand why this is important, they need to have the meaning of ""community spread"" and ""public health"" explained to them.

Beating this virus is not going to happen if we regard it as another for-profit venture, designed to enrich the President and members of his Cabinet.  Sorry, guys--this one isn't going to work unless you think of it being for the entire US of A, Democrats, sanctuary states and Puerto Rico included!"
2020-03-04 14:34,"This is exactly why the US needs medical care for all payed for by a fair tax system. If people are offering insurance with the aim of making money, they will not forego profit for public welfare. The flip side of that is just what we have in this article - if people with limited means are going to have to pay money they don’t have, they will not seek medical help and will continue to go to work and take public transport, spreading the virus as they go.

Similarly, people with no sick leave can not stay home in self quarantine. You can’t expect them to choose financial ruin for the common good.

The US is the only modern democracy with no national health care. I am very afraid your country is about to pay a terrible cost. People will die. Make it all free now. It may not yet be too late. Surely the “best country in the world” can see its way to do the only possible thing that can mitigate the inevitable deaths of thousands of its citizens."

That sort of foggy thinking is keeping thousands of people in Mexico and other countries from getting free medical care in the US.
2020-03-04 14:55,"It is absolutely shameful that Alex Azar, whose qualifications to head HHS seem to be only that he was a pharmaceutical CEO and lobbyist, has implied that the vaccine for the coronavirus might not be affordable to poor people because the drug companies creating it need their profit margin.  What is “public health” after all, if not a way to ensure that the public is healthy?"

Most self-employed people who earn a decent living can now only afford policies that are basically bankruptcy protection.  We need to start recognizing how widespread medical care access is- maybe this experience will help to illuminate the issue.
2020-03-04 16:16,"You better believe I'm not getting tested if I come down with a cough/fever. It's the start of the year, I have a $2000 deductible, that's a huge chunk of my overall savings, and who knows how much more it would cost me after that. 

This testing needs to be FREE and I hope the conversation about how absolutely ridiculous it is that people have to pay anything  related to covid19 helps lead us to the universal health care we all deserve."

D) provide for the common defence, 
E) promote the general Welfare, 
F) and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,

2020-03-04 17:06,"Envision this:  some group you are associated with (work, school, gym, ...) has a member that tests positive for this coronavirus.  They want all the contacts to be tested.  With the majority of people not on a gold plated medical plan, that is a couple of hundred dollars each (physician + test).  Even if you are showing symptoms, what difference will testing make to you?  Mostly if you are sick you stay home anyway;  some companies encourage this to avoid contagion, but this is nothing new.  

People want to read the news and know the results, at least until the bill is up close and personal.  Then, not so much.  The system is generally designed this way, to dissuade use that isn't necessary to improve YOUR health (cynical fine print:  and the health of the CEO's wallet).  Improving community health isn't a feature with a few specified exceptions like vaccinations.  Coronavirus isn't an exception, so the user gets to directly pay even though coronavirus testing will not improve the user's health."

2020-03-04 17:23,"It is nice and wise of the New York State to consider waiving fees for the coronavirus tests and treatment. Failure of other States to follow suit will only result in the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the nation and in the bordering countries like Canada, Mexico and beyond. The insurance companies should put their greed aside and stop playing games with the lives of people who cannot afford to pay the fees, for a change. Is it any wonder Bernie Sanders’ proposed policy of free Medicare for all resonates with the masses. I wish the short sighted politicians and health insurance companies took cost of human life into consideration first instead of their bottomline. If they haven’t learned the lesson from the global carnage caused by the spread of coronavirus yet, they never will."
2020-03-04 17:27,"At first I thought you were asking for not-for-profit to actually mean not-for-profit. Then I realized it was about asking taxpayers to pay for the costs. Where I live, a lot of medical facilities and hospitals are owned by the DeVos family, and they are known to charge more. Hospitals have to waive their profits on this one, and fair prices established. I'm fine with paying for the poor and destitute, or even for medical professionals, but not for the ultra wealthy to become wealthier."

2020-03-04 17:30,"You can't test, quarantine, and vaccinate an entire population by reducing certain health care costs to a ""small fee."" You can't have a ""little bit"" of single payer. It's like trying to fix a flat tire by patching most of the holes. 

1. Adam Smith, who praised the free market in Wealth of Nations, also wrote that health care is an appropriate function of government. Smith was familiar with plagues, quarantines, and vaccinations. 

2. The 1974 Rand Health Insurance experiment was a randomized controlled trial to find out how people respond to financial incentives. They found that even a small charge will make patients more likely to skip life-saving, cost-efficient medical expenses, like blood pressure drugs. This has been confirmed ever since, in journals like NEJM and JAMA. 

3. People either have adequate health care, and get into the habit of going to the doctor with problems, or they don't. More people get mammograms if it's part of comprehensive coverage (like a union ""Cadillac plan"" or the VA system), than they do if mammograms are promoted as a special service to a targeted community. 

4. Only a national health care system can handle an epidemic (or any other health problem I can think of). We have (had) our chance to make this our national goal, by voting for Bernie Sanders. The Democratic Party establishment, and their donors, may have prevented that. 

We need new Democrats."

2020-03-04 19:58,"The current epidemic exposes the real dangers of our current private healthcare insurance system.   Healthcare isn't a private consumer good like clothing, televisions, or hairstyling.  The majority of Americans, not just those 27 million without insurance, need to weigh the financial costs of seeking medical care when they're ill.   The bottom half of Americans make an average of $10.22 per hour (source: Brookings Institution), so ANY deductible and co-payments affect their ability to pay the rent and make car payments.  A wrong decision can lead to the loss of their apartment or job.

The absurdity is that even those who are ""better off"" face exposure to this disease every day, unless they stay home until it ""blows over"" (or until the next epidemic).   Because service workers are the least likely to have insurance, paid sick leave, or be able to afford the deductibles and co-payments, the ""better off"" can't even go out to eat, to exercise class, or take a bus or an Uber.   Going to a party, a community meeting, or a concert is already risky in many places.

So are we, as a society, going to decide to ""save money"" by tweaking the edges of our current healthcare system?   Are we going to sacrifice civilized  life in order to avoid taxes? 
Simply expanding Obamacare leaves high deductibles and co-pays in place, and doesn't reduce costs.  It's well known that Medicare for All would reduce current costs by HALF.   We need to get there to protect all of us."

Were we just pretending China, Italy, South Korea and Iran don't exist and their struggles weren't real? 

To call this administration's response ""inept"" is a gross understatement. It's unacceptable to accept this level of dysfunction in a crisis. This is criminal negligence on this administration's part and they must not be allowed to walk away from those charges. 

I can only hope that all scientists and that the CDC, from this moment onward, ignore the administration entirely. It is unconstitutional to have to funnel scientific data through Pence, the great science denier.

2020-03-03 21:43,"Industrialized nations (G &7) need to do what China did. They need to place people under quarantine and provide free medical care to those suffering from the virus. Even though it seemed heavy handed, it is the only way that the virus will be contained. Of course, there will be a negative economic impact from the quarantine, but it will a lot less than dealing with a major outbreak, many deaths, and a major recession. So governments and corporations need to bite the bullet and pay the price of prevention, which is a lot lower than the price of treatment and its aftermath. Stop saying that people need to wash their hands well. That is not the answer. Make sure people can stay home instead of getting infected and spreading the infection left and right regardless of how well they wash their hands."
2020-03-03 21:47,"This pandemic was a catastrophe waiting to happen.

In 2018, Trump and the Republicans disbanded the office in Homeland Security that managed global pandemics.  They also cut funding for the Center for Disease Control, forcing them to reducing their monitoring of infectious diseases in other countries from 39 to 10.  One of the countries where monitoring stopped was China, where Covid-19 first appeared.

When the pandemic first appeared, the president's only concern was the stock market, since that was key to his reelection.  He blamed the MSM and the Democrats for the stock market and tried to calm the markets by proclaiming that the pandemic was no big deal.  

The public needed a clear understanding of the pandemic, but Trump is the least transparent president in living memory.  Instead of having a infectious disease expert like Dr. Anthony Fauci lead the effort, he assigned that role to VP Pence, a science-denier who Trump could trust to keep the bad news away from the public.  That was a fool's errand.

Trump didn't create Covid-19, but his response to the pandemic is shameful.  He weakened our ability to respond and then tried to keep the American people in the dark."
2020-03-03 21:50,"Economic tricks won't calm nervous citizens.  Facts, science,  competency can help reduce fears, but they won't ever go away until people believe the worst is over.  The world is nowhere near that yet."
2020-03-03 21:51,"I find it hard to believe that the US government didn’t have a plan in place for such an event.  We spend billions on military and planning for such events.

Republicans must take ownership of this system.  And moderates as well.  The only people providing solutions have been progressives with rational policy that will drive down medical costs and help us act in situations such as this.

Right me it appears evident that isn’t possible nor will it happen.  And anyone telling medical professionals they have the virus and isn’t properly covered risks losing any and all assets.  Maybe even their jobs as well.

We can get through this.  Traditional power structures based on aristocratic models of wealth distribution though will yield the results of ages past.

Either we step up as a species together or we fail together.  Right now we are choosing to protect the few at the expense of the many and choosing to fail.

Jobs programs, monetary backstops, medical infrastructure preparation.  All of these things can be done if we had better leadership.  And republicans have proven they are in able of this."
2020-03-03 21:55,"Seems money does not solve all problems, a reality the money-counters don't seem to grasp. Human beings are essentially children of the planet, susceptible to its vagaries and diseases...nothing a banker can do about that...but politicians can move to make this as bearable as possible with free medical care and rapid-response/testing/quarantines etc."
2020-03-03 21:55,"Fiscal policy, folks. Why no one’s trying probably has to do with the elites’ ignorance of basic economics. No, we don’t have a debt problem, and with interest rates so low it makes sense to take out a low-interest loan and finance some infrastructure spending or whatever is your pet project. That would inject billions into the economy. My spending is your income, and your spending is my income. Problem solved."
2020-03-03 21:59,Interest rates and tax cuts will only feed the rich.
2020-03-03 22:10,"The U.S. does not need additional economic stimulus as much as it needs competent leadership with any grasp of how to deal with science based problems.  Diagnosing problems, assembling experts and then allowing them to execute a workable/realistic strategy should be the way forward.  This administration has absolutely no clue what to do and it is mortifying to watch as lives are put at risk."
2020-03-03 22:11,Could that be that they so much don’t care about us that for them it does not matter if we are dead? Do they live so much in their bubble that they honestly really! don’t see us? Of all things in the world is that it? We are invisible for them. And they keep playing their elite lonely game longer and longer. And we? Are just quiet?
2020-03-03 21:51,"Went to COSTCO today, store opened at 10am, very few customers at that hour. Left about 30 minutes later, parking lot full, most shopping carts taken, some folks wearing surgical masks, and you could sense the panic buying. And it was only 10:30am.

Cutting interest rates was not on people's mind."
2020-03-03 21:53,"""...governments must unleash the power of their budgets. They must transcend their aversion to spending money and increase taxes on wealthy people to secure the revenue to build more infrastructure and bolster government programs."" Never, never going to happen, especially when some $86 billion will be coming due for oil companies in 2024. Additionally, there is SO MUCH leveraged-debt out there and the current returns on equity are WAY low. Where's the money going to come from? Not. Thus, watch the virus move to the southern hemisphere during the turn of seasons there (note the NYT's maps), and let's see where China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative goes in South America and Africa. The loss on those equity returns will be staggering, so as Paul Krugman just wrote, ""...here comes the bump. Brace yourself."" BTW: this particular coronavirus: SARS-CoV-2 and its attendant disease COVID-19 are masking with other, benign coronaviruses. In essence, piggybacking to survive and thrive. That's why they're asymptomatic until they're not; then suddenly detectable. Expect the caseload to spike in the U.S., now that the CDC has FINALLY constructed testing apparatus that works (the CDC, and U.S. exceptionalism-fantasy, blew off both So. Korea and Germany that had great testing apparatus to begin with...How's that for ""innovation"" at crisis mode??). Great article; just wish oligarchical-and-industry-controlled-governments thought long-term. They don't."
2020-03-03 22:18,"Monetary policy is not the problem-public health policy is.The Fed can lower interest rates with the stroke of a pen.Public Health policy is tedious and expensive and does not show immediate and satisfying results.Too many are addicted to a quick and visible solution.If the government were serious about calming the markets they would roll out a program for extensive testing( thousands a day) provision for loans for small business, an extension of sick leave for affected individuals and a number of other practical solutions.Trump wants to minimize the threat so that he can bask in the glory of his decision to ban flights from China.That was easy and a no brainer.It did not prevent the virus from coming here and now because of lack of testing there are many more cases which will eventually shock the system.There will be no preventive medicine for over a year and springtime will not stop the virus.-back to the tedious work of public health ,amelioration and prevention."
2020-03-03 21:55,"Congrats hedge fund managers and ultrarich investors on your 15 minutes of profiteering. Everybody else, you now have less."
2020-03-03 22:22,"What did they expect? If the fundamentals of the economy are sound, the chairman of the Fed and treasure secretary should sit tight and ride the wave of bad news because no monetary policy can solve the problem. However, an emergency rate cut, which was used after the 2008 financial meltdown or after 2001 terrorist attack, is required, this points out either, weak economic fundamentals or a worst health crisis then we were lead to believe. Therefore it justify the days sellout."
2020-03-03 22:27,"The public health response and messaging around COVID-19 in the United States has been about as miserable as it could possibly be. Markets thrive on clarity of information and we have nothing like that at the moment. Part of this is the virus - we don't know all there is to know about COVID-19 - but the remainder is due to the scientific illiteracy of Donald Trump. The US president appears intellectually incapable of understanding the true nature of the crisis and is therefore unable to provide competent leadership. This is one of those times where a president can actually make a major difference in how people view and respond to the history unfolding before their eyes. Donald Trump has failed to me this moment, completely."
2020-03-03 22:30,"Perhaps the threat of this pandemic will expose the sham that is monetary policy and currency trading and bundling bad debt into AAA rated “financial instruments”, or any of the thousands of other imaginary ways that paper profits get traded. Maybe we will retool some of that system to actually value labor, time, and productivity where it should be.

But probably not."
2020-03-03 22:34,"And the distribution from poor to rich continues.  No one is not borrowing because rates are too high, no one goes in to business to make a 1% return. This helps highly leveraged rich people who are able to take advantage of bank finance. For those on pensions and other fixed incomes it leads to more hardship as inflation, yes it isn’t zero, eats in to their savings. Everything over the last 20 years has led to inequality and the Cebtral Banks are in the vanguard."
2020-03-03 22:35,If this administration believes it is appropriate to divert Congressional  appropriations for the military to build a wall why would it not agree to divert significantly more military funds to support the general economy and health of the population? Doing so would not increase the national debt but it may help avert an economic downturn.
2020-03-03 22:36,"The world cannot withstand continued growth with economics based on growth. We appear to prefer status quo growth now and ignore the future.
The virus is giving us an opportunity to control growth by figuring out where the excesses are, rather than  controlling growth by running into a wall. 
Also, if we had a controlled world population we probably would not get pandenmics like this with regularlity. They breed in  overcrowded situations. 
Cutting out material excess is good practise for the future. 
Either we develop living conditions that protect the earth and provide a safe environment with enough space to survive or we don't. It is either we succeed, or the choice will be taken from us. Either way, the population will be reduced. But it is better to take the way that gives us the control. The whole world surely must understand this by now."
2020-03-03 22:36,"Interest rate cuts don’t treat Covid-19. 

It’s simple. Why doesn’t trump understand?"
2020-03-03 22:43,"We deserve it, given the damage we've wrought on this planet.

I'm still working on finding treatments for COVID19 but humanity's behaviour against itself and the environment is severely disappointing."
2020-03-03 22:43,"Good article. Sadly, the Fed’s cut today was knee-jerk and now leaves little room for further cuts if we really do hit a recession. One wonders if Trump’s pressure on Powell pushed him to react emotionally when we need him and the Fed to be more rational for the long-term viability of the country. The reality is that the coronovirus will impact economic growth in short term but it is unlikely to be systemic as was the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession."
2020-03-03 22:49,"The author properly notes that there are remedies available, not simply psychological bromides:  ""Governments have tools that could limit the costs, but have been reluctant to use them, economists said. They could give cash to employees whose workplaces are shut, provide credit to small businesses and offer rescue packages to industries most affected, like airlines and other tourism-related concerns.""  

Meanwhile, Trump's team has stated that the tariffs with China remain in place.  I have a question for the author.  Does such a policy make sense at a time like this?"
2020-03-03 22:54,"The coronavirus crisis is a human biological health medical science issue dealing with a novel infectious agent. 

Science is the only possible answer. Not economics nor politics

There is no science in economics nor politics. There are too many variables and unknowns to craft the double-blind and/or randomized controlled experimental tests that provide predictable and repeatable results."
2020-03-03 23:03,"While it is absolutely clear that Trump and his administration have done an unspeakably bad job of preparing for the impact of the coronavirus, I have to acknowledge that in one respect Trump has done the right thing, although for the wrong reasons.

Specifically, Trump has been dancing furiously to downplay the threat from the coronavirus for political purposes.  But by downplaying the threat for (inexcusably) wrong reasons, he has helped to keep the Chicken Littles of our nation somewhat in check.  People are already almost out of control.  They've rushed out and bought up every available mask (to the detriment of doctors, nurses and others whose jobs require them to protect their lungs) even though masks apparently are ineffective.  And they've even cleaned out supermarket shelves of bottled water -- as if water won't keep coming out of our faucets. 

I do think the government urging calm is critical at this time.  But at the same time, the government needs to be doing everything in its power to adequately prepare for widespread infections here.  By muzzling Anthony Fauci at NIH, having Pence-the-Enforcer silencing honest government reporting on the virus situation, holding zero White House press conferences, etc., we are forced to conclude that this Administration is doing what it can to hide its incompetence and is, in fact, not doing everything in its power to adequately address the coronavirus situation.  The stock market seems to agree."
2020-03-03 23:08,"Peter Goodman, we used to say, you can’t push on a string. Marcus Nadler ran Money Marketeers. Henry was involved. So was Cy. The economy will contract. Markets were extended. 1600 pushed equity. The FED crushed interest rates. Some are negative. That’s deflationary. Monetization crushes the common denominator: currency. We are hurting savers and those on fixed wages. 

Politicians never get it. Mike gets it. He trained in bonds. Bonds are 95% of all value in securities. 

The pandemic will not respond to any treatment. Quarantine will not do it. Our immune systems will save us or we will die. We are 81 and 84. We get it. Closing the borders will not matter. “Herd” health matters. Carriers may be well. The elderly are always at risk. 

Keep your eye on Mike. UBER drivers I’ve used like him. All are naturalized. Hard working. All seem to like Mike. That’s my private poll. 

I like Mike. Let’s get serious. We are in a mess."
2020-03-03 23:10,I’m not a fan of Boris Johnson but his address today on the UK government’s plan of action to deal with the coronavirus threat was far more enlightening and rational than anything coming out of the US administration.
2020-03-03 23:13,"When we sooner-than-later find ourselves in another recession, the Federal Reserve will have virtually no wiggle room to lower interest rates further and blunt the economic impact. The Fed has been acting on behalf of Trump’s re-election efforts, not the best interest of the American people. We will all pay the price and the next democratic president will once again be tasked with cleaning up the fiscal hot mess of the previous republican administration. Do American voters have no learning curve when it comes to politics? I would be grateful to anyone who can explain this maddening phenomenon. Vote blue no matter who this November like your savings accounts and lives depend on it, because they do."
2020-03-03 23:46,The worrying thing is that we maybe in a lull before the real storm. The virus does not give a stuff about man made economic models etc. I still think that many politicians seem to think that the virus needs to behave itself because of our political needs...hubris...hubris...hubris. Also it is now about 2 weeks since many of the Chinese factories re-opened. Any reasonable person would expect an increase in reported infections but according to officials these are close to zero! This would defy commonsense. Sadly I think that that Xi and his cronies are saying this to take pressure off themselves especially since it is now appearing in great numbers elsewhere.
2020-03-03 23:50,"America is a special case. Only here in America are millions uninsured and most everyone else is afraid to go to the doctor or hospital because of cost. We have Secretary of Health Azar who says private labs should make test kits because we can't have price controls.

When you speak of economic measures to fight the virus, the outcome in America will not be affected by monetary policy, it will be determined by our uniquely poor healthcare system compared to other industrialized countries."
2020-03-04 0:21,"China should be sued in an international court for this catastrophe, there is ample evidence for the prosecution. The proceeds should go to the families of the dead, to research institutes and education."
2020-03-04 0:21,"In this age of globalization it has become obvious that the United States must be always prepared to respond to outbreaks of any communicable disease in any part of the world which could eventually find its way here.  A huge reason to do so is to minimize the spread to, and impact of these diseases on the American populace.  George W. Bush established a pandemic influenza preparedness program which was used to great effect to combat the SARS outbreak in 2003 and this program was left in place. Obama expanded the program to combat Ebola, Zika, and other communicable disease outbreaks during his presidency.  
And in 2018, the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure.  He really is a terrible president and an awful person.
I have learned that Arizona clinics in areas that have Coved-19 victims still have not received test kits.  Americans should be worried."
2020-03-04 0:36,"Yes, it makes sense. Our Twitter in Chief cut taxes for the rich two years ago, now he doesn't have the needed resources to fight the virus epidemic. 
As he tries to prevent the side effects of this threat by lowering the interest rate, he appears to me as Don Quixote charging the windmills."
2020-03-04 1:05,"The financial system does not control the two key parameters in what is now an inevitable global pandemic - transmission and mortality rate.

The WHO today confirmed a 3.4% mortality rate.  I have been saying for over a month that the number was at least 3.4% and the earlier 2%-2.5% rates were too low, which fostered a sense of complacency leading to a failure of global leadership. Meanwhile, the rate of infection over the past few weeks has consistently indicated a 10% increase in reported cases every week to 10 days. That means over 10 million infections globally by year-end and deaths in the hundreds of thousands and an equal number of survivors in ICU or on ventilators. And that will not be the end of the pandemic.

Time to stop fiddling with financial response and move to all out government mobilization on the health front. We are stuck with the death rate. We can do something about prevention."
2020-03-03 22:50,"Rate cuts will never treat a stock market decline from Corona virus.... only a massive coordinated response from the federal government would have any effect. On the scale that China was able to mount...every case isolated, all contacts quarantined using AI, hospitals built in a week, food supply stabilized, superb free medical care....all not happening with the Trump government."
2020-03-04 1:21,"The author states:The move “could easily backfire by hinting that something extremely negative is about to come over the hill, possibly a recession.”

This suggests that investor sentiment can worsen a recession as distinct from driving down asset prices.  My view is that there is another cause that can worsen a recession. I believe that in the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the management of corporate oligopolies decided en masse that the ""right"" response was to cut head count by 10%. Magically, the unemployment rate soon went to 10% based on the decision of a small elite.

Let's hope that this time corporate managements decide (or are forced)  to do what's best for society, and not follow their misguided animal instincts for self-preservation."
2020-03-04 0:55,"There was the same battle when Obama was guiding us through the bank collapse of 2009. The bailout packages were fought tooth and nail by Republicans. Especially, the package for the automakers. Not only should we have passed ACA, but a much needed infrastructure spend, which we are still yet to see. The underbelly of all of it goes beyond the obvious life and death struggle during the virus crisis. I strikes average Americans with an opiate crisis, veterans with PTSD and children with disabilities. The great nation that defeated fascism and communism and made the world safe for Democracy can do so much better. Just not with the Republican sycophants and shills who are part of the Trump cult. Shame on them all."
2020-03-03 22:34,"It is sickening that trump continues to lie about the availability “very soon” of a vaccine for Covid-19. It’s still so far away that it may not help much. 

And, by the way, it’s not a treatment or cure. It won’t help people who have contracted the virus. 

False hope is worse than no hope. We have to live with the truth, whatever it may be. 

We need a leader who acts but not one who couldn’t recognize the truth if it hit him in the face. 

The current situation calls for a plan to contain the coronavirus since a proven treatment is unavailable. Who is doing that? Certainly neither the president nor his czar pence."
2020-03-03 23:03,"They don't know what to do, so they did it."
2020-03-03 23:13,"Some policy makers are worse than a contagious disease. Jack Welch surrendered GE to China and all corporate America was infected with his policy to sell out USA for short term profits. But trade with China is suicide; thru trade, we build China’s empire, their military, their spy network and human rights abuses"
2020-03-04 1:25,"This type of crisis needs to be managed with scientists and healthcare professionals. Politicians are making it worse and misguided economic policy is adding to the panic. I just wonder if Trump and his minions are still referring to it as a Democratic hoax. As the virus spreads and the death toll rises, we are reminded of how reckless, dangerous and counterproductive such statements can be."
2020-03-04 1:32,"If interest rates are to be cut to save the economy, don't cut the rates for bankers. Cut the rates on student loans, past and present.

We don't need ""free college"". We do need to let the young people of America pay the same 1% or so on those student loans as the bankers are paying the fed on their loans. Soon there will be millions of people getting off the debt treadmill and into the market for all sorts of goods. That's what the economy will really need."

That policy was used by Germany following the 2008 recession.   Known as Kurzarbeit [1].   

2.  As pointed out in the article , the impact is on the supply side.  When supplies decrease, prices rise.    In that case the standard monetary policy is to increase, not decrease the interest rate

2020-03-04 1:33,"Like many Americans, Peter S. Goodman does not give Donald Trump enough credit for preparing America for the Coronavirus.  First, to cut costs in 2018, Donald Trump  shrewdly fired the U.S. pandemic response team.  More brilliantly Donald Trump's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal included a 16 percent reduction in CDC funding from the 2020 spending levels.  American's on the left are always criticizing the high level of corruption in the Trump administration, but his administration may be more rememberd for its spectacular level of incompetence."
2020-03-04 2:15,"Since the coronavirus is projected to ""get out"" into the general public in a big way in the near future, is trying to ""track down"" analyze the source of the virus for each patient and who they might have exposed to the virus the best way to expend resources?

For example, the minute someone who comes down with it is shown to have taken the subway or the LIRR during rush hour, there will be no way to track everyone who was exposed.  There will be thousands of potential cases all over the City, and no way to identify who they might be.

It seems like it would be more effective to put the money into rapid testing and expanding sites that can receive patients using proper protocols if/when there are outbreaks."
2020-03-04 2:25,"The usual abuse of fiscal policies by politicians put all the weight of keeping a healthy economy on the shoulders of central banks, which are given too many tasks and few instruments, just monetary policy. Many years ago, I learned while in college that you assign one instrument to each economic target. But we want the FED  to manage shocks, coronavirus, unemployment and inflation.

2020-03-04 4:24,"Delighted to see a columnist state right out in plain words that governments have been happy to spend lavishly on tax breaks for the wealthy (persons and businesses) but reluctant, at best, to spend on what benefits ordinary people.  British Tory austerity is only the most extreme such case I know of (barring the forced contaction of Greece's economy at the expense of the populace)."
2020-03-04 11:18,"Why is it the only thing never mentioned by supposedly ""brilliant"" economists is raising wages?  More people with more money means more spending.

This college graduate has now been living an austere existence for over 20 years.  No money for new cars.  No money for house repairs. (Guess I was lucky I already had a house.)  I've bought department store clothes 2x in the last 20 years.  I'm still using furniture inherited from grandparents and a bedroom suite bought by my parents when I was 10.  I've not had health insurance for most of the last 2 decades.  We do movies maybe 2x a year.  A dinner of more than $25 has been a rare occurrence.  I've not any air travel but twice until last summer in over a decade.

I'm afraid my experience is more typical of the American populace than is generally known or admitted."
2020-03-04 11:54,Rates were already low. The Fed’s “surprise” (?) action is consistent with recent knee-jerks supposedly not influenced by Trump. Ammunition for an actual recession has now been used in a thriving economy. Fun stuff.
2020-03-04 13:46,"It’s breath-taking how quickly global financial and monetary administrators can coordinate policy in response to an outbreak of the ‘jet-set’ flu. Yet, to address child poverty, homelessness and climate damage, they can’t seem to agree on much.

“Wrong forever on the throne.” Well done last night, President Sanders."
2020-03-04 14:20,"Until countries can get an accurate measure on the velocity of the outbreak and practical containment measures no amount of monetary or fiscal policy can deliver much effect. The Government’s focus has to be on public health, which notwithstanding Trump’s initial ill advised comments, seems to be occurring. Once this unfortunate event is in the rear view mirror rapid implementation of monetary and fiscal tools should commence. But, first we must handle the public health issues."
2020-03-04 17:22,"The suggestion that governments might ""offer rescue packages to industries most affected, like airlines..."" shows up one of the bear traps of such a policy. Airlines, by carrying people with the virus around the world, are surely a key part of the problem here, certainly not part of the solution.

And whenever it comes to a stimulus package like the one advocated, there always comes the question of how to pick winners - companies and sectors that we lead us out of the current crisis, rather than bring us more quickly to the next one, be it global warming or whatever."
2020-03-04 18:49,"Trump and his sycophants in Congress spend unceasingly in tax cuts for corporations and the 1% and spend nothing to improve ordinary citizens.

2020-03-04 16:36,"I’m not sure how and where macro economists source their data and statistics, but it looks like these economists are imbibing of koolaid in their ivory towers.

Most other countries are now either already in recession or preparing to contract (including China in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic). Even in the US per earlier reports, manufacturing is in already recession and events and travel are expected to decline). Yet economists continue to harp on positive numbers like the still grossly overvalued stock market abetted by a willing Wall St.  We are supposed to believe that the US economy can continue to expand unconnected to the rest of the world.

For the common person on the street what smells like fish must indeed be fishy. Isn’t it logical to assume that White House “fake-onomists” like Kudlow and Navarro have taken Trump’s Orwellian thesis to bend the Bureau of Labor Statistics to his will, just as he has most other institutions? Now we’re supposed to believe we should monitor service sectors like hair salons for signs of a slowdown?

It seems that with 9 deaths, the number of infect individuals should be closer to 350-540 individuals rather than 115 individuals. Given that the medical care in the US is comparable to South Korea, the US infection number might be as  high as 1666 individuals. Regardless, the current reported infection numbers are way lower than would be expected and so the spread of the virus is much greater than what is currently reported as being. This discussion is NOT intended to make people panic, but to raise an alarm about how serious the problem is. Washing hands, self-sequestering if you have a fever, and contacting medical personnel if you are having trouble breathing might be a really good idea right now. The very low infection numbers is likely due to the lack of available testing kits. The United States is completely unprepared for this problem."

Apparently insurance companies in the US are telling people that they are NOT covered for the test and that they will have to pay over $3000! for their test. This is insane. There  is also discussion of how much Big Pharma will charge for any vaccine! Great approach.

With rampant rumors, understandable fear, profit-seeking hustlers, and political opportunists everywhere, there must be one voice that Americans can count on to present the best understanding of the nature of the disease and its spread. This is a moment when the individuals who work for the C.D.C. must stand up as responsible Americans and not let external political pressure influence their best judgement.

hus it is quite problematic that the article, ""U.S. Plans ‘Radical Expansion’ of Coronavirus Testing"" stated, ""The kits had three components but some of the components were producing an inconclusive result for many public health labs using the test. On Thursday, the agency announced that labs with two of three working components could go ahead and use the C.D.C. tests....""

Why should we have confidence in results of the ""new"" test? If the C.D.C. originally thought that all three elements were necessary for an accurate test result, how does simply eliminating one problematic element solve the problem and produce accurate results? Why should this not be viewed as more of a political solution  --  let's get lots of ""tests"" out there to look good  --  rather than a genuine public health/medical solution?"

2020-03-04 0:03,"Viral Infection testing can be tricky depending on the sensitivity and specificity of the test and the stage of infection. If one tests just after exposure and before an infection with sufficient detectable viral multiplication has occurred, then one will get a false negative result. The window of detecting infection with absolute certainty opens up when there is viral presence even as low as a few virions (complete virus particles) in the specimen being tested. Well into the infection roughly 2-3 weeks from exposure one can confirm the presence of the virus indirectly by detecting by a different test, specific antibodies developed against the virus by the immune system of the person exposed to the virus. Firstly, it should be possible to test for the corona virus anywhere in a qualified and certified laboratory in the entire USA and not just in a centralized location. Besides the complexity of testing and interpretation, time is of the essence and sending specimen for testing from one end to some far away location in the country by air courier, is ridiculous. If a decision was made to have the patient in WA tested for Corona virus, it should have been possible to have the testing done right there and within hours the result be made available to the doctors treating the patient. It is scary to imagine a patient who tested positive longer than he or she was found to be positive walking around exposing others who were in contact with that person. Hopefully a lesson learned."

Alex Azar has already stated that HHS cannot control the patient cost of any expected vaccine (translation: expect aggressive gouging from the pharma companies). Not to mention the cost of quarantine or hospitalization.

Obamacare has been largely dismantled by Trump and many red states decided not to expand Medicare.

2020-03-04 0:13,"Trump had eliminated and defunded all that Obama's administration had done to deal with this very kind of emergency, and at the first White House press conference in a very very long time, hearing and watching a whole stage of people say nothing but praise for each other, we heard Vice President Pence say his team would ""follow the facts, listen to the experts and pay attention to the science.""  The hoax, however, is not the coronavirus we're battling, but the confidence this administration has in itself.  It's a con."

We need a daily Trump Report that reports on his mental capacity, his ability to speak, his ability to comprehend, how drugged he appears to be on any given day, and what he is doing in his infinite spare time. 

If you had done this while the virus was cooking in the United States, we'd have known whether he was responding to the crisis or playing golf. Nine people are now dead. 

If the NYTimes does a Trump Report  faithfully & accurately every day, Trump will not be re-elected. For the survival of our country, he really needs to not be re-elected. You could even have a little window with the number of fatalities - and then a report on his actions & behavior. 

Please stop treating him like an intelligent human being. He's not. People are dying because he's not."

But, no worries! trump was excited to say that therapies, 'sort of another word for cure,' are coming 'at maximum speed.'

Because 'cures' don't need to be tested in clinical trials like vaccines-----right? RIGHT??

Stop trump before he starts peddling internet potions!"
2020-03-04 2:03,"Here in Seattle, I've had a serious fever and cough for five days. The nurse at my doctor's office gave me a phone number to call about testing and in case I have breathing difficulties. It automatically disconnects after two minutes on hold. There is no concrete information online on how to get tested. Based on my experience, the problem in Seattle is far larger than anyone imagines. 

I've been regularly searching for information about what I should do and it just doesn't exist. The King County Health Department phone number runs an old message. There are no basic fact sheets easily accessible online. Even information on basic symptoms is conflicting. The Pence team's priority should be working with Google to surface basic answers to common questions. Not pleasing Trump every news cycle.

I read these articles about political posturing and messaging and shake my head. Please New York Times et al, focus on how regular people are getting authoritative basic information. It just isn't out there."
2020-03-04 2:06,"It seems, at least with thinking people, that credibility is the biggest problem on the surface.  It is very difficult to determine the situation when confronted with facts, but impossible when confronted with purposeful political dishonesty and propaganda from the administration and Fox News.  Maybe I'm cynical, but can't help but wonder if the lack of testing (Pence finally says they will strop restricting testing...why in the first place?) f in addition to gross underfunding and purposeful delays, is a way of keeping the public in the dark to spread their ""hear no evil, see no evil...""

When testing finally catches up so that effective strategies can be implemented, it will be too late.  When the numbers come in, Trump will do the same thing he does with the global warming science and call it Democratic politics and a good opportunity to buy stocks.  Speaking of numbers, Trump and company keep saying 2% mortality.  According to their numbers 9 deaths and 122 cases in the US.  That is over 7% in one of the most advanced countries in the world and is considerably higher than the .1 (1 in 1,000) for the flu which they keep saying is the same rater of mortality.

With rampant rumors, understandable fear, profit-seeking hustlers, and political opportunists everywhere, there must be one voice that Americans can count on to present the best understanding of the nature of the disease and its spread. This is a moment when the individuals who work for the C.D.C. must stand up as responsible Americans and not let external political pressure influence their best judgement.

hus it is quite problematic that the article, ""U.S. Plans ‘Radical Expansion’ of Coronavirus Testing"" stated, ""The kits had three components but some of the components were producing an inconclusive result for many public health labs using the test. On Thursday, the agency announced that labs with two of three working components could go ahead and use the C.D.C. tests....""

Why should we have confidence in results of the ""new"" test? If the C.D.C. originally thought that all three elements were necessary for an accurate test result, how does simply eliminating one problematic element solve the problem and produce accurate results? Why should this not be viewed as more of a political solution  --  let's get lots of ""tests"" out there to look good  --  rather than a genuine public health/medical solution?"

Trump’s agenda is WRONG: it’s entirely politically self serving to HIS agenda, and his view of how things are going, or should be going.

Enough of this! If America is to have a realistic response, and a chance to save many lives, Trump’s agenda needs to be ENTIRELY REJECTED!

We need news coverage that clarifies the distance between what is and the goal post of what is considered competent protection.

Hmmm.

Trump has told the CDC and others that all coronavirus “messaging” must go through his anti-science VP Mike Pence. He has told our military leaders not to take actions to protect their troops from the virus without first clearing those actions with the VP.  He lies to the press about the facts of the coronavirus crisis and minimizes the risks, suggesting that any crisis is merely a hoax, an exaggeration created by the media. He has sued the Washington Post and the NYT for daring to write articles critical of him.  He has fired an astounding number of federal employees, including his own staff, for having the temerity to disagree with him.  He not only has fired a man for testifying to Congress during the impeachment process, he has actually fired the man’s twin brother.  He thus threatens not only individual retaliation but retaliation against family members. 

What will it take for Trump’s base to finally become  frightened of the raging dictator they have allowed to decimate all that is good about our proud nation?  Are they willing to risk their own and family members’ lives because of his lies about the dangers of coronavirus?"

2020-03-04 14:55,"If one were to take a really close look at the infection rate and compare it with the number of those who have died, the infection rate in the United States is grossly under-reported. Worst case scenario is that we have an infection rate similar to South Korea. In this case, the US would be under-reporting case by about 15x. So, not having test kits is leaving the country open to widespread infection, the implications of which will only be felt months into the future. Current reports indicate that the death rate with CoVID-19 is about 20x higher than the flu and even though the death rate is ""only"" 2%, that would mean that about 2 of every 100 people who get the virus die. Think about how many people you know. I know about 600 people as fiends and close acquaintances (people I would sit and have a long conversation with). These stats would suggest that if all 600 people I knew got sick, about 12 would die as a result of the infection. This virus is serious. We need to get a handle on it and it begins with testing kits."

Trump is giving himself a pat on the back. Hawaii Governor and public health officials are screaming. They still have no tests available for Covid 19. If you don't test for the virus, you have no cases unless someone walks into the hospital and ends up in the ICU."

He did nothing hoping not to scare the stock market. Which in his lame world is how you tell how the economy is doing.  He does not read, he knows nothing so how can we expect him to do the right thing. China closing down Wuhan give us maybe 5 weeks to get ready for what is coming. Trump got is wrong so now he blames Obama, what else is new. Believe the head of the NIH not Pence. Hope that the regular people don't get stuck paying for the test if they have to get one.

Are they analyzing for proteins - sensitivity is lower than for RNA. The former may account for the delay if antibodies are in production. Mouth swabs May not contain enough material for analysis. The CDC is not incompetent- I see the hand of Pence and Azar - discredit the CDC to justify the cuts, hand billions to private companies.

How could we know?  My first question is about ""Integrated DNA Technologies"", who is, I presume the source of the first (tiny!) batch of failed kits that were sent out.  We got 200 in CA, and, of course, they were useless (""bad component"").
If this company had been following FDA GMP regulatory protocols, no bad product would have made it through the QA/QC process, so I have real concerns about the quality management of that company.
Second, what is IDT's manufacturing capacity?  One does not just ""ramp up"" if there are quality issues.
These things aside (!), it appears we, as a country, have ""fired"" the wrong people, and made the wrong budget cuts (referring to the fraud's firing of the Pandemic Response team, and their chain of command).  Yes, we can ""ramp up"", but it is not an instant turnaround.
Third, and unfortunately a little late here, we did not have the volume of test kits when we needed them most, at the beginning of this outbreak.  Without being able to test (""screening"" is, at best, only a ""feel-good"" process that can only catch those already sick, not those infected) ALL suspected of being infected, we cannot know the scope of infection, so we cannot hope to ""contain"" the spread.

or if the test is negative, the patient does not have the virus?

Validation is important.  Stop making it sound like this is an unnecessary standard, and we are only wasting time on bureaucracy.

The key missing element is how many tests have been administered, and how many have been negative;  also, the criteria for when a test is administered.  If only 1,000 tests have been administered, 100 sickened could translate into hundreds of thousands ""sickened"".

We need government grants to pay a stipend to those who taking time off work will result in lost wages and to pay hospitals who treat those without insurance. We need assurances that sick or quarantined people can not be fired or raided by ICE. We need masks for health care workers AND civilians. We need a mobilized federal heath program ready to deliver ventilators, quarantine units or staff on command and we need daily, honest briefings on the state of affairs that will keep the public safe and informed.

After the C.D.C.’s version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.

We probably have between 60,000 and 120,000 cases minimum in the US right now, but public health efforts are concentrated on keeping their heads buried in the sand, so we’ll never really no.

It may be time for the WHO to put a quarantine order out against the US: no-one can go in, no-one can leave our borders.

The false positives from this unproven, rushed diagnostic test resulting from mass application on a low-risk population will generate far more panic and economic disruption than any events so far.  The false negatives will similarly contribute to spread of disease and false reassurance.  And of course, no price tag has been set.

In fact, it looks like it will go much, much worse. Speed in testing and contact tracing is how China has managed to quell their outbreak; see this article:

I’m geographically right in the middle of numerous cases. Many people around mock and say, “it’s no worse than the flu!” so they are going about their kids’ sports, their trips to Disneyland. Meanwhile, the media silence after so many local deaths is eerie. But Facebook and Nextdoor are not. People begging to get tested bc they have symptoms and have nowhere to turn. Doctors say stay home, call when it gets worse. And then there are the pictures showing people transporting patients from the LifeCare Center with masks hanging loosely from their faces and nothing covering their arms. No wonder the quarantined firemen have symptoms. 

So, I’m shutting myself in as much as I can. We are about 2 weeks away from thousands of cases uncovered given the timeline of other outbreaks— if we even manage to identify them except to hear of the 2% who die.

They really shouldn’t let folks like me from this area fly right now. Our country has failed my region. We are your guinea pigs.  We are currently seeding this to the rest of America. I’m sorry for us all."

During the White House press conference last week, Trump stated that the current coronavirus infection is under control and no death despite he was briefed one patient contracted the illness without any known contact in Solano County by CDC. During Trump rally in South Carolina, he said, "" Coronavirus infection is a hoax weaponized by the democrat "", 

China covid-19 outbreak provides the world with 6 weeks of borrow time for preparadness. Now US has 6 deaths and over 100 confirmed cases which is totally underestimated the real incidence of the infection because of insufficient diagnostic kits. The current White House chain of command with politicians on the top sows and piles up with chaos which is the hall mark of this administration. A qualified health professional from CDC or NIH should be appointed to replace Mike Pence."
2020-03-03 16:53,"This administration doesn’t want to test too many Americans, knowing too well that the American healthcare system is totally unfit and unprepared to confront this medical emergency.
Thousands of test kits were sent to the states by the CDC with a defective reagent , making their value zero.
The German test kit being used worldwide hasn’t even be considered or used , losing to this infection precious weeks .
The millions on uninsured Americans will stay away from clinics , because they can’t afford the cost , as well as the working poor , who when sick , can’t afford to lose a day of pay .
As a result of all of the above this infection might have catastrophic consequences."

Once again private profit is elevated over public health."

2020-03-03 17:22,"From this article it appears that the government is relying on state and local public health labs to process the tests. If so, that's madness. Most medical testing is carried out by the enormous network of commercial medical labs. Why not draft them into this effort? PLEASE."

The experts now have other positions they aren't readily going to leave, and much process and effort is necessary before this type of event.

Thinking that private industry will create millions of testing kits and they'll submit to QA afterwards shows the belief that private industry can do everything better and faster, when in this area, clearly they can't.  And not having experienced, governmental experts working shows every day."
2020-03-03 17:23,"It is just as urgent to identify people with mild to moderate symptoms as it is to identify critical cases, since an effective health care force can thereby be recruited from those who have recovered successfully.   Otherwise it will be far more challenging to care for people."

By contrast, 110 people are infected by the Coronavirus and 2 people have died. Almost 30 of the people that have been diagnosed with the virus were repatriated from overseas and are in quarantine. The panic about the Coronavirus is disproportional to actual threat that it poses. The federal government is in full gear and the most likely scenario is that the virus epidemic will wane and ultimately end by late spring, and, like so many other overhyped news events, soon fade from our national conversation. Fear and panic serve no good end and are a cowardly response to a problem that requires cooler heads and basic common sense."
2020-03-03 17:25,"All this testing is probably going to show that this Coronavirus strain has been around prior to the recent outbreak in China. With the high percentage of smokers among Chinese men, the large number of co-occurring COVID-19 infections attracted enough attention for medical personnel to test to see whether this was a new virus. Now that testing is being done around the world on literally millions of people, it's likely going to show that the strain has been present for perhaps several years and the outward symptoms of COVID-19 have been confused with other similar illnesses."
2020-03-03 17:28,"We will know testing has finally increased when there is a sudden surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S., causing panic. Of course, those cases will have been there for weeks, going untested and undetected."

And to make false claims of ""one million"" test kits by the end of the week! We're sleepwalking through this, and we're not being given good information about what to do. There are a lot of us taking care of seniors and others with health conditions who seem to be the most vulnerable. So how are we supposed to know when cut off contact with the outside world and shelter in place? I fear that we are not going to get good information until too much damage has been done."

The government not being able to provide concise information and approach to this looming disaster. The government trying to censor information and downplay the scale and potential damages from this virus reminds me of the way the Politburo handled crises in the USSR. If we do not test enough people then there will be very few sick people with the COVID 19 because many will not know if they are infected or not.
Hide your head in the sand and you would not hear and see nothing. 
I was dumbfound when I watched the president talk to the big pharma execs yesterday. I don't expect the president to know everything, but he sounded like a grandpa on AM radio.The execs did not help much as the seem afraid to confront him with facts and the true time line to produce a working vaccine. The execs need to show some backbone, not to be hiding and mumbling. They enjoy the tax breaks. Now is the moment to earn them!"

Trump bullied the Fed into cutting interest rates repeatedly to pump up the stock market for his reelection and to cover the costs of his tariffs.  

Now that we need those rate cuts for what they're intended to do (stave off a recession), we're out of ammo.  And with the $1 trillion a year deficit he caused with his giant Rich, Inc. tax cut, we're also bankrupt.

2020-03-03 17:43,"As of yesterday there had been 500 tests done. We have 100 people with confirmed cases. Meaning 20% tested have contracted it. What they will find out when they start testing more is that it is already here and spread fairly widely. Tests themselves will do nothing but confirm the extent to which it has already spread. I would suspect that there are far more infected and likely some people who have had it, got better, and will never be tested.

Basically, we missed it, and there is likely nothing to be done but ride it out. 

It's not like our government was set up to do anything anyway. We like small government. Government is the problem, not the solution. Is that not correct republicans and Reagan Democrats? Government is the problem."

However, their facilities had been told by the federal goverment that they COULD NOT report these directly to the media - all communication had to go through the federal Health and Human Services Department.  I figured at the time that the feds would hold off reporting until after the stock market closed on Friday.  Which is exactly what happened.

Nor do I have any confidence whatsoever that this administration is reporting all of the cases.  Trump appears to be treating this as a marketing issue where he's more concerned about tarnish on his ""brand"" than the health of the American people.  Which is par for the course."

That’s the first clue to any untruth, alternative facts spreading as fast as the virus itself.

Beyond that is the wreckage of past attempts to provide universal healthcare insurance.  Alex Azar has already stated that HHS cannot control the patient cost of any expected vaccine (translation: expect aggressive gouging from the pharma companies). Not to mention the cost of quarantine or hospitalization. 

Obamacare has been largely dismantled by Trump and many red states decided not to expand Medicare. So expect great reluctance on the part of the lower and middle class people to self-report and check themselves into care facilities. Instead they’ll just hope to recover on their own. Who wouldn’t wish to avoid the crippling bills? Needless to say this would only exacerbate the problem. 

Deafening silence from Trump’s team on how patients are supposed to pay for coronavirus treatment."

-- Hindsight is 20/20 but the delay was primarily because developing a test kit requires you to actually have the pathogen and there could be more virus spread if you build the kit wrong or test incorrectly than would otherwise spread
-- No one would have done anything differently test kits or no test kits (just as no one would do anything different if this is called a pandemic or an epidemic). In particular, the first case in the country showed up in that Seattle suburb where the deaths occurred on January 20. The local health officials have been all over this thing in multiple ways since then <a href=""https://crosscut.com/2020/02/how-coronavirus-has-tested-seattles-infectious-disease-response"" target=""_blank"">https://crosscut.com/2020/02/how-coronavirus-has-tested-seattles-infectious-disease-response</a>

Then the comments here go a step further and seem to simply make up stuff that was not only never discussed at the press conference but that have never been discussed anywhere that I can see ($3000 a test? Only 400 tests have been run in total? Etc.)"
2020-03-03 17:57,"As far as I can tell, fewer people have been tested for coronavirus in America than in any other country at risk.

Are we actually still a first-world nation?  Because Cambodia has tested far more people than we have."
2020-03-03 17:49,"Regarding testing -I actually believed the government when they stated there would be a million tests by the end of the week. I mean, why lie about that?

Then Covid-19 testing data disappeared from the CDC website. Then I read this NYT article. Then I remembered we are dealing with the Trump administration. Of course they are going to lie, or at best make unrealistic statements -their usual thinking that simply making a statement will magically make it true. 

So why should I have ever believed anything that this administration says? They’ve proved themselves false over and over again."
2020-03-03 17:44,"""Trump only cares about himself.""  That is a simple statement, which is repeated ad naseum, but it carries a lot more significance than most people attribute to it.  His narcissism is profoundly beyond common understanding.  Anything (and I do mean anything) that threatens the eggshell fragility of his self image is devasting for him.  He must do whatever is required to protect his self image.  Any criticism of him requires an agressive response even if that response is based on outrageous lies.  His agression comes in many forms, but mostly in deception, even if that deception is without any foundation and threatens the lives of others.  Those lives truly and absolutely do not matter to him because other people are dispensable and simply a tool for his sick need for self-fulfilment.  In the end, if he can protect himself from harm and maintain his ""self"" against all others, the lives he harms do not matter to him.  It is clear, beyond a doubt, that he has promulgated, directed and sustained the lie that the U.S. could produce one million tests by the end of the week.  This lie will hurt thousands of people, many who will die because of the delay in the appropriate medical intervention.  Yet, he views this as a good result because it buys him more time to fabricate other deceptions that will in turn enable him to fabricate still more deceptions that will buy him more time.  He  does not care that all of this has destructive consequences."
2020-03-03 17:58,"With such limited testing capabilities, there is absolutely no way of telling what the spread through the population really is.
One way currently to get a rough estimate is to look at the people who have recently returned back to China from countries with circulating coronovirus as a random sample.  The accompanying article states that 13 of them tested positive for the virus.  Assuming all of them were tested, one would use that number and divide it by the total number of Chinese who have returned.  Assuming that they were randomly exposed or not to the virus in the general population, that would provide a rough estimate of what fraction of the population has already been infected AND is contagious at the time.  

I suspect we will find that the virus has already spread beyond control BUT that the vast majority of cases are mild or asymptomatic.  

The scary number of 2% mortality is caused by confirmation bias and biased sampling.

Mortality overall will be FAR lower.  

Nonetheless, every case is one case too many, so get on with approving a vaccine, FDA!  Waiting until next year is not an option, certainly not with the panic this is causing now."
2020-03-03 17:43,"I’m fairly certain I have a mild case. I developed a sore throat, fever, and cough upon returning home from a business trip in Asia. I transited through South Korea in both directions. Once I spiked a fever I called my doctor. I was told that I don’t meet the criteria for testing because I didn’t leave airport in South Korea and I don’t require hospitalization. If I had had the exact same symptoms as I boarded the plane in South Korea, I wouldn’t have been allowed to board and would have been tested immediately.    I’m self quarantining but was told I didn’t have to - it’s mind boggling. There was also zero screening at SeaTac when I arrived on Saturday. Flights from South Korea and Japan went through customs mixed in with passengers from all other destinations. What exactly is the CDC actually doing?"

2020-03-03 17:59,This is really disheartening. Our province of B.C. had conducted more tests than the whole of the United States. I was just reading that Iran too is promising it’s citizens a million tests.
2020-03-03 18:06,"The sad reality of the Trump Administration falsely claiming a million COVID-19 tests can be performed in a week is that the public may believe this can instantly solve the spread of infections. 

     Even at that purposefully exaggerated weekly rate it would take years to test everyone; and each positive person and likely contacts would need isolation.

     The most likely epidemiological prediction is that while massive testing and isolation policies might slow infections – and that is certainly beneficial for not overwhelming the healthcare system -- exponential infection will persist until most people have been infected, recovered, and made antibodies capable of preventing subsequent infections from constantly evolving COVID-19 strains. 

     The genie is out of the box, and millions will die prematurely before safe & effective antiviral drugs & immunization technologies are available.

     Development of these is also not something that can occur via a Trumpian press announcement.

     These advances will require extensive basic research to understand COVID-19 biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, cell biology, and the pharmacology of candidate drugs.

     Unfortunately, and due to budget cuts that enrich the 1%,  roughly 90% of scientifically sound NIH grants to investigate these problems have remained unfunded year after year, and elimination of graduate training grants has eroded the pool of young talent needed to sustain scientific progress."

I see no indications that the CDC is working to coordinate US access to the best available testing technology.  Instead they seem to be paralyzed by a ""not invented here"" syndrome that assumes US science and health technology is always better than anyone else's.  Worse yet, Big Pharma's profit motive has kicked in to limit kits to those produced by companies we like.  This kind of hubris will add at least an order of magnitude to the American death toll from this pandemic.  Maybe Trump believes this will improve his chances for reelection."

It's said China was testing 10,000 people per day (with capacity to test 1.2M/week) and South Korea has tested over 100,000, while the US has tested 3,600, and the CDC removed the ""number of tested"" data from their website.

The ONLY way to get in front of this is to identify carriers and have them stay home while treating serious cases.   China's effort has yielded a decrease in new cases, to a point where they're closing a temporary 1200-bed hospital.

Always back to the same old excuse - “If we had been able to test earlier.....”

And why weren’t they able?  Because the Coronavirus Czar,  Mike Pence, was chosen to “lead the way” having no medical experience, background, or medical leaders.  Alex Azar is a pharmaceutical attorney and he heads the US Health and Human Services, go figure, but on the “committee”.  Others were told to keep quiet or were not brought into the equation.

2020-03-03 19:11,"On 2/27/2020 broadcast (last Thursday), California Governor Gavin Newsom gave a 20 minute report on the web/TV. California could only get 200 COVID-19 test kits from the CDC. So California sent to private companies in CA to design and manufacture better test kits which would have much quicker results and which could either be processed in many local labs or would provide the result directy to the healthare provided giving the test to a person suspected to have the virus.

The new California tests are much less expensive and can be mass produced and processed in many authorized labs. A test which will yield immediate results is in the works and expected in a few weeks to a few months. South Korea sells a great test kit (one ompany there can make 100,000 per hour). The CDC just gave CA permission to use it!

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) lacks enough of the current tests approved by the CDC and which have weeks delay at the two (or a very small number, very backed up) which are authorized by the CDC to process the tests - there is a weeks delay. This means that those kits can really identify only those people who have already likely died if they did have the Cornoa virus, or who obviously did have it because they were smehow able to survive the virus.

Bottom line:  Trump's CDC has only a tiny fraction of the tests needed, and the tests can't be processed fast enough. Was Trump trying to set up manufacturing opportunities for his supporters?"
2020-03-03 20:06,"Excellent reporting, thanks for following up on this. The lack of testing is yet another failure of the U.S. healthcare system, Chernobyl-esque in it's magnitude and perniciousness. Was Dr. Hahn the same party responsible for restricting U.S. use of the WHO test kits?"

Seems like the Fed is now a tool of the Trump administration as well. Cutting interest rates does help prop up equity/bond prices and boost corporate earnings, by cutting corporations' borrowing costs. So, yet again, the rich get richer, and the non-rich just keep getting the raw end of things as usual.

Meanwhile, don't do any meaningful testing, so no one will know how widespread the pandemic is becoming, and try to bury any/all evidence of that for as long as possible -- well, at least until the Nov 3 election.

But consumption will decline substantially because of precautions most people will take in order to protect their health.  Does the Fed seriously believe that lower interest rates will stimulate people to borrow to spend when spending exposes them to increased interaction (and the increased virus risk that accompanies interaction)?

1. Governors and Mayors of cities that have corona virus cases should encourage employers to have their non-essential employees telecommute. Most employees have this capability.
2. The same state and city governments should set the example by requiring non-essential staff remain home. This is done during snowstorms and hurricanes, so there is precedent for this.
3. They should also cancel functions where many congregate.
Some of us have sick leave, have insurance and have less risk of getting seriously ill or dying from this virus. Others don't, and government needs to step in. At the end prevention is less costly, can save lives and help against a recession. So the Federal Reserve can get some help from elected officials to protect what is most important, corporate profits."
2020-03-03 15:56,"This interest rate cut lifts the stock prices long enough for the elites to sell at a higher price. When, unfortunately, many people are sick, dying and in isolation, the stocks will fall again. But, by then the elites will have been able to mitigate their losses.

Its too bad that the administration dismantled the procedures that Obama put in place to lift the effects of a global pandemic. The previous administration would have been advancing testing even though Republicans would have decried it as socialized medicine."
2020-03-03 15:56,"This was a move by the Trump Administration to drive off the Stock Market Shorts.  Dow 30 index was down over 300 points this morning before this announcement was made  after the market opened. It won't help long term because the rate cut is a symptom of grave concern about economy.

If only the Trump Administration would show this much interest and care with all American Lives."

2020-03-03 15:59,The solution to the Corona Virus blues in the stock market is not interest rates-it is uncertainty about the extent of spread of the virus and how much disruption it will cause for companies and their bottom lines.Trump has been promoting interest rates near zero since his election and has disparaged the Fed because they would not do his bidding.Now the Fed has preemptively cut rates before  the picture is clear-it forces people who want any return to get into the market which will probably lose them money-anyone who wants safety has to stay in cash.Trump and the Fed are pushing stocks even though that may be disastrous for investors.
2020-03-03 15:59,"The Trump administration pushes for the public to remain calm and not panic, but then rushes to cut rates in emergency move - way to inspire."
2020-03-03 16:00,"This diminishes and weakens a tool we will desperately need when things get really bad. 

Lets face it, things are not terrible right now, but Trump and all his extremely wealthy friends are freaking out as to the reality which may set in.  They need to perpetuate a myth that they are all wholly invested in, so an unnecessary rate cut has been rolled out immediately. 

In the future, when the time and need comes for real action, the interest rate tool will not be as potent and less effective. 

This seems to be a short term fast and furious approach when a longer term view needs to be taken. Especially when it has to do with the interest rates."
2020-03-03 16:00,"This abrupt move by the Fed betrays lack of knowledge of stock market psychology. Looking at how stocks are doing today you would not think that anything of interest has happened (no pun intended).

The stock market psychology works on ""buy on rumor, sell on news"" principle. This is the reason there was a significant rally yesterday, and barely any movement today.

What the Fed should have done is give signals that they are about to cut interest rates, then give stronger signals, then even stronger signals, then cut interest rate by 0.25% then repeat for the next 0.25%. Markets would have rallied multiple times for each good news signal."

Pretty slick for the rich and financially influential. For the rest of us, not so much."
2020-03-03 16:04,"The Fed gave a booster shot to Trump’s most important patient, the economy. If Trump can contain the market reaction, he believes his political operation will succeed, even if an unknown numbers of human patients die. If his plan of treatment works, maybe he will request another rate cut to address climate change. If the market is up, CO2 will come down...so opines a Trump’s denialist scientist embedded in the EPA. 
Will the rate cut allow the international supply chain to produce and move goods and components from quarantined regions where factory production is curtailed? Will the rate cut spur tourism, with the prospect of quarantined stays on cruise ships with hundreds of infected shipmates? Of course, his MAGA rally attendees have immunity to coronavirus ( since they never would be caught imbibing Corona and Lime) but will theaters, concerts, sporting events and other large gatherings be saved by lower short term interest rates? Will fiscal stimulus give you enough comfort to send your kids to school, if the virus affects kids?

We need a plan, to be explained to us all, as to how the virus can be contained here and worldwide. But when the economy itself becomes sick, what fiscal remedies will still be available to stem that crisis?"

A real virus, not the euphemistic kind of virus (contagion) economists are oft prone to invoke, is not raising a monetary policy question. COVID-19 churning through the population is slowing people's urge to spend, except for hoarders buying every roll of toilet paper in town. It is certainly not the cost of money why people are leaving their wallets in their pockets."
2020-03-03 16:04,"Fascinating Fed action in the face of Trump’s assertion that everything is under control and there is no reason to panic.  This rate cut is a clear Fed interference in the election meant to artificially stimulate the economy to aid in Trump’s reelection.  So much for an independent Fed.  The real need for money is to help the uninsured and underinsured people cope with the coming medical financial crisis as the cost of drugs, containment and testing is being passed on to consumers.  Fed rate cuts overwhelmingly help only the wealthy.  There seems to be no limit to the greed of this administration.  If people continue to vote for this corruption against their own self interests, then what comes next is well deserved."

The US is running a deficit that is far outpacing its economic growth (4.6% of GDP vs 3.1% GDP growth in 2018, a good year) and running bare bones interest rates that are flirting with a nose dive into negative territory.

He cares nothing but for the stock market and his re-election. He is going scorched-Earth on this. Hiding the Coronavirus, the massive impact on business it’s already taken, and the toll it’s about to take on the American public is his prerogative. The lack of testing kits could be by design. 

China has shut down and travel has ceased. The world economy has slowed, now it’s a matter of how well Trump can reshape reality to his benefit."

CDC says, ""Plan to stay in, work from home if possible."""

2020-03-03 16:15,"Central Banks are confronted with the reality that none of the structural economic problems, which created the 2008 financial collapse, have been resolved. Instead of allowing insolvent and highly indebted firms to go bankrupt following the 2008 crash, these companies have been allowed to continue functioning with infusions of circa $6 trillion of ultra-cheap money from the FED, which along with Trump’s 2017 tax cuts have gone to Wall St. for share buybacks, purchasing stock futures and to sustain [still] insolvent banks. This money also inflated bond markets and trendy real estate in Boston, NYC, SF, Seattle, etc. A vivid illustration of how dysfunctional capitalist economies have become is that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is the largest shareholder on the Nikkei. Proper functioning of capitalist economies requires that unprofitable firms have to be culled from the marketplace, not repeatedly bailed out by the FED, BOJ or ECB. Global central banks are continuing their orgy of money printing and debt creation, ignoring the fact that continuing economic stagnation in the global economy is a consequence of excess capacity and slack demand. ‘Tough’ talk, more rate cuts or asset purchases does not resolve this problem, but rather is postponing the proverbial ‘day of reckoning’."

This seems to me throwing a bone to the wealthier of Americans but does nothing for those who own no stocks. Given that savings rates are little better than zero, there is no incentive for those who don't own stocks to save. This kind of policy simply encourages people to spend -- and to do that on credit. The population just grows more indebted. And now with this new virus -- sick and in debt.  

I hope the New York Times publishes an article that explains the Fed options and choices to its readers."

How do rate cuts in the US get missing parts from closed Chinese factories into US factories and stores?

All lower rates do is decrease borrowing costs for leveraged buyers on Wall Street and certain elected officials who are known to have personally borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly with floating rate agreements."

Why, because it is not needed right away and the Fed should hold its powder for later since it didn't have much left to use.  Doing it now suggests that fears of the virus depressing consumer spending are greater than anyone thought, at least in the eyes of our inside-baseball experts at the Fed.  And maybe in part a response to Trump's incessant bullying. Is this why the market is not reacting with the glee expected?"

While dropping interest rates may boost the market in the short term, the net effect of one to three months of reduced output has to depress stock prices.  The most effective way to stabilize the economy is to check the spread of coronavirus so that we can resume travel, school, public functions and rebuild our lives.  To do this we need to focus on testing for the disease, finding those exposed and isolating them while the exposure runs its course.  The stock market is a secondary issue for now.  When the coronavirus has been stopped, and only then, will it be possible to grow the economy."

The reality is that the virus is going to spread and it's going to curtail economic activity for the at least the first couple of quarters of the year.  No interest rate cut is going to change that.

2020-03-03 16:23,It'll be interesting to see what other central banks will do. The US Fed's move may well become known as the decision that took away its authority. Everyone with a little insight in the present supply chain problems understands that a lower interest rate does nothing to solve the problem; the only effect is that it gives the corporate class more time to run for the exits. Not only has the Fed given away much of its remaining ammunition. It has given away a much more important asset: trust. It'll be equally interesting to see what the stock markets will do now. Rational behaviour should result in a further rout.

And – that we can allocate $ for tens of millions of (useless) face masks, while keeping the price of COVID-19 testing at extortionate levels, and hype-talk about vaccines and cures…

To a point, that’s not a bad thing…

It will be one more place where China – after we point fingers and smirk – leaves us in the dust, here, regarding public health and safety based on advanced clinical imaging and genomic diagnostics…

Which may finally get us past our nation-scale denial regarding our declining global standing…

Has there been a suggestion from Secretary DeVos that student loans payments or rates might be lowered for the medical workers who man the front lines in this battle? 
Finally, the absurd idea that ""we"" want millions to die must be rebutted with this fact: The Trump administration deliberately made these cuts that have left us vulnerable. They were clearly warned not to do so but went ahead anyway. They were fully-informed of the consequences of a possible pandemic. They were told that millions could die. And this after years of attacks on Obamacare where they were repeatedly told how many millions would face sure financial ruin with a medical emergency.

Cutting interest rates doesn't contain outbreak. Closing public places does. So does staying home from work. 

And besides, the real issue here isn't this outbreak. It's the next outbreak of a mystery disease. And everyone should take notice of the colossal (and ironic) ineptitude that  germophobe Trump, who squealed loudly about the ebola outbreak years ago, brought to the handling of the coronavirus now in question.  

Seems to me, there's firmer consumer confidence and market confidence to be found in being able to reliably look to our national leaders for action, and not just see Bozo the Clown trying to make hasty work of a public message on what anti-outbreak efforts are being undertaken so he can leave to go to a campaign rally and call it all a media hoax spun with the Democrats' assist.

2020-03-03 15:27,"By cutting interest rates and expanding the money supply, the Fed is artificially pumping up the stock market by expanding bank and corporate debt. This fictitious money is not being invested in production of goods and services or higher wages to give consumers more purchasing power, that would actually cause growth in GDP. It is being poured into stock buybacks, mergers and acquisitions, short-term speculation, and predatory lending, further enriching the top banks and corporations. Covid-19 is making people sick and killing them, decreasing production and trade in real life, and no amount of electronic money is going to stop that."
2020-03-03 16:49,"This move is so typical of Republicans.  Cut rates to stimulate the stock market and increase the fortunes of the fat cats, alias the 1%.  Meanwhile, Joe Public needs more money in their pockets to pay for basic medical supplies and co-pays for visits to clinics and hospitals.  Visits to the ER will devastate the finances of 30%+ of the people. God forbid that they have to take off from work because the greedy capitalists limit their paid time off.  What we need short term is fiscal stimulus such as Federal re-imbursement for Covid19 medical bills and policy changes to guarantee paid time off for illness related to this epidemic.  Long term, we need a better health care system."

Not only are rate cuts not going to solve the issues caused by corona virus, capitalists aren't interested in solving those issues or willing to invest to fight the corona virus much less grow the economy. And neither are any national states. No one is investing in serious infrastructure to deal with these kind of health problems. They are only interested in clipping coupons and growing their individual wealth."
2020-03-03 16:50,"Trump loved lower interest rates because he is in debt and ower interest rates allows him to borrow more and more.  He governs similarly, tax cuts which much be offset by more borrowing.  It's all OK because it's the American way to make future generations pay for our mistakes."
2020-03-03 16:52,"Doesn't make any sense. Cutting interest rates doesn't do anything to help sick people get to work, buy more things, etc.

But this short-sighted political move does accomplish one exceptionally Trumpian thing - it hamstrings the next administration's ability to use rate cuts when they're appropriate."
2020-03-03 16:52,"This is all you need to know:
1) The interest rate cut will do basically nothing to help the average American (only rich Americans). 

2) The Coronavirus does not care about interest rate cuts. Cutting the rate will do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of the virus throughout the country.

3) The Coronavirus is going to sicken and kill many Americans. Yes this will happen. And as the virus spreads it will adversely impact the American economy in many ways- slowing manufacturing, slowing travel, slowing tourism, people going out less to stores, car dealers, restaurants, concerts, movies, events, museums, wherever people gather and spend money. 

4) Face masks won't save you from contracting Coronavirus. Washing your hands frequently will help but it is not a panacea.

Have a nice day!"
2020-03-03 15:29,"Not exactly sure how lower interest rates will help the economy. If there is nothing in the supply chain then there is nothing to buy, nor a need to borrow money for anything.

Also with this reduction how can the Fed do anything to boost the economy when there is a downturn unrelated to the Coronavirus?

If there is a need to boost the economy how about a real infrastructure week since interest rates on 10 T-Bills are at historic lows?  Borrow now to rebuild the infrastructure of the country.  Roads, rails and schools can be rebuilt and improve the lives of Americans."
2020-03-03 16:54,"It sounds to me that Trump indeed controls the Fed.  The only reason for this rate reduction is to bail out the Stock Market

Ever since Trump has come into office the Stock Market has been told what to do by Trump and is comments.

2020-03-03 16:55,Recognizing the impotence of rate cuts from already low levels is likely too much for a Fed already politically beaten up for not sufficient rate cuts. So is this just attempted exchange rate manipulation? - what the Chinese have long been falsely accused of doing? The ironies in the world of Trump just keep coming.
2020-03-03 16:55,"Rate cuts help in cases where there is demand aggregation. They are not designed in this case which is about supply disruptions, and distribution chains.  That being said, markets are panicky now, and rate cuts are like a shot of ativan or a few valium, allowing a reduction in anxiety and uncertainty.  Although, of course, the uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 remain high."
2020-03-03 16:36,"An interest rate cut is not the solution to a public health problem.  If we solve the public health problem, the economy will recover.  If we ignore the public health problem and try to stimulate the economy, things will only get worse."

2020-03-03 16:53,"Just yesterday I read a piece in this paper from Wm. Cohan. The subtitle suggested that last week was a minor stock market correction and basically investors were really looking for a reason to take their profit. 

<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/coronavirus-economy-recession.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/coronavirus-economy-recession.html</a>

I’m no expert in investing, but like many I have a 401-K and try to be patient with these market swings. I’ve also had a passive interest in business articles over the years and have read enough articles to not put too much trust in what the stock market tells us on a daily basis. Too often, voices from Wall Street sound like nervous Nellies in these stories – often a company reports good results and their stock price drops; or a company reports massive layoffs, and the price soars (""Ah yes, they're finally addressing their problems - you know, people).

I’ve liked Cohan’s columns over the years and appreciate his moderate tone and knowledge of investing. Yesterday’s piece discussed how a relatively minor market correction wasn’t a bad thing and ended with 
“Jerome Powell should find a way to stiffen his resolve not to lower rates in the face of what surely will be relentless pressure from the White House. Then, when the fears of coronavirus subside — as they inevitably will — the financial markets will be in a much better place.”

Well, I guess it’s “poof” to that idea."
2020-03-03 16:55,I'm sure COVID-19 will stop reproducing at the news of an interest rate cut. I can throw out my hand sanitizer and masks now.
2020-03-03 16:55,"Ah yes, the old cutting interest rates ploy...the fed and
it's chairman are being manipulated by Trump to
secure his reelection."
2020-03-03 16:57,"I think this is a wasteful move. The issue of corona virus is going to be supply chains being emptied and they aren't going to refill faster as a result of a rate drop.

Trump gets to beat his chest and say, ""See what I got them to do?"" Big deal."
2020-03-03 16:58,"The coronavirus cat is out of the bag, and no amount of expansionary monetary policy (when rates are already so low) is going to mitigate the global economic consequences of the virus.

This is just the beginning, here in the US, where the virus is spreading communally unbeknownst to authorities until days and even weeks later - see Washington and Oregon, for examples."
2020-03-03 16:53,"This is a stupid move that will inevitable blow up in everyone's face (except the rich, they'll be fine) once the next recession hits and we don't have the room to drop rates any lower."

2020-03-03 17:00,"FOX news (essentially trump’s propaganda agency) is fully engaged in a concerted cover up to  camouflage just how badly managed the COVID-19 response has been in the US. The trump administration over the last three years has been drastially cutting budgets and gutting public health agencies, eliminating preparedness teams, and abruptly  dismissing expertise. It’s clearly a deliberate effort to dismantle the important measures Obama made to effectively protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis. And as with all things Obama, trump is doing these things vengefully, recklessly and surreptitiously. The nation is already paying a huge price with the looming emergence of a similar infection crisis, the COVID-19 outbreak and undoubtedly there is more to come."
2020-03-03 17:01,Isn't it an interesting coincidence how on Monday the market has the biggest one day increase in the Dow in its history. A jump in market value of approximately one trillion dollars. On Tuesday morning morning the Fed announce a fifty basis point rate cut. A great deal of money was made on Monday. I am sure it's highly unlikely but can't help wondering if  there might be a tiny leak in the plumbing that carries information out of the Fed to the White House and to the financial community. What a great investigative reporting project for a skilled financial reporter.
2020-03-03 17:01,"I have to hand it to Trump, he says ""jump"" and they all say ""how high?"" -- the Federal Reserve, all republican congress, and it seems the Supreme Court. Time to start saying ""no."""
2020-03-03 17:01,Trump should stop worrying about the stock market and interest rates.  His focus should be in marshaling resources and expertise to take on the coronavirus.
2020-03-03 17:02,"The markets are panicking because a pandemic is going to interfere with commerce. A rate cut by the Fed as has been advocated by the Great Economist, Donald J. Trump, and others who know what to do with a man-made panic, but don't understand a ""panic"" caused by a virus. 

Easy money will not stop the effects of this virus on human activity disrupted by the infection. The Fed is tilting at windmills. Trump can no longer blame the Fed. But this coronavirus pandemic will run it's course regardless of what the Fed does. Sorry Donald, your administration's response to this pandemic as a human health crisis is still your responsibility and the Fed can't help you."
2020-03-03 17:02,"I am a senior citizen and have been quite conservative with my financial resources. Trump’s insistence on lowering interest rates punishes savers like me. It’s hard to understand how our hard earned savings are so critical to our economy and borrowers like Trump, but we are rewarded so little. Trump will now lower taxes for the wealthy after he has harmed so many trying to be financially responsible. Maybe savers should be given a limited tax break for the sacrifice they are making."
2020-03-03 17:03,"After 2010, with congress unable/unwilling to approve additional stimulus legislation, the alternative tools have been   either tax cuts or the fed cuts in interest rates.  Tax cuts are largely played out and the fed does not have much room for more cuts.  Depending on what happens this year, we may see a return to direct, targeted stimulus."

Any Democrat is better than Trump and Republicans who want to get private labs into testing, and won’t control prices, even in an epidemic."
2020-03-03 17:05,"Aren't interest rates already low enough?  Why does the Fed constantly cut the interest rates?

I mean, what is the economic rationale here?  It's not as if cutting the interest rates suddenly makes the virus go away.  The reason for the lower economic activity would be people staying home to recover from the virus.  Until the virus goes away, people aren't more likely to engage in lots of economic activity.

And why can't we just have a recession and be okay with it?  If we have a recession because of subprime mortgages and dishonest bankers, that's just stupid and we need to increase regulation.  Though likely zeal over economic growth is why we cut the regulation in the first place.  But if we have stagnation just because it's a while since we had a good invention to spear economic growth (read: agriculture, electricity, or industrial machines not social media and targeted ads), then so be it.  Or if we have a recession due to some darn virus, that's just life.  I mean, the economy can't always grow.  Sometimes life happens.  For non-economic reasons, with economic effect.  And the Fed can't do anything about it."
2020-03-03 17:05,"Mr Powell, why is the interest on my variable-rate, public student loan still higher than at any point over the past 18 months despite Fed interest rates being cut by >33%?"
2020-03-03 17:06,"This makes no sense. As analysts have pointed out, interest rate cuts cannot start production in China and S.Korea, restore lost tourism dollars, or fill empty shelves, hotels, and convention centers. Those are lost dollars and productivity. All it does is temporarily juice the stock market, so Trump can stay afloat. This rate cut leaves the Fed with even less leverage to act in the future when we really need it.  

There will be an economic reckoning and price to pay for Trump’s exploding deficit and short-term focus. Hopefully, that reckoning will occur while Trump is still in office, so the next Democrat in the White House isn’t faced with a mess to clean up that he or she didn’t create."
2020-03-03 17:07,"Yes, let's make sure the investor class gets what it wants.  

Heaven forbid capitalism ever having to make it on it's own. Those of us that were happy to obtain 2% interest on protected money were able to accept getting eaten alive by inflation caused by a rampant 'economy'.  I'm not speaking of the conservative inflation rates you ad about, but by the actual cost of living increases, which are a strong 5-10% -- due to capital agitation."
2020-03-03 17:07,"I am certainly no expert, but this most recent cut makes no sense.  If our economy is booming, as has been reported via various media sources, then why the need for a cut?  Furthermore, if they keep making cuts during a ""solid economy"", what will they do when a real emergency arises?  They will have given it all up already.  Am I mistaken in my thinking?"
2020-03-03 17:08,"The Fed's action makes so little sense that the net effect will likely be to undermine confidence further. Now we have to worry not  only about the Coronavirus, but irrational and perhaps politically motivated thinking by the Fed itself."
2020-03-03 17:08,"1% does not leave much margin for further cuts if more problems arise.   
This is a problem because they cut rates earlier when Trump cried wolf!"
2020-03-03 17:12,"I am not an economist.  But looking at the interest rate trend of the passing 15 years, does this mean the recession is coming?   The huge drop for 2008. This is not good news in spite of the reaction for coronavirus.   I hope this is not the case."
2020-03-03 17:13,"I’m just wondering — with interest rates this low, wouldn’t that encourage too much borrowing and cause a credit bubble? Wasn’t this kind of easy credit the fuel that fed the chasing after investments so much that it led to the invention of mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps? That didn’t work out so well, as I recall."
2020-03-03 17:14,"In the first half of my life, the people at the top showed eminent good sense in running Western economies: they always seemed to be able to find the right solution for the economic problem at hand. Then came the 80s and everything changed. True, monetarist policies helped greatly in the short-term, but then, things started to turn a little sour. Since the days of Reagan and Thatcher, wealth inequality has grown exponentially, as has income inequality. Decent, well-paid jobs with good pensions and perks have evaporated, being replaced by ‘positions’ in the gig economy.

Likewise, in days of yore, the people who ran the economy took a balanced view of the economy as a whole: the economy was run for the benefit of all, not just the few. The needs of the workers, the elderly, pensioners, young savers, etc., were all taken into account. Gone are those days, alas! Trump, of course, takes this to the Nth degree. To Trump, the stock market is everything; it is the economy. But as we all know: Trump has no real understanding of economics. So I wouldn’t expect better from Trump. From Jerome Powell, however, I would expect better. Alas, my expectations, yet again, have been dashed.

If you take all income away from people who depend on their savings to generate a little extra to eke out their often meagre incomes in old age, you also take away their spending power. You curtail their spending power and, in so doing, you make it difficult for the economy to grow through consumer demand."

Increasing the deficit into the trillions as Trump has done combined with very low interest rates puts us in a weakened position should a strong recession hit (as is not entirely unexpected as part of the Business Cycle).

Keep four feet between students & students AND students & instructors. Mark positions with chalk or tape. 

Cover work surfaces with paper that can be discarded after each class. Sanitize all doors & work surfaces between classes with hot soapy water or disinfect with a nontoxic agent like vodka. Ensure that people cleaning wear heavy gloves, don’t touch their faces, & wash themselves afterwards for their own safety. 

Have one teacher hold the door to the school open with gloves or a rope, keeping their face averted, so that many people are not touching the door. Have students enter one at a time, four feet apart. Mark waiting positions on pavement outside the school with chalk. Have all students & parents use hand sanitizer or wash hands upon entering the building. 

Ask parents not to congregate in the waiting area, but to go outside, & to avoid or use caution in crowded cafes or shops. 

Ask parents to let the school know if they have travelled recently or anyone in their family has been sick. Ask them to  self-quarantine before sending their kid to class.

The goal: reduce the risk of transmission & downturn."

The bad effects of poorly-thought-out government policies are compounded by QE, which is used to enrich the already fabulously wealthy; and government economic policies, both fiscal and monetary, are not based in either common sense or logic. So how much longer can this rotten system be allowed to go on?

From my observations, this is not even true capitalism. Not at all, in fact. In a true capitalism, there’s no such thing as “too big to fail”. In true capitalism, if you can’t make an enterprise work, make and enterprise profitable, you let it go to the wall. Further, fortunately, there are ‘capitalist’ alternatives to this failing system, which we could adopt. We could also return to the common-sense economics of the past. That would be a great start."

The bond market's  rates were so dreadfully low already that nobody could make serious money by investing in bonds, and the newest cuts will increase that effect  In fact, if Trump has his way, we will have to pay the government for putting our money into bonds (that is what ""negative"" interest rates mean). 

 So millions of people will have to put their money back into the stock market -- they will simply have no choice.  I understand there is even a term for this phenomenon in Wall Street: they call it TINA -- which stands for ""There Is No Alternative."""

Besides the already affected global supply chains, restaurants, travel, entertainment events, malls, and any other business that relies of public gatherings could be hit very hard. That said, no one can yet give an informed estimate of exactly how large that effect will be because we simply don't know enough about the virus to put meaningful boundaries on some possible ranges. We do know however that the number of people sickened by it in our country in remains relatively small for the moment. In that context, why does Powell believe that such a large emergency rate cut is warranted right now? With so little wiggle room in the Fed's rates, using as much as a third of what's technically available seems somewhat extreme. Is it possible that the Fed is doing the thing the rest of us have been asked not to, and panicking?"

Right now, there is a crisis at the CDC where testing efforts have been hamstrung due to poor quality control and leadership. Instead of focusing on containment and safety issues, Trump et al. seems fixated on the stock market and what this means to his curated image. Why does he seem to be fixated on getting a vaccine out in months? Because this would be in time before the elections. After that, it doesn't matter to him. Is it any wonder that rather than taking the reigns himself on the most serious crisis of his presidency, Trump decides to hand over management to Pence."
2020-03-03 18:11,"Misleading headline and story. The Fed cannot control interest rates, which are set at auction for treasury bills. It has control over the discount rate at its window, lender of last resort to banks that cannot get loans from private banks to cover their overnight shortage to meet liquidity requirements. That lever need not directly affect the Treasury auction. Milton Friedman made this point clear, and history has shown he was right. For example, during the Bush Jr administration, the Fed wanted to raise rates but could not because T Bills were being bought up which kept rates low.

This is yet one more economic/finance myth that Trump doesn't seem to grasp and which his jawboning has made ever more Americans believe. It's nonsense. 

The Fed's target rate is not any sort of guarantee of coming interest rates."

Moreover, from a public health standpoint, greedy GOP fiscal policies have left the US with arguably little room to respond to pandemics. For example, testing for corona virus infection should be free of charge for all citizens. If self-quarantine is required, employers and employees should be subsidized to make that practicable for real people who need to eat real food and pay real bills."

Make sure that the costs related to that test and the potential treatment are covered. There are many people who fear the costs to go to a medical provider.

Makes sure that all public schools are well equipped with all needs to protect children, teachers; Run ads to educate people (not scare people) to follow a strict hygienic procedure throughout the days

Make sure that health professionals and scientists are running the process from the start to the end - and Mr. president just be quiet for one or two weeks!

This move goes back via the Greenspan Way, and it is about making investors happy, not keeping prices and markets stable, which is what central banks are supposed to be about.  The danger of lowering interest rates with every downturn in the stock market is that when the real economy actually does need a shot in the arm by way of making capital cheaper, that tool won't be available.

Everyone in this administration now seems to be psychics, somehow able to  appease every Trump wish before he even tweets his rage. The answer to the COVID 19 is not cuts to interest rates, tax cuts, or suspending tariffs, it is full steam ahead organization from the top down utilizing test kits, production of a vaccine, giving the public information they can trust to be accurate and not sugar coated by Trump,  and coordinating with State and Local governments.

My viewpoint must sound very quaint to those of you who pillage and manipulate the markets for your personal gain everyday, but that's the way it used to be. People invested for the long-term and held their positions.

The Fed should not be rigging the markets to protect speculators. Small businesses and seniors on fixed incomes and distributions should be assisted by Congress directly through enactment of a small business loan program and suspension of required minimum distributions in 2020 and beyond if necessary as was done in 2008 and 2009.

The original charge of the Fed was to help control inflation, but central bank borrowing rates have in the past decade become the tool of preference for all sorts of economic and political problems.

One can only assume that Powell, like everyone else in the Trump orbit is the President's lap dog- Trump calls for a large cut, and presto, less that 12 hours later Powell reduces the rate by a large increment.

What possible help can lower borrowing rates offer, except to give the idiots on Wall Street cheap money too continue their heedless gambling on the biggest Casino of the all, Wall Street. The days are long gone where considered long term analysis of companies were the basis for the ups and downs in the stock market. Now, with approximately 2/3 of trades executed by automated trading apps the stock market means nothing in terms of the overall health and viability of the American economy and the companies traded on Wall Street.

The Europeans have made the same mistake, and now, with already negative rates, and a slowing European economy, they have no room left to help bolster European economies."
2020-03-03 18:05,"This is not the remedy required in a pandemic mode. They had little room to begin with and now there is hardly anything left, if needed. Then, the faux president immediately said this is not enough and it should have been bigger as we are not playing on a level playing field. 

Really?  This faux president care only for himself and not the citizens of the US. 

The Fed is only providing $$$ for the 1% with most not holding stocks except in their retirement accounts, if they have one. 

Where is the leadership? Oh yeah, there is NONE!"
2020-03-03 18:12,Unnecessary and election year.  Sad to see the Fed cave like this.
2020-03-03 17:44,I’m breathing more easily just at the mention of an interest rate cut.  What can the Fed do now that will cure my cancer?

When a recession hits the Fed will be impotent."
2020-03-03 18:21,"Increasingly, Jerome Powell comes over as Trump’s lackey. Jerome Powell isn’t running the Federal Reserve for the good of the nation; rather, he’s running it to please his master. Can we, perhaps, say that Jerome Powell is ‘his master’s voice’?"
2020-03-03 17:27,"Yesterday all Trump’s Billionaire Cronies did him a favor and boosted the markets.

But the markets did not comply by themselves this morning.

So the Fed cut rates.  That did not work either.  

So Powell did a Press Conference.  Markets went way down.

NOW WHAT?

Likely Trump Tantrum."

2020-03-03 18:17,"The problem is this isn't an economic problem, but a health problem that drags on the economy.  You can't fix a virus with lower interest rates, so this is just nonsense as people have money, they just aren't traveling or working in factories."
2020-03-03 18:42,"""Central banks cannot keep disease from spreading, prevent workers from losing hours at work, or mend broken supply chains amid factory delays."". EXACTLY. This rate cut is not going to do a darn thing to change the fact that damaged supply chains are causing a production and sales slowdown. It's not like companies can magically create a factory in the US to make the supplies they need; that requires long-term planning. 

I am disturbed by today's action by the Fed. Yet again, it appears the Fed is bowing to angry pressure from Trump. What happened to the Fed's vaunted independence? And the rate cut could end up creating more fear and panic."
2020-03-03 18:43,At least the government has finally taken some action with regard to the coronavirus... I just wish the action taken were at all relevant to the problem.

2020-03-03 18:50,"Each time the market undergoes a healthy correction because of trump’s trade war, and because of the massive increase in deficits caused by trump and gop tax cuts for gop billionaires and companies that were already paying little or no taxes by offshoring money, and because of the panic caused by a bumbling trump, the fed cuts the rate. It does nothing to address trump’s irrational behavior and in the case of the latest cut, the fallout from trump’s very slow response and utter incompetence. He tried to overturn obamacare and create chaos, slash spending on the cdc and nih, cut aid to the un and foreign countries-all these have worsened coronavirus and its very serious threat to america. The fed cant do anything about an insane trump"
2020-03-03 18:35,"What if, just what if,  the Fed is doing precisely the wrong thing right now in cutting interest rates?  What if the feckless Fed chairman was more concerned about keeping all dimensions of our economy robust rather than spinelessly giving in yet again to Trump's inane Twitter bullying? We have trillion dollar deficits,  bond interest rates ridiculously low, simple savings interest nonexistent, stock prices tend to be madly overvalued, and a correction arguably was long overdue in any event.   It might be important to keep in mind that though Trump graduated from the vaunted Wharton Business School at Penn, he has betrayed near-zero understanding of business, government, or economic matters.   What if the obsessive focus on the stock market by Trump and his minion Powell is undermining overall longterm economic growth?"
2020-03-03 18:59,At this time the only effect of a rate cut is to pump up stock prices.  The effects of that on the real economy will be very limited.  But I guess Trump and his rich friends know not to let a good crisis go to waste.  What's next when this doesn't work?  More tax cuts for real estate developers and rich people?
2020-03-03 19:00,Trying to stop a pandemic via monetary policy. This is 2020 in a nutshell.
2020-03-03 19:02,"Well. I guess that rate cut didn't work. I wonder what they will try tomorrow?

It reminds me of the old Earl Weaver story about when the Os were in the middle of a big losing streak. The players demanded a team meeting. Earl replied ""so if we have a team meeting and we lose again tonight, what do I do tomorrow? Have another team meeting?"""
2020-03-03 19:05,"Trump will cut the interest rate any time he can.

Trump controls Powell.

Interest rate cut = more profit for busineses."

2020-03-03 19:10,"The President finally is achieving one of his goals with the Fed left with only 1% to cut before arriving at zero. He probably thinks thinks that means free money,  as if a rate of zero or into negative territory will cure all ills. Time for the Prez to take a break from the campaign trail and focus on the spread of covid 19. After further consideration of that last sentence, maybe people with the skills and abilities to deal with covid 19 left in this administration would be better off with a Trump that is engaged elsewhere so they can get their best effort out there without his meddling."
2020-03-03 19:14,"An immediate cut of all tariffs and duties, something the President can actually do would do more to immediately stimulate the economy both in the USA and globally than a rate cut.

The fed was right to cut.  It's pretty obvious we are going into recession.  It's not enough to overcome the terrible economic policy by this administration.  

Small businesses that have had their cash flow squeezed by draconian tariffs will not survive long enough to be able to borrow money at lower rates."
2020-03-03 19:16,This is an acknowledgment that the impact of the virus will probably be severe and the President is scared. Unlikely he’s scared that people will suffer (other than himself)
2020-03-03 19:16,"The Fed is not responding to fears about the coronavirus  on which a lower interest rate will have no effect, but on trump's fear that the economy will slow and stocks plunge further, leading to his defeat at the polls in November.  Trump once again thinks only about himself and not the sufferingof the nation."
2020-03-03 19:17,"I don't see how this could help. Covid-19 is by definition a true black-swan event, something that's not engineered by men (unlike the subprime mortgage crisis that we KNEW it's heading off a cliff). If anything, I see this as a good thing, that the corrections in markets (not just stock markets, but hopefully in property markets, and more) as a good thing, since all of them are way, way, way overpriced. Case in point: Stock market (NASDAQ) returns in 2019 is 37%+ which is clearly not sustainable. Even if it comes down by 20% now, it would still have been 17% ahead than it was in Jan 2019.

Me, I'm not worried. Let the correction begin. As Buffet would have it, when everyone is heading to the exit, it's high time to go back in."
2020-03-03 19:18,"I see that Wall Street has been reassured by the Fed's slashing of interest rates! We're in for a rough ride, it seems."
2020-03-03 19:18,"The ""fed"" just made it cheaper for the elite to borrow money to buy stocks that have plummeted to their lowest levels in 10 years. In 2 years they will sell these same stocks at a premium to the band wagoners ensuring themselves a tidy tax free profit,  collectively in the trillions of dollars.
Catch that falling knife."
2020-03-03 19:19,"So the Fed bows to pressure from Trump, do an emergency cut, and the market still tanks. Now what?
Instead of cheap money, and tax cuts, how about investing in the science to find a vaccine and provide medical care instead of cutting the budget of the CDC and NIH? 
Financial jujitsu will not stop a pandemic."

Like many others, I'm simply disgusted by the government we have."
2020-03-03 19:21,Sounds like the Fed's just interested in propping up stock prices by making interest bearing instruments less attractive.  Very little economic stimulus will result - only a bit more fuel added to a years long speculative stock surge.   If Trump wants to be reelected - get congress to approve a trillion dollar infrastructure program - rebuild our crumbling rail and highways and bridges!  Interest rates on US treasuries will be at historical lows - basically free money in the short term.  That alone could ignite real growth in the face of a pandemic and that growth would last decades.  Or wait until January 2021 and get it done with Dem's in charge.
2020-03-03 19:30,"Goes to show you how little the current administration understands macro economics and irrational fears of the market. The fed, by taking a huge sledge hammer to the rates, signaled that they are worried. And the irrational investors/gamblers (which also includes little of my money) saw it as a sign of fear and the market reflected the fear. We must keep our fortitude and calmness in times like this...and this administration has neither the fortitude nor clam."
2020-03-03 19:31,"I work for a major railway company that runs an immense rail network with a skeleton crew. When these overworked and exhausted workers inevitably fall ill, which they do with regularity, the company will not accept medical documentation as proof of illness and disciplinary measures frequently ensue, persecuting the worker to function while ill, potentially spreading the virus, and endangering public safety.  To add insult to injury, these same workers receive negligible, if any, sick pay while absent from work due to illness. This is in a country with socialised medicine and free healthcare, better placed than most for withstanding a viral siege. Even so, how can these workers maintain employment stability during a pandemic? How can they self isolate for fourteen days and still pay their bills and feed their families and avoid persecution? They’re not paid enough during healthier times to plan for a doomsday scenario.

America is well placed for economic ruin emanating from a viral outbreak because it has never insulated itself from the risk. Countries that possess socialised medical infrastructure and humane employment laws will weather the storm much more effectively. Only privileged Americans, with generous benefits and paid sick leave, will be able to afford to get sick. The rest will suffer as they must."
2020-03-03 19:33,"A Fed rate cut would be a reasonable option if the problem was tight credit and high unemployment. A potential pandemic, on the other hand, requires that consumers and businesses be convinced that America’s leaders and institutions are prepared to handle the crisis. 

Nothing that Donald Trump has done since his inauguration would lead anyone to believe that he is capable of managing this or any other crisis. On the contrary, Trump’s penchant for lying and obfuscating to gain short term advantages conveys a marked absence of focus, understanding and willingness to honestly confront essential circumstances. 

Thank God for leaders like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who is both knowledgeable on the facts and willing to share them with America."
2020-03-03 19:35,"The conservative ""Starve the Beast"" strategy is now in place.  Covid-19 is hastening a recession, the federal government is already spending a trillion more than it takes in, and the Fed has no tools left to stimulate the economy."
2020-03-03 19:38,"This administration is clearing the equivalent of a square peg being forced into a round hole all the while telling everyone one it's a perfect fit.

For the life of me, I have no clue as to the reason nor rhyme of this motive to cut interest rates by 1/2 percentage point as a ""pre-emptive move to protect the economy from the coronavirus.""

How about spending more money on the testing kits so they are available or how about .5 percent interest loans for families if the breadwinners must stay home due to this virus?

Once again, sound the alarm to close the barn door even though the cows have been long gone for awhile."

The purpose of gaslighting has always been; the subject not understanding right from wrong. I am not a psychiatrist but I am afraid the century long experiment has been a complete and total success.
I understand data and I am trying to understand why the Obama/Biden administration is considered a success when the hope and change did less than nothing to stem the 55 years of growing inequality and the next election may see the end of social security and an already frayed and weakened social safety net.
My history tells me that there never was a food shortage in Ireland and that the potato blight was the excuse to cull those not contributing to the economic success were culled as the newly created neoliberal The Economist led the demand that the hungry not be fed.

In fairness, Trump did warn you all that you would tire of it by the end, as a result of his expert handling of the US economy. It is indeed possible to have a surfeit of all things good, even winning. Then, la dolce vita becomes too commonplace for those who can partake of it. It looks as if we might have arrived at the tipping point."
2020-03-03 19:59,"The Feds are cutting rates to appease trump. Trump doesn’t care about the long rage health of the economy, he just wants a band-aid placed on the gaping economic wound and hobble it along until after the 2020 election.

2020-03-03 18:42,Trump has been badgering Powell to keep interest rates low for years now in an attempt to artificially rev up the economy.  When we really need a rate cut which is not now there is no room for the Fed to act.  The foolishness of the Trump administration has no bounds.

Unlike Trump he wisely admits he does not have all the answers. Nor will he take all the blame. 
Could he be trying to hint to Trump to give up on the gratuitous and self serving casual lies only to look like an old ignorant buffoon a few minutes later. Then double down by blaming the free press and trying to gag it at every turn. 

Trump would have a chance at being effective if he would go to Capital Hill today and push Congress to unleash spending  across the waterfront to deal with this epidemic. 
Expanded Medicaid, a vaccine, augmented hospital beds, staff, supplies and a nation wide Manhattan style project to get scientists collaborating. 
So much to be done and so little time.

2020-03-03 20:15,"The Fed Reserve now appears to have wasted a resource by deploying a rate cut in a circumstance where rate cuts yield no benefit. There was no benefit to a rate cut in this instance because the present contraction in spending is unrelated to rates and therefore unresponsive to rate-based stimulus. 

This bad policy decision was disappointing because, as growth softens and as consumer confidence diminishes, Fed Reserve should have conserved resources now for effective deployment later (post COVID-19) at a time when spending would respond to rate stimulus.

""But there are limits to what rate cuts can do to contain the damage. While they can bolster confidence and help to keep borrowing cheap, central banks cannot prevent disease from spreading or mend broken supply chains amid factory delays.""

Pretty sure this should be the main take-away from this article. I understand that it is important to protect our economic interests but let's be real, if this thing should happen to turn into something akin to the second go-around of the 1918 Flu Epidemic all the rate cutting in the world is not going to help.

If you're going to throw money at the problem perhaps it would be more beneficial to provide more money for testing kits, bolstering our hospitals, protecting our health care workers. You know, hedge fund owners & CEO's can get the virus too, they might be inclined to want a robust response to the virus if it threatens them.

Meanwhile he hasn't really articulated a solution to the public health crisis. Odd, how Trump has overruled both houses of Congress to declare an immigration emergency in order to get money for his wall, yet he continually downplays the expanding health emergency that is taking lives right now.

Or would we rather have only the option for people to double-and triple up in one bedroom apartments, or worse.  The Fed and the Trump administration, embarressingly, believe the public consists of people who cannot possibly understand their importance.  And the parasite CEO investors continue to dump currency into Treasury Bonds. They do this because they don't give a hoot about anybody but themselves. They don't care, except insofar as they can save their money on the backs of everybody else.  Nevermind dumping currency into bonds just makes it harder for regular people to acquire the same benefits enjoyed by the barons of finance. So spare me the phony narrative, as I know with some certainty that its all crocodile tears coming from the Trump and big investors.  The Fed needs to put a halt that immoral behavior."

Trump continues to spread this insidious myth, and he will do so in the 2020 election campaign. How many times has he said that if people vote for a Democrat, the stock market will tank? Ridiculous. He is in the White House and the market is tanking. He further thinks that if he screams at Powell enough, the FED will lower interest rates, and THAT will cause the market to rise (and Trump will take the credit).

A rate cut may help stop a free falling securities market. It won’t significantly alter the effect an epidemic will have on productivity and consumer demand. It won’t fix the disruption in supply chains because of travel bans and quarantines abroad.

I don't see how it could possible help the economy in the areas that they are responsible for in their charter. The coronavirus is not subject to economic manipulation. How is consumer demand and employment going to be changed? How will the inflation rate be changed?
2020-03-04 3:35,"I'm amazed at so many people who think they are experts on Fed policy, when in reality they know very little. 

The cut in fed funds rate was linked to problems in bank liquidity which sometimes shows up in the repo-markets. Specifically, as people draw down their deposits to hoard cash or hoard groceries(use of cash), this causes liquidity problems for banks. Similarly as markets drop, trading firms need cash to prop up their money losing positions, i.e. sell bonds over night to get cash in the repo market causing banks to have in tern to have large unexpected cash needs. 

This may also be tied to banks/brokers/hedge funds having liquidity  problems as people pull out their cash such as at Robinhood. (a run on the bank)  - This is an educated guess."

In other words, it may well be that the hundred of thousands of people that are known to come down with the flu each year in spite of the flu vaccine, actually were infected with the Coronavirus instead to the 4  variants of the common types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D.   The bottomline-Covid-19 is essentially a flu with low mortality rates like the common flu that may have went molecularly undiagnosed for a long time. Caution &  14 days quarantine of carriers are a good approach until a vaccine is at hand, but all the hype and economical panic may have much more dangerous consequences than the virus itself."

2020-03-03 13:48,"This why it matters.   It isn't just about how many get sick but also the ripple effects through the system.    ER patients are at risk when ERs have potentially ill patients.  Any procedures deemed unnecessary will be pushed off to keep beds available and healthy patients healthy.   People may avoid doctor's offices and not get necessary treatment for looming blood pressure or diabetes issues.   

Also, the town of Kirkland had to take 1/4 of its emergency response team off line because they were exposed at the nursing home where four deaths have occurred."
2020-03-03 14:14,"Collateral damages are unavoidable.  COVID-19 took a heavy toll on citizens of Wuhan.  Without adequate personnel & equipment in the beginning, imminent death threats took precedent on all other sickness.  But things should have been improved since more resources have poured into Wuhan and Hubei province in particular.

But it shouldn't affect people, who need medical attention, in other cities where hospitals still open & infected patients are not that many to delay or cancel the normal medical practice.  Rural territories could present a problem that traffic to the city is controlled and monitored.  Even then, getting medical help is still possible and doable, but will take more time and effort to get the pass going to places.

I have sympathy for those affected person.  I am sure Chinese government will take prudent actions to remedy this inconvenience."

In January, we complained that the Chinese government is lack of transparency. Looking at our own government, I am not sure the Trump administration is so much better. When the virus started spreading in China, we were laughing at the Chinese for their incompetence and insufficient health care to handle the crisis. During this time, we were smiling and drinking beers and said that pandemic is good for the US economy. We have done nothing to prepare for the worst. The Chinese built two hospitals in a week and locked down the city of Wuhan. It looks like the situation is under control now in China.
Now the pandemic is finally coming to our door and we are totally unprepared. We wasted 2 months of time. Where were our government leaders and politicians? They only care about the next election. They don’t care about the pandemic. The democrats probably think that the pandemic is good for them. What do they care about? Today is Super Tuesday. Really? It is a super day for the politicians.

2020-03-03 12:36,"The flexibility to shift points of care and sources of medication will be more problematic in the US given our decentralized, multiple insurance plans which control costs by limiting access.  Overcoming this challenge will be that much more complicated if insurance company staffing is limited due to quarantine restrictions.  Finally, the lack of ability of the many electronic health record systems in use to share patient data in an efficient manner will hamper flexibility too—particularly in a time of healthcare labor shortage.  Hopefully case numbers will not push America to this state of emergency but it is an challenge that is best addressed with federal coordination with insurance companies and healthcare systems."

No city is going to be adequately prepared for something of this magnitude. Unfortunately sacrifices and compromises have to be made to contain the spread of the virus. More importantly, I wouldn’t want to go to the hospital, if I was already immune-compromised with chemotherapy, to have the additional burden of being possibly infected by the virus."
2020-03-03 15:01,"This is precisely the problem with such epidemics. If the rate of infection is not adequately managed, services become overwhelmed and there is a cascade of consequences. It is a numbers game. If you have too many people infected and severely ill at the same time, medical services are overwhelmed for everyone. Many who might have been fine with adequate care, die. This is why death rates were higher at the epicenter. Further in the game, there can be loss of more essential services/utilities/supplies. Beyond medical supplies, things like food, water, and power cannot be taken for granted. This is why I am so upset that we, the US, has squandered the time afforded us by our luck that this started far away and China's containment and mitigation measures. If we are hit in force, many will unnecessarily suffer and die. It was obvious that this was coming, yet we seem to have done little to prepare, to the extent of being unable to even test in a meaningful way. We are flying blind."

At this point we are only aware of people who are visibly ill, not those who are infected.  The one question that's never  been answered was how many people traveled from China to the US before China acknowledged Coronavirus existed?  Isn't the answer weeks?"

We're talking one in roughly seventeen thousand folks by those numbers, and presumably many infected weeks ago are now fully recovered. 
Or, as mentioned by a health expert from Yale, it's entirely possible that the cure for Covid-19, in a manner of speaking, has resulted in far more deaths from other preventable causes. I mean we're talking about 1/17,000, surely more folks than that need emergency surgeries, antibiotics, treatment for stroke and heart attacks, diabetes, kidney and liver problems . . .  
It'll be really interesting if epidemiologists ever had accurate numbers to report on the aftermath. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. 
(Since a fetish for wild animals with purported medicinal properties led to the outbreak in the first place, why are the hospitals so crowded?

Perhaps also my two week old granddaughter whose mother has a month left of unpaid maternity leave. The expense to any of us from a quarantine will be unmanageable.

On 3/2/20 it then reopened and closed the gap from 2/28/20. Today, 3/3/20, it closed the gap from 2/27/20. 

It will likely continue to struggle up this week to close the gap on 2/24/20.

When cut interest rates, you enable giant corporations to buy their stocks back at ultra-low prices even as they continue to issue junk corporate debt to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.  

You can not Twitter away or cause the impact of a massive business to slow down through lower interest rates FOR BANKS.   If anything, rates should have continued their upward trajector to signal confidence from the Fed.

If you want to stimulate the economy, give money to people who need it, working people, struggling with the debt-induced in many cases because of of the 2005 bankruptcy act for TBTF banks, credit card companies and payday lenders that eviscerated the right for people who went into debt due to a lack of insurance or losing their job due to the TBTF induced crash of 2008, which caused many to lose their homes, their life savings and were left only with credit cards to put food on their kids tables.

There was an initial, talismanic response to the rate cut, but the Federal Reserve *obviously* can't mitigate the impacts of a pandemic. Given the mood, and America's irrationality in general, volatility on a downward trend-line seems likely.

2020-03-03 16:51,"Stock Market was supposed to be erratic after rate cut as it already jumped ~4.5% in anticipation of today's rate cut. It will start falling soon, so i guess, another tweet from president and another rate cut from fed?"
2020-03-03 16:53,"The deeper context concerns me. Under Trump, annual deficits increased by 70 percent to a stunning sustained rate exceeding 4 percent of GDP per fiscal year. Interest rates are at historic lows. The national debt is aroung 80 percent of GDP and is projected to continue to grow as fiscal deficits outpace economic growth.

These are unsustainable numbers on their own. Those numbers in the context of coronavirus are frightening. Coronavirus presents a potential shock to the economy both on the supply and demand sides. Supply chains may be disrupted abroad. Domestic demand may recede. 

Where are the macroeconomic tools to combat simultaneous supply and demand shocks? Looks to me like both the Fed and the Treasury are short of bullets.

Trump's goofy macroeconomic policies may come home to haunt him. The sad part is that the burden will be borne not by him and the one-percenters, but by people in the middle- and lower-income brackets."
2020-03-03 16:54,There's only one reason why the fed is getting involved and that is because Trump is worried about his reelection
2020-03-03 16:55,"Our economy is much too dependent on cheap imports from China.

If China's economy comes to a grinding halt because of Coronavirus, there will be a supply shortage. Rate cuts are effective for boosting demand. But they aren't as effective - if at all -- at boosting supply, since the supply shortage from China is caused by factors that are entirely outside the Fed's control. 

In the short term, this rate cut might be effective at postponing the death spiral of massive layoffs. Emphasis on 'might'. But in the medium to long term, it's just about anyone's guess.

We have become so entrenched in our ideology of Capitalism curing itself of any and all ills - All Hail the Invisible Hand! - that we didn't even consider the possibility that a virus might bring down the entire house of cards.

So, here we are, in the 21st Century, like a deer in the headlights, with no plan, and no clue what to do next.

Rate cuts and tax cuts don't work on viruses."
2020-03-03 17:00,"Lots of talk about helping the economy, but near nothing from the federal government about healthcare during an outbreak.

And still no idea how people in the US will receive medical help and who will pay for it. Some stories of people paying thousands to test themselves is scary.

Yes, “rate cuts” can fit on a bumper sticker so those who don’t know better can rally to it, but it doesn’t address the actual disease."

We're not having a crisis of 'high interest rates'. Rather than lowering interest rates, it would perhaps make sense to offer loans to specific affected businesses if they are having difficulty staying afloat. To the layman, the rate cut looks like a bald manipulation of the stock market."

A frequent estimate is that commerce -- people buying stuff -- constitutes about 70% of the economy.  If people stop travelling, stop going out to eat, stop going to events and start hoarding what cash they have, we are looking at a serious recession.

Trump believes the stock market is a direct indicator of the economy (market up = economy up, market down = economy down). 
Sort of like climate deniers who think if the outside temp is down, so must be the climate.
Well, it seems Mr. Powell did kowtow, and what did it produce?

The economy wasn't slow and slowing due to the cost of money, but in reaction to what is more clearly a systemic economic operational impact from this virus. It may not in fact be that bad from medical perspective, but it will slow economies materially. A lower cost of money will not make it all better.

Now Trump is whining some more that the Fed must “further ease” and that not doing so is “not fair to the USA” (read: to Trump). Clearly, he is panicking that the stock market bubble he has juiced by running up the deficit will burst and ruin his re-election prospects.

He said to be prepared to stay at home, work from home and well have your emergency plan ready.  The markets and people fear this reality.  COV 19 is in our communities and our health care system is underfunded, not coordinated and short on tests for COV 19.  The sick will just stay at home=not working vs going broke by going to our for profit hospitals.  In Oregon a local health care union stated that it is under staffed to refill a group of quarantined dozen or so nurses at a med center  where two people have COV 19. The county  quarantined over 50 because of an infected school worker. The school closed for 3 days=loss of work for parents and teachers. In Eastern Or. a casino worker has the COV 19 so the Casino  is shut and 100's if not thousands were exposed and job days are lost.  News just said that he also attended a high school basketball game were hundreds more were exposed so the county prudently cancelled large sporting events = janitor, concession, school rental money is lost.

And one again, Trump promotes this. Lower interest rates won't help fractured supply chains any time soon. Lower interest rates won't help consumer spending as sick people stay home, companies lay off workers and close plants due to component shortages, and demand falls as those people cut back. Lower rates will, however, help real estate investors... and the lower bond rates make Trump's huge deficit and debt accumulation less a burden in the short term. The wrong solution, but at least Powell's trying."

Better watch out you don't go into negative interest returns for investors as you'll see the banks with no money as the investors will withdraw all their money from the banks and banks will go bankrupt or have to foreclose on properties or however it works. Not much room for movement by the government as interest rates creep lower. Just delaying the inevitable."

No spin from our fearless leader and his groveling experts will change that and no rate cut is needed since the corporations are sitting on piles of cash that they use only to buy their own stocks. I suggest they put all of their cash into buying their own stock, you know, if they think it's such a good investment, and they are such brilliant corporate leaders. Surely they think so.

Why would a rate cut help the economy when supply chain issues and softening demand due to understandable fears of the virus are what appear to be the issues?

2020-03-03 20:28,"I've been harping on about how since Trump was elected, that he should have not given tax cuts and should have paid down government debt that is in the trillions. If you governments debt is low then the government has more room to manoeuvre when the nation hits a rocky period or rainy day.  It's a domino effect, what worked once, like lowering interest rates won't work once the rates hit rock bottom and will have a negative effect on the markets. The rich won't loose anything as most of their companies on the stock market will be limited liability.
Our government in NZ has set up a Corporate Welfare fund to pay wages of companies affected by downturn in export orders and tourism. Our government has been squirrelling away money for a rainy day so we'll weather this better than the USA."

But it’s not free. I pay.  Just looked at a few of my monetary savings instruments, the interest rates have changed already…in the negative direction.  The world monetary consensus was not to lower rates, but when you have a Stable Genius literally ordering functions of government by fiat to save his own skin, this is what we get."

Monetary policy is not the remedy to a global pandemic.

This is in stark contrast to the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis. Lower interest rates were critical to refinancing high private debt levels and residential mortgages.

Basel III made sweeping changes to bank asset quality, solvency and liquidity ratios.

Dodd-Frank improved fundamental issues in mortgage underwriting and securitization.

Cutting interest rates in the face of a global pandemic simply illustrates how ineffectual monetary policy is at this stage in the expansion.

Trump is to blame for browbeating the Fed to cut rates 75 basis points a year ago while simultaneously claiming the US economy was never better.

Also, his poorly targeted corporate tax giveaway created record fiscal deficits exceeding a trillion dollars annually. He thought this would lead to investment, but corporate investment fell instead.

He created massive structural fiscal deficits also while claiming America’s economy was never better.

He slashed the CDC and NIH budgets that could have contained the pandemic, and failed to address climate change or rebuild infrastructure.

He built a wall on the Mexican border that fell down with a gust of wind (see climate change).

Trump is directly responsible for the health and economic impact of COVID-19. He is a disaster as the illegitimate occupant of the White House."

The most devastating things for an economy, besides a meteor hitting us, is war on your territory, famine and pestilence. The latter two have high probability compare to the first. 

So we have this humongous military to prevent war on territory and a modest surplus of food to mitigate (not prevent) famine. Obama did his best to provide a buffer against pestilence but Trump discarded it, and like Obamacare, had nothing for a replacement.

The stock market is plunging because of panic selling caused by fears that the continued spread of the corona virus will cause a major slowdown of business activities.

Good grief, dude, the problem is external to our monetary mechanisms.  Certainly I can understand bulls wanting to buy stocks that are much cheaper than they were two weeks ago (cost-averaging), but if the equity markets are going to fall during this impending crisis (forgive me if I'm over stating the issue) the FED can do nothing about it.  However, the President can.

Shifting gears, Trump hasn't hesitated one second before climbing on Obama's shoulders to claim ..ALL.. the credit for Obama's work in pulling things together after 2008 Great Recession created by Bush and the Republicans and setting the scene for the sustained recovery that began in the last years of his administration and has continued till now. And for whatever reason, most people allow Trump to take credit for something he hasn't done simply because he's currently in office.

Based on this 'reasoning' shouldn't Trump also be held ..ENTIRELY.. responsible for the pending economic downturn/crash, even though he has no real connection to the virus? Wouldn't that be fair?"

""Since the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a major Ebola outbreak in the West African nation of Guinea in March  of this year, it seems that the Obama administration is doing everything in its power to make sure the virus spreads across America. A series of blunders and shocking policy moves highlight how the federal government is allowing immigration from the affected African countries to trump the nation’s public health, even to the point of risking a spread of the virus across the country. Most shocking is the fact that .... around 100 to 150 Africans from the Ebola region are entering the United States each day, testified Thomas R.

And it ain't a skinned knee here that we are looking at.

Trump is very fearful, that much is clear. If the economy slips into a recession he could very well lose the election. With the White House in Democratic hands Trump's administration's past behavior will be under scrutiny. His immunity gone, his tax records exposed. Very vulnerable indeed.

It would have helped to not purge 'disloyal' employees who insist on speaking truths that are at odds with trump's fantasies.  It would help to have the CDC relay as much information about the virus and its spread, but that might make our narcissist-in-chief look bad.  It would help if trump actually listened to experts instead of Limbaugh and the talking-head sycophants at FOX.

Cancel all other tariffs including those on China.
And of course get the other sides to cancel their reciprocal tariffs.
The US Treasury has collected multi $billions in tariffs (paid by Americans). Get that money flowing into the economy.
Cancel the huge tax cuts given to the rich. Even add a 'wealth tax'?
Use all that revenue for two things - Infrastructure! And a boost to 'social security', on things like 'unemployment benefits', because there are going to be lots of layoffs. And a guarantee that nobody or family is going to be bankrupted due to medical expenses.
And cut the Pentagon military budget. That is unaffordable & getting out of hand.
Infrastructure? Hire Chinese engineers to show you how to build roads, bridges, railways, high rise buildings, 3 to 4 times faster than anybody in the US. And 500 times faster if you need COVID-19 hospitals & clinics.

On that basis, CORVID-19 is still 10 times more deadly than the Swine Flu of recent years, although not as deadly as SARS, but SARS was much harder to catch. Young emergency physicians and front-line workers are dying from Corvid-19."
2020-03-03 14:52,"How is it that some countries are testing 10,000+ people a day and the US can't test more than a few dozen?

The US healthcare system is the world's most expensive failure. Yet another reason for the sort of fundamental reform advocated by the likes of Senator Sanders."
2020-03-03 14:52,"One of my MD colleagues in Boise travelled to Seattle recently, now has a fever and a cough. Can't get him tested because he does't meet any of the case definitions the CDC has put out. Coronavirus is all around us already and we don't know it. The CDC has botched this big time, but I wonder how much Trump has had to do with that?"
2020-03-03 14:33,"“It’s just a very American approach to say, ‘We’re the U.S., the major U.S. public health lab, and we’re going to not follow the leader,’” Dr. Mina said regarding why we are not using the W.H.O. test.

Our American hubris will be the death of many of us. Time to start thinking globally!"
2020-03-03 14:33,"Trump was criticized for acting too quickly by blocking visitors from Asia. Now we hear that some arrived a few days earlier and infected people in Washington state. I expect that Trump will now be criticized for acting too slowly. I really would like to hear the Democrat Candidates’ positions on allowing persons from our southern border to rush into the US for treatment when they believe that they are ill. Everyone knows that Trump is only in favor of orderly, legal immigration."
2020-03-03 14:37,"The coronavirus seems to be hitting a perfect storm of incompetence and mismanagement at all levels here. First, Trump gutted the pandemic response team that Obama assembled just out of sheer petty spite, taking out an agency that might have been able to rapidly mobilize a response, then, he’s muzzled anyone who contradicts his rosy forecasts because he’s afraid of how the stock market will react. The CDC itself, hampered by budget cuts and probably horrendously low morale amongst its remaining staff bungled its testing kit and either CDC or Trump administration made the idiotic rule to limit testing. Now that the virus has gotten multiple footholds all over the country we will see how a health care system where too many people are uninsured and a government that doesn’t care and will charge for testing and quarantine will hold up because too many of the most vulnerable will stay away from medical facilities and go to work out of sheer economic necessity further impacting all of us and making it impossible to stop the spread of disease. Add to that Pence who will do no better than pray the disease away and we look worse than a third world country in our response to this pandemic. ALL of this is thanks to the GOP which has kept the US from protecting its citizens in every way in the name of greed."
2020-03-03 14:46,"This must be fake news.  The President assured us the situation was under control, it was not an issue in America, and that the government was ready to deal with the virus."
2020-03-03 14:46,"Trump has made it very clear that he did not care about the effect that coronavirus had on the American public as much as worried about how it would hurt his stock market. This is disgraceful, putting numbers ahead of human life."

2020-03-03 14:53,"Make no mistake - this is the Trump administration's fault.  We could have had the WHO test weeks ago, but the decisions at the executive level were ""no.""

Trump initially wanted to pretend like it was not in the US.  Now he has allowed the virus to silently spread everywhere, creating a much bigger and more dangerous situation."
2020-03-03 14:53,"“May gain a toehold...” 

It’s here, and it’s been spread for weeks and weeks. 

Here in California, we’re resigned to the fact that chances are countless people have the virus and are spreading the virus but have no way to tell if they, specifically, are carriers. There are no tests, and no resources, and apparently no one at the wheel.

It’s pretty scary, but what can you do? Drop the kids off at school, then go to work and hope for the best. The CDC and federal help are nowhere to be seen."
2020-03-03 14:54,"This is bad not only because of the possible epidemiological effects.

Following his character of trying to find a scapegoat to accept the responsibility he should be accepting, Trump will probably use this as an occasion to replace everybody he  can in the health care establishment with anti-vaccinators and other such non-scientific -- but politically loyal -- types.

2020-03-03 15:00,"There are critical questions which this Administration must provide clear and accurate answers to. Particularly, why didn’t the C.D.C., after the hugely consequential failure of its preferred, initial domestic testing kit, not quickly turn to acquiring the perfected W.H.O. test which had been developed in Germany? Invaluable, precious time was thereby lost allowing the unknown spread of the virus by asymptomatic infected people within this country. Was this decision made by political appointees at the C.D.C., possibly favoring commercial companies with direct connections to the Trump White House? With this corrupt Administration one cannot dismiss the possibility that decisions were made not by the acclaimed scientists and physicians at the C.D.C. but by lay agency employees motivated by a purely political agenda. The fear, of course, is allowing this totally unacceptable behavior to occur again, when faced with a new public health crisis. We must get to the “bottom” of these profoundly flawed decisions."
2020-03-03 15:04,Loosening the highly regulated testing process would go a long way in opening up access to tests.  Centralizing it at CDC seems like a mistake in hindsight.
2020-03-03 15:06,"Our leaders’ mantra has been “Do more with less” year in and year out since the Great Recession hit in 2009.  This is across businesses, government and non-profits.  So mistakes now are the obvious result after leaders have slashed expertise and appropriate staffing levels during the decade.  If Boeing mistakes crashed its new jet, it’s no surprise that the CDC has a flawed testing program. Perhaps we can learn that a death spiral strategy of “do more with less” is a losing strategy for us all."
2020-03-03 15:11,"It’s not just bureaucratic paralysis and stonewalling by the CDC and FDA, whose policies in actual fact affect the development and approval of many drugs, tests and vaccines in America. That’s usually a good thing, because it insures rigorous testing before releasing anything to the public. There’s no way on earth that anyone could have developed either a vaccine or a medicine for coronavirus in time for this pandemic. We’ll have one for the next time. However, the problem is further complicated by the fact that we are in peak flu season. It seems like everyone here in Houston has had the flu recently or has it now. My son works in a hospital and came down with a cough and fever yesterday. His hospital does not have the test for coronavirus. He went to occupational health and was sent home with Tamiflu. Is he most likely to have the plain old flu, or coronavirus? We’ll never know, but most probably he has regular flu. It doesn’t do any good now to point fingers or politicizing the problem. What is needed is the rapid development and distribution of tests - to be administered for free - and given to people who present with flu-like symptoms. Then isolate and quarantine those who test positive. You’re surely not going to test 350 million people. That’s ridiculous. In the meantime, practice good hygiene principles and for God’s sake if you feel sick, don’t go out and infect everyone else."
2020-03-03 15:11,"Ask a simple question:

To what extent has the CDC - a formerly well trusted federal agency - been ""Trumpified?""

Meaning, in federal agencies, the process by which competent dedicated officials from the last administration have been replaced by anti-government conservatives whose loyalty to Trump is the criteria for the job rather than expertise or devotion to public service. 

That's the most dangerous, fast spreading virus we've faced for three years."
2020-03-03 15:12,"This is the beginning of the ""what went wrong"" looks at what happened when the Covid-19 virus came to the U.S. So far the federal efforts (CDC, HHS, FDA) have not been inspiring. Perhaps if they can't do anything well they should step aside and give state and local agencies more authority. 

I really don't have much faith that a Covid-19 coordinated by Mike Pence will do much more than PR damage control."
2020-03-03 15:14,"The only way to get in front of the fight against this virus is to have testing kits ready weeks ago. If this sentence makes no sense, neither does the response America  has made to the looming pandemic. It's now too late to stop the infection from spreading. 

The only thing left for the C.D.C. and the Trump administration  to do is invest heavily in damage control, circle the wagons, and insist their response has been perfect. Problem solved. 

November can't come soon enough."
2020-03-03 15:17,The CDC and FDA should have let university labs use their own COVID-1 tests.  The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics infectious disease group had a test ready days ago and it could have been put to use.
2020-03-03 15:19,It appears as though our own government doesn't want us to know how widespread this virus is in our country.  Anyone with symptoms who is denied testing should report it to their local newspaper.  Maybe shaming our government into timely testing is our only option at this point.

It has one of the worst among developed nations and everyone knows it. Except Americans. The evidence is there for anyone who wants to see it.
2020-03-03 15:32,"Just last week people were yelling that the Trump Administration needed to stop interfering and allow the CDC to do its job.  Turns out intervention is greatly needed.  Kudos to the Trump Administration for taking charge and trying to work out all the glitches in a rapid response.

Hopefully its pressure on vaccine producers will speed things up there as well."
2020-03-03 15:49,"How often is the CDC providing updates on the number of test kits in production, the number that have actually been distributed and the number that are on back order?  The public should be demanding daily updates on these metrics as well as weekly updates on progress (if any) towards a vaccine.  There needs to be full transparency and frequent communication from the Government or eventually you are going to end up with social media induced panic."
2020-03-03 15:53,"I live in Seattle, and a week ago I came down with fever, cough, fatigue, muscle aches; I did have the flu shot this fall. I emailed my doctor TWICE in the past week. In both cases, I was told that if I had not been in direct contact with someone with coronavirus, and I hadn't been overseas, they didn't need to see me or test me.

Maybe I had the flu. Or maybe I had coronavirus. But since we know it's spreading person to person in the Seattle area, I think this is nuts. I teach high school and 150 kids a day come through my classroom (in addition to the staff I see daily, people in the halls, etc.). I stayed home for more than 24 hours after my fever subsided and I'm practicing good hygiene, but if we know this is spreading person to person and we know it's in my area (my school is just a few miles from the Life Care facility with the huge outbreaks)....why on earth wouldn't they want to test me?!

I am a healthy person with no major risk factors for succumbing to major problems even if it was coronavirus, but what about the people in my greater community?

When the W.H.O. warned that some countries needed to do better in their prevention efforts, I think this is what they were talking about. I can't miss two weeks of work because I maybe-possibly-might-have had coronavirus, and I've done as much due diligence as possible, been as responsible as possible, notified my healthcare team. 

I think that the way this is being handled is a huge mistake. I hope I'm wrong."
2020-03-03 15:57,"Public health researchers use the terms ""availability"" and ""accessibility""  of care to measure quality of health services.  In the US, the Covid-19 test has largely been unavailable due to centralized decision making.  Even if it now becomes more widely available it is not accessible to those who cant afford the fee.  Consequently, we should all expect problems to emerge that cannot easily be addressed in the system that we have.  As a grad of Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, I feel this has been a long time coming and will be a hard fall for the US."

He then denied the USA would suffer, which claim was bolstered by a failure to test as described in this article. That's what happens when a demagogue shoves science aside for political reasons. Wishful thinking is typical of authoritarian regimes like China which at first told the doctor who sounded the alarm about the coronavirus to shut up. It was just a hoax, I guess? The USA seems to have followed its example by limiting testing. Trump is no manager. He is all bluster and false claims, showing his ignorance of both this virus and the flu in his public erroneous comments about fatality rates. Instead of swiftly containing the spread of the virus by identifying, isolating and treating sick people , we are now playing catch up — a tragic consequence of incompetence. The resulting spread of the virus and the expanded death count is on him."

Professor Baric is known for his habit of understatement, very much like his colleagues across the community that study infectious diseases. His question points out the incompetence of our public health system, particularly that of the CDC. 

One of the reasons is that we have a fragmented system where accountability is not clear. From county public health officials to the Secretary of HHS (and now, maybe, sort of, the Vice President), there are myriad levels of responsibility. Add to that spectrum overlapping and conflicting agencies and jurisdictions where HHS and DHS and CDC and NIH et etc. fight for resources all the time and no one coordinates across them. 

We (mostly) solved a similar problem in creating the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs where the identity of who is in charge is not a question. Why cannot we do the same for our public health system?"

Average, run of the mill citizens have hardly any power - except to vote.  And we will, yes, be dedicated to making a change in DC, from White House throughout Congress this year.  

As a nurse of decades, I’ve seen suffering.  I’ve also seen treatment and healing.

But I have never, ever, ever heard a president call a healthcare crisis a hoax, like this one has.  Cut your $$$ interest.  Make it about money.

In my world of medical device design & development, we call this symptom -NIH; this acronym does NOT stand for National Institute of Health rather 
NOT INVENTED HERE. 
It represents the attitude and executive policy by organizations large & small to advance the In-House design over anything ideas devised elsewhere even if the ‘foreign’ , outside concept & methods are better, more efficient or less costly. 
This tack has purpose for intellectual property reasons within competitive corporations but for public health organizations when thousands of lives are at stake such a policy is inhuman, contrary to public wellbeing and possibly criminal.

2020-03-03 16:05,"It is worrisome that the Trump government is considering private company profit over American health. If there was a German test that was adopted by WHO and was ready to go, the CDC should have used it. 

Instead, we have Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar who said, “We would want to ensure that we work to make it affordable, but we can’t control that price because we need the private sector to invest. The priority is to get vaccines and therapeutics. Price controls won’t get us there.""

In other words, it's not important to get a test that works as soon as possible; it's not important that it's affordable, but it is important to Alex Azar that the private sector invest and profit from the test."

2020-03-03 16:03,"Labs make mistakes. Bad ones. Did nature cause this outbreak?  China says yes.  Many say no, including epidemiologist Dr. Fang Chi-Tai of National Taiwan University.

The Wuhan wet market amplified the virus but was not the source.  (The Lancet reports several initial victims had no contact with the Wuhan market.)  But the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is nearby.  Lab Director Zhengli-Li Shi described her research in 2015 (Nature Medicine, Vol. 21, No. 12). *

Shi created a coronavirus with a novel spike protein that easily and quickly infected lung tissues.  Shi wrote “We built a chimeric virus encoding a novel zoonotic CoV spike protein” and called it  ‘SHC014-MA15’.  The lungs of two groups of mice, one old, one young were infected with it. The old mice died, the young mice lived. That’s happening to us now.  Rogue or negligent dual-use experimentation is another risk factor in labs.

Shi wrote in 2015 “the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens”.  The lab makes deadly chimeric respiratory viruses and did one escape in 2019?  Chinese labs are porous - SARS accidentally escaped a Beijing government lab three times in 2004. There is a certain risky culture or mindset in Chinese bio labs.  Xi Jinping and others last week ordered China’s research labs to be made safer “to protect The People”.  Nature or man?

A test kit is one of the first critical paths at the beginning of an epidemic, because you can't manage the problem until you measure it. At this point, we should give up on test kits and buy them from China, where they're manufacturing (I think) 1.6 million kits a week.

Trump Has Sabotaged America’s Coronavirus Response
As it improvises its way through a public health crisis, the United States has never been less prepared for a pandemic.

""In 2018, the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure."""
2020-03-03 16:09,"What an amazing hoax, this virus. So realistic."
2020-03-03 16:20,Maybe we are not testing people because if we don't test then we don't find and then we can brag that only a few people have the corona virus and we are so awesome that we stopped the virus in its tracks.
2020-03-03 16:20,"John Hopkins has put out this information: <a href=""https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"" target=""_blank"">https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6</a>

It seems to be straightforward data in the land of disinformation which is coming from the Executive Branch."
2020-03-03 16:02,The daily WHO situation reports already reported yesterday that the virus is spreading locally in the US. Both the Washington cases and the New York case without travel or known infection chain show it.
2020-03-03 16:21,"Absent free press we'd never hear this important journalism. Trump and his ilk would have gagged this report for certain. 
With more of this maybe we can save ourselves. 

These mistakes by CDC including all the casual lies by Trump are harmful  but the impact would be minimized  if Americans had spent 5 trillion dollars over the past 2 decades on high quality vaccine programs in which congress mandated and paid for research and development of Recombinant Vaccine technology using 21st century genetic engineering.   
Then once a virus was identified we could more quickly and effectively immunize ourselves beyond just testing. 

Instead we use antiquated chicken egg methods because vaccine makers won't invest in cutting edge technology which won't produce return on investment in the next quarter. And it would be expensive and perhaps not profitable for a decade all depending on the appearance of the next plague virus or bacteria. Hence, the need for government to step in. 

We can learn from these mistakes. Many might needlessly die from Covid 19 but it is not too late to divert adequate resources from endless wars to medical  R & D preparing for 21st century infectious foes ignoring all walls likely far worse than this Co V 2 virus. Not to mention we can be prepared for biological war. 
And quality vaccines are just the half of what needs doing to be prepared for microscopic enemies to come. 
Big government? Bring it on."
2020-03-03 15:05,Make America Test Again
2020-03-03 17:14,"This situation saddens me. This is not the CDC I relied on for information and respected so much during my career as a public health nurse. I would love to see some detailed reporting on what people, postitions and programs the CDC has lost or cut since January 20, 2017."
2020-03-03 19:06,"If very little is tested, even less is recognized as positive. If then contact to positively recognized is one of the prerequisites for a test then it slowly becomes very peculiar (almost criminal). An austerity programme that leads to a huge spread.
For weeks it is known to be able to distribute viruses even without own complaints.
More can't be done wrong."
2020-03-03 19:23,"The CDC case calls attention to a case now being argued in the Supreme Court, where corporate and administration opponents of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau seek to overturn past decisions  and put independent regulatory agencies under greater presidential/political control. I hope the defenders of agency independence will cite what has just happened in the CDC, whose director's appointment  had  raised questions about past conflicts of interest, and who was clearly not acting in the public interest when he prevented the creation of more corona testing kits--thus endangering thousands of Americans."
2020-03-03 17:19,"It drives me nuts every time I see phrases like ""mysterious case"" or ""unexplained origin."" Cases are neither mysterious nor unexplained; they are spread from one person to another, and it can happen just as easily in the U.S., Canada, Europe, etc. as in China, especially when the government refuses to test basically anybody for two straight months.

It's beyond obvious that people have caught the virus outside of China, Italy, Iran, etc. It's time to test anyone with a fever or cough who seeks medical attention. It's time to know the truth about how many Americans are actually sick. 

It's easy to crow about how well we've contained the virus, as Trump did at his news conference last weekend, when you don't test people. You can't report cases that haven't been tested. But common sense says this virus has already spread; it's everywhere."
2020-03-03 15:09,"Budget cuts to federal agencies and programs focused on disease prevention and security were ordered by the Trump administration to help defray the massive budget deficit created by the ""big beautiful tax cut.""   

""Overall in 2018, Trump called for $15 billion in reduced health spending that had previously been approved, as he looked at increasing budget deficits, cutting the global disease-fighting budgets of the CDC, National Security Council (NSC), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Health and Human Services (HHS) in the process.""

Same old story: the rich get richer by sucking the resources of life out of everyone else."
2020-03-03 16:46,"The same Republican ""leaders"" botching the reporting and testing for coronavirus are simultaneously petitioning the Supreme Court to kill the ACA. Heartless.  Vote Democratic in November like your country _and_ your healthcare depend on it. They both do."
2020-03-03 16:47,"These guys here developed the first test  and if I get it right they gave the testing protocol away as public domaine (for free) to spread it as quickly as possible : <a href=""https://www.dzif.de/en/researchers-develop-first-diagnostic-test-novel-coronavirus-china"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dzif.de/en/researchers-develop-first-diagnostic-test-novel-coronavirus-china</a>
By the way financed by our taxes and not by big business or investment companies."
2020-03-03 17:03,"So - Rod Rosenstein's sister, Dr. Nancy Messonniere of the CDC, warns everyone that the coronavirus could be really bad to get out in front of the fact that the CDC failed to get the testing kits out timely.  Now the whole mess may conveniently be placed on the President. Neat. <a href=""https://nypost.com/2020/02/25/cdc-urges-americans-to-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak-this-might-be-bad"" target=""_blank"">https://nypost.com/2020/02/25/cdc-urges-americans-to-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak-this-might-be-bad</a>/"
2020-03-03 17:53,"On February 4th, The NYT published an article about the Chinese government's response to the Coronavirus entitled ""Coronavirus Crisis Shows China’s Governance Failure"". Now that the US government is lying about having 1 million tests, why don't we see healines like ""US Officials lie about number of tests""? Why can't the NYT hold the US government to the same standard as they do other governments?"
2020-03-03 16:49,We need experienced people who have a tremendous amount of knowledge to lead in their field of expertise.  Who should have made the decision to go with the German test yet did not?This is a sneak peek into what will happen when terrorist activity increases in the U.S. because Trump keeps putting loyalty above capability.
2020-03-03 16:52,"Under the Trump Administration there has been a full scale hollowing out of many govt. agencies. Funding, deregulation, and most importantly a loss of personnel who carry the institutional knowledge of policy, procedure and processing systems. When a system loses its balancing mechanisms and “brain power” you get systems failure. Managing the Coronavirus requires a known communications network between multiple agencies, many of the people responsible for integrity of the communication have been retired, fired, defunded, deregulated, moved out of the system causing breakdown. DT and his need for gratification of control and power over everything in his kingdom is the barrier to success of his MAGA. He is destroying our democracy and the Coronavirus is an vivid example of his arrogant ignorance of both the use of and responsibility of Presidential Power within our system of Democracy."
2020-03-03 16:19,"The botched/lack of testing in the US is on purpose. Trump doesn't want everyone to know how widespread the pandemic is becoming, plain and simple, because it'll affect his reelection chances. Meanwhile, more people will die as a result of this purposeful neglect. But, Trump doesn't care; he only cares about himself, his bank balance, and staying out of jail for as long as possible."
2020-03-03 17:46,"If the US had embraced the test used by the W.H.O, it would have been clear evidence that Trump is not keeping America great. I guess, when America was Great, there was no CDC."
2020-03-03 17:48,"Hello- they dont WANT to test people. It would have shown this was out in the community 4-6 weeks ago, and now it would easily  show 100,000 positives. Its all spin and pump the stock market so political donors can dump their shares.....same with Powells dropping rates by 1/3 per cent today."
2020-03-03 18:13,"Trump and his supporters take all the credit for things that turn out well.   thus, i assume it is fair to conclude that Trump and his people are to blame for not being able to test for this disease whereas most other countries are able to do so.   

for all we know millions of people in the USA might be walking around with this disease and we don't even know it."
2020-03-03 19:44,"Our CDC was always our gem.  We had faith in it, 
we could trust it. Through several pandemics.
Now.. 
We made America Great Again, and fixed it."
2020-03-03 20:04,"MAGA!!
All the way back to the 50's!!"
2020-03-03 18:20,"As the gross incompetence of Trump's administration continues to be revealed in everything he does and all they stumble through, real crises amplify and exacerbate the effects of the corona of incompetence surrounding him and the self-serving rottenness at the core... Trump.
Of course, the Jonestown-like MAGA faithful will walk off the cliff singing his praises, but the rest of us need to understand how deeply exposed we are to the drift, grift and incompetence of Trump. You can't blow this off, now...
The COVID-19 scourge is upon us, Republicans. As the COVID - 19 research doctor says:
“If you can smell what someone had for lunch — garlic, curry, etc. — you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath,” he said.
This is serious stuff, but our Republican government is not."
2020-03-03 19:58,"The lack of tests and testing for COVID 19 goes way beyond simple incompetence, this is gross negligence!
This administration had the time to blame this pandemic on a Democratic Hoax, bigotry, conspiracy theories,make  further cuts to the CDC budget and erroneously claimed that a vaccine was almost ready. Despite knowing about COVID19 since January ,they still have not managed to provide a working test kit! 

Until thorough testing is completed throughout the US, there is no way of gauging the severity or progress of the coronavirus! There are drive thru testing facilities in other countries , with a three day wait time for the results! 

This goes beyond gross negligence.  It is criminal malfeasance perpetrated by an inept, nearsighted administration on a trusting electorate!"
2020-03-03 14:35,"A colleague works as medical director of a lab at a major medical institution in the northeast and they developed and validated their own test a month ago - which was easy to do once China released the viral DNA information - but the FDA blocked them from using it, even in-house. There is gonna be a LOT more Covid-19 out there when the testing finally does get going."
2020-03-03 14:45,"Once the dust settles, Congress must begin investigations into the CDC's actions.  Why was the initial batch of test kits flawed?  Why wasn't the test used by the W.H.O. utilized?  Why was the testing criteria kept so narrow for so long?  Was this done simply to cover for the CDC's limited testing capacity?  The country needs and deserves answers.  The CDC has always been held in very high esteem by most Americans.  If they failed us on this coronavirus, we must find out why and what changes have to be made at the agency.  We must also find out to what extent political considerations and budget cutting by the current administration played a role."
2020-03-03 22:59,"I think that this situation is relatively clear. First, Trump fires all of the key governmental officials who would deal with handling something like this. Thus, no one experienced is leading/planning/organizing the response (OK, VP Pence, but really?) Second, Trump doesn’t want a coronavirus problem in the US right now, so virtually no testing=few diagnoses=US coronavirus free! 

I’ve been hearing so many stories of people with symptoms being told that they would not be tested and to go home. The true state of the coronavirus in the US is, essentially, unknown. But until testing becomes widespread and self-quarantine starts, it will continue to work its way through the population. So, eventually we will find out how badly we have been misled."
2020-03-03 20:57,"Obviously, accepting working test kits from other countries would demonstrate that America is not really that GREAT again..."
2020-03-03 21:25,"Here are Trump's proposed CDC cuts for FY 2020:

Now we know."
2020-03-03 23:47,"The enforced unavailability of test kits dictated by the CDC was nothing less than suppression of evidence. Its from an old playbook, “…if we make sure there is no evidence, we’ll convince ‘em there isn’t a problem.” Too late. Yet, bad policy continues.

Can the CDC  come up with an ""what's the extent of the pandemic now"" data collection plan and then implement it? 
Thank you, state public health departments for filling a terrible void you should not have had to fill. 

I am so glad to see test kits now being used in an intelligent way, to develop leads about the extent of community spread.
I cannot believe, when it was needed most, much of what was learned in the past three centuries about approaching a public health crisis was ignored or suppressed by those directing the CDC. For what? For who?

Stalin promoted the agronomist Lysenko for his politically convenient theories against natural selection and for Lamarkism. Too bad they were dead wrong. Lysenkoism dominated Soviet agricultural ""research"" for three decades. Thousands of biologists who spoke up were executed, imprisoned or fired. His state-supported psuedoscience made Russia’s famines worse.  

Jacob Bronowski wrote ""No science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power. ... The time has come to consider how we might bring about a separation, as complete as possible, between Science and Government in all countries."""
2020-03-03 21:23,"Here are a couple of great pages of information from Trump's own Health and Human Services Department outlining the cuts he's made to the CDC:

And from HHS's summary of CDC's 2019 budget:
""CDC’s FY 2019 request of $155,000,000 for CDC-wide Activities and Program Support is $102,262,763 below the FY 2018 Annualized CR level. The FY 2019 request carries forward the proposed reductions from the FY 2018 President’s Budget Request as well as continues the elimination of the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant, as proposed in the FY 2018 President’s Budget Request.""

Stop watching FOX ""News"" and find some real data sources."
2020-03-03 20:48,"If patients can't be tested, then cases can't be reported.  Proof positive that the Trump administration has licked the virus!"
2020-03-04 2:13,"Is there a corporation or individual waiting to profit monetarily by the ""design"" and manufacturing of the tests perhaps?  Simply a horrid thought.  But considering how money driven everything seems to have become. . ."

2020-03-04 3:01,"China has developed a quick and highly accurate testing kid and are manufacturing it right now. Just need to ask for them from China. It can complete 96 tests in 2 hours.  Here is the news report about it (google translate): 

""The approved kit is highly accurate. It uses triple target gene detection (ORF1ab / E / N) and a single internal standard test to ensure the accuracy of the test and to avoid missed detection of the new crown virus. This test kit 96 tests can be completed in 2 hours, greatly reducing the screening time. """
2020-03-04 3:11,Maccura Biotechnology Co in China has developed highly efficient and quick testing kit. And they are manufacturing them right now in big quantities. This kit can complete 96 tests in 2 hours. The Chinese government has been using it and they also donated a big batch to South Korea.  Please talk to China.
2020-03-04 3:16,Only a handful of Americans have been tested for Coronavirus. Until large scale testing it's all just a story line.
2020-03-04 4:35,Have there been changes in the leadership of the CDC since Trump took office?
2020-03-04 5:43,November can’t come soon enough.
2020-03-04 14:16,"The scale of what may be about to happen is difficult for us to comprehend. Suppose that 30% of Americans are infected and that morbidity is 3%, the number being floated today. The US population is 300M. If 100M people are infected, there will be 3,000,000 deaths. 

That is slightly more than the number of deaths in a year in the US, from all causes.

I can't imagine any way that 100 million people can receive medical care.

We know there were ways to control the spread of the disease. Our government, led by the dude who claims to wield unlimited executive authority over every agency, blew it. This is a vastly consequential failure."
2020-03-03 14:41,"Interesting how China managed to develop a test kit for an unknown virus within two weeks of sequencing its genes, and produced sufficient number of kits to test millions of people, while battling a raging epidemic.  The CDC had the genetic sequence at the same time, and had more than a month to produce a kit, or to adopt a readily available one in order to prepare for a local epidemic.  Yet, as people started dying, they could only test 400 samples a day in a country of more than 300 million people.  This is a country that spends more money on its military than all the other countries in the world combined.  A country that sent a man to the moon 50 years ago, and has produced more Nobel prize laureates in medicine than any other country.  Has the nation's public healthcare system been systematically hollowed out by the current administration ?  Or a more sinister theory of a coordinated effort by the current administration to suppress information about the true situation of the epidemic, whilst loudly criticising the Chinese government of doing the same ?"
2020-03-04 17:37,"The question is whether the failures in testing were a product of incompetence or complicity between the sycophantic political appointee director of CDC and the White House in order to maintain Trump's deceptive narrative that Corvid 19 was not a problem for the US and Trump was on top of it. The more you test, the more the truth comes out and the White House does not want that.
See the article by world health authority, Laurie Garrett in Foreign Affairs, March 12, 2018. Distinguish between brilliant civil servants like Tony Fauci and appointees who are sops to political constituencies."
2020-03-03 10:46,"If Trump were not the president, but instead was just another person, I wonder what the stable genius would be saying about the president’s management of the crisis ?"
2020-03-03 11:04,"We shall see if the CDC processes a million tests and discloses the numbers of positive results (doubtful). The sheer ineptitude, in the face of a growing pandemic, can only be attributed to a directive to keep the numbers low. Thankfully we have many states performing their own tests (“presumptive positives”) so we may be able to get an idea of where this virus has spread. Of course it is nationwide, of course there is vast community spread, of course we are at the mitigation stage, not containment. But you be you, Mike Pence, and keep lying to the American public."
2020-03-03 10:34,"Forget the masks.  Forget the mass quarantines.

The best thing anyone can do to ward off COVID19 is to make themselves healthy - e.g., eat well, exercise often, and avoid smoking, drugs, and alcohol.  

Of course, a little travel insurance would help."
2020-03-03 9:56,So the circle is closed.
2020-03-03 10:22,"This is what a propaganda state looks like. The virus originated in China and spread to these other countries.  

Now, the propaganda will be “we’re protecting you from the virus *which is coming from outside of China.*”

Wait a year and the Chinese textbooks will be claiming it all started in Iran and made worse by Western powers. 

Rinse, repeat."
2020-03-03 11:17,"Prior to trump instituting autocratic oligarchic subterfuge about Covid 19 
Dr.Fauci’s team was ready to act appropriately. Transparency was always practiced at CDC and Congress always supported their needs proactively to warn and instruct and care for the public good and support medical personnel in the trenches in counties and communities. 
Under pence and Trump we have fake news hoax talk instead of enough test kits. 
As a health professional this scenario will devastate America and trump is using it to attack political opponents rather than have decency of intent and doing the correct thing. 
That would be turning over management to Dr Fauci and leaving him to do the work that will save patients and bring about medicine to help. 
China started this mess without sharing data at first. At least that was what we are told by trump. But come on !
He contacts the other autocrats , especially Putin on unsecure  phones all the time. He admits his contacts . 
I have never experienced a situation this dire since Reagan ignored AIDS till babies and children were dying from blood products in the 1980’s.
At that time I worked in a hemodialysis unit and transplantation. My patients had “ failure to thrive” when they should have been rallying. We had no name for what was attacking their immune system. Our epidemiologists told us it was an entirely new virus emanating originally from wild animals on the African continent. All we had for protection was PPE and bleach water to clean ."
2020-03-03 11:23,"We have a far, far better chance of dying in our cars tonight...or tomorrow. Nobody lives forever. Relax."
2020-03-03 11:35,"So, Trump is willing to delay protective measures for US troops until he can spin or bury information he deems unfavorable to himself."
2020-03-03 11:36,"The ratio of fatalities/confirmed cases is about 6% for US compared to 5.5% for Iran. Are American physicians inapt barefoot doctors or conceals the US Government the true extent of the disease? Given the number of fatalities we must expect 500 to 1000 Corona cases , assuming up-to date medical care. In retrospective China’s communication as well as medical response look more professional than US crisis management."
2020-03-03 11:38,"“We’re going to reduce the severity of what’s happening. The duration of the virus, we discussed all of these things, we will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible. And I have to say with a thriving economy, the way it is, and the most advanced health system on Earth, America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing. We have the greatest people on Earth, the greatest health system on Earth.”

There are people who are actually comforted by this garbled nonsense?  I assume it goes on like this:

“The greatest Earth.  It’s really great, isn’t it?  The moon too.  And we have the greatest wall, the tallest.  The Democrats will try to convince you it isn’t done.  It’s done, finished.  Big beautiful wall.  They say it can keep out anything, even this virus.  The virus, you’ve heard about this?  Terrible.  Strong though.  You gotta respect it. They say I shouldn’t say it so I’m not gonna say it.  But I really do respect it.  Strong, powerful disease.  Good friend of mine, we have a great relationship.  The economy is great too.”"
2020-03-03 11:40,You are creating widespread panic with the sensational headlines. Not everyone has a statistics background like me and can keep their calm in times of crisis like this.

2020-03-03 11:39,"I thank NYT for the global coverage of this pandemic.

I was amused to read that China is now asking overseas travelers  to force themselves in a quarantine.

There is a word for it - chutzpah.

I am following Congress response on an emergency funding for this Wuhan virus.

The virus of adding unrelated items in an emergency funding appears to be still alive and well.

POTUS asked for $2.5 billion - yes, that's with B.

Congress is about to pass an authorization - giving him $8 billion - yes, another B.

He should have asked for some Wall money.

May be, Congress would have stuck to his original request."
2020-03-03 12:02,"Why exactly is this virus targetting over 65's who can be previously well, and also often fit, may even have run marathons. In truth, however we try to outwardly or inwardly  stay young, the immune system starts to age. There is a reduced production of lymphocytes, and the lymphocytes produced do not function as well."
2020-03-03 12:11,"The fact that the US has an incompetent President and a fawning administration has already made the corona virus much worse.  The delayed response to recognizing its severity and the limited availability of test kits has cost lives and increased the number of infected persons. Also, blaming Democrats and speaking in hyperbole about the US’s preparedness demonstrates an inability to confront conditions as they are.  It is very troublesome that most state governments are better prepared than the federal government at a time of national crisis."
2020-03-03 12:13,"China appears to be getting through this because they have an authoritarian government. In China you do what the government tells you to do.

Here in the US, under our democratic system, efforts to control the outbreak are scattered and largely voluntary. Voluntary efforts of any kind are usually weak. 

To make matters worse the flow of information to the public is terrible. For many, if not most, the only source of information about this, and any other crisis for that matter, is cable news and word of mouth: neither of which is reliable or has the depth that people need right now.

And then, to make matters really worse, there's no strong leadership from the White House. Compare this crisis with the attacks of 9/11. Despite his falts George W. Bush did show leadership and helped the country heal in the days after the attacks.

The current 6 percent death rate in the US is not encouraging."

2020-03-03 11:56,"Who are these millions of people who are going to be tested?  Are that many people showing up to their doctor’s office and hospitals?  Or is Trump going to test everyone coming into the country from areas with significant outbreaks?  What does the CDC recommend?  I can imagine this being a stunt on the part of the Trump administration:  see how aggressively we’re going after this?  But is it really effective?  If Trump wants to control the spread of the virus, he should hold a press conference and stress the importance of hand washing, not touching your face, and staying home and keeping your kids home when sick.

In that respect it is akin to the coronavirus known as the common cold aka rhinovirus.

Anyone who is voting today should think hard about whether or not these are the values we want in our leaders.

You're quarantined and miss work? We got you. You have symptoms and get a test? We got you. Have no health insurance? We got you. Funeral costs? We got you. We will figure it out whatever the costs are later, just as we did in WWII--when we were much, much poorer. We came up with trillions in the past two decades for wars and the global economy. We can take care of our own, and we will, because that's the decent thing, the American thing, to do. In addition, since we're telling you to prepare, and most of you live paycheck to paycheck, we'll direct deposit into your account, or otherwise handle, whatever costs you need to get some extra dry goods and whatnot. The details we'll iron out. And after this is all over, we'll get back to tearing each other to shreds about all kinds of issues. This is not about 'being nice,' even, though it is: if people can't afford to stay home from work with symptoms, that hurts others. And so on. Biology demands this. Morality demands this. Oh, and, we're jointly, both parties, coming up with a way to have an election this year, too. More later in our next joint fireside chat."""

1.Limit information, or change CDC reports to exclude certain information, or minimize the gravity, in order to keep Wall Street from panicking. (based upon the assumption that WS analysts rely upon information controlled by US government. They don't.)  
 2. Bully the Fed to force interest rate reduction. This will attempt stabilize a shaky stock market, not by increasing demand and health of economy, but by limiting investment choices.  
  
A pandemic recession results in a demand reduction, particularly in travel and leisure. In particularly hard hit areas with large populations of impoverished people who are at high risk, worker shortages could occur, leading to possible plant shutdowns. Global companies who cannot redirect like Apple will be at risk. An interest rate reduction will do nothing to promote this demand. The demand is unrelated to capital injection. The interest rate reduction only attempts to force investors to stay in the market  by reducing income from safe alternatives.  

We have a President terrified of losing an election. If he loses,    he no longer has DOJ protection, legislative protection. He will have to face a criminal trial. He could care less about the health of this country. He does not want to go to jail."

How infectious is it? How many people get seriously ill? These are the other important questions. Right now, this looks scary because it seems to be quite infectious and a significant number of people(20%) become severely ill. The key is to stagger infections. Then those who die, don't all die at once. Those who can be saved are able to benefit from optimal medical care. Not everyone is out of work at once. We don't devolve into anarchy. We get time to develop vaccines/treatments. Right now, we can't do a lot about severity or death rate(given access to optimal care) but we can take steps to manage how many people get it at once.

What hasn’t been talked about much is the US government’s role in failing to take adequate measures to protect the communities where the evacuees from the ill-fated cruises were “quarantined” once they reached US military bases.
We are pretty sure that the stringent rules of test administration and their unavailability have artificially suppressed reporting the number of people in the US who are known to have the COVID-19, and we are about to learn how poorly organized and uncoordinated the US response has been.
In President Trump’s stunning press conference only last Saturday, he claimed we have control of the situation, that only 15 people were infected, that the COVID-19 virus effects are not much worse than the common flu, and Democrats are perpetrating a hoax about its seriousness in order to damage his presidency.
Many of us will pay the price of our lives for the inept and ham-handed approach the Trump administration has taken to deal with yet another very real threat, partially because he won’t admit the problem because he perceives it as a threat to his position.
In this sense the COVID-19 problem is similar to the “Russian hoax” as Trump refers to the real and documented threats Russian interference continues to pose to our free and fair elections and from which the Republicans refuse to protect us."

Most of us need to be out in the world at work, in schools, at healthcare facilities.

We can all be prudent but not panicked, practice excellent hygiene (washing your hands, then grabbing a dirty cellphone to plaster against your mouth is pretty pointless) and, if possible, avoid crowds.

In about a month we will have a far clearer idea of what is going on here. I have an important dental appointment next week.

First keep your house warm and humid and remain inside unless conditions allow outside since the virus doesn't travel well under such conditions.  Keep your blood alcohol level above normal to present as hostile an environment so that the virus is deprived the ability to enter mitosis as alcohol dissolves the virus cell's outer surface on contact.
This approach allows the body's own defenses to counteract any exposure by destroying the virus' RNA before the thing spreads throughout the body resulting in sepsis and death.
Please note: I have on hand enough antibiotics to hunker in place for at least three months should pneumonia present itself with any symptoms of bacterial infection.
I have stockpiled food, dry goods, and water enough to last as that long as well.
I am also taking a daily poation made up of highly acidic and spicy liquids, including vegetable juices, steak sauce, and hot sauce, topped with lemon juice and black pepper on a layer of ice cubes in a salt rimmed and chilled glass.

I don't love Trump, and it's good to call out government inaction or ask questions about what more needs to be done, but we shouldn't use every conversation right now about it as a voter rallying cry or turn the focus of a potential  pandemic into a political conversation.

Spring break is coming up, things are happening so fast, and I do not know what I need to consider in order to decide whether it is still save to visit my (elderly) family in NYC. If only there was some sort of flow  chart that could dictate what types of travel and contact are safe.

It does not follow that 20% are ""serious"" and saying so is misleading.  But it certainly sounds more dramatic."

Gather your family around the sink to play a game.

Everybody together spreads shaving cream all over their hands from the wrists to making sure there is gel under your fingernails.

One by one, time each other washing every last bit of the gel off, everything needs to be squeaky clean, no slippery to qualify.

That's how to properly wash your hands.

No one regulates hospital prices except for Medicare, which is set at actual cost (and oh do they wail and moan and gnash their teeth about Medicare rates); (and no one regulates drugs at all). 

On average, hospitals charge their privately-insured 400% actual cost. Some charge more than ten times cost. The sky’s the limit. Scans that actually cost $300? That Medicare pays $300? Hospitals charge $3,000. But why not $6,000? What about for saline drips? Masks? No patient afraid of Coronavirus and naked on a gurney can say no. While the very dear doctors and nurses on the front line risk their lives to save us, CFOs in the boardroom are ""adjusting"" their chargemasters in light of increased demand, (and then suing patients afterward who survive and can't afford their bills.)

It gives rise to a lack of awareness and cultural complacency which means that when seriously bad things happen, they always seems to take the USA completely by surprise and this is no different, as evidenced by the complete lack of preparation for widespread testing. By the time they get their testing act together, you probably should have moved to the 'delay' phase (see UK government high level planning below):
The overall phases of our plan to respond to COVID-19 are:
• Contain: detect early cases, follow up close contacts, and prevent the disease taking hold in this country for as long as is reasonably possible
• Delay: slow the spread in this country, if it does take hold, lowering the peak impact and pushing it away from the winter season
• Research: better understand the virus and the actions that will lessen its effect on the UK population; innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; development of the most effective models of care

2020-03-03 15:12,"Accurate testing will remain key. Waiting for the vaccine against Corona virus COVID-19 is like waiting for the messiah or a ""real stable genius scientific discovery"" or until cows come home. Pandemic HIV infections have been managed without a vaccine for almost 35 years and even after billions have been spent, all vaccine rials have failed including a recent one in S.Africa. Attempts to get a vaccine against HINI pandemic in 2009 frustrated the Obama admin. by the delay in getting one which was only ready after the pandemic tapered off. Back then, H1N1 pandemic was making rounds and got me too and over a million and a half others; out of those infected 284,000 fellow inhabitants of the world died ie 17.4% fatality. Compare that to the fatality rate of 2% due to Corona virus predominantly killing the seniors in US, above 70, smokers and those with serious genetic or acquired immunodeficiencies and those on immunosuppresive therapy. 

A vaccine against COVID-19 could benefit those with immunodeficiencies or those working closely with patients with immunodeficiencies. But with the uncertainty about, if and when a vaccine that can protect against COVID becomes available, I would count a possible vaccine out of the equation for changing the current course of spread. 

Considering that the fatality due to COVID being very low and that too mainly among those with a weaker than normal immune system, providing the immune system advantages to clear the virus would be a way forward."

2020-03-03 15:30,I question the way in which this epidemic is reported. A statement like ‘x number of people have been infected’ is misleading because the times isn’t reporting recovery rates. For example here in Arizona the one case reported was quarantined and the patient fully recovered yet according to these data visualisations and articles you’d still think they were infected. I’m happy with my subscription but I suspect the way it’s being reported has something to do with getting consistent readers glued to a story and frankly it’s very transparent NYT.

So any infected travelers who had tickets to the game or the surrounding events would have been freely allowed in. I thought the moment it was announced that the timing was suspiciously late and was timed for economic purposes so as not to disrupt the game and associated events. (Since we knew all about the situation weeks before, why wait to institute the ban till the actual day of the game, when everyone would already already be here?)

Why should we have confidence in results of the ""new"" test? If the C.D.C. originally thought that all three elements were necessary for an accurate test result, how does simply eliminating one problematic element solve the problem and produce accurate results? Why should this not be viewed as more of a political solution  --  let's get lots of ""tests"" out there to look good  --  rather than a genuine public health/medical solution?

The most important thing at the moment is the credibility of the C.D.C. With rampant rumors, understandable fear, profit-seeking hustlers, and political opportunists everywhere, there must be one voice that Americans can count on to present the best understanding of the nature of the disease and its spread.

China thus completely missed the community infection for 2 weeks and then the situation was out of control.  After they removed the restriction on testing, the cases explored, China then run into the problem that there was not enough test for the patients  which require trained personnel,  Level 3 lab and good sample and it takes time. The backlog led to even higher infection rate as patients looked for hospitals which can do the test so they have treatments.  Eventually, Wuhan made the decision to admit anyone with similar symptoms without the testing first.  It is only then the situation was under control.

On the plane ride back, I started feeling sick, feverish and sore.  So back in NY, I’m not able to work from home, don’t have any sick leave and can’t afford to miss work let alone what would likely be thousands of dollars in deductibles and co-pays.

Even still, I called around to see if I even could get tested as I slog around to pharmacies for pain meds and cough drops.  Even calling most drs, I’m told they can see me in 6-8 weeks. I could go to the ER, wait 12 hours and expect to pay $3000, and they likely couldn’t even test me...

Meanwhile, I ride the subway and walk the streets, hiding my cough because I can’t miss work and don’t really know what to do.  

Do I have coronavirus? Difficult to say; if I do, my symptoms aren’t super severe, so I’ll likely be fine but have likely already infected others while seeking help.  But, it’s clear to me from my experience that our healthcare system and model of work and sick leave in the US is a glaring weakness."

It's easy to say case numbers are low when people are not being tested. I would not doubt this is a government strategy to make things seem under control more than they actually are, especially after what Trump has been saying. Either that, or the incompetence of health authorities all the way up to the White House almost defies belief. I'm not sure which would be worse.

The top one being that this ordinary flu season, from October 2019 to February 2020, the estimated number of DEATHS from the ordinary flu is between 18,000 and 42,000.

2020-03-03 19:12,"This article makes a dangerous logical and statistical error when it states that ""That brought the death toll to seven in Washington State, the only place in the United States that has seen fatalities so far.""  

A correct statement would be ""That brough the death toll to seven in Washington State, the only state that has thus far definitively linked fatalities to the CoVid-19 virus.""

The difference is important for public health.  Due to the Trump Administration's botched coronavirus response, fewer than 500 people in the entire country have been tested.  Given the shortage of tests, CDC guidance limited testing ONLY to persons who had been in China in the past 14 days and those already in the hospital with the full list of CoVid-19 symptoms.  Until Saturday -- just a few days ago -- not even people with unexplained pneumonia could be tested.  For that reason, we actually have no idea how many Americans may have already died from the virus, just as we have no idea how many people have it but are either not sick at all or only mildly ill and thus continue to go to work, school, etc., where they spread the virus to others who may not be so lucky.

Now that the FDA has finally (after weeks of fear-induced dithering by HHS Acting Sec. Azer) allowed more facilities to test, expect the number of confirmed cases to skyrocket in coming weeks.  The CoVid-19 virus is already in wide circulation and the lack of testing is the only reason for so few confirmed cases."

There are docs and here who have not been instructed to wear even minimal protection in clinics.  Maybe that is now changing, but i heard that there simply aren’t enough masks.  A doctor I know is now under quarantine and he says he knows other docs who have been exposed and a few who are sick now.  Not sure all of this is being reported.  It seems there is a kind of medical knowledge underground among medical professionals. Many on this thread are saying this novel virus is no worse than the regular flu which kills thousands of people every year. Can someone make a counter argument?

 “On Saturday we issued new policy, allowing us to have some regulatory flexibility around those tests. So academic centers, private companies can develop these tests, tell us that they have validated those tests and then begin to use them.”

Meaning, Trump is actually farming out these tests to companies in which he or one of his pals most likely have an interest in. 

In other words, these tests will be privately manufactured. The US government (US taxpaers) will pay for those privately manufactured tests (with zero oversight) and then these privately owned and operated manufacturers will tell the American public that the tests they are manufacturing with no oversight or regulations.....are ""validated"".

Yet people are going about their daily lives as usual, on the assumption that ""they"" will tell us when it's time to start avoiding public spaces. There also seems to be a widespread assumption that this is basically the flu, no big deal. The reality is that even with the stringent measures China is taking to test, isolate and treat, the death rate outside the epicenter is still ten times that of the flu. Without those measures, the death rate will be much higher.

In my area it seems the only plentiful multifamily housing going up last couple years has been senior housing.

2020-03-03 19:53,"The most important thing at the moment is the credibility of the C.D.C. With rampant rumors, understandable fear, profit-seeking hustlers, and political opportunists everywhere, there must be one voice that Americans can count on to present the best understanding of the nature of the disease and its spread. This is a moment when the individuals who work for the C.D.C. must stand up as responsible Americans and not let external political pressure influence their best judgement.

hus it is quite problematic that the article, ""U.S. Plans ‘Radical Expansion’ of Coronavirus Testing"" stated, ""The kits had three components but some of the components were producing an inconclusive result for many public health labs using the test. On Thursday, the agency announced that labs with two of three working components could go ahead and use the C.D.C. tests....""

Why should we have confidence in results of the ""new"" test? If the C.D.C. originally thought that all three elements were necessary for an accurate test result, how does simply eliminating one problematic element solve the problem and produce accurate results? Why should this not be viewed as more of a political solution  --  let's get lots of ""tests"" out there to look good  --  rather than a genuine public health/medical solution?"

2020-03-03 20:48,"Case fatality ratio in the US is over 8% at this early stage of the epidemic. That’s a high ratio and indicates that a lot of cases have gone undetected.

Attempts to contain the infection seems to be worth trying. According to Dr.Bruce Aylward (WHO, UN), the data from China shows, that there maybe are not that many latent (asymptomatic) cases. Instead, we have a virus that is highly contagious and indeed much more (factor of 7-20x) lethal than seasonal flu."
2020-03-03 20:53,"Lost in all of this is that the tax cut passed in 2017 assumed that the US economy would continue to grow at 3%.  Before the virus, it was 2%, and it isn't on track to be anywhere near 3%.  Of course, many said this would happen, but that is all forgotten now.

When the Democrats get into power again, you can bet that screaming about the deficit will be the first order of business for the Republicans.  I hope people remember the growth rate and the implicit assumption it would just keep on continuing, the way housing prices a decade ago were modeled to just keep on rising."

For instance,  Germany has more confirmed cases but no deaths. This suggests that Germany responded well to the early data from China on the epidemic and prepared and effectively utilized a reliable diagnostic test in the earliest days of infection spread to Germany.  The US apparently did not.  A major question is why the CDC diagnostic kits failed and how was the manufacturer of those kits chosen.  The CDC Director Redfield has a prior history of controversy around working on an AIDS vaccine which would had potential for a huge market.  As other countries had developed effective tests, was there any financial ties within CDC decision makers that made sticking with the failed American test kits the initial response in the critical first weeks of Covid-19 transmission to the US."

Now like all great dangers, it would be natural for people to be aware of such a problem.  It would be natural to want to evaluate the problem and figure out how to best deal with the threat... to survive it.  People will naturally look at history to learn how to deal with what is happening now and in this case, people have a period of history to learn from... the Spanish Flu.  It is considered to be very similar to the Coronavirus 2019 and has so far a mortality rate the same as the Spanish Flu... approx 2%.  But, we don't know, for sure what this virus will in fact do.

This flu, which looks as though it is going to join Flu outbreaks from 1960 and 1950 as a pandemic that kills millions has its own unique characteristic, in that the younger you are the more immune you are.

In science fiction, a brilliant scientist would use that clue to figure out away to combat it. But it seems on a planet with 7 billion people not one scientist can come up with anything. This is a failure of the human. This is not 1918, we have made incredible technological advancements we now have super computers and a way to rush groundbreaking medicine around the world, but it seems the only thing we can rush around the world is Corona virus, we are very good at that.

We have nobody to blame but ourselves, it’s just a flu, we had all this time to have a plan in place in case a super flu emerged, too much partying, too much stupidity , we might have bred-out the kind of minds that could solve and fight this virus.

Cough into than new handkerchief you've started carrying for just that purpose, if you have to cough (maybe you have no symptoms, but might have the virus anyway. Lucky you.)

Wash your hands again. A third of Americans don't wash at all when leaving the bathroom, and a big percentage of those that do don't use soap! Wash your hands like you're trying to win WW2.

The novel coronavirus is a bad new one, but the common cold is also a coronavirus. Use all the methods you might use to deal with it. Everything from Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to Zinc lozenges.

If you do go visit grandma, wear a mask and tape it to your face with bandage tape for 100% blockage. Wash your hands in Vodka (because the hand sanitizer is all out, goodness knows why.) Heck, gargle with the vodka. Couldn't hurt. Use a zinc lozenge if you think you have a tickle in your throat.

For now, we need to ruthlessly employ every method of disease vector control that has been devised since germ theory was discovered. We can get the transmission rate below 1 if EVERYONE does these simple, manual things. A transmission rate below 1 means the virus starves. For now, we have to stop  this virus the hard way.

People do indeed begin to get more emotionally heightened when we, the nation, are not getting properly prepared for the historically deadly virus.

How many people will go to work knowing they have been around someone who has tested positive if they have no sick time. Some people without health care or paid sick leave will have hard choices, feed your children or go to work.  There are so many serious problems that could arise that we are not prepared for,  and again the poor will suffer the worst. Can't we set up free testing sites? Also, today I read that India will stop exporting some medications that we may need and the Chinese supply has already been impacted. Time for us to bring drug manufacturing back to the US.

I think we will have the biggest problem out of all western countries with the virus as un/underinsured people wont go to the doctor. A clear indicator will be If the death rate stays way above other western countries. Germany for example has about 200 confirmed cases and 0 deaths, we have about 100 and 6  deaths. Due to universal healthcare Europeans will contact a doctor when they notice the first symptoms. They don't need to worry about any copays or deductibles. 

Besides the loss of life, the economic damage will be huge. 

20% of infected need to get hospitalized
7%   of infected end up in intensive care
1 - 2 % average fatality rate

We also need to work on communication. The people should be told and instructed on TV by the government about what to do and who to contact if they experience any signs of a possible infection.

I would have factories working 24 hours a day , to produce face masks, hand sanitizers , protective equipment , test kits, and anything else that is needed to stop a super flu from spreading, this would help beat the flu, it would also boost the economy and boost morale 

I would put a billion dollar bounty for the company that can push a Corona vaccine in the fastest time . A race to the cure , we sent a man to the moon, we have gene editing and super computers , you can’t tell me we can’t create a vaccine in less than a year. Once again this would boost morale .

I would cut out the politics and embrace bipartisanship, bringing the country together for the good of the country, like after 9/11

I can also say that I would have banned the flights from affected countries weeks ago, but that is besides the point.

2020-03-04 2:39,"Dr. Fauci and others appeared at the Aspen Institute on February 11 to discuss the Covid-19 outbreak. All candidly opined that travel bans are essentially useless once you have ‘community exposure.’ Such bans are also useless unless they apply to everyone coming from pockets of infection outside the country — whether American citizens or not. The virus doesn’t know citizenship; and an American exposed abroad poses the same risk as a foreign national.

A travel ban, in Dr. Fauci’s words at Aspen nearly a month ago, buys some time to prepare for an epidemic before the number of domestic cases moves us to the ‘mitigation’ phase of a response. It is not the final answer. 

The problem is the Trump administration gutted the CDC pandemic response team before covid-19 hit China. He then relied solely on a travel ban and treated the virus as a ‘hoax’ and ‘the common cold’ for weeks: that was what his right-wing, science denying pals were saying on Fox and the Rush Limbaugh radio hour. 

We now likely have thousands of undetected carriers of the virus. Only a handful of them will have symptoms that attract attention - most will think they have a cold and not seek out medical attention. Many will put off seeking diagnosis and care because they can’t afford it or can’t afford to miss work. 

That’s the problem. We do not know how lethal this virus may be, because the data is insufficient. But it is unquestionably many times more lethal than seasonal flu, and that isn’t good."
2020-03-04 1:50,"The protective gear employed in the picture “Medics transporting a stretcher...”  is total inadequate, heads uncovered, wrong masks, no eye protection, uncovered street pants and uncovered shoes.  The medical workers shouldn’t even be in the building so poorly protected, much less in direct contact with a patient."
2020-03-04 2:05,I just don’t understand why we weren’t increasing production of testing kits back in January
2020-03-04 2:19,"We have known this outbreak in USA would be inevitable since January. The virus was known to be very infectious with a high degree of stealth infections. The CDC and Trump government are acting as if this is a one week old problem. This is what happens when scientists, controls and planning are jettisoned for political reasons."
2020-03-04 2:34,There was a great interview on Amanpour and Co from Penn: the hype around the corona virus is overblown - why are people being quarantined? So far deaths are at 9 the flu tens of thousands. Tornados today 24. The virulence in this country is unknown because of lack of planning to produce testing kits (planned?). Hard to imagine that the country mobilized under Obama to defeat Ebola cannot manage another coronavirus. What is truly sad is that Iran under crushing sanctions by the US is truly suffering.
2020-03-04 2:11,"The most important thing at the moment is the credibility of the C.D.C. With rampant rumors, understandable fear, profit-seeking hustlers, and political opportunists everywhere, there must be one voice that Americans can count on to present the best understanding of the nature of the disease and its spread. This is a moment when the individuals who work for the C.D.C. must stand up as responsible Americans and not let external political pressure influence their best judgement.

hus it is quite problematic that the article, ""U.S. Plans ‘Radical Expansion’ of Coronavirus Testing"" stated, ""The kits had three components but some of the components were producing an inconclusive result for many public health labs using the test. On Thursday, the agency announced that labs with two of three working components could go ahead and use the C.D.C. tests....""

Why should we have confidence in results of the ""new"" test? If the C.D.C. originally thought that all three elements were necessary for an accurate test result, how does simply eliminating one problematic element solve the problem and produce accurate results? Why should this not be viewed as more of a political solution  --  let's get lots of ""tests"" out there to look good  --  rather than a genuine public health/medical solution?"
2020-03-04 2:41,"Sad 2 hear of infections and deaths, the big problem remains regarding fighting COVID-19 here in U.S. is testing and test kits, then  treatments, supportive care, quarantines, the politicians say it was inevitable that COVID-19 would come to U.S. but seems like not much preparation has/is being done. Don't believe we are really prepared as they (locally and nationally elected officials) say, just hope you don't get it. Stay well."
2020-03-04 2:19,One promise after another. Yet testing is still limited. Pence doesn't want to make Trump look bad. Look for testing to stay limited.
2020-03-04 2:56,"""“Today we will issue new guidance from the C.D.C. that will make it clear that any American can be tested, no restrictions, subject to doctor’s orders,” Mr. Pence told reporters at the White House.""  ….. so the uninsured and/or those with no prompt access to doctors' will NOT be tested -federal limits have NOT been lifted."
2020-03-04 2:57,"This pathetic, greedy, self-centered administration couldn't fight it's way out of a wet paper bag if that was what was called for.  Their response to this novel coronavirus is an unmitigated disgrace---just as is EVERYTHING that they do, or don't do.

I'm getting a passport.  I never thought I'd outlive my country.  And, with Trump/Pence in charge, I may not even do that!"
2020-03-04 2:47,"Why can’t the folks in Life Care in Kirkland be safely evacuated, quarantined, tested (and if deemed necessary, placed in a hospital with a bio-containment unit, like the one in Nebraska (or at least isolated?)."
2020-03-04 2:57,"We don't want socialized medicine like all those other developed countries! They have long lines to see the doctor and limited treatment!

Oh, the U.S. government has decided to finally stop rationing health care in what is close to a pandemic COVID-19 health crisis. What a great health care system we have! 

No Medicare for All here - just a bunch of fat cat health insurance, hospital, and drug company executives/shareholders and nearly everyone else in the private health care industry."
2020-03-04 3:04,"S Korea is testing over 10,000 cases per day 
They now implemented drive-thru testing to minimize exposure to both tested and public health personnel 
Also they are free after certain protocols and self quarantined patients are provide daily allowance by the government 

It true they have high numbers of infected because of Sinchunji church, but health officials there are moving quickly to adapt to changing situations and reporting with transparency"
2020-03-04 3:13,"So if you are the first to use the New York Subway you are good, right? Oh, wait, it's public transportation, so you're not the only human, and there are many other animals too. That's just plain absurd. Build restrooms and pay cleaning staff so people can wash their hands, that'd be much better."
2020-03-04 3:16,"Too little too late.  

Community spread is rampant - this is obvious from the fact that most individuals presenting with ""test positive"" cases lack a link to known exposure, be it a prior positive or travel.  Because there has been such limited testing we have NO IDEA about the actual burden of disease in any community.  

I would argue that any community with a positive case unrelated to travel or known exposure has 100s -1000s of other cases brewing. And given interstate travel, this is an unstoppable epidemic.  The only question is how fast it will spread.  But we are all likely to be exposed at some point."
2020-03-04 3:06,"Make no mistake, this is not part of a well-thought out plan to contain this virus spread. It's a desperate shot in the dark by this absolutely horrible administration to placate the market. That's all it is. 50-point cut had the exact opposite effect, so they are trying something else. I am happy we will finally get more people tested, but this comes so late, it's criminal."
2020-03-04 3:09,"The stats are clear... COVID 19 is be a huge threat to young and middle-aged healthy people.  But to those in later life, and those with a compromised immune systems, the chances of dying from this virus rapidly increase from around 5% to maybe 20% or even higher (for a person, say, in their 80's with a compromised immune system).   That is a 1 in 20 all the way up to a 1 in 5 chance of dying, absolutely horrendous odds.  So dismissing this virus as just a variant of flu going around is uninformed, callous and inhumane. 

Equally intellectually squalid is to say hey, 20,000 to 30,000 die of the flu each year, so this is nothing really.  But this virus is conservatively ten times more deadly.  So anyone saying this is also saying that they don't mind if potentially 200,000 or 300,000 more people die.  Although these people probably do not intend this cruelty, it seems very similar to the indifference towards human life that has helped drive genocides in the past."
2020-03-04 3:25,"If you ran a mission-critical health care project with life-or-death consequences, would you hire Mike Pence? I’m just asking for friends who are fans of The Apprentice. He’s good at nodding and answering questions with inane word salad I guess."
2020-03-04 3:33,"Does it matter if the United States has ""the greatest health system on Earth"" as Trump says, if 27.5 million people have no health insurance and even people with health insurance can't afford the copays and the deductibles?"
2020-03-04 3:35,"The stats are clear... COVID 19 seems unlikely to be a huge threat to young and middle-aged healthy people.

Equally intellectually squalid is to say ""Hey, 20,000 to 30,000 in the US die of the flu each year, so chill out, everybody"".  But this virus is conservatively ten times more deadly.  So anyone saying this is also saying that they don't mind if potentially 200,000 or 300,000 more Americans die who might otherwise be alive.

The leaders of this organization are putting their members and the communities in which they practice at unnecessary risk for corona virus."
2020-03-04 5:06,Why do bureaucrats have the authority to determine how many test kits are available and to whom? It would seem that letting the industry operate by supply and demand would be much more efficient...

2020-03-04 5:01,"The Trump Administration waited far too long to drop limits on testing, probably because they were also extremely late obtaining test kits, which at first were untested and defective.  They had several weeks to get goin but didn't, Why?  Fear of the political and economic repercussions on an election year or did they still believe it was a hoax?  Dereliction of duty comes to mind."

My anxiety is overwhelming and I should know better and I do, but I know our presidents response is egregious. Too many people will get sick and die. This is maddening."
2020-03-04 5:38,"It appears to me that the US government has deliberately slowed testing and under-reported the amount of cases in the country in order to keep the stock market from crashing due to the economic repercussions of the true scale of the outbreak. 
Trump thinks the stock market is the only part of the economy that matters, and his idea of the ""economy"" is the only thing he can claim to have improved since he took office. 
Slowing down or reversing a viral outbreak depends on testing as many people as necessary and isolating them as quickly as possible. The problems with the US health care system and the politicization of the CDC by Trump and his cronies are becoming more obvious daily and could end up causing a much larger pandemic. Meanwhile, the stock market will crash anyway when it becomes apparent that far more people are infected."
2020-03-04 4:26,"We should rename the organization:
