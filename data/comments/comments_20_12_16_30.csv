2020-12-30 11:28:57,""" A Mount Sinai Hospital study of New York’s first wave found that patients with shorter initial stays and those not sick enough for intensive care were more likely to return within two weeks.""

God help the medical community when it finds itself learning as it goes along, making policies about discharges without fully understanding their impacts on long-haulers like Mr. Long.  

I feel for him, and for doctors trying to see the future from the middle of a dark tunnel.  One of the most formidable aspects of this coronavirus is its invinceability and shape-shifting symptoms,  resulting in repeat hospitalizations, further taxing a system not equipped for them.

Such a vexing virus!   The fact so many medical experts still can't predict which unfortunate patients never totally get rid of COVID-19 is one more sad element in a deadly year."
2020-12-30 11:34:44,"I truly feel for those fighting this awful disease. The lasting complications are ghastly. More could have been done to prevent this virus from entering our country, alas, hindsight is 2020.  No joke, please. Politics aside, closing the borders would have just been a small percentage of victory, the virus didn’t need a passport to enter. We know a lot more than in March. The new vaccines are only a stopgap as the virus continues to mutate. We may have to face the fact that the virus is here to stay. I’m tested every other week at work, as I’m exposed to 2,000+/- people a week at work and do my best to protect myself and others, but it’s just a matter of time before I’m infected."
2020-12-30 11:41:36,"In the early years of HIV treatment, physicians had no idea which patients would develop long term complications from that viral disease. Today, that is still the case. What we do know is that some patients will develop long term complications requiring an array of supportive services: Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Home Health, Rehab Hospitalization, Mental Health treatment. In addition, these patients and their famy need Legal and Financial counseling to deal with the ramifications of a new serious chronic viral disease upending their lives. We who have spent our lives in HIV care for the last 30 years are well aware of how humbling and complicated it is to provide good quality care to those who are suffering the long term consequences of a serious viral disease."
2020-12-30 12:07:06,"Maybe Mr. Long should get checked for POTS, another post-Covid problem. Thanks for sharing your stories with us. As a physician, I learn a lot from reading these accounts in the NYT."
2020-12-30 12:09:12,"My heart breaks for these people, and what they're going through.

Making it so much worse is the fact that tens of thousands of these COVID-afflicted will likely be forced into bankruptcy - after they can't work anymore, lose their employer-sponsored medical insurance, and can't afford the cost of their treatment. 

If they live in Democrat-run (blue) states, they might be eligible for some help from Medicaid. But likely not in Republican-run (red) states, which by design have scanty Medicaid benefits and make it extraordinarily difficult for anyone to qualify for them.

But even if COVID sufferers have medical insurance, they will still face devastating medical bills. Because there's so much that the insurance doesn't cover. And the kind of care that COVID patients need is among the most expensive care there is in the United States. It's subject to the highest deductibles, out-of-network costs, patient co-pays, prescriptions, medical device fees, etc., etc., etc. And we haven't even gotten to the fact that many of these patients will need round-the-clock care after they leave the hospital.

What's going to happen to these COVID long-haulers (and their families) when they can no longer work; when they may nor may not be eligible for SSI/disability payments; when lose their house; when they lose their vehicles; when their medical debt forces them to file for bankruptcy... all the while they are still acutely ill and in dire need of long-term care and social support?"
2020-12-30 12:10:55,"This story needs to get more attention. Too many people still believe covid-19 is no worse than the flu, that 99.999% of people survive it with no problems afterwards, and so on. 

They'll look at the story of Chris Long and dismiss it by saying ""Well he had pre-existing conditions."" They're more afraid of the vaccines than they are of the virus, and figure if they're healthy, they have nothing to worry about.

Well, one of those pre-existing conditions is being more vulnerable to the virus because of an individual's particular set of genes. Some variants leave a person primed for serious, even fatal reactions to infection - and there's no way to tall ahead of time if someone has them without the genetic screening that's not yet available. 

And as has been pointed out, if Obamacare gets thrown out, pre-existing conditions will be back in style, and having had covid-19 will be the blanket excuse to deny coverage for anything."
2020-12-30 12:28:52,"These are terrifying portraits of the possible individual effects of a Covid infection. If these stories were in the media, front and center, instead of stats about death rates, I think it would get the deniers' attention. If there are any still in denial.  The death rates are too abstract to any who haven't lost someone, and too easily attributed to ""old age"" chronic health problems for those who imagine themselves out of harms way because they don't quite fit the description.

Looking at the numbers of those who have been affected, this IS going to be a burden on our medical system, but not just the medical system,  for a long time.  While more is being learned about how to respond to the  infection, the country is not set up to handle the aftermath, which may require an extended network of outpatient non- medical outpatient services as well."
2020-12-30 12:40:12,"We will be learning about long term health impacts for quite some time.  Thankfully they seem to be limited, but the randomness of it all is unnerving."
2020-12-30 12:41:18,"COVID-19 has wreaked devastation in so many horrendous ways, but out of it we may now make vaccines in less than a year and in reading this story I imagine that through COVID-19 we will learn a lot about the role viruses play in many medical conditions that we now term “idiopathic.” For example, Mr. Long’s pulmonary fibrosis condition and recurrent infections suggest that COVID has reprogrammed his immune cells, especially in his scarred lungs, towards almost a senescent pattern. If this is true,  reprogramming  or delivering youthful immune cells might reduce further infections and resolve some of his scarring. Hopefully Congress will invest big in research to advance medicine in monumental ways in response to these tragic long haul COVID-19 stories and ultimately help tens of thousands of currently considered “untreatable” patients."
2020-12-30 14:19:34,"I am one of these people. Not as extreme but being able to get out of bed and function takes care and planning.

I got covid early, in the last week of Feb. Got real sick, missed a month of work, ended up in the ER once because I almost passed out. It took a while before I was back up and functioning, though I would tire easily. 

Recently I started having tachycardia and breathlessness. My heard would just start racing into the 140s because I got up up to go to the bathroom, I would feel faint and be gasping for air. A test this week indicated permanent lung damage,  and the tachycardia i think may be due a syndrome called POTS.  They are a brutal combination. 

I have started logging my vitals and water intake, to help me figure out what works. Looking forward to my next appointment on the course to figure this thing out."
2020-12-30 14:26:29,"I work in Genomics and Immunology at one of the world's leading hospitals and research centers. We have known about these ""long haul"" illnesses and decreased abilities for many months. It is a mystery why the media have said little about it. A preponderance of people who have survived serious COVID-19 infections show a wide variety of ongoing problems, both physical and mental. These last for months, perhaps for life. They include permanent damage to the lungs, making pneumonia, COPD and lung cancer more likely. They affect people's brains, causing lessened cognition (sometimes called ""brain fog""). They also cause chronic fatigue making it hard or impossible to go back to work, enlargement of the heart, routinely kidney damage requiring dialysis and other damage. COVID-19 survivors are at greater risk of strokes, heart attacks, kidney failure as well as a variety of lung ailments. 

Mayo Clinic warns on its public websites that ""natural immunity,"" the immunity survivors get from antibodies is likely short-term, showing steadily decreasing antibodies within months of survival.

Mayo also says tha, while the vaccines rally your antibodies to fight the disease, COVID-19, it is still not determined whether a vaccinated person can be infected with the virus SARS-CoV-2 and infect others in the days before COVID-19 hits and antibodies are created. 

So, the vaccine is a lifesaver, but not necessarily an end to the virus itself and the pandemic. Only time and more research will tell"
2020-12-30 12:39:15,And still no real push to vaccinate. No strong response. It’s kill or be killed.
2020-12-30 13:09:48,"Why is there a blackout in the media about monoclonal antibody treatment?  When Trump, Chris Christie, and Giuliani all receive antibodies the first week and all walk out of the hospitals feeling like superman (Christie wants to run in 2020) why isn't there intense interest in how these old, unhealthy men surviving?

What are the success rates for antibodies? Who can receive them and how? Trust me, it is NOT a coincidence that once they diagnosed they went straight to the hospital and received these treatments. 

Who else are receiving them? This is the biggest scandal in the COVID era while thousands of Americans are dying each day."
2020-12-30 13:53:50,What is the effect of vaccine on them. Rumor says that the vaccine immunity is stand in only a couple of years.
2020-12-30 14:18:25,"Repeatedly hospitalized because of SARS-CoV2 infection and consequences, yet still can't wear a face mask properly. Really??

 If your mask is not covering your nose it's only keeping  your lips cozy.  If your mask isn't sealing reasonably well around your face it can't do the job of reducing risk to you or those around you. 

Editors set a good example and don't picture inadequate mask use without indicating to readers ""Please be aware that CDC advises against the improper facemask use, as depicted in photo. """
2020-12-30 11:16:53,"“Significant numbers of coronavirus patients experience long-term symptoms that send them back to the hospital, taxing an already overburdened health system.”

2020-12-30 12:45:09,"This gentleman is not a good example to prove the author's point.  

Deep in the article the author admits he had multiple, serious health problems long before covid.  Its interesting the author doesn't mention this in the headline or initial topic sentence.

Not surprising he got worse after a severe viral infection.  Its a bad virus but to be clear it did not CAUSE his serious conditions.

Would be more helpful to study what covid actually causes.  This article is pretty misleading because it doesn't tell us that

Mr. Long had some previous health issues, including blood clots in his lungs and legs several years ago and an irregular heartbeat requiring an implanted heart monitor in 2018"
2020-12-30 14:24:37,I’d also be curious to hear about long haulers who voted for Trump - how many of them still think this is a hoax?

2020-12-30 12:35:42,"Personally I think this is just going to get worse because people have slackened up on social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing, because of the vaccines. Everyone relying on the vaccines and that's why it will take years, if ever to get this virus under control, if ever, because of international travel and how fast this virus spreads; international travel is opening the flood gates for this virus to continuously spread. 
The only way to keep this virus out of your nation is to close the borders to all international travellers who can bring it into your nation. The only way to control the virus is to put all incoming travellers into compulsory quarantine for 14 days, like NZ has, and have the hotels guarded by the police and Army. Once you've quarantined all incoming carriers of the virus you can concentrate on getting the vaccine out to all USA citizens, and you won't be adding to the list, by letting in contagious international travellers. At some stage the USA is going to have to make quarantine in USA for 14 days compulsory as you can't trust humans to do the right thing, and lots of travellers will have false documentation and carry the virus. No quarantine then go back to where you came from and pay a big fine and go to prison until you leave."

You are in effect at the mercy of Nature's Russian roulette!"

If Trump administration employees wouldn't mind actually doing the jobs they're paid for,  for a change, I would like to get vaccinated as soon as possible."
2020-12-30 15:10:22,"There appears to be some level of sensationalism in this article.  The CDC report referred to does report a 9% return to the hospital for discharged Covid patients, but limits the cohort to patients over 65 with at least one  chronic condition.  Interestingly, this would not have included people like Chris Long; his situation may well be a rare or at least atypical one.  The report also noted that this same cohort without Covid is associated with a 7% readmission within 7 days.

The third report referred to, done at the beginning of the pandemic, had no control group at all.  And its not surprising because the cohort they used to show a 15% readmission rate also had a mortality rate of over 25% in the hospital and and additional ~5% died after discharge.  Not a typical cohort.

In the VA study, also done in March-June, the cohort had a similar mortality rate near 30%.  While readmission was higher for them after 10 days vs pneumonia or heart failure admissions (which had mortality rates of 3-4%) with ~13% vs ~9%, a 4% addition, the rates of readmission after 60 days were about the same.

In short, it appears that, at the beginning of the pandemic and among the sickest of patients, there was nominal increase in readmission above what would be expected.  There seems to be little here that indicates some impending inundation of readmitted Covid patients."
2020-12-30 15:14:57,"We are only at the beginning of understanding the medium and long-term medical, psychological, and socioeconomic impact of COVID, as detailed assessments are only starting.  
Many in this unfortunate initial cohort of COVID patients, not all even severely effected early, will carry these burdens indefinitely.  Many symptoms may gradually subside and our understanding our treatments will surely improve.  
We can only hope and pray that no additional later problems, like the development of autoimmune diseases, will appear.  More vaccinations and common sense will gradually subdue this plague, but remnants will be present for decades."
2020-12-30 15:35:19,"I wonder whether if, had Mr. Long been given the type of treatment the well-connected (such as Trump and Christie) received which seemed to have significantly helped with their recovery, he would have deal with the ongoing repercussions."
2020-12-30 15:31:00,"We are in the early days of understanding this virus. My husband got sick last March for about four weeks when all of this first started. He still has weak legs, chronic fatigue, and other issues. He had no lung involvement like this poor man in the article. My husband was told there was little to nothing doctors could do for him. Any physical exertion is exhausting. We are at the beginning of a health crisis for many who thought life would be better after getting over Covid, only to find things more difficult than they could have imagined."
2020-12-30 11:22:39,"Thanks to Ms. Belluck and The Times for this report. It's too bad that the people who most need to read it likely have their heads buried in right-wing disinformation conduits like Fox News, Newsmax, and OANN."
2020-12-30 14:11:00,Why is so much of the focus of this article on the cost to *hospitals*?
2020-12-30 11:45:16,"Among the growing numbers of my Black African, brown Indigenous, white European and yellow Asian blood family who have been infected by and survived COVID-19 are a handful of 30- 40 year old males with lingering heart, kidney and lung issues that have repeatedly landed them back in their hospitals.

COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is still an RNA evolutionary fit be fruitful and multiply mystery to our best science and scientists.

What, if any, immunity does surviving COVID-19 confer and for how long? 

Same question for having a COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization desperation use vaccines?

Members of my family from 4 years old to 78 years old have caught and survived COVID-19. 

One member of my family is currently COVID-19 hospitalized and suffering multiple organ phased failure. She has multiple underlying health issues. We are on edge."

The anesthesologist took the tube out of my mouth to quickly.  15 days later in the hospital after being fed through my nose while on a resperator I was discharged. I had lost the dexterity in my fingers and couldn't button a shirt. These early discharges of Covid-19 patients are disgraceful."
2020-12-30 15:29:19,"In a more perfect world, instead of triumphing at a seditious push to overturn the election, Trump, Pence, and the other Republicans should be forced to do 1,200 hours of community service in covid wards and home health care for long haulers."
2020-12-30 12:22:44,"This article is missing a few things: 1) readmission rates for patients who have required ICU stays; 2) by the numbers what are the symptoms people are re-presenting with; 3) are all of these readmissions being billed as COVID-19 related or are they for other problems?

As for the readmissions of those potentially too early, we know that For some, initially patients look better with covid and then get worse (hence some early on were being extubated too early). There are also many whom had a milder course - albeit requiring hospitalization - and then went home appropriately and did well. 

I very much feel for the people in this article but to make meaningful change to policy, the New York Times owes us meaningful data."
2020-12-30 13:56:49,"The willful ignorance of the president and his devotees is astonishing. 

When I exclaimed concern about the COVID status in California and their startling numbers my conservative uncle said (over the speaker phone because my mother, husband and myself are isolating this winter) responded by saying:

“Who cares? nothing good came out of that state anyway, we don’t need them”

Since it was Christmas Day I tried prevarication, but somehow shifted to being asked “how did someone like joe Biden come to be worth worth 12 million dollars today, without taking money from foreign governments?”

People are dying by the thousands and I’m supposed to try to debate with someone I realize I no longer respect and I have no patience for. 

The cost to our society will take decades to recover. I’m not sure how we give joe Biden what he needs to lead us out of this devastation when seemingly smart people are callus to the pain of others."

And also for the Hospital Administrators to stop kicking out patients who obviously should not be discharged.  The Administrators are actually the ones wo make these calls, not doctors or nurses.

So long as we have a heartless Republican Government, and a for-profit Health Care Industry there will be no change.

If there was a political will, all of this could have been avoided.

We need to do better electing the Leaders of this Nation.

We are not just fighting a deadly pandemic, we are fighting for the life of this Nation thanks to these heartless leaders, Mitch McConnell, Trump and his cohorts.

2020-12-30 14:43:32,"One of the mysterious sequelae (follow-up diseases) some COVID-19 survivors get is a brand new type of pneumonia they are calling ""stealth COVID-19 pneumonia."" With it, your oxygen saturation can drop as low as 50% (high 90's is normal) without signalling shortness of breath. This is a potentially lethal level of oxygen starvation and, even if you don't die, can deprive the brain of needed oxygen, make the heart and lungs work much harder to deliver oxygen to the body and risk damaging other organs.

""Brain Fog,"" a lessening of brain function is not uncommon in survivors anyway, possibly explaining our President's increasingly erratic behavior and inability to work, spending his time golfing, tweeting, eating KFC and consulting wackier and wackier conspiracy theorists to figure out even more phantasmagorical ways to overturn his election loss.

2020-12-30 13:31:18,"On March 9, same date as the subject of this article, I fell ill with suspected COVID. (I say suspected because in rural Tennessee the test was not available and only those sick enough to be hospitalized were treated and tested; everyone else was told to ride it out at home.) The first ride took two months of chronic exhaustion, coughing, and chest pain. Then periodically it kept recurring for the rest of this past year, typically after trying to be more active. That’s the heartbreaking reality of long COVID: you know you need to try to do more, you ride out a bad period, you eventually decide to try to do more, it works for a little while maybe, then you get hit all over again. Another 3 weeks in the barrel.

My case is nowhere near as bad as the folks described here, and it took a turn for the better after my seasonal flu shot in November. (I went into the barrel again right afterwards, then two weeks later came out better and healthier somehow.) I wish all us long haulers health and wellness again! Thanks for this article.

2020-12-30 14:52:31,"I feel sorry for Mr Long and others like him. These long term effects of Covid-19 have been reported repeatedly but I think many in our country prefer not to hear about it. Many will suffer permanent lung damage that makes them more susceptible to other diseases. Sadly this happens to many in the prime of life. The long term consequences of this virus will be with us as a society for years. 

To think, if we had had a president and Republican Party that had taken this virus seriously and encouraged everyone to follow public health guidelines we would have had a fraction of the deaths and misery.

Japan, a country of 125 million and one of the first affected, has had just 3,200 deaths due to near uniform mask use and citizens who follow public health guidelines."
2020-12-30 11:32:38,"This is what’s so horrifying: there’s still so much we do not understand about this virus. Even with a successful vaccine, so many people have been infected already and we just cannot say for sure what the long-term impact might be. I had covid eight months ago; no lung issues, but many other nasty symptoms such as awful nausea, loss of smell, and severe anxiety. My stomach has been off for the last couple of months; is this related to covid? Last month I felt anxiety on a very high level not experienced since eight months ago. Covid related? How would we even know? And I’m even more worried for my young child who tested positive for antibodies. He’s complained of stomach pains for quite some time now, but no obvious explanations. It’s hard to stay positive when there are so many unknowns. And that’s coming from someone who has not experienced the worst that covid has to offer."
2020-12-30 12:27:46,It’s terrible what these people are going through and it’s confusing why some patients seem to have very mild symptoms and can return to their lives with minimal lasting effects while others are plagued with debilitating illnesses. They need support. We need to help them in their efforts to become stabile and not let them fall into bankruptcy due to the bills that are sure to pile up. I agree with the points made here on Obamacare.

2020-12-30 16:06:26,This is a message that needs to be heard: a lot of people are willing to take unwise COVID risks because they think they're going to survive and be fine.  They would make safer decisions if they knew they might face lifelong health consequences from infection.
2020-12-30 16:08:27,"Best wishes to Mr. Long. Lots of people are struggling with the impact this virus can have on our health. But I’ve yet to see the incessant coverage of Covid complications, a phenomenon echoed in local media here, bring the level of dread we’d probably need to slow the spread through voluntary changes of behavior. Utah’s epidemic has never been as intense as it is now, and there’s no sign it will stop until everyone’s been infected or vaccinated. People still head to work or school, and parking lots at the stores are often full. While restaurants, gyms and bars do seem empty now, relative to usual holiday crowds, that’s not good enough for such an aggressive virus—of which a late mutation will make avoidance even harder.

I think a newspaper ad supplement the CDC published last April has become relevant again. It had a section on anxiety that recommended tuning the lurid stories out for a while. I’ve made plans for temporary disability and possible hospitalization or death. I stay home most of the time, a step I’m lucky is open to me. But I’m expecting to get hit anyway. And remembering the fears I’d had upon hearing that SARS had reached Toronto in 2003, thankful the new virus wasn’t as deadly as it might have been."

I didn't meet the clinical criteria to get tested at the time (remember, too few test were available?) because I only had a fever and felt awful for two days. However, my MIL who lives with us got sick with Covid and spent 4 months in the hospital. Since we all had symptoms at the same time, I assume everyone in our household had it. Long story short, I still get bouts of fever and general malaise for 1-2 days every six to eight weeks or so and I am pretty sure it is Covid related. Not fun."

We’ve already suffered nearly 340,000 deaths, and there’s no end in sight due to the slow rollout of vaccine doses. (90% fewer doses than promised? Really?!?) And significantly more hospitalized patients survive than die, lucky to be alive but many left with sequelae of unknown long term significance.

Trump’s plan for herd immunity via natural infection was far worse than bankrupting a casino or running a bogus university, but he’ll escape real responsibility like he always does. Meanwhile, many of his victims will probably suffer lifelong economic and health consequences. Simultaneously, congressional Republicans will try to kneecap the recovery under Biden and further their attempts to dismantle government supported healthcare. 

Too bad personal responsibility and accountability only apply to the victims of Republican mismanagement."
2020-12-30 17:59:18,"Health professionals are racing to help the sick and prevent new cases. They can't do it alone! How nice it will be to have national leaders who respect and help them, and put Americans' well-being first. 
How tragic that so many people listened to those who know so little, and care not at all. May those who survive learn not to do that again."
2020-12-30 18:03:49,"If COVID-19 were diagnosed much earlier through strategic and frequent testing and contact tracing, as well as more aggressive therapies like identifying (ferritin levels) and treating cytokine storms, would doctors be able to prevent most of the long term disabling effects?"
2020-12-30 18:20:22,"Long term illness is the scariest potential outcome of Covid. 
So hoping to hang on until the vaccines are widely available. And looking forward to findings that tell us if the vaccinated are no longer possibly contagious."
2020-12-30 18:33:07,"I had Covid-19 with very light symptoms in July. I’m 52 years old and have been donating the antibodies since Aug and continue to today. I workout regularly. More importantly, I eat healthy-salads, red bell peppers, broccoli, blueberries. strawberries etc. 

I feel the media does not emphasize how important eating healthy contributes to fighting Covid-19 and helping your body’s immune system. If you eat a hamburger add lettuce to it. If you have ice cream add fresh strawberries, walnuts etc. . It doesn’t have to be a chore."
2020-12-30 18:37:09,"If you are coughing - see a pulmonologist and don’t wait.

I have asthma and allergies
When I have a bout the sooner I am seen the sooner I get on steroids and maybe an antibiotic the sooner I am well.

One year I waited two months and it took six months to clear."
2020-12-30 18:38:24,"This is why my wife and kids and I have hardly left the driveway since March. My wife has not gone inside a store or restaurant or friend’s house in nine months, and the only times I dare venture into a store is with a P100 respirator mask with replaceable filter cartridges that block everything right down to the microscopic particles carrying scents. It occurred to me the other day that I haven’t smelled the interior of a building other than my home or shed for nearly a year now.

Despite the relatively low risk of surface transmission, we still let nonperishables sit for a few days before putting them away, and dutifully clean off the packages of refrigerated and frozen food with bleach water. It’s more for our mental health than physical, I suspect, but that’s OK with me.

And yet, during all this, I remain acutely aware of how privileged we are to be able to rely on curbside pickup and delivery services run by people who have to put themselves at risk every day to infection by this terrifying virus. I hope they get the vaccine way before we do, even though we are older than most of them. We can continue to wait as we have been for however long it takes."
2020-12-30 16:02:57,"Why start the article like this:

“Chris Long’s life used to include biking 30 miles three times a week and taking courses toward a Ph.D. in eight-week sessions.”

But ends like this:

“Mr. Long had some previous health issues, including blood clots in his lungs and legs several years ago and an irregular heartbeat requiring an implanted heart monitor in 2018. “

Maybe the underlying health problems should have been mentioned earlier."
2020-12-30 17:29:50,"Fact is, at this point, we have no idea what the lasting effects of Covid-19 are. We have no idea how it damages our organs. And now we're going to have to deal with....I guess you would call it...Covid-20....the sequel. One thing is certain, anyone who had Covid-19 has a permanent preexisting condition."
2020-12-30 17:31:01,"I think Covid will be ultimately known as a multi-system disease.  What is frustrating is that our public health, CDC, FDA, NIH are not doing rigorous study, instead making excuses for their poor performance to date.   I hope President Biden cleans house of all the Trump gang and re-installs professionals into these agencies."
2020-12-30 16:37:36,"When I read these symptoms I wonder where are the people who suffer from chroinc Fatigue. People with Me / CFS suffer from most  of these same symptoms and they never get better.. This is a group of over a million people who know how to live with these disorders. 
When I read about long haul Covid sufferers I think maybe just maybe some smart researcher is going to discover what post viral syndrome is  about and there may be help for all the  millions of housebound CFS patients.
At Stanford a son of one of the  CFS best researchers  in the country is so debilatated by CFS he can't get out of bed. The  disordrs  of CFS patients are   so similar to what these long haul Covid 19 patients are suffering.
CFS/ME is a large group of people who have been home bound way and could have taught all of us how to cope with lock down and loss of a work or personal life. 
So I hope ,really hope this will be studied and maybe so many undiagnosised patients will finally have an answer. 
We need more research please look at CFS."

2020-12-30 16:17:17,"Sounds like Mr. Long is having an auto-immune response and likely needs steroids and not antibiotics. Based on personal experience & someone who has autoimmune diseases, when the body experiences a similar threat over and over, it’s defenses can over-respond to threat. Sounds like this is what is happening here. Best wishes and healing to him."
2020-12-30 17:52:07,"This makes it even more tragic that throughout this whole epidemic we have made no efforts whatsoever to control the chronic diseases that clearly contribute to bad COVID outcomes.  In particular, we know with diabetes that people's rates of severe complications (and deaths) go up significantly as their blood sugar increases (excess blood sugar actually increases COVID receptors); yet there hasn't even been the hint of public health campaigns to help people understand this or direct education to help people with diabetes reduce their blood sugar, something that can be done within weeks.

2020-12-30 18:07:16,"Something else to think about because of USA privatisation of health system; what happens if the insurance companies go bankrupt from all the insurance claims? I bet the government would probably have to bail them out so you should have voted for Obamacare. No wonder the USA has so much government debt with the government having to bail out private businesses whenever there is a national emergency. Don't forget private companies privatise their profits and socialise their losses and if that isn't corporate social welfare paid for by government what is.
Another horrific thing you'll need to look at as well, is that your insurance premiums will probably increase the more you draw on your private insurance policy."
2020-12-30 18:09:26,"Trump and the Republican Party should be billed for all covid initial and repeat care.  Since Trump stooped so low as to with hold testing to make himself look good, then he should pay the price.  While the RNC blindly supported Trump, they too should feel the financial pain of paying for what they caused."
2020-12-30 18:50:32,"I’m a practicing physician. Hospital readmissions for chronic conditions is commonplace in this country mostly due to a lack of societal and healthcare support structures. Hospitals call these patients “frequent fliers” and most cost containment interventions focus on a few costly readmissions. We can add Covid to the list of mismanaged hospital discharges, although I doubt it’s hundreds of thousands as the article suggests without solid data."
2020-12-30 18:52:00,Long-haul Covid is starting to remind me of FIP or feline infectious peritonitis-- a fatal disease in cats. It's caused by a common coronavirus that most cats recover from. Some small percentage of cats never clear the virus and end up with a systemic infection and immune system reaction that eventually kills them.
2020-12-30 15:50:14,"I had suspected Covid in March.  I’m slim, a life long runner, no underlying conditions.  I rode it out at home, suffered too many symptoms to name, and only improved in September.  The concept of herd immunity, given what I endured, is a dangerous crap shoot.  How can our health system handle the onslaught of long haulers, such as me? It infuriated me that Trump and Christie - hardly paragons of good health - emerged unscathed when I took excellent care of myself and suffered a general systemic collapse!  Happened to many others.  I will definitely take the vaccine when it’s offered."
2020-12-30 18:56:47,"For Mr. Long, and the many others in the same boat- I've been in that boat too.

Still am, really; I was officially diagnosed with ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"" around 1989.  I still have it.  When it's in full bloom, I feel like- I've had both legs cut off about mid-thigh; and have terminal pneumonia.  For most of those 30 years it's been better; more about like I had one arm ripped out of its socket, yesterday.  A major improvement.

One smidgen of hope for you; your body has long-term resources to fight weird germs- that the doctors rarely talk about.  That's because nobody knows much about them, except that they do exist.  Some of my early symptoms (4 years of acute sinusitis) have actually disappeared altogether; something inside me kicked in- after 4 years- and kicked it out.

So your body is STILL FIGHTING.  Fight with it.  And don't give up; you may win it yet; really."
2020-12-30 18:33:01,"The Sisyphean nature of this disease is truly horrifying to me. I suspect the next wave of horror for these folks and many more to come (just read the NYT article about covid psychosis & subsequent lengthy hospitalizations this week) is the ever mounting and unending medical bills for long and repeat hospitalizations, not to mention home health care. When, when can we have single-payer healthcare??

The medical bankruptcies are going to cause the next wave of recession-depression in this country and it's going to be a tsunami. How long until many of us cannot afford to stay alive? I'm furious our health insurance in NC is so ridiculous (no ACA initiated expansion allowed here, no sir, but our $9000/y deductible is unaffordable)! And I believe the US republican government owes us not $600 checks or $2000 checks, but nothing less than universal health care, especially considering their dereliction of duty both because trump knew in advance how bad the virus was, and because the republicans allowed him to stay in office by laughing off the impeachment.

In my opinion, the Bush administration should have been prosecuted for their phony wars, and trump should be prosecuted for negligent homicide. Lies, lies, lies, and mendacity."
2020-12-30 19:00:16,"Wishing Mr. Long better days and improved health. It's unconscionable so many Americans are suffering like this, or have lost their lives. It didn't have to be this way.

2020-12-30 19:25:58,"Not only has this Country cavalierly ignored how expensive ICU Care is to those actually in there for weeks ( millions), they completely have ignored the looming crisis of the medically disabled who will further tax our broken healthcare system and who will no longer be able to contribute economically. All because the GOP politicians ( overwhelmingly ) couldn’t bear to pay people to stay home. The ultimate cost of their inaction will be multiple times the money they were worried about spending."
2020-12-30 19:33:05,"I’m fighting a mild case of covid right now. Yes, I’m one who has been terrified of getting covid and have taken precautions such as wearing my mask if I hike outside, avoiding stores, picking up groceries curbside, not socializing, etc  We need to all understand that wearing a mask won’t protect  alone you. And we need to be less judgmental and recognize that many who are sick did wear a mask and took precautions.

Nationally, there also needs to be more physical and emotional support across the board. As a nation, our leaders have failed us at every level. Who is providing support to medical staff? Who is supporting those who are caring for others? Who is supporting those who are bereaved? If you’re home sick, what is the best way to treat various symptoms? I’ve read and heard carrying degrees of medical advice including to treat it as a flu and rest, rest, rest to keep walking 15 minutes every two hours. From an emotional perspective, it’s horrifying not knowing if you’re going to end up being on a ventilator. What strategies or resources are available to those who need emotional support?

Lastly, every citizen who leaves the house (even with a mask)! should have a plan in place if they become sick. Who will be able to drop off food? Who will take care of your children? Who will be your primary emotional support? Is your will written? Let’s all assume we have the propensity to get this virus and plan accordingly."
2020-12-30 19:41:05,"I wonder, and it is not addressed in this article but when these folks become symptomatic again, requiring hospitalization, are they contagious again?   Perhaps some physicians out there can answer this.   

I'm so sorry for these people, this virus has ruined so much and so many lives.  With the new strain (more contagious) having entered into the US; I also wonder does the current vaccine cover that too?  This was always a concern, that the quickly mutating virus would be difficult to stay ahead of.   Like colds, we don't vaccinate for colds because of the frequency and speed in which they mutate."
2020-12-30 19:43:46,"I find it shocking that Mr. Long was released after only 5 days, to go home where he lives alone. It seems a bit irresponsible of the hospital."
2020-12-30 19:56:59,"We need to get away from the mindset that after Covid, all will be fine except for the hundreds of thousands of those who died and potentially millions of people and their families who are physically and mentally devastated by the disease.  Sadly, right now we do not know how to treat these long standing problems, whether they are temporary or permanent, and what if any are risk factors that bring it on.

We need to:
1. Have a registry of these people and start following them to learn the natural history of these conditions. If they get better, we need to know how long it takes and why, if there is a clear why.
2. Recognize that for the foreseeable future, they are going to need disability support, and this is going to cost a good deal of money and time.
3. Recognize that those who treat them will need to be reimbursed as well, because most people's financial and insurance situations will be inadequate.

Acute and chronic Covid care is going to be a huge addition to the country's budget, and we need to deal with it.

Can we have a few more people wear the cloth and quit whining about rights to ignore public health guidelines?  If the new strain is more infectious, and the vaccine rollout more messed up that it already is, the costs will keep mounting."
2020-12-30 20:08:56,"This article should have mentioned Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS, also called ME/CFS) which is a poorly understood disease with similar symptoms to post-COVID, but may be triggered by other viral infections as well.

These are not psychiatric or imagined symptoms, and should be taken seriously by the medical community and the insurance industry."
2020-12-30 20:18:18,"There's another side to this story, too. I work in lung transplant. We've received consults for multiple patients who are ""covid recovered,"" but the virus has done such extensive damage that they are stuck on life support, not able to leave the hospital. We have had to tell 100% of these patients no, because the toll of being critically ill laying in a hospital bed is so severe that they wouldn't survive the surgery, much less benefit from it. At that point there is no other option but to ""pull the plug,"" so to speak. Then there's another subset of patients, who aren't on life support but aren't able to function anymore due to the lung damage. We've only taken a shot at giving one a lung transplant. It did not go well, and we probably won't do anymore until we understand more about the long term effects of covid.
So for all those out there who say ""but 99% of people with covid recover,"" remember that ""recovery"" does not always mean ""return to life as normal."" It might just mean you die after 6 months of medical torture."
2020-12-30 20:38:20,"These long-term complications from COVID-19 are not only dangerous, they're heartbreaking - to anyone with even a bit of compassion. And these ""long haul"" illnesses will not magically disappear, even after national (and global) vaccination success. Which makes me wonder what the internal discussions are like, right about now - at the end of Q4 - at medical insurance conglomerates. I'm pretty sure those conversations are not ""We need to provide long-term quality medical coverage, for those afflicted by a deadly virus about which science still is largely in the dark."" Nope; more like ""How can we maximize profits off 'long-hauler' treatment regimens, deceptively skirt around Obamacare, and manipulate the ravages of disease (yet again) as the ultimate cash cow for our stakeholders?"""
2020-12-30 20:44:01,"One of the most costly aspects of chronic illness is when home care is necessary for survival.

If you are discharged from the hospital because an insurance company says your time is up, and initially the insurance company says you qualify for home health, it can look doable. Until home health has to discharge you, and you need daily home care which is not a covered medical expense.

Once health insurance premiums, prescription premiums, deductibles, co-pays, co-insurance, ""uncovered expenses""...are paid, you see what home care you can afford, or not. 

You might be able to deduct medical expenses on your tax return (to be clear, an increase in the ability to deduct medical expenses was not part of mcconnell's plan, but, the ability to deduct corporate meal expenses, mcconnell insisted on including the pandemic rescue package.  

Obamacare is the reason many of us were able to tell these stories prior to the pandemic.

Those on the supreme court and in congress who do not support healthcare for all need to continue on their private insurance plans; the rest of us know what President Obama was able to accomplish."
2020-12-30 20:48:26,"""Long Covid"" is one of the least understood and under reported aspects of the pandemic.  Thanks to the President and the mendacity of social media, many people still believe that Covid-19 is no more dangerous than the flu.  They point to the survival rate, ignoring that many who survive continue for weeks, months, or longer to battle serious debilities involving their heart, lungs, kidneys, brains, and reproductive systems.  Thank you for this story and any continuing coverage you'll provide on this devastating aspect of the pandemic."
2020-12-30 21:11:07,"It is so important to look at this virus not just in cases of death. People are getting crippled for the rest of their life. And i am still missing any statistics about the severity and quantity of long term effects of those, who are just considered survivors. Also the prospect, that immunity wears off and we can get this seasonal like the flu makes this much more serious than just considering at the actual death rate.
We should show the same determination like we had with Poliomyelitis. Obliterating this infection even far beyond our borders should be a political primary for the next years."
2020-12-30 21:17:34,"I'm a long-hauler, too, and have had a year now of moderate recurrent symptoms. Fortunately, I haven't felt like I needed to be hospitalized, but I've come close. I suspect that there are a lot of us out here, just waiting for the day when recovery is not three steps forward, one step back."
2020-12-30 21:30:31,"This story shows the utter devastation that COVID-19 can bring besides its horrible deaths.  It also shows that America needs to invest in a robust public health system -- to prevent these tragedies and also to assist those who suffer long-term consequences from diseases like COVID-19.  It underscores how extremely necessary it is that we have national single payer healthcare covering everyone and that this also be robust, so as to cover complications and long-term care and disability.  America is currently in an uncontrolled pandemic but is also facing the upcoming need of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people for long term care and assistance just to survive.  For those who said the economy was more important than taking steps to mitigate this pandemic, I ask, how will the long term effects of this disease fit into our economy?"

2020-12-30 22:57:33,"As a person who had struggled w/ post-Lyme symptoms for years, it's amazing to see the attention given to (well-deserved) long-term Covid. My symptoms were identical to many Covid longhaulers, except for the pneumonia, although I did have shortness of breath. The brain fog/cognitive issues, in particular, were near-debilitating. I had to drop out of a master's program because I couldn't understand or retain what I was reading. Two neurologists sent me home, saying there was nothing wrong w/ me according to their tests, even tho my parents (I was 38 at the time) had to take me to those appt's because I couldn't drive, could barely think, & was almost too weak to walk from the parking garage to the clinic. To read here that a doctor acknowledged that post-Covid brain fog is very real & a terrible thing for a man who thinks for a living almost brings me to tears, because I had to fight so hard to be heard by my MDs. I couldn't share the extent of my illness w/ friends & extended family because it wasn't as accepted or understood. I definitely wasn't being interviewed by journalists for newspaper articles. I kept my illness as secret as I could due to shame. People have always suffered from post-infectious disease syndromes (myalgic encephalomyelitis), and not just from viruses. With Covid in the spotlight, maybe now they'll be taken seriously & given the research time & money they deserve."

I won't let him have any sugar, eat a pizza, go through a drive-thru or enjoy the overwhelming majority of recipes put forth in this paper.  It may not cure him of everything but he will feel like he is in a new body.  

Hippocrates (the father of medicine) said, ""Let food be your medicine and let medicine be your food"".  Would any of you spend an evening at the pharmacy dining away?  Of course not.  But the American diet is clearly poison which is why 70% of all adults are taking one (if not many) prescriptions.  

A neighbor of mine (now dead from COVID) said to me one night in the parking lot.  ""I wish I could eat anything like you and still be skinny"".  Boy, did she get a lecture of my diet, the weightlifting, and the five mile walks with a jump rope.  And I told her about my relatives who are all 75-100 lbs. overweight.  

Mr. Long's body is fighting the poisons he keeps dumping into it.  It can't get the nutrition he needs.  And on top of that, its trying to heal itself and fight off a new virus.  He is doomed to failure just like my other late friend.  Official cause of death?  Diabetes.  But what really killed her was the fact that never once did I see her without a super large Mountain Dew in one hand and a big bag of Jack in the Box in the other.

2020-12-30 17:47:53,"THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY of our time is suppressed information on “alternative medicines” that actually changes the course of all this
 My husband and I had early Covid last January and were hospitalized. In 2 weeks un-remittant arrhythmia led to heart surgery. His arrhythmia meds stopped working. A Friend told us to get high doses of Liposomal C because her Integrative Medicine MD said it was changing patients lives there.(Moderna’s vaccine,   some cancer meds are encased in liposomes) We started 1000mg of C and Lysine every 2-3 hours and our symptoms stopped in a day after weeks of struggling with the initial infestation.    
 I hit the books. Linus Pauling’s protocol for dosing vitaminC, YouTube’s tutorials on its chemistry, and Nih.gov had massive studies on this miracle. It’s mind boggling that medicine disavows C while the government publishes medical institute studies online over its miraculous efficacy. Volumes of studies confirm it changes the course of recovery, prevents getting sick, and is the co-creator of collagen, serotonin, bone density, nitric oxide,and creates hydrogen peroxide, just to name a few. YES! it kills germs. Enough said about Big PHARMA and our nutritionally uneducated Medical establishment. We need to educate ourselves. 
 We were purple, now red..I became symptomatic Saturday, identical to last year but milder. I followed the protocol for when you are sick and today I’m only slightly tired. I’ll maintain protocol for 2 weeks. Self educate!!"

I give the NYT credit for its pandemic coverage, but articles like this one appear constantly in this publication and almost uniformly fail to provide statistics that properly designate how slim these scenarios actually are. 

On Monday, the NYT featured an article on extreme psychological illness effecting some Covid patients. Today, it’s recurring pneumonia. While the facts exist and should be reported, I find the overall coverage to be heavily tilted to click-bait shocker instances of worst case scenarios, perhaps designed to scare the public into awareness. We did this article merit a banner pop up on my iPhone. It’s pandemic click bait, that’s why. All I’d ask is for these articles to clearly state that the actual incidence of these side effects are fractions of a percentage point when compared to the total infected population. 

My wife and I both had Covid in March. Several people I know have had Covid. We are all fine for what it’s worth, but that story isn’t news worthy is it."

It would be such a public service.  Getting COVID is just so scary.  I’m trying to be so careful, only going to grocery stores, drug stores, post offices.  But I know other people I read about also know how to protect themselves.  So why are 100,000/200,000 people getting sick every day?  What more can I be doing to remain COVID free?"
2020-12-30 19:14:27,Well now they have a pre existing condition. Let us all hope the republicans do not take that away from the ACA. Wish them the best. Richard.
2020-12-30 19:23:16,"The article says there are no stats on the number of ICU readmissions, but it suggests it may be about 1%. How is that a ""significant"" number of cases? What would be an insignificant number? Since there is no reliable information to make an informed judgment on the relative significance of the numbers, the reporter is simply injecting her own opinion into the story.  Why then has the reporter insisted on sensationalizing it? It's the definition of fear mongering."
2020-12-30 20:23:14,"A conservative friend is sure the Coronavirus numbers have been inflated, so she’s “ living life.” She and her husband have flown for Thanksgiving and Christmas commingling with children from LA, NYC and Nashville. I’ve vowed to stay away from her until I’m vaccinated for who knows what she is carrying around..only wears a mask when she is required and shops as usual.
I shudder to think what may happen...Dr. Fauci’s recommendations are simply “ the government trying to take our freedom.”
 
Thinking it’s “just like the flu” it appears many haven’t gotten the message...until they are admitted to the ICU or suffering long term effects.

Meanwhile, I haven’t left my house except to walk since early March.

I just don’t understand it. It makes me extremely angry."
2020-12-30 20:30:23,"This is why a think that a blind attitude that everyone will be fine once they get the vaccine is misguided . 
      I am still battling Lyme disease , I had chronic fatigue for years after contracting Epstein Barr virus in my early 30’d and was very sick . Then interestingly after I got pregnant my chronic fatigue went away . They say that sometimes hormones can shift things around .
    I have no idea how my body will react to the vaccine . And if people who have relatively mild Covid symptoms are experiencing devastating lasting neurological and physical disability , do we really know how someone’s body could react going forward if exposed to that protein in the vaccine ? 
      There is still too much we don’t know. I will continue wearing masks and won’t be going to any crowded events anytime soon  . The vaccine doesn’t protect you from getting infected either . It just gives you supposedly a milder case . But this is not like the flu . It is an extremely complex virus just as Lyme disease is an extremely complex bacterial infection. There is much we don’t know . 
   
Question : Why in Gods name are we still allowing wet markets in China with live exotic animals slaughtered under no health regulations or supervision ? 
That is a breeding ground for these kinds of horrible deadly viruses that disrupt the entire world and our economy. 
       Shouldn’t the WHO ban this  ??? 
Come on , this is enough of that disgusting germ ridden practice ."
2020-12-30 19:26:29,"The best way to help everybody the most is to give Covid 19 vaccine priority to the very oldest amongst us, because most of the medical resources are being used to give medical care to the very oldest who are the most vulnerable to serious illness requiring medical care. It is a hospitalization crisis of the very eldest who require top priority for vaccination against Covid 19."
2020-12-30 22:15:05,They are using too many resources after not taking any precautions. Next.
2020-12-30 19:56:27,"This information should be presented daily by doctors in the media.  How else are we going to reach the Covid-deniers and mask-protesters?  There are those who are unreachable, who believe Trump is a role model and who won’t listen to science.  But some minds can be opened to the real and devastating after-effects of a bout with this virus.

There is MUCH that is not understood about Covid-19.  What doctors are learning is often bad news for long-haulers.  The way we can avoid all this is not to get Covid-19 in the first place.  That requires that we all mask up, physically distance, and remain in our own bubble for enough months until most of us are vaccinated.  

Why this isn’t doable for so many is difficult to comprehend.  How did people get so selfish?"
2020-12-30 16:59:28,Will you publish this article in Spanish? I'd like to share it with non English speaking friends and family who need this information
2020-12-30 23:18:19,"Luckily, Providence has somehow spared NYC from even a mild flu outbreak this month. Activity Level = ""Minimal"". Source: Weekly US Map: Influenza Summary Update, as of December 19, 2020 on the CDC website."
2020-12-30 23:38:48,"With the massive overpopulation around the world, we are not in a position to have the weaker population back repeatedly for hospitalizations.  Sorry but that is the blunt truth."
2020-12-30 23:51:05,"One thought about this:  how many patients will die from the sequelae of COVID-19 because they will lose their jobs, have no income, and be unable to afford the care or medications they need to recover or even stay alive?  And how much longer will Americans be forced to deal with the inefficient wealth care system that masquerades as a health care system?"
2020-12-31 01:46:27,"Honestly, between the reports of people suddenly becoming severely psychotic after having COVID and all this information coming out on long haulers...it makes me not want to leave my room, let alone my house! My neighbors have COVID and one of them is in the hospital right now. I hope they recover fully. These long term effects are nightmarish."
2020-12-31 02:37:55,"Good lord. And to think our nation is full of benighted humans who are certain that this coronavirus is a hoax! With seventy million of such people, how will we ever overcome this pandemic?"
2020-12-28 19:18:34,"Interesting. But I see little mention of how it is known that these psychotic episodes are related to having had covid? There are so many now that have had it, could it not be coincidence? Has anyone shown that the onset of these episodes is higher in the post covid population than not?  I know that episodes usually initially occur on the late teens or 20s, but I believe it’s not too unusual especially in women to occur initially in the 40s. My deepest  sympathies to those affected, mental illness from any cause is truly awful for those affected and their families."
2020-12-28 19:22:54,"Is it possible that parts of the brain are lacking oxygen? I have sleep apnea and if I sleep without my CPAP machine, I have nightmares whereas with the machine, I never do. some of the other symptoms described here are also typical of low oxygen (or poor mitochondrial function) such as tingling extremities, headaches. If so, then a good treatment would be to improve circulation and/or mitochondrial function. not sure what that would be - NO for circulation? or blood thinners? Intermittent fasting for improved mitochondria via autophagy?

If covid patients are treated with aspirin, are they at a reduced risk for later effects ie long covid or the problems described here?"
2020-12-28 19:29:22,"If there’s no scientific explanation, then I don’t understand how you can make this correlation. If we stop listening to what is scientifically proven and feasible, then we altogether degrade the nature of proven causal relationships."
2020-12-28 19:42:18,It is possible that this is an autoimmune mediated process.  Autoimmune encephalopathy has been documented after certain viral infections of the brain.  In some patients they manifest as a psychiatric disorder such as psychosis.
2020-12-28 19:51:06,"Interesting but frightening. If it is some sort of immune system response gone awry, I’ve been wondering about the (out of the box) use of interleukin antagonists. Tamp down inflammation as well. But, just a guess."
2020-12-28 19:55:21,"They don't say if these patients were tested for antibodies against synaptic and neuronal cell membrane proteins such as anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor that can occur after viral illnesses and cause psychosis. If they haven't tried IVIG, it might be worth it, at least for those who aren't responding to other anti-psychotic medications."
2020-12-28 19:55:56,"The suddenness of onset in patients with no prior history, the severity of the symptoms, and the unusual ages of onset as well as the common factor of a prior COVID infection are all suspicious. This could well be a central nervous system effect of COVID and needs to be considered a prime hypothesis for further investigation."
2020-12-28 19:22:48,"By far, this is the most profoundly terrifying article that I have read regarding the virus. I am at a loss, trying to absorb such a tragedy. Physical pain, we understand. Severe mental anguish, not so much."
2020-12-28 19:27:31,"Make one wonder if this is indeed Covid related, or if extended quarantines and social isolation is what's causing this psychosis."
2020-12-28 19:37:35,"This isn't surprising since the immune response to some virus are know to cause psychosis.  Psychosis is also a very rare but known side effect of some whole virus vaccines like the yellow fever vaccine (read about the case of Malcom Brabant).

2020-12-28 19:43:48,What is the percentage of people that become psychotic?    Is there anything else that they have in common?   Much more research needs to be done.   Interesting hypothesis though.
2020-12-28 19:51:15,Wow.  One more thing for this Covid survivor to worry about.  I hope everyone stays healthy.
2020-12-28 20:15:33,"A family member developed psychosis this summer and was hospitalized in the local hospital's psych ward for 40 days.  No history of covid infection.  However, we later found a very large number of nitrous oxide (""laughing gas"", and a dental anesthetic) cartridges (colloquially called whip-its, as used in making whipped cream, but available in head shops) hidden in the house.  Turned out he had breathed in 15.8 KILOGRAMS of the stuff over 2-3 months, thinking it was not toxic. My wife, a very smart physician, researched N2O-induced psychosis and found many case reports.  None of the psychiatrists had heard of it.  Turns out it eliminates vitamin B-12 in neurons.  He had a very low level of vitamin B-12 in his blood.  Vitamin B-12 supplements, which we had to convince the psych ward physicians to administer, cured his psychosis, with some help from respiridone at the end.  This probably has nothing to do with covid, compared to viral brain infection or elevated immune response, as there probably isn't a mechanism involved with SARS-CoV-19 infection that alters vitamin-B12 metabolism.  Just thought I should mention this, as so many local psychiatrists have never heard of nitrous oxide-induced psychosis. Hopefully some psychiatrists read this article and then the comments."
2020-12-28 20:17:39,"Here’s my best guess: it’s lack of adequate Oxygen. Either acutely ( those hospitalized, intubated and ultimately needed ventilators) OR a lower level, chronic shortage of “ air “.  ICU psychosis is a well known and studied phenomenon, for decades. Most patients recover after a few months, some are permanently affected. Not only the oxygen deprivation, but also lack of sleep, the noise, the physical and emotional stress, the deprivation of family contact, the use and possibly overuse of many, many Drugs and therapies.  Who would NOT suffer under those circumstances ?
  If you’re recovering without apparent lasting damage or symptoms, congratulations. And buy some lottery tickets. Also, please do all you can to protect others. THIS ISN'T OVER, not by a long shot. It won’t be finished for a couple of years. For too many, it will never be done."
2020-12-28 20:27:45,"COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 RNA currently knows far more about us than we do about it.

We don't know the short nor long term effects of having and surviving COVID-19 on our emotional, mental and physical selves."
2020-12-28 20:30:23,"This is not an unknown phenomenon. It’s a diagnosis called delirium. It’s been studied for many years. Covid patients are somewhat unusual because younger patients are becoming delirious, but this is not a new phenomenon. perceptual disturbance is a cardinal symptom of delirium. It seems strange to me that these doctors do not even mention it."
2020-12-28 20:37:25,"My biggest trepidations are several fold, first the incidence of extreme episodes of Psychotic Behaviors may not be correctly diagnosed in areas of the country where mental health services are lacking also numerous other minor neurological symptoms that will diminish motor or cognitive ability will go undiagnosed.

Even though the numbers appear at this time to be  statistically small I wonder if in underserved rural communities and urban enclaves where hospitals operate on a shoestring budget if they will have the needed  funding at their disposal, exacerbated by the numerous Covid patients from these regions that may have had the disease and never been tested or diagnosed."

Neuro anatomically the olfactory nerve has direct access to  the

And this virus is a naso-pharyngial  infection.   Of course it also affects the micro circulation in the brain.  that's pobably enough?"
2020-12-28 19:09:50,"So many horrible things are related to Covid, including the response by the current president of the United States, but thinking that your cell phone is tracking you sounds like good reality awareness to me, not psychosis.

How do you tell a 911 dispatcher NOT to send the police?"
2020-12-28 20:19:32,At least these people had enough self-awareness to know there was something wrong and sought help. This is just another example of how much we don't know about the effects of Covid.

unpredictably at best?

2020-12-28 20:03:19,"Well, this is horrifying. And to think I used to be afraid of getting an STD for anonymous sex! Jeesh! Silly old me! 

I'd have anonymous sex all day long now and risk STDs compared to this! Only problem is, if I DID have anonymous sex just one time, based on the fact I'm a total loser,  I'd probably get Covid psychosis and every time I'd pick up a can or lift a box off the shelf at the grocery store, I'd believe I launched a nuclear missile from a silo somewhere in Nebraska! 

I'm never leaving my living room for the rest of my life."
2020-12-28 20:38:28,"Other researchers have imaged the virus entering through the mucosa of the sinus on its way into the brain. Sorry, link not at hand.  It then entered parts of the brain that regulate organs effected by COVID-19.  Where it travels from there was not identified.

We give drugs to effect organs but if it is the regulator of said organs that is the thing being attacked, it may explain our limited ability to change outcomes."
2020-12-28 20:41:35,"These cases should be investigated as cases of PANDAS, which has afflicted adolescents in recent year.  Often during an infection, the macrophages of the immune system can escort aluminum and mercury to the brain where it can cause inflammation and mental conditions.  The patients should be evaluated for chelation therapy to reduce heavy metal toxicity in the body."

It’s demons."
2020-12-28 21:03:22,"The reason we don’t really want to reach natural herd immunity is that when you infect a few billion people you get a lot of terrible consequences. Death is only one of them.

Psychosis, neurological damage, lung damage, heart damage, kidney damage, autoimmune disease, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, depression, muscle weakness are just a few of the long term consequences of Covid. And even if each is rare, once you have hundreds of millions infected, those rare problems can tax a society and have terrible personal consequences.

I look forward to a vaccine, to stopping this disease and reducing the terrible toll it takes on all of us. But for now, for all of our sakes, I hope people will wear masks, stay home especially if felling ill, and curtail social contacts as much as possible. There is a mother out there who’d like to not kill her kids because someone could not hold off a year on a birthday party."

2020-12-28 21:15:11,"Dr John Barry’s study of the 1918 flu pandemic, The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History (highly recommended read) includes a chapter discussing something very similar—the segment of influenza survivors who were hospitalized (some for up to ten years) with psychotic illness that arose after the infection. He speculates that President Woodrow Wilson’s influenza case and subsequent behavior negotiating the Treaty of Versailles after WWI might indicate a similar phenomenon. 

I think it’s important to put this new clue about COVD-19 into context when thinking about how COVD attacks the body. So far, we have heard other scary side effects: lingering illness and incapacitation, heart and lung blood clots and other problems, kidney failure, circulatory problems including COVD Toe, Kawasaki’s syndrome in children, mental and brain problems, etc. We simply don’t have enough information yet to see how all these effects tie together. Right now, it’s about gathering data, treating symptoms, getting vaccinated when available and taking warning from those who have experienced these horrible effects. How bad does this virus have to be before the mass of us take this virus seriously enough to change our behavior until it’s over?"
2020-12-28 21:17:20,"What we do not know about this virus could still fill an encylopedia. I'm astonished and horrified how anyone can be cavalier about it, let alone refuse to wear a mask to protect themselves and others, or dare use it as some kind of misplaced, psychotic political wedge to further divide us."
2020-12-28 21:17:26,"This may explain why Trump has been acting the way he has been.

Nah, he's always had this problem, long before Covid-19 ever existed."
2020-12-28 19:19:11,This is an example of correlation. There is obviously no causal mechanism.

What about the immune system response initiated by the vaccine?"
2020-12-28 19:51:27,"Well that explains a lot about Trump’s actions in recent months after his bout with Covid. He’s been erratic, delusional and paranoid, classic symptoms of psychosis. Now if we can find out what made him psychotic before that diagnosis, we might be able to test for it before each inauguration."
2020-12-28 19:33:42,Is this offered as a possible explanation for Trump’s erratic and capricious behavior prior to and after treatment?

2020-12-28 21:19:55,"I theorize this is mold psychosis that is triggered by covid-19, similar to how latent mold psychosis is triggered in the early 30s by over immune activation with Lyme disease. It seems the anti viral minocycline is helping covid-19 stay well in hand yet the sudden onset psychosis is not being treated except for symptom masking. Look for a glycine treatment option."
2020-12-28 21:28:26,And what about children who contract COVID and are either asymptotic or have mild or moderate/severe symptoms. What are the mental impact risks for developing brains?
2020-12-28 21:29:46,"My heart goes out to these suffering people.  I experienced this kind of psychosis when I  unknowingly had neuroborellia from Lyme Disease; a perfect storm of infection, inflammation and immune response, which  totally compromised my brain's ability to process information and resulted in waking nightmares, hysteria and severe cognitive dysfunction.  Unlike those with bipolar or schizophrenia, as Covid19 patients described here, I was aware that something was wrong.  I no longer could order things; or compare, contrast, or determine what was more important or less.  I was unable to discriminate between what was possible or what was probable  The remotest worst case idea that entered my head had equal merit of my attention and concern as did the most reasonable or likely idea. Once I was properly diagnosed and treated with antibiotics; anti-inflammatory diet (no sugar, gluten or yeast) supplemented with Liposomal Glutathione among others to support neural regulation; removal from a toxic environment of mold, air pollution and other stressors; and embraced a healthy lifestyle, I was able to fully recover and rehabilitate in about 2 years.  (Thanks to my family and excellent health  socioeconomic support system)."
2020-12-28 21:21:14,Schizophrenia has long been associated with a mother catching a virus while pregnant. Looks like Covid might activate a (dormant) genetic predisposition.  Horrible.
2020-12-28 21:22:32,"In View of Trump's bizarre behaviour and the fact that he had Covid psychotic would be a good diagnosis for him. This country cannot afford to let a psychotic president rule for another month.

2020-12-28 21:29:21,The language people are using to mark people who have tragically acquired brain functioning problems due to a virus's effect on their neurological systems is as frightening as the contraction of COVID-19 to develop these tragic symptoms.

2020-12-28 19:40:30,"Nice. Another alarmist, Covid click-bait article by the New York Times. We have 81 million (reported!) Covid cases worldwide. The actual number probably being double that. In any given year, a sampling group of 81+ million people will give you a handful of cases who will develop unexplained, psychotic symptoms. As much as I feel sorry for the people experiencing this, the connection to Covid is not proven, and with these micro numbers does not even warrant a hunch. New York Times, please return to publishing fact based stories, instead of the continous peddling of sensationalist Covid fodder."
2020-12-28 20:38:23,"It is irresponsible fear mongering for the Times to publish this.  It is no more newsworthy than posting about the vanishingly rare reactions to the vaccine.  This serves only to stoke fear and bolster justifications for stronger lockdowns, which the privileged have been enjoying and are profiting from.

There’s an accepted gatekeeper narrative about this virus that no one in the mainstream is allowed to challenge - it’s worth asking why and who is benefitting."
2020-12-28 21:53:26,We all know someone at the white house who had Covid and now is exhibiting signs of derangement. Who could it be?

2020-12-28 21:51:41,"If it is theocratized that the immune system is involved in some way,  I wonder if plasmapheresis or steroids along with antipsychotics would help."
2020-12-28 22:13:13,"We should not rule out a hysteria-like phenomenon given the intensity of the culture-wide Covid experience, the recurrence of this syndrome across multiple pandemics, and the absence of organic indicators from tests.  Unfortunately, in the age of social media, merely reporting on these cases could trigger similar problems in others.  Cautious multi-disciplinary science is the only solution we can hope for."
2020-12-28 22:06:39,Previously I felt a sample size of Donald Trump was not large enough to prove psychosis might be related to COCID
2020-12-28 22:06:40,The lessons that I learned from George Romero prepared me well Covid.   Stockpile food.  Stay indoors.  Avoid people.
2020-12-28 22:17:11,"Haven’t time to read all the comments but wanted to share my experience with psychosis last summer. It came about as my doctor was decreasing the amount of prednisone I had been on for interstitial lung disease. It was really bad & scary. Thankfully, I realized the timing coincided, did some research and spoke with my Pulmonologist & therapist who confirmed this can happen & isn’t rare. Luckily, in time, the effect lessened & went away.

Steroids are used in treating Covid-19. Is it possible that ties in to see psychotic episodes?"
2020-12-28 22:25:53,I wonder if any research has been done on psychotic symptoms and delirium in those already diagnosed with Dementia.  I've seen some major behavioral changes in long term care residents following covid 19 diagnosis.
2020-12-28 22:26:06,"Your cellphones are tracking you. You can see how reality is woven into the story of the illness.

I had near psychosis one year, several years ago, while taking meds for tuberculosis and ulcer and not being given enough vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 to counter the depletion caused by the TB meds. The TB meds cause liver damage. The vitamin deficiencies ?"
2020-12-28 22:15:17,We have a guy here in Lubbock with no history or drug abuse or mental health issues announced he was going to the ER to check himself in with his COVID symptoms. On the way he stopped outside a local supermarket and shot a total stranger to death who was loading groceries. Then he drove to the gas station up front and shot that up. He finally ended up at the ER where he finished off his rounds into his own car. He then proceeded towards the ER entrance where he was promptly tackled by a local off duty cop. Madness.
2020-12-28 22:28:30,"I wish every article here didn't end up derailing into an anti-Trump rant by commenters. As an epileptic bipolar woman who suffers from migraines, I have experienced brief psychotic episodes before. They were successfully controlled with antipsychotics but those are heavy duty drugs best avoided if possible. The article concerns me. Psychotic episodes are impossible to adequately describe verbally but they're a scary perpetual internal guessing game. 

You constantly ask yourself, ""Is this real or not? Is this truly happening or is it all in my head?"" Everything is very frightening because you see and hear strange things and it seems like reality but you can't tell for sure. I wear masks, socially distance, wash my hands, and use hand sanitizer religiously to try to avoid getting the virus. So far, so good."
2020-12-28 22:29:42,Still don’t want to wear a mask?
2020-12-28 22:41:29,"This sounds like anecdotes, not data.  A certain percentage of the population is going to be struck by mental illness of unknown cause every year.  Doctors look for the cause in part by taking medical histories.  

In this year, covid is going to show up in a certain percentage of medical histories, and doctors who are just look at their own case loads are as prone as the rest of us to errors of logic, of assuming that X that preceded Y must have caused Y, of confirmation bias, of ignoring all the cases that don't fit their theory.

Someone needs to do a study or statistical analysis to see if mental illnesses with no other known cause are more common in former covid patients than in patients that are not known to have had covid.  Also, they need to look to see if there was an uptick in new cases of mental illness with no known cause (other than presumed covid-related causes)."
2020-12-28 22:39:15,I blame everything on Covid now.
2020-12-28 22:46:13,"I heard anecdotally about a president who displayed psychosis following his covid infection. From what I understand, his case is incurable."
2020-12-28 22:47:28,we have a president who became significantly less in touch with reality after COVID.....
2020-12-28 22:38:34,The people who became psychotic may have been isolated. Isolation could cause psychosis. There is a reason why isolation is a harsh punishment for humans.
2020-12-28 22:48:59,These people are having delusions and can be treated very effectively and simply with homeopathic remedies.
2020-12-28 22:58:07,"As compelling as these stories sound, this seems like another instance where caution, and more investigation, is needed before ascribing the presumed cause. It's reminiscent to the conclusions anti-vaxxers make when they presume a vaccine caused autism because the disease was diagnosed not long after a vaccination. The fact is that autism tends to emerge right around the age when children get vaccinations, so the vaccination looks causal when it's merely a temporal coincidence. Similarly, many millions of people are contracting COVID and get only mild symptoms, and then a few happen to suffer the very rare, but not non-existent, emergence of psychoses. It's natural to associate the two, but it's a long way from proving causality."
2020-12-28 22:58:54,"I had Covid in March, and severe anxiety for months afterward. I thought it was because I was going back to work after a long absence and was rusty performing my job tasks. (I was a long-hauler who returned to work after 6 weeks but wasn't really well for about three months.) I had difficulty remembering how to perform my job. Because I had mild Covid symptoms, I thought I was only slightly affected - I've gone to work with worse cold symptoms. But I had huge fatigue, and I did suffer from vertigo, headaches, and loss of smell and taste. Maybe more was going on than I realized. I feel better now, though I feel continued fatigue, have insomnia, and need a lot of sleep. Is any of this related? I guess we'll find out in the future. Wear a mask folks and avoid this virus."
2020-12-28 23:02:47,"Several years ago I got bacterial meningitis. After being treated with antibiotics and put into an induced coma I recovered completely after almost two months in the hospital. While I was a patient though, I had ""hallucinations"" which were similar to the ones described here. Interesting what an inflamed brain cooks up."
2020-12-28 23:07:20,"Reading this article, and several others detailing long-term and debilitating brain fog and fatigue from Covid, it is clear to me that young people, who have their whole lives ahead of them, need to be prioritized for vaccines, ahead of people in their 70’s and beyond. I understand why people in nursing homes need to be prioritized. They’re in congregant settings, where they can’t protect themselves. And we don’t want hospitals to be (more) overwhelmed. But many people in their teens & twenties live in congregant settings, too, such as dorms & student apartments. We need to protect our young."
2020-12-28 23:13:21,"The toll for the amount of stress a person goes through especially when their body is working overtime to physically fight the virus I cannot imagine when you add in all the non-medical stress.

Having been witness to other forms of psychological issues caused by many factors in a person who is relatively physically healthy, these issues may cascade to their families."
2020-12-28 23:15:38,"Patients with certain cancers, even occult lesions not yet detectable by imaging or chemical markers that will later be found in the patients blood, can develop limbic encephalitis, an autoimmune condition where our antibodies to these cancer cells also trigger other immune cells to attack nerve cells in the limbic system of the brain. Patients very abruptly manifest neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from personality change, mood dysregulation and psychotic symptoms to memory impairment, confusion and changes in sleep-wake cycles. 

Perhaps SARS-CoV-2 virus is directly, if slowly, damaging brain cells or these delayed psychiatric and neuropsychiatric manifestations could be caused by autoimmune processes gone awry."
2020-12-28 22:56:54,"Yet another thing that the, “it’s just a flu” crowd doesn’t know about or discuss with their google epidemiology background."
2020-12-28 23:05:31,"After reading this, I am so glad to live in a country with great, available health care. Oh, right."
2020-12-28 22:56:03,"It is not true to say that the onset of schizophrenia is only in adolescence.  Paranoid conditions (those most likely associated with violence) appear later . . . In the thirties, forties.   Furthermore, without a matched sample of late onset psychosis without Covid, how can one posit a biological cause in these cases?  Deadly external stressors can and do give rise to psychotic symptoms not just PTSD-like manifestations.  NYT has been putting forth too many exaggerated stories over the past four years.  It is difficult enough to discern reality in everyday life without mainstream journalism becoming eccentric itself.  People are frightened.  Some suffer from psychotic anxiety when their world is turned upside down and some suffer more from neurotic anxiety.  Some experience a more fixed form of delusional system with longer lasting paranoid beliefs like conspiracies and some will have acute psychotic reactions which are dramatic but brief and some will have formed enough mental flexibility over the years to use hardship as the impetus for creative work.  Let us hope that the later outcome prevails."
2020-12-28 23:29:11,"Rare but real. If you want to see something similar to this read ""My Brain on Fire"" Susanah Cahalan. Antibodies to NMDA, a neurotransmitter"
2020-12-28 23:29:53,"Other illnesses that can cause mental health issues include strep, syphilis and Lyme. My daughter has Lyme-related autoimmune issues that cause emotional and behavioral issues. Treating the underlying infection has changed a lot, but the mental health issues still come and go. For those Ibuprofen can help. Some have used IVIG transfusions. SSRIs and ADHD stimulants failed for us, but these other remedies have worked. Maybe those treating covid’s psychiatric impacts should try treating the remaining autoimmune/physical illness?"
2020-12-28 23:29:16,"What about treating psychosis or covid with medical cannabis or psychedelics? Oh, they’re illegal."
2020-12-28 23:45:14,I’m a psychiatry resident and have seen a few  patients with unusual onsets of psychosis since the pandemic began. This emerging data indicates that we should be screening for past covid infection or symptoms (patients may not have been formally diagnosed). This data also supports theory of chronic inflammation as an etiology for psychotic disorders
2020-12-29 00:13:42,"My 87 year old mother's dementia became much worse and we assumed that was all there was to it.   Her dementia, though, takes the form of delusions or possible hallucinations that she did not have before COVID.  She believes she is in the army and the residents who she lives with are soldiers and the staff officers.  She called me recently saying she was in the middle of a battle and as the commander she needed troop re-enforcements.   Is this dementia or psychosis?  Ten months ago she lived on her own."
2020-12-29 00:18:19,"Since these cases seem to only be appearing in ""younger"" people -- 30s to 50s -- I wonder if this also is a contributing factor to any increase in depression and suicides that many people are blaming on lockdowns? Perhaps at least some of those people had asymptomatic or mild Covid (as younger people do) and the increase in their depression and suicidal ideation was actually caused by the virus rather than being stuck at home."
2020-12-29 00:18:24,"Large number of COVID Patients who get through hospitalizations and invasive treatment also most likely are mad at their sudden miserable situation they find themselves in. Basically, it is like freedom and paradise lost and helpless sets in. Such patients recover when they return to the life they knew. So circumstantial psychotic symptoms are to be expected during the difficult times that a COVID patient endures. 

The best way forward is to get the vaccine as soon as it is available and never get COVID. There are so many variables that most physicians and specialists don't have answers. It is appalling that some elderly about 75 are getting a run around about getting a vaccine even though CDC guidelines have given top priority to those above 75 and front line workers are top priority. I was totally appalled when my 96 year old aunt living in Memphis, TN has not received the vaccine to date. I don't even want to imagine what will happen if she does get COVID infected. So far she has done well with staying away from her own kids and grand kids. But long should she endure the fear of COVID. Even after she gets the 2 doses of immunizations, she will acquire protective immunity after a month or more of getting the first injection. Was this what WARP SPEED was meant to be?"
2020-12-29 00:39:52,"ICU, Intensive Care Unit Psychosis, is well known, especially among those having been intubated or placed in a medical coma, no matter what the underlying illness was."
2020-12-29 00:27:41,It must have happened to Trump!
2020-12-29 00:30:34,"Well if the president is any indication,  anybody on the edge already can go full blown out of control.  They should call the syndrome TRUMP ELECTION LOSS SYNDROME.  Or TELS."
2020-12-29 00:38:05,Well this explains a lot.
2020-12-29 00:40:21,And plenty more people are suffering from a variety of mental health issues due to the lockdowns.
2020-12-28 23:45:41,"The silver lining to these horrible outcomes will be greater insight into the immune system's influence on psychiatric pathology. Future treatments will be immunological.

2020-12-29 00:17:16,"I'm convinced that there must be some truth to the hypothesis that Covid-19 contributes to psychosis. Covid-19 has ravaged the GOP and now 70% of its members have delusions about dead people voting, machines switching votes from one candidate to another and other paranoid fantasies."
2020-12-29 00:39:57,Does this explain president Trump’s behavior?
2020-12-29 00:22:23,"We seem to know so little about this virus.  World leaders have been infected.  It’s terrifying.

Remember early on when people pooh-poohed the danger and compared it to seasonal flu?

Wear a mask.  Please."
2020-12-28 23:45:27,"Problems are best solved before they become overwhelming.

We should be setting up a massive, and well organized, Covid research center.

I doubt that we are doing that now.  Biden doesn't hate science, so we might have a chance of getting it done.

If you search hard enough, and deep enough, it is likely that you may even solve problems that you were not your primary targets.

Being proud of ""Not Knowing"" is a very negative trait."
2020-12-28 23:51:33,This could explain Trump's behavior at the first presidential debate.
2020-12-29 00:01:00,Is it possible that they are reacting to medications and therapeutics that they received related to Covid?  As a person who is hyper sensitive to drugs and chemicals I always look to that as the first culprit.
2020-12-29 00:21:12,"Could this be the case for other patients with psychosis?  That it is due to a virus?  It makes one think, there but for the grace of God go I."
2020-12-29 00:14:28,If it's this rare of a medical occurrence perhaps you can explain the urgency to put above the fold in the Reader Center for those of us less prone to panic.
2020-12-29 00:44:58,"Dr Gouli said ""Nothing was working.""  Considering the psychosis was the result of an illness or immune response, did they consider trying something to tone down the immune response?  Something like steroids instead of psych drugs."
2020-12-28 22:33:54,Trump supporters who already live in an alternate reality going to super- spreader events and then suffering further mental issues post COVID . One can only imagine the consequences.
2020-12-29 00:47:28,"It’s likely a parainfectious syndrome, of which there are many. They body produces antibodies to fight off the virus - which it does - but those antibodies also attack/ injure parts of the person’s own body. Guillan-Barre is a well known post-infectious autoimmune syndrome that effects the peripheral nerves; same thing can occur with the central nervous system... If I were the treating physician, I’d try steroids, IVIG, or plasma exchange."
2020-12-29 00:48:22,"This sounds like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.  Read ""Brain on Fire"" for a good case study.  It's treatable.  This is also similar to PANS/PANDAS in kids."
2020-12-29 00:55:30,Sounds like Trump and Giuliani.
2020-12-29 01:24:54,Could also be that a dormant Lyme infection became active after the stress of Covid. Neuro-Lyme can cause mental illness symptoms or brain fog and memory problems. Lyme is spreading quickly and Long Island is endemic.
2020-12-29 01:36:10,"Then there is the case of DT, a 74 year old man from New York who has recently been living in Washington for work.  He contracted Covid in October and had relatively  old symptoms, but was hospitalized and exposed to every possible treatment.  He either recovered spontaneously or responded to treatment.  He was released from the hospital after four days, rested at home for an equal amount of time, and then returned to work.

Never psychologically strong, he grew increasingly delusional, paranoid, and withdrawn. Everyone in America with the exception of some 74 million of his friends believed DT should be hospitalized but he remained at large, making insane decisions with dire consequences for many people he did not even know.

Outpatient treatment has focused on golf and poor diet in lavish surroundings but so far have shown no promise."
2020-12-29 01:58:01,What else does anyone need to be convinced we need a national referendum on health care and Medicare for All?
2020-12-29 02:01:03,"Its known that some types of infections can cause a temporary insanity that seems like a hallucinatory dementia.  My husband had this after a urinary tract infection, and it didn't go away until the infection was cured."
2020-12-29 02:13:10,"My experience was not as severe as those cited, but after coming home from the hospital, I questioned what was real, and did not believe that what I was experiencing was.  Everything in my home environment, I felt, was not real, but that I or some entity, was making it up.  The furnace was especially troubling, I felt it was running for no reason.  Neighbors had to come over, a service person was called, and he declared it to be normal.  I am by myself.  The next day I started playing music from my phone in my earbuds, and for some reason, that seemed to bring me back to reality.  I have never had any issue of mental illness or problems within that realm.  It was indeed scary."
2020-12-29 02:22:29,"Thank you for highlighting the immune system effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a topic of extreme importance that has been largely bypassed by the mainstream press and medical literature. Understanding the relationship between the coronavirus and the immune system will be the key to developing a safe vaccine to stop this pandemic.

The viral spike protein generates an immune response that generates thousands of antibodies against the virus. Only a very small percentage of these neutralize the virus to prevent infection. The non-neutralizing antibodies act as carriers for the virus to enter white blood cells called macrophages and neutrophils which are cleaners of the bloodstream, sweeping up immune complexes (antibodies attached to antigens) and cellular debris. When the virus enters these inflammatory cells riding on the antibodies, it acts like a Trojan horse and infects the immune cells furthering the infection. This leads to the antibody dependent enhancement of disease that has been widely described not only for viruses but  also for certain vaccines, including RSV and Dengue vaccines.

The immune related cardiovascular and neurological complications of COVID could also occur with the current RNA and DNA vaccines that all express the entire spike protein and generate strong immunological responses - some so strong upon booster vaccination that people are incapacitated with chills and fever. 

Please keep reporting on this important topic."
2020-12-29 03:02:33,"It’s important to note for anyone reading this experiencing intrusive thoughts, and distress from these intrusive thoughts or images— that OCD could also be the cause and requires a different treatment protocol including Exposure and Response Prevention therapy, and SSRIs (not antipsychotics). For anyone experiencing distressing intrusive thoughts around harm, sexuality or contamination— please consider an OCD evaluation. The diagnosis saved my life when I thought I was going through a psychotic episode."
2020-12-29 03:04:04,"One of the patients was convinced that her smartphone was tracking her? 

She’s not wrong about that. That one is not paranoia. It's reality."

2020-12-29 03:13:03,Wonder if the Nashville bomber had covid and then came these kind of symptoms. We'll never know.
2020-12-29 01:09:03,"Doing it again NY Times! Broadcasting highly unusual statistical outlier cases to frighten people and drive readership. Sensational, shameful reporting that collectively paints a false picture for readers. Tell the truth: For the overwhelming majority of people, COVID-19 is a minor illness. Hard to believe, given the reporting, but, nevertheless, the truth."
2020-12-29 01:45:11,"I had “Covid-Lite” in October.  I now wake every morning at 0200 AM.  I’m 70 and used to wake in the night to urinate.  Not now, I wake to stare at the ceiling.  Maybe related to isolation from the national quarantine tension, or who knows what.  Beats me!"
2020-12-29 01:45:04,"11.4 vaccine doses delivered to hospital sites, only 2.1 injections done, according to CDC website. When are Americans going to get fed up and demand competency and a rapid vaccination program, like Germany and Israel are doing. The CDC’s own statistics show there is something seriously wrong with the US vaccination program. Nine million doses sitting in storage, not administered, adds up to one thing only: mass casualties.  Aren’t NYT readers disgusted with the hopeless pace of US vaccinations? Say something! Speak out online!!!"

2020-12-29 02:17:33,"The NYT story 8 months ago of Dr Lorna Breen, an Emergency Room Director who caught COVID and had no pre-COVID psychiatric history, subsequently became severely depressed and committed suicide. Her story may also have represented a post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis, a disorder that can mimic any “psychiatric” disorder."
2020-12-29 02:14:13,This could well explain Trump's increasing detachment from reality.
2020-12-29 02:14:36,"In this pandemic there can be a delicate balance between tuning in enough for safety and tuning out enough for sanity. Especially given how we have been expected to wade thru endless fights over how the country will protect its citizens during a health emergency.

So you have to wonder: If you add personal family and financial pressures to the mix, it seems surprising more people are not floundering around in the deeper ends of human pain and suffering.  

What might we call this collective ability to stay ""on track"", or at least ""near enough to the track""? Covid Resilience??  If so I celebrate your psycho-emotional survival to date!"
2020-12-29 01:38:14,"Is it just us or have you also suspected or worried that every sneeze, cough, shortness of breath, etc. might be symptoms of Covid, no matter how many allergies or cold you’ve had in the past. If I sneeze and cough I immediately think Covid. Can’t breathe... Covid, not my asthma. 

What I’m not so eloquently trying to say is when I hear hoof beats, I’m thinking zebras not cows."
2020-12-29 02:37:56,"Here’s my naive question. De novo psychosis in middle aged people is rare but is not totally unheard of. What the chance that out of the 19+ million cases in the USA, there will be some of these cases that arise by chance and unrelated to Covid? Seems pretty high that you’d have a handful of such cases. And only those patients with this psychosis would be reported to the news/scientific journal due to confirmation bias."
2020-12-29 01:51:42,Guess that explains DJT's actions!
2020-12-29 03:42:37,"Be sure to differentiate two categories of patients:  those who were intubated versus those who were not.  Another significant categorization:  elderly versus not elderly.

I suggest this because psychosis is already known to occur in certain categories of patients who have undergone some form of acute stress.  One example is postanesthetic psychosis, which occurs commonly in elderly patients who have undergone general anesthesia.  Another is post-traumatic psychosis, an aspect of shell shock or PTSD.  So watch out for age and instrumentation as cofactors.  Also try to differentiate the possible effects of hypoxia versus viral cytopathic effect."
2020-12-29 03:50:06,"I'm a retired neurologist. Covid is the new Great Imitator, replacing syphilis. It causes a necrotizing encephalopathy=death of brain tissue, probably an encephalitis, and post-encephalitic psychosis.

Not only is the immune system suspect, the virus is known to be in the blood vessel lining and has been found in other organs. Covid affects smell, and the olfactory bulb is nearby, with connections that involve the amygdala and the hippocampus. Not only does all this have implications for psychosis, but also for brain fog, and a host of other disorders categorized as ""long haul"" covid. 

Bottom line: 
-Covid is not a live normally afterwards-die dichotomy.
-I suspect there are many who have had Covid, been assumed to have gotten over it, who would say they are not normal ever since they became ill.
-There are and will be a enormous numbers with various disabilities of different organ-systems, including the brain.
-Those who suffer from these post-Covid problems are often in mid-life, not old.
-We don't know what works for treatment. We may find something, we may not, and we know neither how long the disorders will last nor whether they are permanent. 

If that isn't enough motivation to do whatever possible to avoid infection, I'm not sure I understand what would be."
2020-12-29 04:02:21,"While it is clearly established than many people who have had a COVID infection have been symptomless, it is less clear that what constitutes symptomless beyond the lack of fever, severe headaches and the other familiar ways that the disease presents itself.
We look for answers to why it has been such a crazy year. But is it possible that there are medical, and not political causes for the astounding and abnormal divisions that have fractured society?"
2020-12-29 04:02:49,I work in psychiatry. This matches what my colleagues who work in hospital settings are reporting.
2020-12-29 04:26:18,"Would be interesting to see if the frequency of psychotic patients who had been previously treated for Covid19 is (statistically) significantly higher than those who have not.  I imagine this is very difficult to do, what with all of the factors that must be controlled for, not to mention gathering the data.  Hopefully the anecdotes mentioned in this story will prompt such an undertaking."
2020-12-29 04:27:53,"My dad 78 got Covid in WI, had mild respiratory symptoms but was/is experiencing these similar symptoms, vertigo, feet tingling, headaches, he could eat. Not sure about weird thoughts though but I'm going to call him tomorrow and ask him.  My mother had mild symptoms but fared better, headaches, couldn't eat.  My younger sister also a COVID survivor had memory issues. I think she still does and this has been over two months."
2020-12-29 04:29:42,"As a physician myself with special training in behavioral changes due to brain injuries, I believe the article overlooks a couple of  important points.

It appears that many of the patients described experienced visual hallucinations.  These type of hallucinations are rarely due to a primary mental disorder such as schizophrenia so virtually always indicate the presence of an underlying medical disorder as the causative factor. 

Also with regard to possible underlying etiologies, one has to wonder about the possibility that infection could have led to a seizure disorder.  Visual hallucinations are a common symptom of partial complex seizures.  Also antidepressants and antipsychotics can actually make these worse as they can lower seizure threshold.  I wonder if the doctors treating the physical therapist whose symptoms worsened with these medications considered this possibility.  Also, there is a type of hallucinations that occur as people are falling asleep or waking up that can appear very real that are also frequently associated with these seizures. Another common symptom is impulse dyscontrol resulting in unexplained violent episodes.

Unfortunately, few psychiatrists or neurologists have much training in recognizing these seizures and often misdiagnose and mismanage patients who suffer from them."

Additionally, many sleep medications, commonly given to patients in hospital and after hospitalization (which disrupts normal sleep cycles) have suicidal side effects and other psychiatric disturbances."

2020-12-29 08:15:29,"COVID may well be a disease of the blood vessels, specifically the lining. Bleeds into the brain are a likely side-effect. Look it up. 

Our focus on deaths and remarkable recoveries and low death rates ignores or minimizes the damage being done. ""Long-haulers"", COVID-toe, etc. are examples of the widespread damage done by the disease. A 60 minutes report on autopsies of those who had COVID and died later showed a great many had many small brain bleeds damaging many small local areas. 

Getting COVID is life-altering far more often than is commonly believed. The fraction of COVID patients who have long-term health effects is estimated from 11 to 85% of all who get the disease. Clearly, this wide a range shows only that we do not know (and are not looking very hard) at the damage being done to the survivors. Even the lower range of the estimate means millions in the US are already bearing lifetime scars from the disease. 

Our policies need to include consideration of the long-term damage--and the urgent need to better understand how bad it is."

Honor roll student, extremely social, competition cheerleader for ten years, caught in July at HS graduation, tested positive in August.  Quarantined for 14 days as recommended, only had a headache for two days and mild sore throat.  Wound up with two hospital admissions for manic and delusional behavior.  Discharged on Risperdal.  He came home and completed his online classes and is attempting to go back in January."
2020-12-29 12:15:08,"Can the psychosis be extended to criminal activity as well? Have any of the Police Departments done any psychological screening of those detained  to see if 1) they have COVID-19 (or one of the strains)? and 2) The reason for their criminal behavior is a part of their psychosis or if they are expressing their psychosis through criminal behavior? 

The rise of crimes, could possibly be an indicator of not just the stressors of living with restrictions and loss of jobs (""idle hands"" metaphor comes to mind), but also of this psychosis during COVID recovery.

Of all the COVID-19 testing that's been done, has any agency done a follow-up with those testing positive to check their mental state? Not likely as states are overwhelmed with treating the sickest of the COVID patients. Those in the right age for mental disorders already at nursing home facilities would be a good place to start (restricted environment for sampling), but considering most of those patients could have been already experiencing psychoses of a form (pre-COVID) like dementia, there may be no difference seen by staffs unless they really know the patients there. My wife was an RN in the nursing home field and really got to know her patients and could tell you when something ""changed"" about them causing distress (medication imbalance, infections, family problems, etc.). She's an autism behavioral therapist now; a lot of the old age things she saw are similar in kids with mental growth issues."

He's doing well now, but doctors were completely puzzled by it all and told us it was possibly Covid related, but they were concerned about the uncertainty"

But after getting very sick with what was certainly COVID19, the family member broke out of the meds and experienced delusion for months, and is only now 'waking up' out of that experience.  I suppose it will take weeks and months to have more data on patients already suffering from mental illness and the toll COVID has taken on them."
2020-12-29 12:49:43,"Case reports are a first step in identifying associations between an exposure and outcome. They are low on the “pyramid of evidence”  in terms of scientific rigor, but case reports are a starting point for more rigorous analysis.  

Several weeks ago the Times reported cases of tooth loss following COVID.  I spoke with an epidemiologist, who also happens to have trained as a dentist, and the consensus in her peer group is that the timeframe between covid and tooth loss is too short to show a causal link.  It is more likely that people who have experienced tooth loss have underlying (perhaps undiagnosed) periodontal disease. COVID may have exacerbated the periodontal disease, but there’s no evidence at this point that COVID on its own is a direct cause.

Case reports have been helpful in identifying  “long-haul” symptoms as a possible outcome, but further study is necessary. 

We should use theses case reports to note the possibility of an association between COVID and psychosis and test the hypothesis."

2020-12-29 12:45:01,"Dr. Goueli is quoted in this article with, “people with psychosis don’t have an insight that they’ve lost touch with reality.”
Here’s a case study the researchers should be looking at: a 74-year-old man whose underlying medical condition includes obesity and high blood pressure, narcissism and cognitive issues that include an inability to discern truth from fiction, illusions of grandeur and high paranoia, lack of empathy and self-awareness. He has also displayed a limited capacity to learn new words or pronounce familiar ones (“origin” comes to mind.) The man is now saying he won a recent presidential election and is calling for civil unrest to restore him to power and is attempting to upend the constitution and destroy anyone in his path to that end. 
Some of the other case studies in this article illustrated that  patients displayed violent fantasies in order to protect themselves or their loved ones. How tragic if any of these people had not been hospitalized in time before they could do real damage."

We saw the one work quickly with Trump, and now a long list of others with government ranking, and the rich and famous. 

But low and behold there seems to be a hang-up somewhere along the line for many of the rest of us. Amounts available? Most hasn’t been used. Why not mass production, and organization of facilities for distribution? You get sick- go to get treatment quickly just like the rich and famous. All these lives being lost and mostly all we hear is vaccine- vaccine- vaccine! And- it takes time, and we hear all these predictions of darker days ahead. Stop predicting dark days it doesn’t help.

Lyme's Disease comes to mind with similar stories.

Although horrible, these are relative rare events.

What is more important is to weigh pills, treatments, vaccines re the good vs the bad.

If Covid vaccines prove as good as they do in the trials and have the usual side effects I will take it because the good greatly outweighs the bad.

I stopped taking the flu shot several yrs. ago because I either caught the flu in the office or the shot gave me a bad flu like reaction (I know, I know medical purists, the flu shot can't give you the flu.)

After reading that in some yrs. the vaccine is as effective with seniors as low as 14% and from personal experience I know people who got the shot were as equal to get or not get the flu as people who did not get it, I decided to stop making big pharmaceutical rich and stopped getting the shot.

I have not have the flu in ten yrs., not because I am super human but did things that are much more effective than the shot, social distance, washing hands and now wearing a mask especially in the winter."

I’m 25 and contracted covid a few months ago. My symptoms of covid were mild including headaches, short term loss of smell and change of smell long term.
I recently experienced a psychotic episode with delusions I was being chased by persons with guns (friends at a holiday gathering). While experiencing that fear I also was aware I wasn’t right and sought help.

Perhaps the real shocker to all this is how much focus the doctors/the article puts on looking for neurological/brain damage and not any mention of deeper psycho-social fears. Prescribing anti-psychotic meds to such cases seems like a wildly off approach and I highly doubt it works."
2020-12-29 16:12:59,"They need to see if Azithromycin was prescribed to these patients as an antibiotic. Many Covid patients get prescribed this as a “catch-all”.

This is a synthetic antibiotic that is causing psychosis in patients at varying degrees."

2020-12-29 16:30:09,"The history of brain function, consciousness, and religious belief are filled with anecdotes about shared delusion.  It seems possible that COVID 19 itself alters consciousness in its attack on the human body.  Is it possible that COVID 19 affects the Vagus Nerve in ways which disconnects a COVID 19 sufferer from their own reality leaving their system of neurotransmitters open to primal fears, imagery they've seen on TV, or imagery perceived by others in their vicinity?   I have read accounts of a COVID 19 survivor who while hospitalized, believed himself to be participating in production of Hamilton, and, another reported by a priest, who believed he'd at a party where he got into a casket.  The combination of immobility, drugs and COVID itself perhaps creates a protective, dissociative neurological response to attack and treatment. Our brains are wholistic information processing entities who may pick up on shared energy via serotonin, perhaps.  (Read about grasshopper/locust swarming.)  I highly recommend Carl Sagan's ""Demon Haunted World,""  Judith Hooper and Dick Teresi's ""The 3 Pound Universe,"" and Joseph J. Fins ""Rights Come to Mind"" as leisure reading during COVID isolation. In response to trauma and danger, human consciousness can become compartmentalized.   Individual group response manifested by religious leaders, medical specialists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists is certainly compartmentalized."

I have experienced nothing like it before or since, and I have no family history of psychotic illness.  It was ultimately determined that I had a steroid-induced psychotic delirium resulting from the huge doses of steroids required to prevent lethal brain swelling.  I heard no mention in this article of corticosteroids, although they are fairly routinely given to COVID-19 patients.  Has anyone studied the steroid doses or blood levels in these patients?"
2020-12-29 15:04:51,"It is also important to consider the role of the menopause transition in new onset psychosis in midlife women. The second peak of new onset psychosis occurs in women only in the 40s and is attributable to hormonal changes in the perimenopause. Clinically, it’s important to apply gold stand criteria to properly stage women’s reproductive status as perimenopausal or postmenopausal using STRAW 10 criteria (Harlow, 2015 JCEM). In such cases there is evidence from randomized placebo controlled trials that estrogen therapy can improve both positive and negative symptoms (Weiser 2019. JAMA Psychiatry). One wonders if COVID history and menopausal hormonal change might interact to trigger new onset psychosis in some cases. Perhaps estrogen therapy could be tried in midlife female patients with a history of COVID and a series of case studies could be published."

I woke up the next day in restraints and totally lucid.  I figured out how to get out of the restraints and then put them back on and rang the bell.  No one ever said anything to me about it.

Our child experienced this nightmare when she was 5 years old. Often triggered by Strep, in her case it was triggered by Lyme. The New England PANS/PANDAS Association led us to a correct diagnosis and treatment, excellent doctors (out of network), a Moleculera Labs positive Cunningham Panel and IVIG infusions (insurance covers because she has a selective immune deficiency.) She is now in her twenties and doing well.

Moleculera Labs website:
“Parents will describe children with PANS as overcome by a ‘ferocious’ onset of obsessive thoughts, compulsive rituals and overwhelming fears."" Dr. Susan Swedo, NIMH

""Exposure to any number of infectious agent(s) triggers a misdirected immune reaction, where antibodies attack a portion of the brain, causing inflammation. The inflammation, in turn, causes an abrupt onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics, severe eating restriction, anxiety, ADHD-type behaviors, personality changes, emotional lability, and sleep disturbances.""
 
If there is a silver lining to this tremendous suffering it is that the CDC might finally recognize and address the chronic & unusual symptoms most Lyme patients experience which mirror what has been described here.

Maybe there is an important special mechanism for covid alterations of mental status- especially causing hallucinations & delusions. But the observation of all sorts of bizarre mental experience in a delirium is not at all new.
Every medical student learns a long list of medical conditions that elicit psychotic symptoms, fluctuating level of consciousness- often secondary to fever, steroids, infection, dehydration, etc.

Medical science seems to have no idea how to effectively treat this. We have finally found a doctor who knew what to look for, found it, and is working toward getting the immune system under control. Our diagnosis is in a class called paraneoplastic disorders. 

There are other receptor antibodies besides nmda that can cause these responses. NMDA is getting the attention right now, which is great, but there needs to be greater awareness of these conditions. Especially when people don’t respond to psychiatric medications. 

Not sure if we will ever fully recover."
2020-12-29 22:23:18,"High fever and a previous neurological pathology, possibly undetected, can cause schizophrenic-like symptoms. It's called affective schizophrenic disorder. The low fever described as a possible symptom of having the virus is not why Covid-19 patients are in the ICU. They have very high fevers in addition to difficulty breathing. 

I once double-pneumonia with a history of multiple sclerosis. I began having visual hallucinations and waking nightmares. I ended my two-week medical stay at NYU in a month-long lockdown psych ward, diagnosed with affective schizophrena and though the visual hallucinations ceased auditory hallucinations, worsened by high-dose IV ciproflaxin (I'm allergic to most every antibiotic) began and continue to this day.

High fevers damage the brain but they can and should be brought down immediately. Remember Libby Zion? An old-fashioned ice bath might have saved her life."
2020-12-29 23:04:14,"Brain inflammation has been previously implicated in paranoid schizophrenia.  That fits the pattern with brain fog, severe fatigue and ache, and post-exertional malaise which are also common symptoms associated with neuro-inflammation."
2020-12-30 00:35:10,"Maybe we should all take a look at how we would be covered medically for a psychotic episode!  I bet insurance would only cover 2 weeks. In the old days the state stepped up and provided care. I don't think this is the case anymore. Not that you would want to be there, but back in the day, we took good care of people. So what is a family to do it a loved one can't be taken care of at home?  We will find out what families with members who are severely mentally ill, have to cope with.  We should all know this, and do something about it. The drugs don't always work."

She also works with Dr. Yolken and was the LEAD author on a study of coronavirus immunoreactivity among individuals with recent onset psychotic symptoms. I understand the NYT reserves the term ""Dr."" for those with MDs, DDSs or DVM's, but in this article that quotes nearly all men this casual reference to Dr. Severance is glaringly inappropriate."
2020-12-29 22:00:24,"Psychosis can be caused by fault in dopamine sensor, in otherwise healthy brain. Fortunately, quite manageable. Ser9Gly variant of dopamine DRD3 auto-receptor is quite prevalent (20% I think in Asian & Caucasian populations) with missing adenylation site. When sensor detects out-of-range excursion in dopamine [happens all the time during hospitalization], circuit triggers wrong path causing arachidonic acid cascade instead of correction in dopamine.  Short term neuroleptics plus OTC meds for allergic cascade are effective for late onset good outcome schizophrenics. Stabilize, monitor, intervene again at next hormonal crisis. At least, that's been my life story. A physicist."

2020-12-29 20:13:14,So many people who refuse to see Covid for what it is --- a true threat in so many ways.  Their refusals to wear masks and socially distance is heartless.  To knowingly spread this disease is a crime.
2020-12-30 01:07:52,ICU Psychosis is not uncommon.  I experienced it while undergoing a transplant.  Post-surgical psychosis is also not uncommon among seniors and can tip someone who has borderline-dementia over the edge into full-blown dementia.  This happened to an older friend of mine.  So severe psychotic reactions to serious illness and treatment ought not to be unexpected.

2020-12-30 01:53:29,"We know that the coronavirus can and does get into the brain. Like so many other mysteries, why it affects people so differently is not clear. 

I am hopeful that this article will increase awareness of this reality. Sometimes the connection is obvious, e.g. when my elderly mother was diagnosed with COVID-19 and still very ill, she started ""seeing"" horrible things. It was almost unbearable to her because it was constant and the content was so disturbing. Fortunately, she survived COVID-19 and this passed, but her cognition continues to be affected in odd ways, i.e. not typical of the common dementias.  

What I fear is that people may be misdiagnosed because  post-COVID syndrome may not be recognized as such. For example, young adults who have very mild cases of COVID-19 might be misdiagnosed as schizophrenic because they are at the typical age of onset. The same could be true of the elderly, i.e. the assumption that what is wrong is the onset of dementia, rather than post-COVID-19 syndrome. 

On the other hand, perhaps this wouldn't be misdiagnosis. Perhaps, with aggressive research, we might learn more about why some people develop schizophrenia and dementia. In the cases of both illnesses, it has been hypothesized that viruses or other environmental agents may trigger the onset of symptoms in the genetically vulnerable.

It is important that we study this dimension of COVID-19 even if it appears to be rare - it may not be as rare as we think."
2020-12-30 02:30:24,"My most debilitating and lingering symptoms with COVID-19 were brain fog and shortness of breath.

I am truly sorry for those who suffered from psychosis."

2021-01-05 15:17:13,"I am in no way a clinical or medical savvy person and therefore might be conjecturing nonsense but reading this article I cant help but thinking about the vaccine.
As the purpose of the vaccine is to trigger a response from the immune system so that it could defend itself against the virus in the future, would it be possible that these long term 'infections' could be created by it at the same time ?"
2021-01-05 15:16:40,"Psychoses are incredibly complex phenomena, and poorly understood. The fact that a handful of the millions of people who have had COVID have presented with new, possibly transient psychosis in the weeks or months after mild cases seems most likely to be a random correlation. The pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have taken a terrible toll on mental health, and the cases described here are incredibly infrequent and are—according to the doctors interviewed—quite inconsistent. That says to me that claims of causation should be met with real skepticism until more compelling evidence is forthcoming. Of course, that sort of scientific rigor doesn't lend itself to fear-driven clickbait like this and dubious reports of ""long COVID"" which, at least as of yet, lack scientific support."
2021-01-05 16:58:12,"i found this article about this emerging medical mystery very fascinating, but also very frightening.
a coworker of mine committed suicide last July after contracting and recovering from COVID-19. it was very shocking and unexpected.
i can't say it was psychosis - but we can't forget the possibility of long-term effects with a disease so new. we must extend compassion to those who are currently ill and we must continue to protect each other from this disease."
2020-12-29 18:44:46,"All of the focus here is on the medical community and the patients' physical symptoms. Has anyone considered that this may be energetic, and that the cause may be something more along the lines of entity invasion (aka demonic possession)? Medical doctors are not trained to look at biofoelds, meridians, or chakras, which may be where the causes of these symptoms are attached. Perhaps a view from a more Eastern type of medicine should be explored, or something in the realm of Energy Medicine. Western medicine, although beneficial and scientifically proven in many areas, is not the final word on healing. When a person is in low frequencies of vibration, like emotionally below the level of Neutrality (on the Hawkin's Scale of Consciousness) which vibrates at a level of 250, they are experiencing anything from anger to shame, creating what may described as ""chinks in their armor"" which is where low vibrational energies can enter the human system. If detected and verified, these can be easily removed by a trained energy healing practitioner, and often prescription drugs are not necessary as a form of treatment for something that is pretty much unknown anyway, resulting in making the patient a form of experiment. When a person is experiencing something as dreaded and unknown at the COVID19 virus, which has been surrounded in fear since it was first mentioned, it seems likely that they would be in the lower vibrational frequencies of fear, thus becoming vulnerable to such invasions."

This reminds me of the real-life Amityville horror house (112 Ocean Ave., now 108 Ocean Ave.) — where Ronald DeFeo Jr., murdered his entire family after hearing voices in the home to kill them. The couple that moved in a year later (unaware of the murders) experienced 28 days of crazy paranormal activity that became the book/movie Amityville Horror. Amityville is a small town of pop. 9,439.

I live in Bogota, Colombia - no local newspaper has reported such cases nor have I heard thru my friends.

Even this article reports no cases out of any parts of the globe other an USA or some parts of Europe.

This makes me think that as some below point out - may have more to do with Wuhan medications. 

Also, the general paranoia and fear mongering by high level officials including Faucci - may contribute to some of this psychosis.

I know for sure if some of these patients have financial problems or work issues - they can get overwhelmed by Wuhan - if not their own condition but just a general sense of fear around them.

Also, I think all this fear mongering and oxtymoronically termed ""social distancing"" - some patients might feel ostracized by their own families for fear of catching Wuhan.

Perhaps, like other medical publications - some of these stories should be peer reviewed before publication."

2021-01-06 04:16:07,"After a tough ordeal with Covid last March, I attributed ongoing daily headaches, fatigue and brain fog to the storm’s aftermath - and stayed optimistic for a healthy recovery. Reality was that my brain had started slowly swelling from a vessel tear (no other explanation but Covid).  It took a good 8-10 weeks of slow bleeding for the alarms to go off. From a fit, athletic mid-40’s to dragging myself around like a stroke patient.  The day family rushed me to ER, I couldn’t even hold a pencil to write my name. I was in imminent danger of seizures/coma.  CT scan revealed a Sub Dural Hematoma i.e. swelling on both sides of my brain, severe enough to shift the mid-center.   After a procedure to drain the fluid accumulation I was prescribed steroids to mitigate risks.  Those 2 weeks in June were esp. scary as I dealt with very painful headaches - was in and out of ER and admitted twice.  I’ll skip details but I’m guessing it was either the steroids OR post brain trauma effect that kicked off the paranoia (voices, conspiracies etc) followed by mania (grandiose illusions, insomnia, uncontrollable chatter, irritation, mood swings) for days.  I had never experienced anything like it.  4 months later, I am fighting incessant anxiety, disrupted sleep and lacking my natural vitality and optimism.  Regardless, taking it a day at a time and hopeful about the future. I decided to share my ordeal after seeing how many found this article unfounded. Hope this helps. Stay safe"

2020-12-22 14:41:29,"Mexico is the Western Hemispheres poster child (no pun intended) for the effects of unchecked population growth. In 1950  there were ~27 million Mexicans. Today there are >120 million and no end in sight. The last trip I took before covid was kayaking in Baja. We drove thru town after town filled to bursting with women and kids where nothing seemed to be going on.  They are running out of resources like water and there is rampant crime and unemployment, all driven by this spectacular birth rate. Prenatal and perinatal care  is vitally important if a kid is to have a good start in life, but Mexico’s and Central America’s problems are now almost exclusively from over population. I hope for their sake and ours that after the birth of their latest child these women are given the opportunity to delay or forego their next pregnancy."

2020-12-22 16:34:07,Excellent work NY Times.
2020-12-23 01:04:50,"The U.S. has the same patriarchal problem of medicalised birth that compromises women's bodily integrity with detrimental interventions. Women need to learn the word ""no"" and stop allowing family and medical staff to pressure them into episiotomies, c-sections, inductions, and other harmful misogynistic practices designed to benefit only medical staff, not women or babies."
2020-12-23 01:45:51,"Yes, I feel like while scientists are worrying about finding a cure to cancer (which of course is important too) and half a dozen other stuff, no one is trying to make childbirth easier for women everywhere. Like how about you figure out a better way to do c-sections without doing surgery? How about you make a better numbing medicine that you can drink instead of women needing to either have an epidural or be in terrible pain (because not everyone is willing to do that)? Appreciate these women!"
2020-12-30 10:32:14,"Still way too many questions about the group with the ""mistake"" dosage was higher in effectiveness - to a level similar to Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines.  That needs to be determined.  Also there is no information on what effectiveness is achieved by the three month delay of the second shot.  Personally, with comorbidity conditions, I would want these answers before getting the Astra Zeneca vaccine.  My preference would be for maximum protection, and that is Pfizer's or Moderna's.  Way too many and conflicting information from Astra Zeneca for my comfort level."
2020-12-30 11:35:59,Shoddy science. Aggregated data from Brazilian and UK studies and the study protocols were changed midway during both the studies. It is hard to have confidence in their results.
2020-12-30 10:25:30,It is odd that AstraZaneca/Oxford vaccine is being authorized without sound efficacy data. One cannot criticize other countries for doing the same such as Russia.
2020-12-30 10:29:20,Good work! This is why Oxford has been ranked the number one global university for several past years.
2020-12-30 11:55:19,"Wonderful. We're stuck in the UK, now most likely to be given a vaccine that hasn't been fully tested, using a dosing protocol that isn't understood--or worse yet, dosing that provides substantially less protection--leaving people who already can't or won't observe the basic social distancing requirements thinking that they're now safe having been given a dodgy vaccine (or a good vaccine using an untested dosing plan), telling people without cars that if they can't find their way to a football stadium or racecourse that they'll move to the back of the vaccine line.....I could go on but I'm getting too depressed and angry.

And all this to score points for a bunch of politicians wanting to convince the public that Britain by way of Oxford can save the world, in a fit of dangerous post-Brexit jingoism.

And they wonder why people don't trust them. Talk about making a bad situation worse.

How about we solve the cold storage problems of the good vaccines, and figure out how to ramp up their production, and how to inoculate people more quickly (sugar cubes, anyone?)?

But that would require leadership, now harder to find than a dragon's tooth. Wonderful."
2020-12-30 12:41:06,"Don’t worry. The vaccine works. The lower cost and storage details may mean a sore arm for a week and a fever with the first shot, but those are very good signs. I was a trial participant in the US. Slow and steady wins the race."
2020-12-30 12:58:55,"The effectiveness needed for a vaccine was only 50%. Someone coming up with a 90% effective vaccine does not make the 70% effective vaccine redundant. The effectiveness calculation also depends on sample population etc.

These are very difficult times. And I congratulate the British Government that they did the right thing. They took a bold and risky decision because the situation necessitated such an decision. 

1. There was no need to hold supplies for the second shot. The need of the hour was to vaccinate as many ""willing"" folks as possible for greater immunity in the population. There is a need to increase manufacturing output simultaneously so that a second dose is available sooner than later. I cannot stress how important it is to ramp up production so that a second dose is available when needed.

2. This is indeed very good news for the World. The majority of the World will not have access to the costly mRNA vaccines. But they must start vaccinating now using the Oxford vaccine without delay and they must start vaccinating without holding supplies for the second shot. I have highlighted those points in NYTimes posts in many articles related to vaccines. 

I am immensely thankful that the British Government has taken this decision. The Serum Institute of India is producing large quantities of the Oxford vaccine. I hope that the Indian Government will follow closely and will approve the vaccine. They should start vaccinating soon. It will save a great many lives."
2020-12-30 12:55:53,Great news to live and with great joy when the educated forces save the world / thanks to all.
2020-12-30 12:08:33,"The MHRA is going to issue a further statement later today, which should give us a more definitive understanding of the effectiveness of the vaccine. It seems the initial confusion stemmed from a misreading of the strength of some Italian product, but in science accidents can often be tremendously fruitful.

(off topic, but delighted see the progress on Penn Station, the demolishing of which was up there with the same deplorable treatment for London's Euston, also in the 60s)"
2020-12-30 12:48:05,This is not how you do science. Retrospective subgroup analysis are meaningless and lead to bad decision making. I will go without if this is the only option I am given.
2020-12-30 12:10:06,"From the start this vaccine's creators have been shady in sharing data, and the protocols for the trials are a mess. It's a darn shame, because it's the most affordable vaccine and shows such promise for worldwide distribution. But no way they are sticking it in my arm. I'll wait for Pfizer, Moderna, or hopefully Johnson and Johnson soon. I can shelter in place for another six months."
2020-12-30 13:19:58,"Our turgid scientific bureaucracy is denying us a critical tool to fight this war while a 9/11 death march iccurs daily in this country.   If we took the uk approach, we’d save over 100k us citizens.  Stop dithering over spreadsheets and whether it’s 60 or 90 percent effective in preventing infection.  It’s 100 percent effective in preventing death."
2020-12-30 13:31:01,"Their analysis, study protocols, and transparency have been a hot mess. It's pretty likely that the half dose appears more effective because that group didn't have older adults in it, and this vaccine doesn't do much - or even anything - for them...Based on the monkey analysis, it also doesn't appear to stop vaccinated people from spreading the virus. In which case, people will still be spreading it, the elderly will still be getting sick. There's not enough info yet to know if it is worth the effort. I'm holding out hope for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine to be a better cheap alternative. mRNA won't work for much of the world's population - we desperately need more and cheaper vaccines - but their process has been a huge disappointment."
2020-12-30 14:32:24,"Everything about the British approach makes sense, given a pandemic. 

We have had the US CDC dither over creating the ""best"" test last winter due to some misguided sense of American exceptionalism. Then we failed completely to get wide-spread testing or contact tracing going.  We have never gotten sufficient supplies of PPE due to lack of leadership from the WH. We have had no cogent approach for mask-wearing or social distancing--try cross-country car travel and observe the quaint local customs. Doses of the monoclonal antibiotic for those ill with covid are sitting unused because of the lack of testing and the narrow window of opportunity to use that drug effectively. This is, unless you are trump, or a professional athlete who can get tested regularly. 

Now we see the total cluelessness of the federal government in even ORDERING a sufficient amount vaccine and a military that is charged with distribution but can't seem to do it; to say nothing of the absence of a plan to get it into people's arms.  There is a leadership vacuum from federal to state-levels, with no clear idea about how to prioritize vaccination.  

Our federalism and American exceptionalism, combined with  governmental ineptitude and the general ignorance too many Americans is literally killing us."
2020-12-30 13:56:42,"I find it quite strange, that between the glowingly positive and only faintly negative coverage of the Oxford vaccine, there was not a single word about the Astra-Sputnik agreement signed recently, whereby the 2 companies - both using the adenovirus formula and with Sputnik reporting over 90% efficacy in the Stage 3 trials - will test the feasibility of combining the 2 vaccines, with Astra providing the first dose and Sputnik the second (the booster), thus raising the efficacy level to 94-95% and the immunity time frame extended to 2 years minimum.
Isn't THAT good news?"
2020-12-30 16:08:12,"The problem with so called ""delayed second dose"" is that this practice likely has not been thoroughly tested in clinical trial, or approved by FDA of UK before the trials. Their Lancet publication did not even mention the 70% effectiveness post first dose. I am shocked that they keep saying the vaccine is 70.4% effective after two doses, by combing the data from two dose regimen. I am a scientist working in testing company and we can't launch any tests with such sloppy way of summarizing data."
2020-12-30 14:56:51,"This is great news and an important step in preventing the pandemic. Vaccine efficacy is not a bragging right, what matters is controlling the pandemic. For this we need the right balance between efficacy and coverage. 
According to a peer reviewed article in the  America Journal of preventive medicine, a vaccine with 60% efficacy and a 100 % coverage can prevent a pandemic.

When you’re bleeding badly and an ambulance arrives, do you refuse to let them take you to the hospital because one of the ambulance’s hubcaps is missing?

70 percent efficacy is excellent! It’s better than most (if not all) of the flu vaccines, and what we need most of all now is to get as many people vaccinated as possible, as fast as possible - worldwide.

The more vaccines, the better."
2020-12-30 14:00:29,Will the USA even evaluate this as long as donnie & co have stock in other vaccine manufacturers?
2020-12-30 16:02:53,"In a fit of pique, the CDC and the FDA condemn several hundred thousand more American's to death by Covid.  Nice work if you can get it.  

When will this clown car of medical arrogance and incompetence end?

Given the slow roll out of the Moderna/Pfizer vaccine, it's clear we should have immunized health care workers LAST so as to provide just a bit of urgency in the medical-industrial complex. 

After all, Dr. Redfield did tell Congress that a mask was ""better than a vaccine"", so the doctors and nurses can all wear masks while the rest of us get vaccinated."
2020-12-30 16:16:03,"This sounds an awful lot like phage therapy, in which viruses are used to fight bacteria. (Bacteriophages). They can also be used to kill other viruses.  (Virophages).  Sputnik is a subviral agent that uses a helper virus.  This technology has been generally known for decades.  Good article in the 12/21/20 Nee Yorker on it, generally."
2020-12-30 17:35:06,"Is its efficacy 62% or 90%? 62% isn’t bad, but statistically one would still be nearly 8 times as likely to get sick as one would if vaccinated with a 95% efficacy vaccine (such as those the Moderna or Pfizer) instead. From the public health perspective, a much greater portion of the population (including those hardest to reach and convince) would need to be vaccinated in order to bring the outbreaks down to manageable levels. Hopefully more data would come out some to make it clearer."
2020-12-30 16:48:43,"Perhaps someone else already has pointed this out:  If they vaccinate 1 million people/week, they'll finish some time in 2022.  Great job, right?"
2020-12-30 17:11:10,"One point nobody seems to be making is that some of the vaccines, especially the Chinese ones, use inactivated or weakened whole virus.  That means they will be growing massive amounts of SARS-cov2 with all the potential for mutations and accidents that implies."
2020-12-30 17:20:26,Too many lies and ambiguities to trust. Maybe politicians and investors FIRST with any new product would be wise?
2020-12-30 19:10:13,"This is lovely news for Britain and perhaps the rest of the world and I am genuinely happy for them BUT people who are suggesting that this Astra-Zeneca vaccine is appropriate for the US are delusional! Have you been here? Have you met Americans? Or are you simply thinking scientifically and without one iota of psychology? 
We, as a people, are ornery, obstinate, exceptionalistic and kinda tend toward anti-vaxxing in the MOST NORMAL of times.
I, personally, am in a high risk group. I have been eagerly wanting a vaccine because I will surely die if I get Covid-19. I don't want this though. ALL vaccines make me super sick! One that isn't fully effective, that makes me sick AND is promised to hurt on top of it sounds like a very bitter pill to swallow."
2020-12-30 19:37:30,"When Pfizer first announced their vaccine, they said it had a 90% efficacy.  Then, when Moderna said their vaccine had a 94% efficacy, Pfizer a week later, said theirs had 95% efficacy....  I trust scientists, not corporations."
2020-12-30 20:11:41,"I haven’t heard—but if a person, say at high risk, were to get the 62% effective vaccine (and likely would still need to “hide”), could that person then get the 94% effective vaccine when it became available? And will we be told which vaccine we’re given?"
2020-12-30 20:21:48,"Isn't only the Pfizer vaccine the one requiring ""ultra cold"" storage? Moderna vaccine uses standard freezer temperature storage (-20)?  Isn't it worth pointing out that the UK regulators are not using a large data set from controlled experiments in their vaccination plan, eg different doses and schedules used in the trial (less data/less rigor to support any one dose and schedule, including the one in the government vaccination plan?"
2020-12-30 20:26:34,"I am having a tough time finding out where I can get vaccinated.  My wife and I are eligible, being in the 1B group.

I have contacted my personal doctor, local health department, pharmacies, clinics and hospitals.  No one knows anything.

I even contact my Senator Elizabeth Warren asking her where she got vaccinated.  Waiting for the call back."
2020-12-30 20:48:23,"Suppose the Astra/Oxford vaccine IS only 60% effective?  That's enough to kill the pandemic worldwide - it just takes a bit longer to do than with a 95% effective vaccine. The reduction in overall 'R-number' is not 60/95 of the reduction gained with the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. It's much greater.

The coronavirus thrives on infecting NEW victims. 

Call me a dinosaur but after 40 years as a physician, I think I'd rather have the Astra vaccine - which is based on more conventional vaccine technology than mRNA vaccines which have never really been tried before on this scale. Pfizer and Moderna offerings are more 'gene therapy' than vaccination. Actually, if I had the choice, I'd prefer to have the French Sanofi vaccine which uses ENTIRELY conventional vaccine technology."
2020-12-30 21:30:09,My hope / request is that since UK has approved the Oxford Vaccine that the US grants emergency approval of the Oxford vaccine for 16-64 year olds that are healthy & non essential workers since this category is lowest on priority for the Pfizer & the Moderna vaccines.   I am in this category and would rather have a vaccine that is lower efficacy with some risk in January/ February rather than waiting until the summer.
2020-12-30 22:08:01,"I hope that the FDA is going to operate with a true sense of exigency for the next vaccine approvals. The manufacturing data is already available for both the Oxford vaccine and the Janssen vaccines. I pray that it has already been evaluated. Once the efficacy of the Oxford vaccine has been determined by the number of placebo cases, there is already enough data from the offshore trials to determine safety - there should be no need to wait 60 days after the last US trial member has received the shot. I'm expecting the FDA operate with a true sense of the urgency that 2000+ deaths a day require and not take two weeks after the EUA request is submitted. The UK seems to have a much better sense of urgency than our FDA and CDC."
2020-12-30 20:57:40,"No  one will make any money out of the AZ/Oxford vaccine in the USA, so why rush to approve it?
Given you couldn't even agree a half decent relief bill, thanks to dinosaurs and lobbyists, AZ/O has no chance.
In fact the USA could be last to vaccinate its population. I'm sure India will be dishing out the AZ/O within a week, and the pressure on the eU will be intolerable."
2020-12-30 21:22:42,"60% effective, 90% effective, who's counting? No evidence that it works in people age 55 and over? No worries. Not telling the US FDA that their trials had been halted due to adverse events? No problem, the FDA is perfectly fine with leaning about trial cessation from an article in the NY Times. Here's a proposal: The UK can have exclusive rights to the Astra Zeneca vaccine but they must forfeit their allocation of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and ship them to the US. We'll pay the freight."
2020-12-30 21:04:09,"Why has the efficacy and/ or potential dangers of the Astra Zeneca vaccine not been openly published in the UK and for the world? The efficacy of this vaccine appears to be very tenuous.

The Johnson Government has let this virus get totally out of control in the UK, they have always been behind the curve, so many people have died unnecessarily.
I just hope that this vaccine works."
2020-12-30 21:40:41,Only Pfizer and Moderna can learn how to make this mRNA vaccine? Is it race? Is it nationality? Is it language? Why? How many souls will pass? Who leads? Who cares?
2020-12-30 22:15:49,"If the half dose then full dose gives a better response, then there is more vaccine for folks to get a first dose. You can do twice as many by giving a half dose first."
2020-12-30 22:20:04,"This is good news.  Lets hope!

But I do note a very unfortunate cold war mentality when the vaccines developed in Russia and China are discussed.  Are
our Turkish-German, Lebanese, etc. scientists smarter than the Russian and Chinese scientists?  Do our countries have a higher regard for safety than their countries?  I rather doubt it.  There are now so many vaccines in phase three or further -- lets hope for good news from all of them!"
2020-12-30 22:36:21,"Something doesn't make sense. How can this vaccine have a 70% efficacy rate after one shot but only 62% after two shots? It is very unlikely that getting a second shot makes things worse! I'm guessing that the 70% number is the efficacy during the first few weeks only. That means that as time goes on, that first shot becomes less efficacious, and the number will dip well below 62% (which is what would be achieved if immunity is boosted by a second shot). But that is only an uneducated guess - I would like to see a real analysis by a qualified expert."
2020-12-30 22:21:37,"And the US is stating they want to do so in April '21. Again here is another fully untested cure. Glad it remains in Britain, and sorry to see the US has already accepted the results on an 'emergency' basis for April, because by then we'll be able to see the results from Britain.

2020-12-30 23:16:03,"WOOHOO!!! Brilliant news! Now we can vaccinate everyone! Let’s face it, the Pfizer vaccine would be impossible to administer in developing countries. This vaccine is cheap and easy to transport. More people will have access to a COVID vaccine now. Really great news."
2020-12-30 23:06:12,we need a clear article on if the current vaccine works on the variant
2020-12-30 23:05:00,"FDA achievements, 2020:
- delayed testing.
- delayed clinical trials (AZ trial paused in US for 7 weeks).
- delayed vaccine approvals.
- delayed vaccine distribution.
Why do I need their approval to get AZ's shot? Sure, efficacy is debatable, but safety isn't, so what we have to lose?
I think I'm converting to libertarianism here."
2020-12-30 23:35:01,"I read that the US is close to approving this as well.  All of this is good news.  The more vaccines, the better.  If this works, as well as Moderna and Pfizer, the closer we will get to normalcy.  Hooray for science."
2020-12-31 00:14:56,"There are far too many unanswered questions about the Oxford/AsrtaZeneca vaccine for it to be approved for widespread use.
The testing process has been one mistake after another and depending where one reads about this vaccine, the efficacy ranges anywhere from 60% to 90%. 
Beginning with test subjects receiving incorrect dosages, there's also the fact that nobody over the age of 55 or anyone with pre-existing conditions were used in the studies. They then went on to combine the test results from two separate sttudies so the data is meaningless.
This does not inspire confidence especially in a World where public health has been politicized far too much and way too often. 
End of story, this vaccine needs much more study and the results must be properly scrutinized or public trust in vaccination programs will be shattered."
2020-12-31 00:46:23,"Of all the approved vaccines (to date), I most prefer the Oxford version - don't get me wrong, I shall willingly take whatever is available in my area, but the Oxford version is based on a tried and tested method with decades of data in support. 

To be sure the Moderna and Pifzer versions are based on solid science, but they still don't have the supporting historical data of Oxford. I understand, of course, that they are based on a new and innovative approach, but the long-term impacts are not yet known. One can look back at decades of data concerning the Oxford version and be assured that long-term effects are highly unlikely . . ."
2020-12-30 23:26:50,How fast can you make one billion doses. I hope for FDA approval soon too. I would by this vaccine.
2020-12-30 23:56:59,"US government seem to be slow walking vaccination approvals and distribution to the most vulnerable elderly. Why?
Why is the UK so much ahead of us on this? How does Canada get to approve vaccines before the USA and Canadian government bought enough vaccines to vaccinate every Canadian very quickly. Meanwhile the elderly are in the hospitals and dropping like flies in the USA every day. Every day of a slow walk is deadly. Meanwhile Trump is golfing."
2020-12-31 01:31:15,"A report on the BBC shows thousands of seniors lining up 24 hrs before the vaccine is available - they are in deck chairs, under blankets - some masked and some not but crammed like sardines! Thank you DeSantis for this chaos! It takes weeks for immunity to develop and two does are needed. Why is all this being done in a parking lot from a small van? Does it have suitable refrigeration? how long is the vaccine stable once thawed? how will they track people to give the second dose? All unbelievable and expect the rollout will be botched, these people will be infected because of unsafe conditions in a field (where are bathrooms and sanitation?). What a joke - even more do than Trump’s ridiculous attempts to overthrow the election. We are in the stone ages!!"
2020-12-30 15:50:58,"Just about couple of weeks ago Astro Zeneca signed an Agreement with Russian developer of Sputnik V vaccine (no word about this fact in the article) and by a miraculous coincidence Astra very quickly eventually managed to make a vaccine which can be stored for a very long time in a common fridge. Exactly these features Russian vaccine has, and could not be reached by Astra. 
I’m really happy that not only we, Russians have a chance to get safest and most efficient vaccine, but a huge community in Europe! But, why western media are this shy to tell about it?"
2020-12-31 01:54:17,Astra Zeneca has not figured out the optimal dosing strategy yet. I would prefer the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. I can’t help but think that AZ is rushing somewhat in order to get a share of the market.
2020-12-31 02:14:50,"I have yet to see the research results examining for failed immunity due to a person's resistance (immune response) to the attenuated live monkey virus used by the AS (AstraZeneca) vaccine.  In other words, the body is able to destroy the monkey virus before the monkey virus can cause ""infection"" and a resulting SARS-CoV-2 immune response. 

I have much more faith in the BioNTech / Moderna approach vs. AS, unless AS is followed by a verification test for good antibody response. Or, a peer reviewed survey showing that the AS immune response failure is negligible on a population basis (not a small sample of 30K poorly distributed across age/race/health status).  

While on a population basis the perfect is the enemy of the good enough, on a personal basis, population of one, the good enough might be fatal.   Good luck with that Solomon."
2020-12-31 02:10:08,"Excellent article, but:

1. The Moderna vaccine DOES NOT require ""ultracold"" storage:
  o Long term storage temp is -20C or only -4F.
  o Normal home freezers can easily maintain from -13F to +5F (the recommended range).
2. So OK, you made a mistake.
3. Does it matter? Well yes. It does. Expanding popular storylines to the point of being untrue is harmful. It adds to the confusion around these complex issues. It undermines the credibility of an excellent article.
4. Well ... does the Times care? So far I see no indication that they do. Not corrected in tonight's story update. Has anyone even noticed?
 
Many of your subscribers, like our household, invest over $1,000 /yr with the Times. 

Most would likely expect, at least, a quiet, timely online correction when clear mistakes occur."
2020-12-31 02:32:27,Covid virus is making everybody scared and depressed and now the vaccine is driving everybody crazy and confused. I am confused which vaccine is better and why? What are the long term side effects as the Pfizer and Moderna used new mRNA technology. Do we have to take every year like flu vaccine   ?  When I will be getting ? I heard about black marketing and nepotism .  There will be fake vaccine and scam. So much confusion.
2020-12-31 03:22:46,"The strategy of giving one dose of the AZ vaccine is intriguing and will be interesting to watch -and possibly emulate here in the US.  Leave the more effective moderna and Pfizer vaccines for the 65  and otherwise vulnerable populations and perhaps single dose of AZ for everyone else —quickly.  No matter what the strategy, we have to get our vaccinations in order.  It’s a slow motion disaster right now.  We have to get creative and focused. Every delay means thousands of lives lost and tens/hundreds of billions in economic losses."
2020-12-30 13:32:09,"Does its interim analysis of Phase 3 trials provide any statistics on the safety, or is it still too early to tell? It is also much more expensive than the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines, not to mention the ultra-inexpensive one from Oxford-AstraZeneca. Why is that?

Still, it is a good progress. Am looking forward to seeing the final analysis on both safety and efficacy."
2020-12-30 14:49:15,"If ever there were a reason to care about the health of every man, woman, and child on our planet, it’s now: vaccinations are needed everywhere in the world in order to wipe out this plague. Country boundaries are meaningless to this deadly virus, and until we achieve herd immunity everywhere, no one will be truly safe anywhere.

Congratulations to China, without whose help getting personal protective equipment, reagents for our testing, and other supplies, we’d have lost even more family members and friends.

Let’s all continue to learn from one another, and help the countries least able to help themselves."
2020-12-30 15:36:32,"While welcoming the news of yet another vaccine on the scene, the irony of the cause discovering the cure continues to haunt. 

China chose not to support the international research community by providing samples to find a remedy for this unusual virus during the early days that would have hastened the pace of research in the U.S. and elsewhere. The centralized regime also rebuked and punished its own researchers and journalists in connection with the cause and spread of Covid19. 

China’s secrecy and lack of a cooperative posture are in stark contrast to its neighbor whose Serum Institute of India worked with Oxford University and AstraZeneca and produced Covishield.

In the end, China faces an uphill battle in reaching markets beyond its client states due to a massive loss of trust, the most significant ingredient in any vaccine."
2020-12-30 15:51:50,"There is too much political angle in the article, like most articles on China by NYT journalists these days. Too much narrative and filling in background just reinforces bias, which is apparent in this article. For example, when comparing the two Chinese vaccines with the ones based mRNA technology used by Pfizer and Moderna, the authors chose to ignore the obvious downside of the mRNA vaccines, that it needs to be stored at ultra low temperature which makes it hard to store and transport and hence unpractical for developing countries. That's one big advantage of the Chinese vaccines even though it has lower efficacy. There is also no need to focus so much on the political implication of China's vaccine. American vaccine is touted as examples of American superior technology which also gives US political advantage, but that is never pointed out because it is somehow the way it should be. This kind of small biases add up."
2020-12-30 16:14:08,"Not interested. I can think of several ways to say it, so I'll just pick one. It's like signing a lease for an apartment in a condemned building."
2020-12-30 15:04:50,The most promising Chinese vaccine was the Cansino adenovirus candidate. Cansino had a collaboration with Canada ready to go but somewhere a Chinese bureaucrat quashed it because of Canada's arrest of the CFO of Hwawei on American orders. I don't agree with what the US or Canada did regarding Hwawei but the Chinese government shot themselves in the foot sabotaging their own best chance to save lives and demonstrate world class pharmaceutical development.

2020-12-30 18:16:50,"It could be with thousands of people injected that the control group has 10 individuals got infected and the vaccinated group has 2. So the efficacy will be 79/80%. Without the numbers, one cannot say for sure."
2020-12-30 14:11:11,No rational person would trust any “scientific” statements from the Chinese government.
2020-12-30 18:30:16,"China provides no transparency now when it comes to vaccines as well as when this outbreak first started. Let’s repeat something that bears repeating: this virus originated in China and the Chinese government is responsible for causing this plague on the world.

Let’s not forget they closed the domestic borders in Wuhan back in February and March, so Covid wouldn’t spread within the country but kept their international borders open. The world needs to hold the Chinese government responsible."
2020-12-31 01:16:37,"Whether it is China or Russia, we cannot trust them. When the Covid - 19 pandemic first broke out, China was not providing information to the outside world. The Chinese government even resorted to punishing those medical professionals in Wuhan who raised the alarm, which we now have to learn of the virus. Now that China is reporting of a State owned pharmaceutical company has been able to produce a Covid - 19 vaccine, there is very little or no information regarding the real effectiveness of the vaccine. It is better that we continue to work with the US/European pharmaceutical companies to obtain the needed vaccines. The process is already in place."
2020-12-31 13:45:26,"I do not understand why local government in partnership with their public health departments are not be utilized to as vaccines locations. Taxpayer dollars are used for just this sort of public health emergency and states do not require any more money for vaccination program. State governments in partnership with county governments are in a position to vaccinate all of there residents and have a county data system to ensure that all residents receive the second dose. Using community based organizations to assist with reminder calls and transportation for those that can not make it to a county site - whether that be the public health office, public school, library or other community site. The roll out should be easily organized using the local government infrastructure that we already have in place."

2020-12-31 13:54:34,"We have the most logistically complex vaccine ever made (ultra-cold transport, limited time after thawing etc) and the plan is - take the vaccine to the people? Major convention centers should be set up and operating - giant freezers holding tens of thousands of doses, 300 cubicles where staff give an injection every minute, running 24/7,  a resuscitations/anaphylaxis team, plus administrative support so each dose is logged in real time. Hospital workers show their ID and its done, nursing home residents do a bus trip as an activity, walk-ups for over 60's are available. Yes, we need priorities, and yes this wont get everyone in more remote areas etc, but for goodness sake the main issue has to be that every available dose has been put in an arm as soon as its released."
2020-12-31 13:56:39,"My little hospital in the Pacific Northwest has been proactive with planning for the vaccine well before it arrived. Those of us eligible by state criteria, received an email with a link to schedule an appointment for the vaccine, starting at 0600 the day after the shipment arrived. I don't know where the problems lie with the slow rollout around the country but suspect it involves many people from the top on down. Witness the chaos in Florida, where one county official indicated that they had ""not had enough time to prepare"". When incompetent leaders are elected to important positions we all suffer."
2020-12-31 13:58:11,"A few weeks ago I couldn't understand why the military was handing off shipments of the vaccine to FedEx and UPS.  It seemed to me that that was the time for a ""Berlin Airlift"" type effort, with military planes lined up on the tarmac nearest the Pfizer manufacturing facility, immediately flying to key destinations around the country once each plane was loaded, where health-care workers would be lined-up at the destination airport, waiting with their sleeves rolled up..."

To some extent, all the advice and demands interfere, all the decision making, who is first who is last.  I live in a very rural area, and despite concerns a lady in her late 60s who works on the front lines in our pharmacy has been vaccinated.  

I agree that something else was needed, is needed now.   There is the Red Cross, there is the National Guard in each State.   Waiting for a commercial solution as discussed on CNBC, by Cramer, for Walgreens to do it is not up to it."
2020-12-31 14:02:19,"I think that states should take a clue from the UK and instead of reserving a second vaccine dose, just go a hard and give as many people the first dose as possible and the second dose later next year when more supplies are available.

I also believe that they should make distribution as simple as possible, and after giving the vaccine to first line medical people and long term care homes, start giving the vaccine by age groups going down the list as supplies allow."

2020-12-31 14:12:39,"Our daughter is a frontline health professional in California.  She informed us the hospital where she works sent out an urgent emails and texts the other day asking staff to hurry up and get their vaccinations before the supply on hand could no longer be administered safely. 

That is a deplorable situation and begs the larger question whether or not the Pfizer vaccine, the one available in her hospital, is really an acceptable option in the long run when distribution is the single biggest obstacle to getting vaccinated, especially by the general public."
2020-12-31 14:14:32,"One unmentioned factor in the slow roll-out of the vaccine is that the healthcare system is so swamped with critically ill COVID19 patients, they don’t have the resources to spare for giving vaccination shots.

With the expected surge in new cases from the holiday, this situation is only going to get worse over the next weeks.

The solution today is the same as it’s been for the past ten months: masking and social distancing!"

2020-12-31 14:21:17,"There is a lot going on here.  My hospital has doses, but wants to make sure that it goes to clinicians, front desk staff, environmental services first.  But we don’t know who will have side effects, so not everyone can get it at the same time.  The paperwork is a lot.  And don’t forget that quite a few people don’t want it yet - so we are going as fast as we can.  Soon.  (And in the meantime, my son’s daycare teacher tested positive...)"
2020-12-31 14:23:19,"I was told that once a Pfizer vial of the vaccine is opened, it can treat multiple patients but only has a shelf life of 6 hours. Open up the high school gymnasiums for mass inoculations like we did during the polio era."
2020-12-31 14:25:11,"If there is one thing Trump has proved, it's that talk is cheap.  Anyone can say anything, but actually getting stuff done is another matter.  Inoculating 300+ million people is a logistical nightmare.  This would be extremely difficult even under the best of conditions, and we are under the worst.

The number one ingredient to accomplish this task is coordinated national, top down leadership and even more importantly, total cooperation from the public.  We have neither.  It's a states rights thing.  It's an individual liberty thing.  It a hoax thing.  It's a conspiracy thing.

Just when we need faith in government and our institutions, we have Trump basing his administration on destroying faith in government and our institutions.  Just when we need expertise in government, we have cronyism and fealty in government.  This is the result.  

Joe Biden is going to have his work cut out for him.  He has to undue the logjam and install a vaccine delivery system.  Even more difficult will be getting about 40% of the nation to cooperate.  Trump took care of that department."
2020-12-31 14:28:08,"The real problem is not distribution, it's end-user update.
Here in Washoe County, we have 33,000 doses of the vaccine sitting on the shelf after 2000 have been administered.  
The is no shortage of health care workers to give the shot.

Given the public's skepticism about the vaccine, expect herd immunity to take many years, not months. Reporting on this last critical step in the process remains sadly lacking because it counters the cheerleading for the vaccine to deliver a return to normalcy in the near future."
2020-12-31 14:28:42,"The distribution of vaccine needs to be done simultaneously to the high risk groups and to the general public in a manner analogous to the accelerated phases trials designed to evaluated the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidates.  The phases (1-2) were cleverly overlapped and compressed to save time. 
Distribution is currently bogged down in hospitals for healthcare workers and nursing homes.  This is a plodding process which will take (too much) time to complete.  
Why not disseminate the majority of the vaccine stock to the general public immediately through pharmacies, clinics, urgent care, churches etc.  Just keep aside a small portion, perhaps 10%, to continue inoculations of healthcare workers and nursing home patients. Stocks will be replenished as they are used up. The rate limiting factor should NOT be hold ups in distribution for the purpose of prioritization."
2020-12-31 14:30:28,"Like other aspects of this pandemic, the vaccine administration appears to be grossly mismanaged.  We should have plans to take the vaccine directly to the people - to neighborhoods, schools, community centers, and front doors - rather than relying on individuals to make their own appointments and arrange their own transportation.  This isn't like a tetanus shot where it's acceptable for many people to decide not to participate."
2020-12-31 14:31:34,"In Florida the vaccine is being administered by local health departments. The give a number to call but it is constantly busy or crashed. Yesterday, the department posted on its website the would be closed Thursday and Friday for the holidays. I don’t think the Rona takes a holiday."
2020-12-31 14:31:53,"No, Covid-19 vaccinations have not lagged, at least not for the politicians.  Your Senator and Congressional representatives got it before you, me and everyone else.  Regardless of their age and health condition, they were first in line to receive the vaccine, before those in nursing homes and before first responders. 

This is a preview on how government sponsored healthcare will work.   Elites will receive treatment first, just as they have received vaccinations first, leaving the rest of us (who pay for it all) to wait for care.

Isn't it grand how ""U.S. Officials Say Covid-19 Vaccination Effort Has Lagged"" after many of them got vaccinated?"
2020-12-31 14:34:04,"The challenge is daunting.  The American Pharmacists Association estimates that a vaccination clinic with 4 stations requires at least 30 staff members, from translators to medical data entry personnel.  Each station can administer about 30 shots per hour.  So with 4 stations, that's about 120 shots per hour or roughly 1,000 per 8 hour shift. 

To get to 1 million shots per day, this will require 1,000 clinics nationwide and 30,000 staffers.  Adjust the numbers accordingly if 2 or even 3 shifts are employed.  

The disturbing point here is that I confess to watching an unhealthy amount of cable TV, and I have never heard a talking head breaking down this logistical nightmare so Americans can understand and fully appreciate the job ahead of us."
2020-12-31 14:35:36,"I'm patiently sitting back, socially distanced, wearing my mask, and washing my hands. I'm sure these are merely ""startup"" problems. We've had unprecedented hype about the speed with which the  vaccines were developed, the clinical trials , efficacy, safety, and approval. On top of these rigorous and required steps we've had the Trump administration muddying the waters with  misinformation, lies, self aggrandizing claims, and demands for credit. The rollout of the vaccines is very very early. People need to adjust their expectations and act accordingly. Three things are about to coalesce that will speed delivery of the vaccines to peoples arms: a science based approach as advocated by the soon to be sworn in Biden administration, Gen. Perna working with the all aspects of the supply chain to insure timely delivery from manufacturers to pharmacies and hospitals, and more vaccines being approved in the next three months. I'm confident things are moving along."
2020-12-31 14:36:56,"We were done a great disservice over these past couple of months with a national debate about who should be given priority for the vaccine. Discussions about age and race and equity and justice have confused us greatly. The real goal is to get lots of people vaccinated and quickly. When we look back on these times, nobody is going to judge who got the vaccine 1st and who got it 2nd and who got it 5th. The measure of success here is how quickly we camps get it to the largest number of people. Every incremental vaccination is a step closer to out common goal. Maybe the NYT should emerge from its identity-focused bubble and help shift the discussion away from which group gets vaccinated in which order."
2020-12-31 14:37:23,"You know what, I think most people in this are doing the best that they can. I applaud everyone who is working on getting the vaccine out as quickly as humanly, that being the key word, possible."
2020-12-31 14:01:47,"Not enough money from the federal government?  I'll bet most people would be happy to contribute for their shot.  Put out a collection box.

Distribution problems?  CVS and Walgreens?  Nonsense.  Set up a vacation day or week at the local high school gym.  That's where I got vaccinations when I was a kid in the 70's.  100's or 1,000's of people showed up every day.

Let's get it done!  And in the mean time wear a mask."
2020-12-31 13:42:27,"If you look at where we thought we would be on vaccines last March, reading where we are today would seem to be a misprint - how did we ever get so far so fast!  Thank goodness for all the hard work to get the vaccines developed and to get the distribution, and vaccinations, started.  Consider the incredible positive this represents."
2020-12-31 14:14:20,"No surprise here; Donald Trump was way late off the mark in acknowledging what everyone else knew back in January. He browbeat and bullied the compliant, complicit medical and scientific “experts” in his administration for months.

So now he wants to beat his chest about rolling out a vaccine? And he wants to pillory the states for inefficient response due to delivery logistics? Which was a federal responsibility?

As usual with him, it’s always someone else’s fault; first China, then the Democrats, now the states. Yup; elections do have consequences."
2020-12-31 14:02:17,"I am amazed how President Barack Obama’s recent book has sold 3 million copies, and millions of iPhones are sold on day 1 of their launch, but somehow the government supply chain could manage only 2.6 million doses in more than a week. I know the industries are different but clearly there is something to learn."
2020-12-31 14:12:03,"Here is the solution.

Give out the shots in venues with big parking lots. Jones Beach, orchard  Beach, Citifield, you get an appointment just like with the nasal swabs. You drive up, get your shot, pull into a wait area, and after 15 minutes if nothing is wrong you leave. You go 24 hours a day , seven days a week

And let’s stop prioritizing the vaccine and give them out, or do half and half, if New York gets 4 million doses as an example, give 2 million of those doses according to plan and just give out the other two million first come first serve. The way they are doing it now, they are moving so slow because you can’t vaccinate all healthcare workers at once for obvious reasons, and as for the seniors, it created a logistical nightmare. 

Time is of the essence, picking and choosing who gets the vaccine has slowed it to a crawl. The vaccine is here, let’s put it in arms, it does no good in a freezer."
2020-12-31 14:19:16,"Let everyone get the shot regardless of age or occupation on a first come, first serve basis. 

An overweight 30 year old waitress with high blood pressure working daily in public should not have to wait. 

People know if their job or personal health puts them at risk and don’t need government bureaucrats micromanaging their health care."
2020-12-31 14:33:07,A politically motivated and Trump supporter Milwaukee WI hospital employee was fired because he purposely damaged about 500 doses of vaccine. More of this type of incident should be expected and hospitals must increase the security around the vaccine shipments.
2020-12-31 14:01:15,"As those vaccine will be useless after a few weeks, seems like it’s gonna cost the government a huge sum down the road.."
2020-12-31 14:13:55,"This is exactly what happens when there is no national strategy in 
place. This virulent disease will never be stopped if we ""leave it to the states"" (the old Republican mantra) to get their citizens vaccinated."
2020-12-31 14:17:48,"In March, Trump declared he was now a war-time president. Given his track record of predictions, his planning, his execution, his management of the supply chain for essential equipment, his selection of generals and his lack of focus during the heat of this war, he should step down now. 

Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Donald is golfing while we die."
2020-12-31 14:31:35,"What was he thinking when he considered not signing the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021?  I guess he doesn't think.

""President Trump seemed to lay the blame on governors, saying that it was “up to the States to distribute the vaccines once brought to the designated areas by the Federal Government.” But several governors have recently said their states have struggled because they had not received enough money from the federal government.""  

Just stating the obvious."
2020-12-31 14:35:00,We’ll just have to wait for a more responsible federal government to form. If that does not happen the alternative is the “free market” to take over. And we all know what that means.
2020-12-31 14:39:48,"There needs to be better, more detailed communication about the vaccination process. My impression is that people don’t know where they can/will get vaccinated when the time comes for their group. For example, will doctors offices offer the vaccine? Which doctors? Which “clinics” exactly?  Cvs and Walgreens must know by now how they will schedule and “host” millions of people for the vaccines in their already busy stores and it would be reassuring to know what that will look like.  Hopefully all this has been mapped out."
2020-12-31 14:40:02,I hope the doses aren’t lost and now on underground market to highest bitcoin bidder.
2020-12-31 14:41:44,"As every day passes we see that our useless government is even more useless than it is.

Even if we inoculated 20 million Americans a month, ir would take 16 plus months to administer the first dose, and to follow on with the second dose every three weeks or so later, means at least 2 years before everyone is inoculated.

Even Biden with his 100 million in the first hundred days is actually confirming that the nation will not be fully innoculated for over one year, if, a big if, he gets his program going.

So, my question is this - Why have we not deployed every branch of our armed forces, and every able American, in schools, police stations, places of worship, etc., in every village, town, city, and community, all across America, to give these shots; the training is basic, essentially no different than the annual flu shot administered by your local pharmacy.

And with so many millions of people unemployed doesn't it make sense to pay them to do this critical lifesaving work.

Like it or not, we are deep in the middle of a world war against an enemy which will kill many more millions of people if we don't get our act together, and regardless government assurances to the contrary, there will be vaccine failures as mutations in the virus become more common, which they surely will, just look at how the flu operates annually. 

It seems to me that for the American government to fully react, we need bodies on street corners fefore they experience shame, if such is possible."

So far,  Canada has only inoculated 63,877 vaccinations from a total population of 37,590,000  (2019).

That is pathetic!"
2020-12-31 14:39:55,The same Moncef Slaoui claims that by February 100 million Americans will be vaccinated. Each and every one associated with Trump cannot be trusted. Cannot wait for Biden and a competent team to take over.
2020-12-31 13:55:19,This will be Biden's first challenge.  Trump will be gone in 21 days and will be quickly forgotten.  Biden must get his arms around the slow vaccine roll out and quickly correct it.

This just another example of the Trump administrations failure to lead this Country thru this horrible public health crisis.

When lives are at stake, good intentions are not enough. Competence and leadership are required. Last night I listened to the General in charge give his excuses about their failure (something that would never be allowed when I was in the service) to do their job. I read this morning how Moncef Slaoui, another leader in the effort, said they have to do better. Ya think!

 The General said, for example, there were weather issues. I don't know how he could possible use that excuse as his planning should have included what they would do if there was a weather issue. I mean, come on, he never considered, in winter, that there might be a problem? I've got to wonder how this guy made it to General rank."

Without identifying the drivers, they have no clue what corrective action is needed.  This administration is pathetic."
2020-12-31 13:53:47,"Why should the mismanagement of vaccine distribution come as any surprise? Recall it was Trump who counselled the virus could be beaten with bleach, who blurted out lies including “The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.”, “Just stay calm. It will go away” and “It’s going to disappear”. 

There were unsubstantiated claims the virus was a Chinese plot and a Democratic hoax, that he knew how to treat it better than the doctors did, that it was just like the flu and if you got it, you’d get better. He lamented: “That’s all I hear about now, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID” and “By the way, on November 4th, you won’t hear about it anymore.” 

Trump held rallies with thousands of unmasked followers, including a super-spreader White House event for the Supreme Court nominee.

It’s all been insane, criminally insane, so why should we be surprised if there is a shortage of vaccine and haphazard distribution varies by state? 

Trump and his enablers need to be held accountable for their crimes."
2020-12-31 14:05:07,Like this is a surprise to any of us who can add two numbers together. The GOP absolutely refuses to allow states to receive any financial support from the Federal Gov’t for vaccine distribution (or anything else really). So here we have another avoidable delay in an endless chain of disaster that is being perpetuated by inaction and denial from lawmakers. This is a calculated humanitarian disaster on a scale unimaginable. What is wrong with us that we tolerate such incompetence?

2020-12-31 14:32:00,"This begs the question of why we should not just administer COVID vaccines on a first-come-first-serve basis, to speed the inoculation of the population and get us to the holy grail of herd immunity.

It's inevitable that the rules that we contrive to make things ""fair"" or ""logical"" make getting to herd immunity slower. Perhaps a lot slower."

Masks do a great job of stopping those droplets from moving about, but many humans refuse to wear them. The virus can be stopped if everybody in a community wears a masks and there are humans who simply will not wear them, they are not punished these humans who refuse to wear a mask, neither by the law or their fellow humans . Of the humans who are acting as hosts and suppliers of the virus 9 out of 10 are the maskless kind. These people walk around, host the virus and can spread it to hundreds of other humans. The virus has no way of spreading on its own, it has no legs.

Now, a vaccine has been made, and once again the humans can’t seem to protect themselves. They are moving with the speed of snails while the virus is trying to mutate around the vaccine 

At this moment even with its variations the virus is still 99.8 survivable. Something much worse is coming , something much more fatal, and humans will be easy pickings, many of them they haven’t learned one thing in 10 months. In Asia, they learned to protect themselves and have the best chance for the future.

If Dr. Fauci is correct, approximately 264 million people will need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity. This effort will take 132 months (11 years) at the current pace of vaccination by which point the entire exercise will be moot as the virus mutates, thereby requiring that we start all over again. Or perhaps the virus will have burned through society to such a degree by 2031 that vaccination will become irrelevant. The accompanying misery and death will be physically and emotionally devastating and an economic catastrophe. 2021 and the years to follow will be bleak at best.

It sounds great that all these pharmacies have ""signed on"" to administer vaccines, but how? What about ultra-cold storage? Who will monitor vaccine recipients for 15 minutes after injection (as recommended due to allergic reaction)? 

I trust Biden will employ more federal resources and organization and provide leadership from the federal level, but it's still going to take a long time for enough of us to get vaccinated."
2020-12-31 14:51:44,"In NY, all available vaccine goes to regional hubs like Northwell Health (which has 23 hospitals). Our hospitals are swamped with Covid patients. They do not have enough staff, or space to give vaccines quickly to large numbers of people. They also do not have the funds to hire extra people or pay people overtime (nights, weekends) to give vaccines. 

The hospitals have plenty of vaccine they have not been able to get into arms. From now on, the vaccines should be given to urgent cares, outpatient clinics, and pharmacies. Also, to healthcare organizations which have already set up drive though testing. Drive though vaccination can be added. 

Hospitals are not experienced at giving vaccines."
2020-12-31 14:51:54,"Who could have possibly anticipated the need for a massive, organized, logistically complicated effort to vaccinate 300 million people?  Oh wait, absolutely everyone on the planet.

We could have spent the past year ramping up for this, with the highest possible national priority and resources (think a wartime footing) and best minds in both public and private sectors working on it.  Of course, in the most predictable event in human history, we didn’t do anything like that.

This is what you get when you elect a President, Trump, and a party, the Republicans, who oppose the very idea of governing effectively.  This latest failure will cost tens of thousands more unnecessary lives and untold economic damage."
2020-12-31 14:53:32,"Creation of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines has been an extraordinary scientific achievement. In March Dr. Fauci said it would take at least 12-18 months to develop a vaccine, and even that would be record time.

Still, the government (the Trump administration) had months to plan the rollout. Trump promised 20 million doses by the end of the year.

I don’t know if Trump deserves any credit for the success of Operation Warp Speed (probably not), but he certainly deserves the blame for over promising and under delivering. Another monumental failure of the Trump administration. 

Everything about this huge project will improve when Biden takes office. The president-elect has been a) taking responsibility and b) planning. What a welcome change from the past 4 years!"
2020-12-31 14:47:30,"Roll up your sleeves, gang, for another round of platitudes. (If only the vaccine could be distributed as freely.) Be patient! There's a light at the end of the tunnel! Stay home and watch some more TV! We'll celebrate when this is over! We're all in this together! Meanwhile, people are still getting sick, businesses continue to close, jobs disappear, and even the President-elect is gloomily predicting the vaccination process could take years instead of months. But that's okay: consumers are inured to being sloughed off since ""We regret your inconvenience"" replaced ""The customer is always right"" and ""not perfect"" became a perfectly legitimate excuse for inefficiency and incompetence. The snag this time is that the dissemination of the product is literally a matter of life and death. So to all of you Pollyannas who think you can assuage the situation by Saying Something, do us a favor: don't. We need action, not words."
2020-12-31 14:54:47,"To simplify, why not have pharmacies distribute by age? We know that age is the biggest risk factor, and it's checkable with an ID. This month we offer the vaccine to everyone 75+. If not enough people are getting the shot every day at their local pharmacy, drop the age limit in 5 year increments.

It's crazy that we're wasting so much time trying to figure out who is more deserving. Everyone benefits when we use up every last vaccine we have, as quickly as possible."
2020-12-31 14:54:56,"I'm still interested in seeing the number of vaccines delivered to the Federal government from Pfizer and Moderna vs. the number distributed to the states. I'm with the other commenter - if the vaccine is for everyone, set up in school gyms and have socially distanced lines to roll it out. Pay trained nurses to give the shot. Move across the country, a town at a time. Too cumbersome to vaccinate over time in drug stores – just get it done. Now."
2020-12-31 14:56:53,"So much for the Republican idea that local and state governments can do it better.  We’ve needed a competent and coordinate federal effort against Covid from the start and instead we’ve gotten bungling from a president who gutted federal agencies of career employees.  The states were clearly not prepared.  And storing the vaccines, let alone administering them, must be massively expensive, but neither the president nor congress is interested in giving states the money they need.  What a mess of a country we’ve become."
2020-12-31 14:59:33,"I’m an essential worker and will be getting vaccinated next week through my agency.  I can understand the slow process.  There are a limited number of shots and in this first wave are trying to prioritize to high risk and health care workers.  Those populations have to be identified and then you have to go through the banal logistics that make up life.

I had to email my details to the coordinator, along with three times next week when I’m available during my work schedule to be able to get the vaccination.  None of this is hard to understand in the specifics, but I think it is easy to miss all the little steps that need to happen add up and cause a wait.  

I imagine it could be a lot quicker if it was a free for all, but just think about what that would look like.  It would be nasty, ugly, and those who rationally ought to be getting it the most (elderly in care facilities, and health care workers) wouldn’t be able to hustle to distribution sites and muscle through the crowds to get the vaccine."
2020-12-31 14:59:47,"There is an attitude in health care - at least in hospitals, where I worked - in which people do not make decisions that they easily could because they are worried about getting in trouble, and so they delegate up the chain of command. It's like a pass-the-hot-potato type of scenario. Basically, fear is a big motivating factor in health care, and personal initiative is minimized. I would not be at all surprised if this culture is slowing down vaccinations. 'Oh! We have a shipment of vaccines! Let's wait until 'X' person gets here to make simple decisions like figuring out how to interpret the rules for who is vaccinated, etc etc.' 

Short story: implementing logistics on an emergency basis is not really hospitals' strong suit."
2020-12-31 15:03:55,I wish my state would set up a go fund me campaign.  I'd certainly contribute if it meant everyone got vaccinated more quickly.
2020-12-31 15:04:43,"When it was announced that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines worked and were safe, I felt no euphoria. Because, in terms of getting a vaccine to people in this country: the inefficiency, the logistical breakdowns, the disorganization, not to mention the line-jumping by elites and the powerful, were all fully predictable.  States announce elaborate vaccine-priority categories and timeframes, and I snort. A vaccine that has a six-hour shelf life once it's out of the deep freeze; how many vials have already been thrown out? How on earth can our fragmented healthcare system mobilize for a complex, nation-wide effort that's supposed to vaccinate hundreds of millions in a few months time?  Where do I even go to get vaccinated (at a fast-receding future point in time)?  Even though I'm over 65, I make no assumptions that I will get that job in my arm anytime soon, and foresee continued isolation and anxiety, for nine more months minimum - while a new, super-contagious variant sweeps the country."
2020-12-31 15:06:45,"In the 50’s we vaccinated for smallpox, measles and polio.  Every kid in school went to the gym and 500+ kids were inoculated in 1 day."
2020-12-31 15:06:52,"The map showing percentage of population vaccinated is misleading.  It implies that we will see a decline in Covid deaths and Covid hospitalizations proportionate to the percentage of the population vaccinated.  But that is false

We will not see a proportionate decline in Covid deaths and hospitalizations because the unethical and immoral medical workers at CDC have dictated that many millions of younger (under age 50) medical workers, teachers, cops, and politicians must be vaccinated first and that general public older Americans must be denied vaccination in order to protect these privileged younger millions of people

But people under 50 almost always have only mild illness from this virus.  Whereas, older people are the ones who suffer severely from infection and often die from it.  It is the older Americans who are 97% of the Covid deaths and 70% of Covid hospitalizations

If older Americans were vaccinated first, then the death count would already have begun what would be a rapid decline (since first vaccinations began over 14 days ago).  And, we would already have begun what would be a rapid decline in hospitalizations which would reduce substantially the need for all those medical workers in hospitals.  And as a bonus, it would reduce the risk of infection to all those medical workers since many fewer Covid patients would be in the hospital to be attended to

Instead, older people will keep dying while younger privileged workers escape mild illness"
2020-12-31 15:07:28,"The CDC has issued guidelines, not mandates, on who shall receive the vaccine and in what order.  As noted in the article the shipments were to hospitals and clinics. They, of course, administered the shots to their medical staff who see patients, then their executives, administrative and office staff who do not see patients. 
In order to vaccinate folks later in line, like old people and folks with conditions like diabetes they will wait weeks until the vaccine has taken effect (perhaps even until after the second dose). This is to avid risking their staff when exposed to the general population. This same situattion will likely occur when the doses are distributed to pharmacies.
So ordinary folk should snot count on getting the vaccine until several months have passed.
Cynical, perhaps,  but this is the real world and people look after themselves first."
2020-12-31 15:08:49,"My husband, a healthcare worker, received the 1st dose of the vaccine two days ago. A wave of relief washed over me and then the tears flowed. The daily worry about his risk of exposure has lessened. I hope everyone can soon experience this sense of relief and hope. Let’s get the vaccine out there!"
2020-12-31 15:08:55,"Perhaps the vaccine rollout is hitting snags because the best minds in the Trump administration are finalizing the details of the beautiful new healthcare plan he has promised “in a couple of weeks maybe” in the debates, throughout his time in office, and while he was running in 2016?"
2020-12-31 15:09:45,I wonder if the vaccine doses that have been distributed are now being refrigerated properly. How  many facilities have the ability to keep something way below freezing for days on end? I read that somewhere in Wisconsin some 500 doses were thrown out because they had been left out. That is tragic enough - what if that happens to thousands or hundreds of thousands of doses while the actual vaccination plans are sputtering?
2020-12-31 15:13:03,"Trump doesn't do details. He doesn't value, recruit, or retain leaders who are good at that either. Instead, we get chaos and confusion.

20 more days."
2020-12-31 15:13:28,"Once again we are not prepared not organized.
The Pfizer vaccine needs special care and the number to receive and especially the people that are supposed to receive them should be prepared before the vaccine arrived otherwise the vaccine will be given to non-prioriry people or sell.
To pay to the workers to receive the vaccine was a big mistake, education was needed.
We do not need the rich and famous to show that they received the vaccine, we again need education and the true.
The priority in nursing homes was a payback for the mistakes of the government and the nursing homes did. 
Priority should be the older living alone or couple and the poor living in large complex houses.
Stop treating a disease with a political mind"
2020-12-31 15:14:06,"As a commentator said yesterday:  We can get fast food 24 hours a day in this country in places and even GET free delivery sometimes. 

If we had the will to deliver vaccinations in the same way we crave pizza we'd be getting it done.

Should be 24/7 until the first round of vaccine runs out.  

TWENTY-FOUR/SEVEN"
2020-12-31 15:15:07,"They should have started hiring nurses and pharmacists to administer the vaccines MONTHS ago.
They should have determined what was needed to administer the vaccines MONTHS ago.
They should have selected sites MONTHS ago.
Somehow they managed to vaccinate millions of people within weeks of the H1N1 flu pandemic.
There were a lot of lessons that could have been learned in 2009."
2020-12-31 15:15:38,"Well let's see. I live in one of the Democratic areas of Republican Ohio and I am over 60 with multiple co-morbidities. I read multiple news sources daily. 

As far as I can tell, no one has identified what will be necessary to obtain an inoculation; other than first responders and the elderly will be first. Apparently it is up to the states to figure it all out and Gov. DeWine is too busy catering to fringe Republicans to do anything other than ask everyone to voluntarily play nice, wear masks and adhere to curfews.

The vaccine has been distributed to certain hospitals and other providers in a manner that is not entirely clear to me. I suspect if the issue was examined closely, it would be determined that distribution was based on political influence by the larger hospitals. Word is, at some point CVS, RiteAid or other pharmacies will be vaccination centers. No details yet available,

State government has had months to figure out a coherent framework and prioritization scheme for everyone. Instead we have an opaque process. Operation Warp Speed was supposed to facilitate logistics, yet the head of that project has been apologizing for his incompetence and, beyond sending far fewer doses to the states than needed, has essentially created one more layer of bureaucracy.  Most states unequipped to handle the problem.

This is a classic instance where the Federal government needed to take charge and get the job done on a bipartisan apolitical basis. Not happening."
2020-12-31 15:16:03,"Trump, needing loan: my property is worth $200 million. Same property for tax purposes, worth $20 million. Inflation of vaccine efforts, same deal.

How could we have believed otherwise?"
2020-12-31 15:16:44,"America's paramedics are ready (at an instant) to help.

This would turn every fire station in every hamlet or city into an emergency inoculation station.

And medics are trained to handle anaphylaxis already.

As for waiting space, just pull an engine or two out and setup chairs in the space for the 15-minute wait afterwards.

As for ramp up time, any Emergency Services Director could set this up in minutes, not days or weeks. (That's what they do for a living - instant response!)

Let's here no more of this nonsense about vaccines piling up because of poor planning, or some other critical resource missing."
2020-12-31 15:18:13,"Rather than trying to distribute the vaccine through a funnel by trying to prioritize this or that group, including even those who don't want to be vaccinated, why not open the process to who ever wants to be vaccinated. I'm sure there would be much quicker uptake that way. Follow the model of the regular flu vaccine."
2020-12-31 15:18:21,"If one person can give shot a minute that’s about 360 shots a day assuming someone else loads the syringes. 
And we need thousands of deep coolers for one of the vaccines. Sure CVS could give shots if they have a enough personnel and someone pays them to do it. They can’t do it for free, not hundreds of doses a day. 
As a healthcare provider I can tell you that giving 300 shots per hour is exhausting.

300,000,000 shots wow."
2020-12-31 15:18:36,"One would think The Coronavirus Task Force would have had quite some time to plan coordinate and organize the rollout before and during the FDA approval process.  

What happened?"
2020-12-31 15:18:38,"If we start to hear about vaccines going bad because of the delay, I expect to see prosecutions. This is absolutely inexcusable. There is not a single thing more important than this. NOTHING."

Why can't we do that approach now?"
2020-12-31 15:27:52,"Has the New York Times reported on the amount of red tape involved in vaccinating Americans?  About logjams at the local level?  How many forms are required?  How long is the review process?

We experienced this same problem when we needed to test quickly in the early months of the pandemic.  Government regulations and bureaucracies involved dramatically slowed the process.

Not saying these aren't needed but they do slow down the process dramatically."
2020-12-31 15:34:18,"The irony of this is that the very people great at administering vaccines and who are supposed to be group 1a, Primary Care physicians, are still waiting to be vaccinated. We are all registered with the CDC, most of us to administer COVID, yet we independents, who deliver care to rural America (the majority) have been left out. ACIP made a point of stating we should be on par with ER and ICU health care workers recognizing that we are testing and treating COVID and exposed first. But even more on point is our ability to deliver the vaccine. It is truly astonishing how little planning went into distribution and administration."
2020-12-31 15:38:57,"The one thing Donald Trump has done for this country is reveal its overestimation of itself. His chest-beating is actually a mirror of America's chest-beating. The hubris has brought us to a place among nations; that is, last place among nations in addressing the pandemic. Sure, Trump has played a major role in the travesty, but we are seeing now the weakness of our overall health care system and government. We like to boast of being the best and the brightest, just as Trump does. Maybe that is why so many love and believe him. In exposing this collective denial of hubris -- at least to those who are beginning to see the danger of it -- perhaps he has given us an opportunity to reassess, to recalibrate, to become sober and genuinely secure enough in ourselves to admit our faults, address them and become the country we only now imagine we are."
2020-12-31 15:38:59,"A worrying sign, when a significant fraction of the highest-priority cohort of hospital and emergency workers are reluctant to get vaccinated, and then the health departments lapse into a period of soul-searching to figure out what to do next.  It is the old problem of a river full of drowning people, how many can you save?  The answer is, one at a time!There is no time to reflect, you just have to jump in, start with whoever is closest, one at a time, and keep going as best you can.  It is the same with the vaccination puzzle, the enemy is time.  Every arm that gets vaccinated is a small triumph. We already know which groups are at high risk, and we know the ultimate goal of herd immunity.  The greater risk is delay.  I sincerely hope this reality is not lost on those unfortunate enough to have to confront this problem.  An elaborate goal-setting process, committee reports, public comment periods, motions to refer for further study, and all the usual trappings of policy development and rule making need to be set aside.  Just get the vaccine into as many people’s arms as possible, based on what has already been discussed.  It’s an emergency, after all."
2020-12-31 15:41:10,"The various excuses that officials offer for the dismal number of people so far vaccinated makes us wonder why planning for distribution and administering of vaccines didn't start last winter and, if it did, why it has been shown to be so poor. With all the faults of the Trump regime, nothing has made the US look worse to the rest of the world than the fecklessness of the (too many) levels of government and dozens of ""agencies"" involved, which has approached the level of parody. Seniors spending the night in line for first-come first-serve vaccination? Eleven months after the virus was detected? Officials blaming the weather? A ""shortage of people trained to administer the vaccine"" (in a country where pharmacists routinely vaccinate people)? Not enough money? What next? ""The person who deals with vaccines is on vacation""? ""We're moving to new offices""? ""The computers are slow today""?"
2020-12-31 15:47:56,"It’s important to remember that in the real historic world, to warp around a harbor meant that a crew would carry out the large ships anchor in a small boat some distance from the ship. They would lower the anchor and the ship would then pull itself to the location of the anchor. And then repeat. “Warp speed” was an excruciating  way to get around a harbor by modern standards. Sadly this is again reality differentiating itself from tv."
2020-12-31 15:50:58,"We are merely reaping the 40-year ideological project of neoliberal austerity and privatization. Our public institutions (and our trust in them) have been gutted across the board, and this is the result.

2020-12-31 15:51:34,"The problem started in the beginning when the Trump administration never took the advice given by the experts seriously and instead politicized it. States were made to fight for the ventilators, etc.  Absolute dereliction of duty to protect the people of this country, with dumping the decisions on unprepared people such as Kushner  who brought in his friends to do the planning. No  vision of seeing this as a war on the virus which would require an all out attack on the virus with federal mandates , etc.  also, the senate could haver done more but again played politics in a crisis... and here we have it...12021 cannot come fast enough..."
2020-12-31 15:51:58,"In the first two weeks of a smallpox outbreak in NYC in 1947, over 5 million New Yorkers were vaccinated.

2020-12-31 15:54:21,"I am completely at a loss to understand how/why ""hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes"" cannot be made vaccination centers for everyone eligible for a shot. To those, I would add large group medical practices which typically have thousands of patients. Why depend on CVS and Walgreen's when these existing health institutions already have the needed staffs and facilities. Millions of over 65s and people with comorbidities would jump at the chance to get this vaccine. Foot dragging at any level is inexcusable."
2020-12-31 15:55:42,"We lack health information systems in this country. Much of this lacking is actually mandated by antiquated laws like HIPAA that make it difficult for health information about individuals to be transmitted between institutions. If you’re trying to figure out who has risk factors, reach those people for vaccination, and maintain communication with those people over the course of a two-injection regimen, you need a modern information system, not the patchwork of fax machines and standalone systems we have today."
2020-12-31 15:07:14,"Compared to what the Trump Adm. promised, it's a snail's pace. Trump is pre-occupied and they've just dropped the ball. 

Another factor is shortage of personnel qualified to administer the shots. That's a big deal because medical personnel are already overwhelmed treating covid patients.

A friend of my wife is an RN who worked for years at UCLA Med. Ctr. She's retired and in private business, and now she has been called back to administer injections because they are desperate. Right now every 10 minutes someone dies from covid in L.A. County."

That the federal government feels no urgency, not only in distributing and administering the vaccine, but in even telling us why there are problems, is Incredible.

Even the reference to Biden's goal of 100 million vaccinations in 100 days (50 million people if it's the Pfizer 2 shot vaccination) while a catchy sounding goal, is grossly insufficient. At that rate we won't even have half of Americans vaccinated by July of next year. This is a war effort and we need to stop all the finger pointing and excuse making, get the right people in the solution room, and start pointing at what exactly we are going to do to get this effort done. We are failing."

Donald Trump simply didn't elect to hire the people who know how to do that!

Fedex, Amazon, UPS and others manage to deliver packages within a day across the country often using different pickup, transport, and final delivery resources for each package. Those numbers are beyond 20 million per day.

They don't simply drop the packages off at the border of each state and say it is now someone else's problem.

Donald, on the other hand has a history of failures and bankruptcies, so he doesn't hire experts, he hires people who are willing to lie and cheat and create imaginary conspiracies to cover up additional incompetence.

Trump could have gone to Fedex or Amazon and temporarily hired several members of their staffs to create a team of experts who could set up a vaccine distribution system.

He didn't do that because he himself hasn't the management skills to recognize the fact that vaccine distribution is a very, very challenging task.

The buck stops on Trump's desk. He didn't simply decide, like a real leader would, to get the job done. He gave vaccine production to organizations who already know how to manufacture millions of doses of vaccine, then he walked away and assigned the rest of the job to his toadies who don't have a clue.

Maybe he could get Rudy to come up with a far fetched tale about how delays were caused by Hunter Biden."
2020-12-31 14:57:04,"We should know by now that ""Warp Speed"" was just another Trump's marketing message.  He wanted to have a positive message to say during the campaign.  Now that the election is over, Trump couldn't care less about reality of getting it out.  How boring!  In fact, he's furious that the vaccines were not announced until after the Election.  That's all he and the WH administration care about.  The actual affect on Americans? Never a concern."
2020-12-31 15:09:33,"The administration tries to blame this on governors.

But first of all, only 70% of the vaccine they said would be INJECTED by the end of the year has even been SHIPPED, never mind actually used. The governors have nothing to do with that. It's the result of the administration's overpromising to begin with, combined with their and the military's incompetence in handling a distribution effort of this magnitude and complexity.

Secondly, the low rate of inoculations compared with vaccine on hand is due to the states' getting insufficient help from the administration to get the shots done. Once again, conservative aversion to spending on the hoi polloi, even in a life-or-death situation, is rearing its ugly head.

This has gone from Operation Warp Speed to Operation Snail's Pace. With the virus variant spreading now, they'd better get this sorted ASAP."

Their mantra today is “do as I say, not as I do”; completely outrageous, unacceptable, and no longer tolerable. We all have a political mess to fix, made by Trump and his equally corrupt Republicans who attacked our system of government and tried to overturn the will of the people. Bad enough that Trump led the COVID denial movement and admitted it. He did nothing as big business grabbed the stimulus money meant for the small shops fighting bankruptcy. No demand for cash back nor any penalty imposed to those guilty grabbers. Latest outrage – pols (aides, and subcommittee part-timers) cutting to the front of the line to get their vaccination. An office aide belongs at the end of the line, way after first responders, other hospital workers, educators, other school employees, etc. We watch as they hand out peanuts to the public, send millions overseas, and bundles of cash to pork matters – their own sweet (non-monitored) causes. And all pols get richer and more powerful with every passing year. Anyone else find it intolerable and want it stopped? That is, after the Republican pols who participated in the failed coup, led by Trump,  are nabbed, charged, tried, and imprisoned."
2020-12-31 15:45:41,Trump has refused to acknowledge federal responsibility from the get-go. It's no wonder he now takes a pass on any blame. But the fact is that Covid is a national problem within our borders. Every state must join in a coordinated response and only the feds can make that happen. I anticipate that efforts will gain organization under the Biden administration. Biden has experience in making government work. Unlike the current waste of space in the White House.

2020-12-31 15:51:16,"This is what happens when ""small government,"" ""government is not the solution--it's the problem,"" ""above all, cut taxes for the rich"" Republicans get control of things.  Well folks, those tax cuts aren't gonna get you a vaccine.  You can't hire someone to make one for you in the basement of your mansion in a gated community.  The federal government is uniquely positioned to promote the common good, but only if it is funded and has adequate expertise.  Trump's party stood by and let him eliminate the federal pandemic preparedness office.  They cheered him on as he put sworn enemies of departments in charge of them, and they rallied behind him when he blatantly lied to us all about the risk of this virus and our duty to social distance and mask.  If Republicans continue to have their way, you'll soon be on your own to figure out how to get clean drinking water, safe medications, and education for your kids.

This time governors and state health authorities have no one to blame but themselves, not Trump. And Biden's comments about using the Defense Production Act to accelerate vaccine production are a non-response obviously. What good are more doses when only a million per week are administered.

It is disgraceful that only a fraction of the vaccine units have been administered. As we have seen ad nauseam on tv, the administration is just a shot in the arm. And not one of these epidemiology experts seen on tv day after day offers any practical solutions to this problem, only blaming the federal government  in a non-specific way as the cause.

Completely ridiculous to say the least.

2020-12-31 15:45:45,This pandemic has revealed that our healthcare and administration process and practices are arcane and unable to handle a national health crisis. The need for a national health service type Org to handle the entire top down approach is lacking. It seems like the top orgs just want to pass the buck & no planning on how to handle the last mile to effectively get it to the masses. Even a poor country like India has one at national level called Universal Immunisation Programme which ensures the millions of its people are vaccinated. How did the worlds leader in science and medicine become so bad at this? Very disappointing.
2020-12-31 15:46:59,"The first question always is: Are Trump, Jared,or any of their ilk involved in selling the vaccine, rushing it to Red States, or affluent allies.  If not, why should we be surprised: 40% of American's cannot point to the Pacific Ocean on a map. Millions deny global warming or refuse to wear masks.  Even more frightening, millions support and vote for Trump. Perfectly logical that they would fail to refrigerate the vaccine or wonder what to do with it and fail to distribute any of it."

From managing healthcare matters, to supply chains
From the factory to the warehouse, to the consumers.

Start writing off the foreign patients
Their numbers would start dwindling soon.

O' sure, a number of them would 
Keep coming for the time being
Until Germany, France and Belgium have 
Trained translators in place

Likewise, American Experts' days are numbered, too
The world that used to marvel at our expertise
At our professionalism, at our dedication to duty
Now wonders what's gone wrong with us.

2020-12-31 14:58:28,"My wife is not a front-line worker but she does work at a local hospital. Expecting to have to wait until March for a vaccination she instead had one two days ago because so many front-line workers refused the vaccine; nurses mostly, but also police officers, etc. The nurse administering the shot was shocked that so many people she works with were refusing the vaccine. ""Too conservative,"" was her polite description.

This leads to a logistical nightmare in small rural communities where, once a vial is opened, it has to be used in 5 hours. In that, they were forced to send out shotgun emails asking anyone who wanted to be vaccinated to come in.

What happens when only one person in a small community shows up for a vaccination? Is the remainder of the vial then wasted? 


I've long said it, but there is no longer such thing as community spirit. A few ignorant, gullible people, listening to the self-serving words of an absent president, can ruin this plan for everyone. And at what cost?"
2020-12-31 14:46:33,"President Trump is working feverishly on this distribution problem in between putts on the golf course in FL. Of course while 3000+ Americans die each day, Trump is distracted by trying in the courts to overturn his loss in a recent election, collect political donations for his run in 2024 and worrying about his upcoming legal issues in the Empire State.

2020-12-31 15:05:38,"I can guarantee you that if the Republican National Committee got $10 for every vaccine that was administered, the country would be inoculated in short order.

A suggested plan of attack:
1. Distribute the vaccine.
2. Set up centers/use local resources to administer it.
3. Administer it.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 until everyone is vaccinated or we run out.
5. When we run out, make more, or be certain that we do not run out.

2020-12-31 15:58:46,"I think we are overthinking the roll out.  I agree with prior posts that we should make it available to all.  We should also make it easier to both the vaccinator and the one receiving the vaccine.  The governmental decision makers should think out of the box to greatly speed up the rollout.  Prior suggestions are great.  How about do-it-your self kits mailed out to every adult citizen in chilled packs (Moderna vaccine).  I spoke with a hospital administrator who complained about all the data gathering and sending that comes with being a source of vaccination.  Unfortunately, we seem to be stuck with our old inefficiencies and risk aversiveness; even in a pandemic."

But all Trump could think about was how he lost an election which he should never have won anyway due to gross, already-demonstrated, incompetence.  Based on what we saw over the past 10 months, for any American to have voted for Trump in 2020 was essentially an act of treason."
2020-12-31 15:18:55,The important thing to remember about Donald Trump is he never delivers.
2020-12-31 15:53:15,"Time to follow the Israeli example, with 24/7 vaccination sites. They have vaccinated almost 10 percent of their population. Military nurses should be deployed immediately throughout the country to administer vaccines. EMTs and firefighters at fire stations should also be mobilized. The United States has 1 million doctors. By now, all doctors and nurses should have been vaccinated at least once.  Like Israel, start vaccinating seniors over 60 immediately. Do not hold back doses for 3 or 4 weeks. Moderna and Pfizer have an excellent supply chain to provide those second doses. Letting doses sit in storage will just cause spoilage. Finally, the Israeli example shows it does not have to be chaos. Federal and state officials should copy the Israeli example instead of trying to reinvent the wheel."
2020-12-31 15:03:54,Gen Perna should stop holding press conferences. I never had any faith in this administrations assertions but each time I see him in front of a camera I have less faith and more certainty that he was chosen because he is as incompetent as he seems.
2020-12-31 15:42:45,"So 14 million doses are available but only 2.1 million people have been vaccinated, and the individuals in charge of Operation Warp Speed do not seem to have a detailed grasp of why (although “General Perna pointed to a few possible contributing factors.”)!? That’s completely unacceptable, given the critical, unique nature of our situation – the effect on the health of millions of citizens, the economy, & the many ripple effects on 330 million lives. It’s also where real investigative reporting is needed, and which this piece lacks: What IS/ARE the actual bottlenecks that really explain this disconnect (between doses available vs. the relative few administered), and what’s the relative importance of each? Shouldn’t this currently be the highest priority of journalists: Uncovering the specific inefficiencies preventing our most critical human resources (individuals designated to receive 1st & 2nd tier vaccinations) from being protected, thus lighting a fire under those responsible? We’re counting on you!"
2020-12-31 15:53:22,"Ok what is the level of funding provided in the just passed COVID bill to help fund the distribution of the vaccine to Americans?   It is $68 billion to purchase and distribute COVID-19 vaccines and help states conduct testing — $20 billion of that funding will make the vaccine available at no cost for anybody needing it.  After excluding the $20 million for direct purchases that means $48 billion or $146 to pay for the distribution costs to each person in America (population of 330 million).  That seems more than adequate to perform this function.  The problem with anything like this is the many hands (manufacturer. the feds, the state health dept., local health dept., actual health provide that will notify a citizen and perform the vaccination)  the vaccine will have to go through and therefore require a cut of this amount in order to do their job.  Also the games being played of who gets vaccinated first.  Controlling the distribution is power where along the way friends and relatives will secretly get to slip to the head of the line.  It is just human nature.  And yes as is the nature of anything in America some people will become wealthy just because they had a hand in this.  Now I think you can see why just like the response to the virus the distribution of the vaccine will demonstrate the worst of what is America.  Sorry to be so negative but it is the truth."
2020-12-31 16:02:54,"Talk about moving the goalposts.  Here we are well under a year before anyone ever heard of COVID, and, not only do we have a highly effective vaccine, which the scientists told us would likely take years to produce, we've already vaccinated about 1 percent of our population with over ten million doses in our hot little hands with many more to be provided in a few short months.   Can't we at least take a moment to congratulate the herculean effort that went into this all while we sat at home before we start up the complaints?  Our government did some things right here.  One of them was to open the check book and start writing checks without thinking too hard.  I'm sure we got robbed in a few cases, but this thing is going to be behind us in the relatively near future, and it's at least in part because the money was there to do the work.  The turn of events recently is pretty incredible when you think about where we were back in like June when it seemed like this might very well drag on for years..."
2020-12-31 16:05:11,"Lack of a stable infrastructure prompts several questions. How is the Pfizer vaccine protected from expiring before injection? How does a health care provider confirm that an arriving shipment was never allowed to thaw? How does an institution track how long since each vial was removed from deep cold? I worry that the percentage of people vaccinated is going to be inflated due to some small fraction of them receiving doses that are no longer effective - due to improper storage. Inaccurate percentages will muddy the models, the forecasts, the science that drives the effort. Also, anyone who unwittingly receives an stale dose may go on to adopt carefree behavior - and unintentionally become a stealth spreader."
2020-12-31 16:10:06,"I would not get the vaccine at a pharmacy given my history of anaphylaxis. There's no way they will be able to deal with that. Anyone at any risk should get this in a doctor's office that is equipped with a ""code cart"", meaning they can manage a life threatening situation."
2020-12-31 14:02:14,"As a physician, I can see that the federal government completely dropped the ball. Mostly because the people at the top (and you know who you are) didn't (and still don't) care.

There is a boatload of paperwork for every single vial of vaccine and for every individual vaccinated. There is no organizational plan to administer 660 million vaccinations for our country of 330 million. Look at the mess in Florida where it's a free-for-all for those over 65. If the government had planned and organized and utilized the National Guard in each state it wouldn't and didn't have to be this way. Each city would have designated vaccination centers, encompassing intake, documentation, vaccination and post-vaccination sitting areas (15 minutes after inoculation to watch for any allergic reaction). 

But no, the government just let it go. So now it's slow, disorganized and chaotic. And it just didn't have to be. The funds for this should be supplied by the feds, because states never anticipated this expenditure. This has been a disgrace. Look at how the UK, Israel and other countries have been doing. Because their national government is running those efforts. The feds have, once again, abandoned the people they're supposed to SERVE."
2020-12-31 14:46:12,"Gen. Perna, the man in charge of logistics, doesn’t have a clear understanding of why there are delays?

That sounds like a big part of the problem.

The other part, of course, is the inept Trump Administration.  

The vaccination of millions of Americans require planning and coordination with the states.  This is something the Trump Administration has really bungled, with regards to testing and the distribution of medical equipment.  And it requires money.  Now is not the time to be stingy, Republicans.

How are other more competently managed countries handling the large scale vaccination?"
2020-12-31 14:48:27,"Trump seemed to lay the blame on governors, saying that it was “up to the States to distribute the vaccines once brought to the designated areas by the Federal Government.” But several governors said their states have struggled because they had not received enough money from the federal government.

I just really cannot with this. You can't have it both ways people - you embrace giving and receiving federal aid in incredibly practical, essential matters or you don't. This is so endlessly frustrating and infuriating."

It seems clear that this is yet another example of Trump trying to set up Biden to fail. Pathetic, but not surprising that Trump - again - put's his own warped priorities ahead of Americans."

2020-12-31 16:17:36,"It’s abundantly clear that we have failed to plan for how we will distribute the vaccine to actual people.

The CDC guidance on distribution didn’t come until after the vaccines were approved.

Supposedly there’s an order of priority now to how they’re distributed, but how do you even get in line for it? I don’t think that line even exists. I’ve certainly never seen a “this is where you sign up for it” article. There should be a website for this. Secure and robust websites take time to build, has this work even started?

Where I live, CVS is involved in administering the vaccines, but they only started hiring additional staff to do the work in November. Hiring and training people takes a long time, I doubt the pharmacy chains are anywhere near ramped up enough to really handle the vaccine distribution at the rate we want.

There should have been plans in the works for all this and more..."

Pay nurses bonuses for vaccinating 500 individuals per day or more.  Federal and state governments need to copy Israel’s approach, which vaccinates 2 percent of its population each day.  The US is too focused on creating nonfunctional, useless websites that don’t do anything, instead of actually physically vaccinating people. Colorado is getting it right. Vaccinate older people immediately before the flood of casualties hits one million nationwide, which is where America is headed.  Vaccinate 24/7. This means vaccinating people at midnight, 2 a.m., however fast it can be done. Regrettable that those In our federal government cannot figure out such simple steps. Israel is vaccinating both healthcare workers and all individuals over 60, at the same time. It is bad to try to finish each “category” before starting the next “category”.  Just some ideas, in case a CDC or federal health worker is able to read this."

-I want to see state by state comparisons including their processes. I want to understand, in particular, how NYS (Monroe County) is doing it. What's the detailed plan? Not some nebulous, ever changing ""possible"" timeframe. Find best practices & share them with other areas!

-As for states/funding - well, what was more important in the Covid Relief Bill - funding Mitch's salvation of the horse racing industry (passed as part of the bill) or putting the money towards actual Covid Relief efforts? Think about it. The man is despicable & is still refusing to provide the $2,000 checks even though Trump supports that amount. Trump's criticism (along with many members of congress from BOTH parties - bipartisan - Yay!) was the first time I can recall agreeing with Trump. Unfortunately (& typically), the need to pass it was too great to stop it & rework it. The common folk had to settle for scraps.

-Laying distribution problem's at Trump's feet is a zero sum game. It may feel good. In reality, Trump checked out of governing after the election. Pence &/or those at the federal level could easily have stepped in & worked out a plan with the states.  Trump didn't care - likely no interference.

-Yes, it's not as easy as just giving a shot due to: temperature requirements, paperwork, etc. This could have been planned for (people trained, computerized forms versus hand written, electronic transmission of the data, etc.) We knew this was coming. The ball was dropped. Fix it!"
2020-12-31 16:27:29,"We don't have recent history with mass vaccinations so I'm not surprised that we are having issues.  However, I don't believe any of the recent excuses cover why we are doing so poorly at getting shots into arms.  There should be a small group of people with appropriate expertise at the federal  level who are going to go through the states with the poorest ratio of vaccinations to doses delivered and come up with a plan to speed this up.   This will be a continuing issue as we change populations eligible for the vaccine which will require different sites for delivery. 

 I'm really dubious about people having appointments at their local pharmacy.  Better to use a school gymnasium or other large room.  Have multiple lines of people and run them through.  Have one person swabbing and putting on the Band-Aid, one person giving the shot and an area for people to sit with a couple of people monitoring them.  If you have the Pfizer vaccine, keep it in multiple boxes filled with dry ice and thaw them out in lots throughout the day.  Send the Moderna vaccine to rural areas where dry ice may not be available."

So we're not doing worse than other countries; on the contrary, we're doing a great deal better than all other countries.  Interesting that this fact escaped mention here.  Rest assured that if we were lagging other countries, this fact would have been front and center."
2020-12-31 14:40:27,"This seems a little exaggerated. It's been less than a month. Health professionals are overworked and scarce. On top of that, the vaccine's recipients need to be put in observation for at least 15 mins, before releasing them to their homes, in case they develop an allergic reaction. It is not ideal, but if we've waited for 9 months, we can wait 9 more months as more people get vaccinated and things get safer. Let's be just patient."

My parents (90+) are in a reputable assisted living facility.  The administrator says they contracted with a big pharmacy chain for the vaccines, but haven't heard anything about when the residents will get them.  Big healthcare employers have begun vaccinating their staff, but folks like me who are self-employed in private practice have to wait in line with the general population, though many of my patients are frail, elderly and otherwise compromised.

2020-12-31 16:36:56,"It’s not at all surprising that the distribution of vaccine is woefully inadequate under Trump administration. This country’s two major crises, 9/11 and Covid-19, occurred during Republican presidents: Bush and Trump. The responses have been predictable: Gross incompetence. Bush killed more than 60,000 innocent Iraqis and ruined the lives of more than 40 million. He single handedly destroyed the nation’s economy. He also let the city of New Orleans drown, because help would have made the government look like a functional entity, contrary to the Republican ideology. Republicans do not want to govern; they want to drown the government in a bathtub (remember Grover Norquist?). According to Reagan, the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: “I am from the government and I am here to help.” Trump’s inaction (not invoking Defense Production Act, not planning how to distribute the vaccine, or simply accept the minimum criterion to save lives of millions of people, who voted for him) during the worst crisis of our lifetime is a proof of he is aggressively and purposefully destroying the government. What we are facing and living is a Republican world view, where government’s failure is a success for the party and it’s policies."
2020-12-31 16:39:58,"Let’s be honest- local hospitals are among the least efficient organizations in America. Why didn’t hospital administrators have enough ventilators? That’s their job, not the government’s.  These “non profits” have little oversight and generate big salaries. Make local hospitals administer the vaccine for free since they’ve billed millions for treating COVID patients. All local hospitals are concerned about it seems are “reimbursement rates.”"

That idiotic, and literally and figuratively suicidal, mantra has now killed hundreds of thousands of Americans through sheer inattention, laziness, and incompetence. Trump absolutely personifies the idiocy of this stupid approach to life, literally playing, either watching TV or  golfing all day, while the masses he's pledged to protect are mown down by the plague's scythe, as everyone from him on down seems to be nodding off at the switch on vaccinations, just as we've been all year on testing. What a shock that hyper-focused China is burying us in the fast lane, while we ""stay positive"" and distracted by our casual determination not to worry and ""be happy,"" no matter how many people are dying all around us.

A friend in Germany, which started vaccinating more than 2 weeks later than the USA made his online appointment for a vaccine for January 20 and February 11 yesterday. Arizona doesn't have a web site for reservations. The state has had since April to develop one. None was ordered to be developed. Next week, Arizona will probably begin receiving another 300,000 doses. According to its new priority plan, over-75s are in a sub-category that includes 1/3 of the state's entire population and they are last in that category. So much for retiring in Arizona. Under 35s will get it first if they operate a gas station pump. That's an essential industry. Last night, Governor Ducey issued an executive order seizing control of the distribution but without any plan whatsoever for distribution under his authority. It is total chaos in my state. The leading hospital chain in metro Phoenix has no room for elective surgery, no room for new virus patients and has readied ambulances to shift patients to anywhere they can. And, we have almost 300,000 vaccine doses in freezers. This is a third world country. Our politicians prioritize everyone so that they can run for cover. Not Governor De Santis in Florida. He, at least, knows what he is doing."
2020-12-31 18:09:45,"This is what happens with an incompetent administration.   Trump concentrated on ""Warp Speed"" and that's all he's capable of... and he wouldn't listen to anyone who comes up with ideas on how to implement efficient distribution.   

It also explains why Biden couldn't get info on distribution (to have a smooth transition)... there wasn't any plan."
2020-12-31 18:53:23,Please note that the vaccine was made immediately available to every member of congress and the Trump administration since they are consider 'essential' workers.  A better plan might have been for congress and executive branch to receive the vaccine the day after every other American that wants it has received.  Bet the process would speed up.
2020-12-31 19:20:16,"I suspect the vaccine rollout is slow for the same reason that the virus itself became so intense (due to people refusing to take precautions, etc) in the West: democratic government. Do you think an autocratic government like China would be experiencing these delays? They built 2 hospitals in Wuhan in, I believe, something like two weeks. I think China would have very little trouble getting a vaccine out quickly. In the West, our style of democratic government moves more slowly. It takes longer to make decisions and PLAN than if you have one central body or person autocratically decreeing how things are going to happen.

Try running a small group or non-profit organization. You can't get anything done, because a bunch of people sitting around a table need to agree on moving two steps forward. It takes forever.

Which is not to say I support authoritarian rule, god forbid, but I think this should be appreciated as one of the intrinsic macro-factors in the situation."
2020-12-31 19:14:25,"I am tired of explanations for why the USA's response to COVID 19 is an abysmal failure.  Instead of looking at what is not working and stopping that behavior, we make excuses for mediocrity.  

I knew when they put the military in charge of running the distribution of the vaccine it would not meet expectations.   For one, take a look at who makes up our military; mostly high school graduates and dropouts.  The military is NOT known for working with civilians or for great communication.

Who else thinks this would have been run better if Amazon had coordinated the distribution and scheduling of vaccinations?  What is pathetic is how Trump has once again told the states that they can do as they please with the vaccines they receive.  Well, how's that working?  Do you think that Jeff Bezos would have the success he's had with Amazon if he'd said, ""Okay, let's get these shipments to the 50 states and let them all do whatever they want to do.""?

When Obama had trouble with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, nobody died due to its troubled beginning.  Yet, you heard nothing but an uproar from the GOP about it.  Where is the uproar here from the GOP about Trump's (latest) failure, even though in this case, additional people will die needlessly?  Yeah, nothing from them!   They're too busy getting prepared to renew their whining about the deficit spending of Biden's administration."

2020-12-30 12:32:31,"The exact same thing happened in 1918. In brief, President Wilson's primary concern was readying the U.S. to enter WWI and nothing was allowed to interfere with those preparations. As a result, we shipped thousands of infected soldiers to Europe while keeping factories in the U.S. open. The rest is history.

The inaction on the virus flowed right on down to the local level where elected officials decried the severity of the disease in order to keep their economies forging ahead at full speed. Sound familiar?

There was nothing new, in terms of disease severity, transmission and the lack of public health directives, about COVID-19. Trump, like Xi, both ignored the warnings in order to keep their economies surging. 

And so here we are, again, with hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of infections and economies in tatters across the world. There are no excuses and yet both the Trump and Xi regimes continue to peddle their lies while the world burns. And the same government inaction can be seen with climate change. Only the repercussions there are going to make COVID-19 look like a blip on the radar as we lock ourselves into a disaster where there will be no vaccine."

2020-12-30 12:39:31,Quite an indictment of how bureaucracy and trying to tell others what they want to hear hinders our ability to do the right thing. Sadly none of these details even if they had been made known to us at the time would have affected how we in the West would have approached the problem.  China had a small chance and short window to keep it from spreading but botched it.  The problem has been amplified many times over since though and we have shown that we are equally adept and inclined to control and subjugate the narrative to other priorities as well.
2020-12-30 12:22:46,"It's really sad that we have 1.79 million and rising people dead because of bureaucracy, money and trying to save face. Just think how much different things would be if the world started to focus on this December 30th. Our government also acted in a defensive, face saving finger pointing mode and still is. Now the big game is number of people vaccinated, who can take credit and who to blame. I hope we can learn from this as a much bigger global tragedy is here, climate change/global warming."
2020-12-30 12:29:28,"I can’t help feeling that anything that China does, or fails to do, is automatically seen in the worst light.

It is stated without evidence that China could have contained the virus, and yet Italy failed, despite having had warning, and the UK and US also. Of all the nations, China has the best excuse for not containing a new (novel) virus that spread in presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We know that the market was not the source, so it was probably already spreading in the population, and could easily have made it out abroad before China became fully aware of it. There is some evidence that this may be the case (yet to be proven).

And if we are talking about denial and suppression in government then China actually compares well with the US.

So... please take a step back and show a little grace and self-awareness. The whole world needs more of this."
2020-12-30 12:22:02,"When the truth is silenced for the sake of politics, people suffer and die.  We seem to learn nothing from history.  A good example is the Pandemic of 1917 (Spanish Flu).  Many of the mistakes made then were made in this pandemic.

2020-12-30 12:33:43,"Let's imagine that COVID-19 emerged from our industrial animal farms.  Then ask yourself, would Donald Trump have shut down entire States/regions in the US as the Chinese did by closing off Wuhan, albeit 20 days too late?

I can't.  His reaction would likely have been as we see it today: ""It's no worse than the flu,"" ""it will go away,"" ""we can't shut down the economy,"" ad nauseum. 

While China's 23 day delay in closing off Wuhan came too late. (Viruses in population dense contexts need very little time to spark epidemics and pandemics),  exactly the same thing would have happened in the US.  Except-- as we can tell by looking at the current US response to COVID-19 -- its initial response would probably have been much worse than China's: a lot worse."
2020-12-30 12:48:40,"“We also spoke the truth but nobody listened to us, and that’s really tragic”. This one line observation reveals the fact of China’s propaganda myth “that the Chinese political elites win assignments and promotion purely on merit. China has sold this system as its own unique innovation. Developing countries have sent thousands of their government officials to China to learn its model of governance, a political system that offers security and growth in return for submission to authoritarian rule”. 

Operation successful but he patient died saying comes to our mind when talking of the pandemic that has since claimed more than 1.7 million lives and came too late to prevent the virus from spilling into the rest of the world. China has no right what so ever to claim its superior system of governance in dealing with Covid 19 like pandemic. 

If anything China’s Covid 19 ham handling clearly illustrates fallacious argument defending the superiority of one party rule over multi party democracy

It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who has been swimming naked. World and the Chinese people are getting a rare glimpse of how China’s giant, opaque bureaucratic system work — or, rather, how it fails to work. Officials are compelled to tow the party line and cannot afford making decisions, however good, that anger their superiors. 

Chinese bureaucracy does not make rules with the well-being of the people in mind is most revealing lesson of Covid 19."
2020-12-30 12:47:53,"The response to this Virus was an epic failure of leadership by Trump and congress, but make no mistake the China CCP is the villain in this story. 

China CCP knew they had a problem that would have eviscerated it's economy and in my view intentionally  kept outgoing international flights from Wuhan(but not within China) to spread the virus, thereby offsetting their economic problem.

While the CCP was addressing the Virus at home with lockdowns, the rest of the world was trying to figure it out; by the time they did (criticisms earned), the virus was well entrenched around the globe and Voila!!! the economic crisis was global.

China CCP needs to be held accountable and truly I hope Joe Biden has the stone's to do it; he should do what Trump failed to do, bring our global allies along for the cause."
2020-12-30 12:15:54,"I think that it's time for American people who were affected by The Virus to institute lawsuits in American courts against China for their negligence. 

Serve them with summonses and complaints. If they do not respond take default judgments against them. The Chinese have plenty of assets in this country to levy against. 

Let the lawsuits begin!"

2020-12-30 12:18:41,"Professor Zhang, the Shanghai virologist, is one of the heroes in this story, along with doctors in Wuhan. But of course the Chinese Politburo is only interested in manufactured narratives that create their own heroes. Dr. Zhong may be the equivalent of our Dr. A. Fauci, but the latter speaks his mind even when it’s not convenient to do so. 

But still left hanging and most troubling are those two vital phone calls Dr. Redfield received  from a contact in China. What did he do with that information?"
2020-12-30 12:09:39,"""China ultimately got control, both of the virus and of the narrative surrounding it. Today, the Chinese economy is roaring and some experts are asking whether the pandemic has tipped the global balance of power toward Beijing.""
Anyone who does not believe that Xi, the CCP and China, with the help of the WHO, did not affect the outcome of this global pandemic, is living in a bubble.
Xi, by keeping silent on just how infectious this virus is, was able to humble the economies of the Western World, while at the same time, stop the spread within China. In turn, Xi and China, are now recovering, while the rest of the World is reeling. 
Just when will the World, especially our ""allies"" wake up to China and its narrative to have ultimate control?"
2020-12-30 13:05:41,"""Politics stymied science”.
That says it all for both China and our own government.
Trump, in the early days, thumbed his nose at those learned scientists, made false promises, made grandiose statements that had no basis of fact, and to compound the issue removed scientists from China along with any cooperation as he continued to insult China.
Yes, the virus originated and spread from China and quickly spread throughout the planet.
Many will argue that Trump effectively slowed the spread by closing our southern border and stopping those from China from entering the U.S.
Naw, those actions were all for show and did little.

If we had a president attuned to science, and could act diplomatically rather than wield a cudgel, perhaps better cooperation could have been seen from China.

So, we dealt with the “China Virus” by unleashing the “Trump Virus”.  
And both are killing us."
2020-12-30 12:43:04,"To me it is comical that the west focuses on how the Covid Virus “Escaped China’s Grasp”. The west had a couple month’s notice, before the epidemic began to transmit widely in their countries. There was a total lack of leadership in the US and even in Europe. The west could have shut down completely for 2 months and ended this in the spring. The blood in the west is on Trump and other hapless politicians’ hands, not China’s. China’s authoritarian government had the ability to shut things down and they effectively did that. As a direct result, their economy was largely back to normal by late summer. In the west, politicians could  also have imposed drastic public safety measures. Think about the food rationing and blackout rules during World War 2. The western politicians were just afraid of how drastic action would affect their personal political fortunes. They put politics over science. I definitely have my problems with the Chinese government; but they actually performed brilliantly. Putting their reactions during the first month of the pandemic under a microscope, after the fact, is a joke. They reacted at “Warp Speed” compared to the west. They overcame their initial political instincts to keep it politically contained and threw their full might behind the public health science. The New York Times should not have wasted its time on this article."

The current administration’s pursuit of “herd immunity” has resulted in our being arguably the most infected, worst case in the western world. People say China’s numbers are understated. So are ours. But theirs are a fraction of ours. China did the world a disservice, but Trump has done America an even greater one."

Our entire world is upside down and although this investigative journalism is education and informative - why is this data not being used to punish or backlash China? In early April of 2020 myself and all of roommates had fevers so high we thought it was the end. Down with China and down with the communist government! The US government also failed to act in a timely manner and inform the general population. The administration took pointers from the communists it seems / I would not have been so ill - There would not be the high amount of unnecessary death if the communist government and American government had put peoples lives first over the economy. I do not trust any of our government even to this day and never will again - if this is to ever happen again I will not look to government for direction especially if I am in an urban environment - I will and suggest you all to take action yourself. Stop buying Chinese products - stop supporting their economy - stop supporting the stupidity that a select group of out of touch elitists really care about us! They care that we keep paying our taxes and vote. They don’t care about our health or those we love!

2020-12-30 13:18:48,There is no doubt China's missteps are many.    If managed well there could have been more control.   US is known for strategic investments and did make investments by placing scientists in China to collaborate  to proactively learn.   It is unfortunate that US pulled all scientists out of China thus cutting off any insights to get ahead.   US missteps added to the misery.      As the saying goes - When we forget the past we are bound to repeat it.   Hope US learns from the mistakes and takes steps to implement a learning process that is independent of the politics or the president in the interest of public health.

2020-12-30 13:44:33,"The parallels between the political interference in China and the political interference in the United States are chilling. In both countries, bureaucrats worked in a system where their status and livelihood were at risk if they took action based on scientific evidence if that action that threatened the country's leaders. 

Autocracy is based on asserting fear to achieve control and cling to power. Whether that's Chinese communism or Trumpist authoritarianism, the results are the same."
2020-12-30 13:51:30,"Strong reporting. Now, could we do a similar in-depth analysis of who and what happened at the CDC with the faulty COVID tests in February? What bureaucratic machinations (who and what) were in play at the FDA to prevent scientists in the US testing existing samples for SARS-CoV-2? And finally, while this investigation shows the danger of constraints on free speech and scientific communication, what can we do about unconstrained lies and conspiracy theories that permeate our current government and our media?"
2020-12-30 14:05:21,I find it amazing that in a detailed description of the origin of the pandemic in China the most salient fact is somehow if not lost surely buried. When people in China died in cities outside Wuhan who had never traveled to Wuhan human to human transmission was a certainty and a game changer. The CDC and WHO were not notified at that time. That was criminal. Planes were allowed to fly with infected people to Europe and then here while all flights in China were banned. That is criminal. The failure of our administration and CDC to respond adequately compounded everything and look where we are! Hindsight is 20-20 some will say. The failures in China and then here should never have happened and are not excused by that argument.
2020-12-30 14:10:32,"Any early missteps in China can be readily understood by anyone familiar with decision making in a large politically driven entity. Or any group over 10 people. If you would otherwise like to blame China somehow for the SARS-CoV-2 woes of the world, I suggest you first look homeward. The quote below, from this article, is most instructive if you replace the word ""China"" with ""Trump.""  And by the way, while the first few cases in the US came to the Pacific NW by way of China, the most dangerous importation came via Europe/England, after the bug had a chance to mutate a bit. So, blaming China for you sinophobes may seem rewarding, but it's just wrong. 

""Politics stymied science, in a tension that would define the pandemic. China’s delayed initial response unleashed the virus on the world and foreshadowed battles between scientists and political leaders over transparency, public health and economics that would play out across continents."
2020-12-30 14:15:42,"Why can we still not refer to the virus as the Wuhan Virus?  After all, no one objects to calling it the Spanish Flu even though it didn't even originate in Spain.  As a Spanish American, I find it deplorable but it's just another example of China's vice grip on the world.   

But even more to the point, what about investigating for real where it originated in Wuhan.  The Lancet itself said it was not from the market as China tried to, successfully it seems, promote.

We are doomed to repeat this if China is allowed to sidestep their role in the deaths and ruination of millions of lives!"
2020-12-30 14:30:53,"Fascinating reporting.  However, I fail to see the relevance in this piece vis-à-vis our current (first, second, third, fourth?) wave of pandemic.  The reality is that China is returning to normal and the Chinese economy is growing again.  China must have done something right in containing the pandemic and we need to learn from it.  Blaming the Chinese government and blaming the Trump administration for the pandemic at this point is like closing the barn door after the horse is gone.  NY Time will do public a great service if it focuses on the things that China did right in its fight against coronavirus.  In that respect, a piece on our ""shut-down"" vs. their ""shut-down"" or our ""contact tracing system"" vs. their ""contact tracing system"" would be very helpful in educating the public.  We can always assign blames after our country is back on track.  Now, is not the time."

He could speak, he had a voice, he could have gone public."
2020-12-30 14:45:24,"It’s been incredibly sad and frustrating to see how badly the US and the Trump administration handled this pandemic.  In essence Trump’s approach of downplaying the severity through sidelining scientists and leaders who said otherwise mirrors China’s political action from Wuhan.  And more ironic that he continued to blame China for the suffering we now find ourselves in.

Whatever comes of these vaccines, the WHO needs to get on the same page in planning and approaching a sever medical emergency worthy of a pandemic.  We cannot and should not tolerate political intervention like we’ve seen from Wuhan’s local government and the Trump administration."
2020-12-30 14:52:53,"I remember hearing about the covid outbreak and thinking that it would be similar to the SARS, where it was isolated in third world countries. Equating these two diseases was a huge mistake. The appropriate alarm was never sounded. Had the President set the example early on with mask and truthful reporting Americans would have made the sacrifices that needed to be made.

We can blame Trump, of course, but the election cycle is as much to blame. The course of history is changed and adjusted by the American election cycle and the natural urge to cling to power. Trump, has the added incentive of enjoying immunity from prosecution as long as he’s in the White House, something that I don’t believe is mentioned in the Constitution. (Commenters, please correct me.)

This immunity question should be examined more thoroughly. If elected Presidents still had to confront illegalities while sitting in the White House, people like Trump would be loath to run in the first place."

""Human nature"" strikes again!"
2020-12-30 14:41:11,"""As its trade war with China escalated, the Trump administration had all but eliminated a public health partnership with Beijing that had begun after the debacle of SARS and was intended to help prevent potential pandemics. By pulling out, current and former agency officials say, Washington cut itself off from potential intelligence about the virus, and lost a chance to work with China against it.""

Along with China's repressive government tactics, the US bungled the chance to gain information and report honestly about the virus. Instead, without forethought but with his usual self-serving visions of grandeur, the US president chose to withdraw from China's sidewinding attempt to thwart verifiable data about the COVID 19 virus. I fault the US president's stubborn and shortsighted measure as much as I do the fakery coming from Xi."

Recall that before the Lunar New Year, on Jan 23rd, China issued a declaration that all airline flights and train bookings would be eligible for free refunds.  That declaration applied Nationwide, not specifically to the Wuhan area.  Just imagine if a similar declaration had been made by the US government.  It gives you an idea of how broad the fear of infection was there."

2020-12-30 14:02:38,"Science trumps. China grudgingly succumbed to science and acted ferociously. The US under Trump never did. If it did, very  late and halfheartedly after intense pressure and did not use all federal resources. America will feel this irresponsibility for generations."
2020-12-30 14:42:50,"Blaming China?
1.  Even if it had not misstepped, would it be able to contain the virus (if indeed it is the origin)?
2.  If China sounded the alarm in real time, would the West listen?
3.  On Feb 3, 2020 Wall Street Journal published an article reminding us that ""China is the real sick man of Asia.""
4.  Japan finance minister said in G20 finance ministers meeting  late February, in response to his concerns on the issue of virus, European counterparts told him that it was Asian disease, having nothing to do with the West.
5.  For many months that follow, see how the major Western leaders responded to the issue.
6.  If there is any nation that can be excused for the misstep, it would be China because no one has never seen the likewise virus (1917 was the long gone history.)
7.  Having seen how China and the countries around it battled the disease, what were we the West doing?"
2020-12-30 14:22:08,"While maintaining a strict no-travel mandate from Wuhan to other parts of China, the government, not alerting the rest of the world to the danger, allowed air travel from Wuhan to other countries. Such action can only have one conclusion, Covid didn't actually 'slip through' China’s grasp to become a pandemic, it was deliberately spread throughout the world."

2020-12-30 14:57:56,"Good coverage.  Hard to swallow some observations:  WHO was there and didn't know.  NIH has grant research there; CDC many ties including thousands or researchers trained and many now colleague of US CDC people including the Director.  

With person to person spreading known we can also assume that Officials knew that they were allowing travel to the world they were allowing a potentially, now confirmed, deadly virus to spread.  Knowingly abetting killing is a capital offense.  China has much to confess and seek to remedy the harm.

However, this is an excellent overview.  It is now time to see when and how we knew or should have known what was happening.  When did CDC officials learn of this virus?  December of 2019?  What happened in our earlier testing attempts?  Things happen; it is not to punish or impugn but to understand when and how we might have responded earlier and better.  NIH has grants inChina, many contacts including those of Dr. Fauci, our most go-to person on these issues.  What did we know, when, and what happened.  It is time to examine this in-depth."
2020-12-30 13:48:29,"I agree that Trump's handling of the pandemic was both incompetent and self-serving.  

But, despite the data that may have been emerging from Europe in fall '19, I can't help holding Xi Jinping and his CCP accountable.  Why are we afraid to say this?  Why are we afraid to call him out vocally and frequently?  He had the power to sound the alarm earlier, but chose not to.

Free nations must speak up and speak out more often, not just against Xi, but Putin, too.  Look at the human suffering that has resulted from Xi's selfish obsession with power."
2020-12-30 13:52:57,"Things might have been very different if Trump hadn't destroyed our early warning system by pulling our infectious disease experts out of China. They would have amplified the voices of Chinese scientists trying to get the authorities in China to take the virus seriously, especially if they were strongly backed by the US government, and they also would have warned the US and the world early on to take this very seriously."

When there is an ongoing disaster caused by Trump, who successfully localized a China virus into an American one, it is more helpful to remind the US people that wherever the virus came from, it is their own responsibility to take precaution measures to stop the pandemic.  They should not continue blaming China while taking no action to stop, or even worse, spoil themselves in activities that help, the spread of the virus.

I’m concerned that this article might boost biases more than help with waking people up."
2020-12-30 13:31:46,"A well written piece based on outstanding research. As much as I hate to bring Trump into this (sigh), his withdrawal from the WHO surely didn't help matters any."
2020-12-30 13:31:11,"As in all human endeavor, leadership matters. It especially matters when science shows us the way and politics shows us our fears. This global pandemic would have been avoidable if politicians showed the same courage as scientists. The blame here belongs with Xi and Trump for being small minded, self interested, and uneducated."
2020-12-30 13:45:53,"There's plenty of blame to go around, but let's make sure to thank the American People themselves, for refusing to wear masks, refusing to social distance, refusing to be inconvenienced at all, to help curb the spread. Look at what's going on now, to try and stop New year's Eve parties, and gatherings. It's sick and twisted, how someone's ""need"" to drink a plastic glass of champagne, is more important than the pandemic."
2020-12-30 14:50:48,"It is indicated in Bob Woodward’s latest book that China might have deliberately let the virus slip out. This way, they could count on every other country having the same disadvantages on the world stage. I tend to believe that there was a discussion of that sort in the highest ranks of the communist party in China."
2020-12-30 14:06:10,"How sad it is that the Times presents a highly flawed and incomplete view of what happened. The Rand Corporation has stated that the Chinese knew they had the early stages of an epidemic on their hands in Wuhan back in the summer of 2019. Since then, the Rand Corporation reports that the Chinese government consistently understated infection and death statistics by up to a factor of 40.

Clearly, the Chinese government made cold calculations regarding how its country would respond to COVID.  They knew early on that if they did nothing that COVID would likely spread globally resulting in massive human suffering directly and economically. But they calculated that via their authoritarian dictatorship that is fully capable of such current day atrocities as the Uyghur concentration camps, that China would emerge from its initiated global pandemic the political and economic victor. Hence, no travel restrictions within China and globally for example.  

I have worked in China (systems engineering research scientist) and can tell you sad stories. What those experiences taught me and have been affirmed many times since is that the Chinese government is interested in maintaining their control at any cost.  They see the world as a zero sum game.  So, for them COVID is just another opportunity to solidify their position with China and win yet another economic victory over the now shutdown western economies."
2020-12-30 13:57:11,"With respect to pulling US public health professionals out of China, the Trump Administration, in prosecuting its fruitless trade war with China, would have done well to remember the adage, “Keep your friends close; keep your enemies closer.” Having at least some situational awareness with assets on the ground would have been better than flying blind, to say nothing of the public health and scientific benefits that accrued from these programs."
2020-12-30 15:02:03,"The truth will out. In the US the press is (for now) better protected and able to expose the government's blunders in controlling the pandemic. Now we begin to see that China's officials are just as culpable. Both nations failed at adequately protecting their citizens, and both, equally so, need to answer for their lapses."
2020-12-30 15:02:10,"Good investigative work.  Clearly there were multiple weak links in the chain of events.  Perhaps the expedient action to avoid panic was to throttle communications which, in this case, turned out to be a disaster.  

What we got from labor arbitrage with China over multiple decades was more than squandered away--economically and in loss of lives--in a few months of this virus.

Where and how did this get started?  The Chinese regime owes us a root cause analysis but it seems like we are letting them off the hook."
2020-12-30 15:10:29,"As a global professional, I have friends, acquaintances and colleagues from different parts of the world, including China. I think that the catastrophic losses associated with Covid 19 can be attributed to the decisions of the political leaders of China and the USA for attaching precedence to economic interests over human interests as US and China are two largest economies of the world. 

Two of my businesses acquaintances visited their families in China during the last lunar Chinese New Year when the festivities coincided with the emergence of Covid 19. Pandemic related news was not well known in China at that time. The Chinese government didn’t want to disrupt the economy. 

Based on Trump’s conversations with Bob Woodward, our government was motivated by similar concerns for not acting proactively publicizing Covid 19 in order to avoid economic downturn during the early part of this year. 

As Covid 19 started to spread dangerously in Wuhan, the Chinese leaders acted aggressively to contain it. However, Trump continued to downplay the spread in our country, for the pursuit of his political agenda to win the re-election on the basis of a favorable economy. His actions amounted to reckless endangerment of innocent human lives as currently one American continues to die every thirty seconds. 

Let’s also not forget the complicity of the political parties: Communist Party effectively made Xi, President for life by removing the 2 term limit. The GOP chose Trump over our country."
2020-12-30 15:14:21,Excellent reporting and forensics by all who worked on this story. Well told.
2020-12-30 15:11:41,"This is why public health and responses to communicable diseases should never be left to politicians.

We need strong, science based agencies with the power and force to shut down economies if required."
2020-12-30 15:07:09,"If we learn nothing else from the debacle of the US's handling of the virus, let us at least learn this:  it is critical to have a president and state leaders who respect science, even if they don't understand it.  

This won't be the last virus we have to deal with.
And what is so mind boggling is how half the country can fall for Trump's pointing the finger at China when he and his minions spent the better part of the year lying about the virus, downplaying the seriousness of it, and then abdicating responsibility for handling it."
2020-12-30 15:12:41,"“If we’d had 100 people in China, it would’ve made no difference given that the Communist Party was determined to keep our people in the dark,” the spokesman, John Ullyot, of the National Security Council, said.""
   The Communist Party of China and the World Health organization are totally responsible for this pandemic. The W.H.O was praising Beijing and concealed concessions to China and sacrificed the best chance to unravel the virus origins.
    On a cold weekend in mid-February, when the world still harbored false hope that the new coronavirus could be contained the W.H.O team arrived in Beijing to study the outbreak and investigate a critical question: How did the virus jump from animals to humans? 
   At that point, there were only three confirmed deaths from Covid-19 outside China and scientists hoped that finding an animal source for the coronavirus would unlock clues about how to stop it, treat it and prevent similar outbreaks.  What the team members did not know was that they would not be allowed to investigate the source at all.  ( from a NY Times article)
   The Chinese authorities are now trying to rewrite the narrative of the pandemic by pushing theories that the virus originated outside China 
    In recent days, Chinese officials have said that packaged food from overseas might have initially brought the virus to China.  Chinese Scientists have released a paper positing that the pandemic could have started in India, that is ridiculous."
2020-12-30 15:18:56,"So unless people would have been accepting to have Americans stranded abroad by completely closing down all travel into the US and also travel within the US until every person in the US would be vaccinated, stopping or even limiting the spread of the virus is virtually impossible.

Yesterday the NYT published an interview with a student in China who got vaccinated so she could travel to the UK to continue her studies. 

First of all, why is the UK allowing people from abroad into their country when the virus shows no signs of easing?

Even if people are vaccinated with vaccines developed in China, there’s no evidence these vaccines work, so why allow foreigners enter the country.

So is it wise to allow people to travel between countries this soon when few people world wide have been vaccinated?"
2020-12-30 15:01:42,"Infectious disease experts should have assumed from the beginning that the virus spreads from human to human, instead of assuming a best case “only animal to human transmission” and hoping that closing the seafood wet market would end the problem.  When the start of a global pandemic is at your doorstep, a set of cautious assumptions should be assumed to contain the damage.  China hid things, yes, but the “assume the best until proven otherwise” logic of the WHO and CDC was backwards and flawed."
2020-12-30 15:24:03,"None of this is surprising, and because it is China. As we see in America there is great conflict over balancing mitigation with economic interests. We have seen time and time again that our leaders have downplayed the virus while their opposition (Democrats) shout the loudest about its destruction. China does not have as robust political opposition. The point is that leaders will always tend to downplay an epidemic because the one thing they fear most is the economic decline and the unpopularity that brings. 

It seems that the lesson we are drawing on this is that China is bad but instead, we need to look at how we can successfully balance public health and economic needs in the midst of a political economy. Even here in the US with an open media and vocal opposition, the Trump administration and fellow Republicans downplayed the virus failed to react quickly enough. Indeed, Trump is still dragging his feet. We can complain about China not being vocal enough in January but by February we had no excuse for not being vocal. And even by October we still have places like Florida firing data analysts and hiding numbers. Millions of people are still crying hoax to this day. So it seems strange to nitpick China's response so early in the game when with all the information we can't even roll out a vaccine properly one year later."

2020-12-30 15:03:29,"For those who don't trust China's numbers, I just have to say, as far as I can tell (as an American who lived through the whole thing in Shanghai), they are off by no more than a few times. Unfortunately, this article stops at the Wuhan lockdown - you have to understand that all cities, like Shanghai, were locked down in late January harder than anywhere in the US to date. When Shanghai had 10 confirmed cases, everyone had masks on, temp checks were everywhere, and you needed permission slips to leave apartment complexes for a month. This is why the number only became about 1,000 cases in Shanghai by May (and barely higher today).  Massive response and compliance.

A month ago there were 7 confirmed locally transmitted cases in Shanghai.  Again, they locked down all the apartment complexes of those patient for 14 days.  Tens of thousands were tested and quarantIned. Heck, the rest of Shanghai couldn't even book a hotel for two weeks (phone health code changed to red font for Shanghai).

The upside is that no one needs to wear a mask.  I've eaten at restaurants maybe 50 times since the spring, and so have everyone I know. No one has gotten Covid.  That's why the 4700 dead, 96k cases are pretty close to real  - the disease was effectively smothered outside Wuhan in the first month.

The initial lies and cover-up? Horrible. But the actual response to the epidemic? Extremely effective - and worth it."

But the Trump administration pulled nearly a dozen public health experts from Beijing months before the outbreak — effectively closing the eyes of the American government to disease threats from China.” This is what happens when someone with an antisocial personality disorder is elected President."
2020-12-30 15:21:32,"Fair points. Despite the fact that there was plentiful governmental interference from Chinese doctors, when the government finally acknowledged the disease they acted accordingly, unlike the US.

2020-12-30 15:24:56,"Why is this article so mild, and so modest? Why does it tiptoe so carefully around the truth, offering little more than face-saving, lip-service criticism?

The Chinese have been lying about virtually every detail of the Covid-19 pandemic from the beginning and continue to do so. The early official epidemiological data released by the Chinese government was obviously manipulated, with actual case numbers reduced by orders of magnitude. The failure to seal off Wuhan from international air travel while simultaneously quarantining the city to prevent domestic transmission is impossible to excuse.  The corruption of the WHO by the Chinese government, especially in the early days of the pandemic, has not been explored. Very great questions regarding the Wuhan Virology Laboratory and its containment procedures have also not been sufficiently explored.  Obvious questions regarding the disappearance and death of early whistleblowers in Wuhan and elsewhere have gone entirely unaddressed. 
If the NYT won't ask the hard questions, who will?"
2020-12-30 15:12:24,"Castrating our cooperative efforts with China’s CDC was a decision that cost so many lives.  We pulled our scientists and doctors in China as well as in Washington DC under the command of the current administration before this virus hit.  It was those in DC who chose to deny the Obama era  “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents.” What happened to our pandemic response team established under Obama? If this team were still in place, I wonder how differently things might have gone."
2020-12-30 15:28:52,Great reporting but the case in China only foreshadowed the failures of the Trump administration to confront the pandemic.  We received the virus sequenced gene from China and the knowledge of its human transmission by early Feb.  and then began the disinformation campaign at home.  Trump hid from the public the air borne transmissibility of the virus and minimized the protections afforded by the wearing of the masks.  Even now the government has been lax in checking the transmission of the more viral mutation discovered in the UK.  It has done almost no gene sequencing of US infected individuals as has ben done in the EU and elsewhere (the fact that a non traveling person in CO. has been found with the gene only shows that it has been here for some time).  It could be said the whole strategy of the Trump administration has been to further the opaqueness of knowledge that was only started in China.
2020-12-30 13:45:06,"There is no doubt China botched this up initially and should be held accountable. But if there is one person responsible for the 300,000 deaths here in America, it is none other than Trump. He has blood on his hands for sheer negligence on his part regarding this matter. Never mind the fact that he called it a hoax by Democrats and repeatedly refused to acknowledge that it was a pandemic of great proportions and frankly did very little to address and stop its spread in the US including telling people not to wear a mask."
2020-12-30 15:42:54,"Thank you for this excellent history on what happened as the crisis unfolded. I too marveled at the astonishing speed and depth of China's no holds barred response once the central government grasped what was at stake. I wish I had something, anything, to marvel at  regarding our own response."

2020-12-30 15:44:54,"The underlying problem was adherence to a top down public narrative. Any contrary opinions and observations even by experts were punished.

One can only hope that someday the same team that created that program will prepare a similar dramatic representation of the 25 days described in this article. 

This article says the attempt to both suppress and rewrite history by the Chinese Communists continues to this day.  We should be concerned that people around the world are afraid, for one reason or another, to upset the Communist leadership in China.

For this reason, the New York Times deserves great praise.  Surely the leadership in China is upset by this article.

I hope our technology leaders, which is to say Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and others, took no part in the early suppression of the news about the COVID-19 virus. Even now, I wonder if they will subtly suppress the spread of links to this excellent article."

However, COVID19 is so easily transmissible that the it was already too late by the time they recognized that they were dealing with a new pathogen.  There is compelling evidence from blood bank specimens, that COVID19 was already present in NY in December 2019.  I treat several patients who, in retrospect, had classic symptoms back in November 2019 and who much later tested positive for antibodies.  Whether or not we were notified weeks earlier is really a mute point.  We missed the opportunity to slow or modify the spread in the US because of our own failing in leadership in the CDC and the White House.  It was not until this summer that WHO or CDC even begrudgingly agreed that the virus was aerosolized.  There was very good scientific evidence of aerosol spread very early on which seemed to be ignored for to preserve the supply of “PPE”.  I work in a hospital setting and continue to treat COVID.  I have worn an N95 mask from the beginning and have still avoided being infected.  I used the common sense idea of using “universal precautions”  which assumes everyone you treat is infected.  This is a concept dating back to the HIV pandemic in the 1980s when I was in training.  Even today, wearing N95 masks in the hospital is not required or encourage except when in very close up, direct contact with an infected patient."

2. Airlines and countries started banning travel that week. At its end, Trump issued restrictions—not a ban, restrictions—Jan. 28. There was no screening or tracing attempted. The Trump government was informed, and US cases were confirmed at about the same time.

3. The first US government ACTION came almost two months later. Even warnings were essentially censored. When action did come, it was weak and ineffectual, with Trump screaming every step of the way. The pattern has continued.

4. Despite the yack about media repressing China’s foul-ups, I knew about them at least six months ago. How? I read the paper, and listened to the news. They were extensively reported. So was Trump’s having yanked our scientists out of China and busted up our preparedness the year before.

5. Also reported: that our national response has continued to be a mess. That as we were told would happen, December has been a disaster. That we’re being told by CDC and the other grownups, January will be worse. That the vaccine rollout has been iffy. And since last Wednesday, Trump has played golf at least four days.

The same is valid for the coronaoutbreak in Wuhan China frightened local officials deny the crisis and thus let it spread without active drastic steps taken early in the process that could have controlled the outbreak .

The UK scientists and medical experts seem to be way ahead of the rest of the world on guidance about this virus. They informed the world about steroids , then they found the new variant.              ( because they were looking for it) now they have the vaccine that is going to lead the world out of this .

This is a disturbing and well researched story of how an autocratic government’s paranoia turned what could have been an epidemiological blip into a global pandemic. It’s deeply dispiriting to see the educated readership’s principal takeaway being BUT TRUMP BAD TOO!! 

I am happy Trump will be gone in January, for many reasons. But the Chinese Communist Party will still be here, and so will COVID. Hopefully we as a nation can pick ourselves up and start addressing those challenges, among others, in a meaningful way, rather than the short-sighted and politicized blame game that’s all too common on both the right and (sorry, all) the left.

2020-12-30 16:03:48,There's a great move on to credit Trump with the rapid creation of vaccines.

From the NYT, February 7, 2020:

“A major epidemiological failure by China is that the Wuhan authorities appear to have closed and disinfected the seafood market that was the outbreak’s early focus without swabbing individual animals and their cages and without drawing blood from everyone working there. That would have provided a wealth of information about which animal might have been the source of the coronavirus and which people had become infected but survived.”

Sure, it's fine to analyze (as if China's autocratic government will ever respond to criticism), but the narrative in the US, even from the NY Times, is far too critical, blaming China for the outbreak. Honestly, if the west had responded as China did (imperfectly, but in the end, effectively), we wouldn't be where we are now. And we continue to be completely stupid about it. Plank in your own eye and all that.

No, China is much more a model nation to emulate. They shut the thing down. Most of Asia did. ""Advanced"", western democracies look feeble and out of touch in comparison, only feeding the propaganda of autocratic nations like China that ""their way"" is safer, more economically viable, and the future of the world.

(Yet deride the empirically impaired conspiracy enthusiasts of the right while they imitate their thought process and behaviours)  Especially if it's something negative about China. So. China's success in dealing with COVID since its early weeks fumble is all smoke and mirrors? I live in Shanghai and travel in China. What happened in Wuhan was ""real"" as was the lock down and follow up that got the virus under control as did similar measures by South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong who all followed the basic public policy 101 procedures enacted first by the Chinese including masks (gasp!) lock downs, developing smart phone tracking apps, novel treatments, vaccines and testing etc... Are the data coming out of all those other East Asian countries untrustworthy as well?
Sadly, predictably and laughably China's current success in managing the problem which now enables them to help others is dismissed by people who can't get it together enough to wear masks and lock down when other people's lives are at stake. 

The US is going to find itself ever more isolated in it's logic free anti-China delirium but the population has been so primed to hate China by the US media over the last 5-10 years it may not matter.

2020-12-30 16:13:15,"By the way, the worst you can say about China on this is: as in all authoritarian régimes, there’re very strong reasons for underlings to try and avoid bringing Bad News to the Leader.

2020-12-30 16:40:41,"It appears much more could have been done early on to prevent the spread of the virus within China.  That said, once they focused upon controlling the virus, the virus was greatly curtailed within China.
Most western nations have not employed such measures to contain or control the virus. The article suggests, the disease could have been curtailed by as much as 95% in the early weeks had China been more diligent.  
So is China fully to blame?
1) China's initial response was slow.  Let's say had they been faster, then 95% of the cases in the original outbreak may have been avoided (as the article suggests).
2) China's response seemingly was effective once they took the virus seriously.  
3) Most western nations have not controlled the virus to the same extent as China.  They are unwilling to employ the same measures.

If China had acted more swiftly and the outbreak contained to 5%, was this still enough to allow the pandemic to occur?  We could not expect other nations to react any better than they did.  Perhaps the pandemic would have only been delayed?  I'm not sure that China is solely to blame here - lots of blame to go around.  I do not possess the mathematical skill to assess the crucial tipping point here.

If China had purposely decided to allow the virus to spread via international flights whilst taking measures to control the virus internally, then blame could be weighted much more heavily on China.  Evidence of that?"

But the responsibility for exponential and uncontrolled spread lies squarely on the shoulders of American citizens and American leadership.  Know how many new cases Australia had yesterday? NINE.

The number of people who have died worldwide as a consequence of actions by the US government is staggering. The US is an incubator for the virus, and by refusing to shut down its airports it continues to spread it around the world. Furthermore, it works to maintain incubators in other countries by destroying those country's health systems as an act of war — namely, Iran and Venezuela. Where the big flashy headlines about this scandal?

If the US has caused 100,000 surplus deaths, does it get to just sit on its hands and say ""well, it's not our fault because the virus should never have existed in the first place""? What if it causes a million deaths? The Times's skewed coverage of China's miraculously successful coronavirus response reaffirms the principle that not all deaths are equal; they count much more if they are caused by our official enemies."

The reason they would give this answer is because the foremost experts on coronaviruses, particularly those which reside in bats, conduct their research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If anyone would be best equipped to detect and stem the spread of a novel coronavirus, it would be the experts at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

And yet, despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first detected in Wuhan, as the article reports, ""scientists have little insight into where and how the virus emerged...""

Our own CDC leader, Redfield, you state was ""constrained by politics"" and that Trump had pulled our health experts out of China (you don't explain that well). Trump's white house also ignored documents for pandemics. And in both China and US, it appears scientists were ignored. Blame looks 50-50 to me."

We arrived in New York, where I disembarked with the masked passengers, and all of us were welcomed with open arms. The only mention of the virus was on a handful of TVs flashing various travel notices as you walked through customs (right up there with warnings about bringing in fruits and vegetables).

I lost my mother in June - not to Covid, but to complications after having surgery. The decisions we made, including for her to have surgery after a fall to put a pin in to ensure a fracture healed properly were not directly linked to Covid but it certainly narrowed some of our options. We could have taken a chance on her healing without the pin, but that might have meant placing her something like an extended care facility. I don't associate her loss directly with Covid, but I see it as indirectly associated with a year that had a lot of losses for a lot of people that were not expected.

Personally, I see moving the factories to China as a huge mistake. Most of the dangerous diseases come from West/Central Africa and China. The trade with Africa is modest. The trade with China is worthless. The working class has been decimated, they're angry and as a reflex they voted for Trump in large numbers.  I see Biden as only a modest improvement over Trump, except the 450,000 manufacturing jobs created in the last 4 years will probably now be shipped off to China or India or some such place, while the elite pocket the excess margins from the lower wage rate.

We can judge all we want but frankly I have no delusions that the US could have handled this better. We know the risks now and our government, and unfortunately quite a lot of our people, have spoken--they're prioritizing their want for ""normalcy"" over safety and protection of others. What China did was bad--cover ups, not listening to scientists. But wait, that's exactly what's happening in our country right now. So let's not point any fingers here--it's not exactly like we've been a beacon of virtue."
2020-12-30 17:42:45,"The most basic thing to say here is that China's ""closed"" society meant that the outbreak was not communicated to those outside China, facilitating the pandemic.  Once it was out, the more ""open"" societies had a hard time shutting down just because of their openness. China excelled at containment within China: it can regulate its population with regard to travel and information much more strictly. Freedom, apparently is not everything"
2020-12-30 12:13:14,"It's been said that autocracy is a far more efficient form of government than democracy and, in many respects, that is true but this terrible incident shows us the fatal flaw of this style that seems to be gaining in popularity throughout the world. Millions of casualties later, we need to realize that preventing the free flow of information is an awful thing. If we learn any lesson from all this, we need to remind ourselves always of the great value of democracy and freedom to tell the truth in public without fear of reprisal."
2020-12-30 17:30:00,"Criminally Negligent Homicide.

Trump.

Prosecute him.

Lock him up.  

Any questions?"
2020-12-30 11:52:42,"""But the Trump administration pulled nearly a dozen public health experts from Beijing months before the outbreak — effectively closing the eyes of the American government to disease threats from China.""

This was mentioned in a previous article in The Atlantic. Along with his concealment of the true threat of airborne Covid transmission,  I will go to my grave saying that djt is guilty of 325,000+ counts of criminally negligent homicide."
2020-12-30 13:26:24,"I'm sure it's just a coincidence that a highly contagious and deadly respiratory virus similar to SARS, which also emerged in China, just happened to emerge in a city with a biosafety level 4 lab. I'm also sure that the WHO, which is highly credible, not corrupt, and not easily influenced will uncover the origins of this pathogen in collaboration with the highly transparent, non-authoritarian Chinese government."
2020-12-30 13:30:06,"""The first alarm had actually sounded 25 days earlier, exactly a year ago, last Dec. 30. Even before then, Chinese doctors and scientists had been pushing for answers, yet officials in Wuhan and Beijing concealed the extent of infections or refused to act on warnings. Politics stymied science, in a tension that would define the pandemic. China’s delayed initial response unleashed the virus on the world...""

Recent retrospective tests of blood-bank donations have found COVID-19 antibodies existed in other countries including Italy as early as September 2019. There's no question China's slow response hastened the spread of COVID-19 but it's unclear if a better response would have avoided the pandemic we have today."
2020-12-30 13:38:41,"There is no doubt that China's initial handling of this disease was poor.  I have read elsewhere that the Hubei branch of the party was hosting a larger national political event and did not want fears of the virus to lead to its cancellation. The fact that scientists were silenced by their political superiors is disturbing. The attempt to rewrite the early history is foolish but not unexpected. All of that being said, however, there is no question that China went on to manage the virus with incredible competence. Once the leadership accepted what was going on, it acted decisively and crushed the virus in 76 days. China's early incompetence pales to insignificance compared to the spectacular level of governmental and societal incompetence and selfishness that has been displayed in many Western states. In the US, the President has spent months denying the severity of the illness and actively encouraging people to ignore actions that could inhibit its spread. The CDC has been completely compromised by political interference. The extent to which political intervention has undermined health authorities and scientists in the US is far worse than in China. Sadly, I feel it is necessary to point this out because so much of what is published in the NYT about China has taken on the tone of US govt propaganda. That is very unfortunate. China dropped the ball on this then picked it back up. It cannot be responsible for the inaction of Western govnerments and people since."
2020-12-30 13:44:56,"I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."
2020-12-30 13:59:35,"Another China-bashing on the origin and containment of the Covid pandemic!

Why do so few critics acknowledge that premature rumors and ""reports"" of the new coronavirus are to blame for the spread of the disease in China and the world? 

Chinese authorities correctly, but not effectively, suppressed reports of the new coronavirus until precautions could be recommended to the public, and quarantines put in place. The preliminary ""reports"" led people to flee Wuhan to China and the world. That's the origin of the pandemic! 

Those ""heroes"" cited in the Western media for leaking premature and unfounded rumors are the real villains of the pandemic."
2020-12-30 14:28:58,"No one knows if COVID could’ve been contained within China’s borders no matter what action they took once “the first alarm was sounded”. What China has shown the world is that science based containment and mitigation strategies, if fully embraced, work even if an epidemic is in full swing. China gave the world a playbook  on how to deal with COVID. Instead, we perseverate on the  first 25 days of a country facing a novel threat while doing next to nothing ourselves for close to a year after Xi personally briefed Trump."
2020-12-30 14:48:14,"There are vast differences between the Chinese and American cultures. This explains why the virus continues to spread in this country. China has a homogeneous population while the U.S. does not. We have many pockets of immigrants in this country, who entered illegally and are afraid of coming forward to seek any type of medical care. If the immigration laws were upheld and if they had entered this country legally, we would not have this problem. By virtue of being in this country and by virtue of not enforcing our immigration laws, these people are at a greater risk of becoming infected. Dies anyone STILL think it is a hood idea to allow unlimited numbers of people through our borders without enforcing our laws? The people who support this policy minimized all of these concerns to everyone's detriment."
2020-12-30 14:57:59,"If Covid-19 slipped China's grasp, then how did they build an emergency hospital in 10 days.

Any disease transmitted by animals, birds, fish or insects can go for days or months before it's picked up by the medical community.

China built the hospital and locked down the country and has done a pretty good job of stopping the virus.

A 1000 times better then Trump."
2020-12-30 15:10:31,"Great details on the timeline, however, no mention of the fact that the genie was already out of the bottle in December with cases now reported to have been found in Europe and the United States.  So it may have not made that much of a difference for Italy or even the US if they had acted sooner when they realized the existence of a new virus. 

We seem to hold China to a higher standard for its handling of what was a new situation and a confusing time. I'm sure officials there were trying to find the right balance between allowing information leading to public panic and taking appropriate action. At least that's how U.S. officials justify the downplaying of the dangers for so long."
2020-12-30 15:34:24,"Monday morning quarterbacking is always interesting.

After so many months, we are still debating the origin of Coronavirus.  WHO is sending a team of experts in China now, trying to learn as much as possible to prevent the next pandemic, which will come regardless when and how.  

WHO experts will surely interview and question why in July 2019, without public explanation, the United States pulled out American doctors inside the Chinese C.D.C. and also closed a separate Beijing office of the American C.D.C. prior to the burst of Covid-19.

Covid-19 is a preventable event.  Many countries including China and New Zealand have successfully contained and stopped the virus spreading to the general public.  With many vaccines become available,  the end is in sight.  This is a good lesson to learn the importance of public healthcare regardless of the country's healthcare system."
2020-12-30 15:39:17,"While this is a helpful summary of highlights, it is missing important information about timing of Covid transmission abroad.   

BBC reported on Jun 19: ""Italian scientists say sewage water from two cities contained coronavirus traces in December, long before the country's first confirmed cases.

The National Institute of Health (ISS) said water from Milan and Turin showed genetic virus traces on 18 December.""

and ""In May French scientists said tests on samples showed a patient treated for suspected pneumonia near Paris on 27 December actually had the coronavirus.""

This mean that even IF China had sounded the alarm earlier, it may not make much of a difference since the virus was already in Europe by DECEMBER 2019!"
2020-12-30 15:41:29,"China was the first country to detect the virus.
More evidence is coming out that this virus has been circulating elsewhere first.
If people continue to have a field day by blaming a country for being the first to detect a virus, then it will only be in any country's incentive to hide concerns for future viruses. Because it seems like whoever is first to detect a new virus will be to blame for its origin. Just remember that HIV was first detected in the US.

I still remember earlier this year when the media was mocking China for its lockdown. I still remember how people were proud about the fact that the US closed its borders to China, though it is now known the predominant covid strain in the US is from Europe.
How pride and arrogance have blinded our eyes. 300K dead and counting."
2020-12-30 17:49:25,"Regardless of their intransigence, Chinese authorities changed their tune when they realized the danger from this virus.  They were able to provide effective contact tracing and isolation.   I don't think it has as much to do with political will as it does intelligence and education.

Trump is not well educated.  The GOP has long been working to disband the Federal Government, although they collect most of the taxes, which line the pockets of military contractors and pay for large corporations on the dole.  Meanwhile, they feed their followers, through Fox News and other far right publications, the joy of uneducated, unvaccinated self reliance.  Ever since Reagan, the GOP has produced surprisingly ignorant Presidents, with Trump probably having the lowest IQ so far.  

Christians still refuse to obey state orders to isolate, claiming their religious rights trump public health orders.  Trump's stupidity and short sightedness has been a very costly wake up call for the whole world.  Parts of our country still haven't heard it, fascists propaganda has made them deaf to all reasoning.  I hope they survive."
2020-12-30 17:37:28,"Can we now start a discussion on getting China, and other nations, to end the wet markets that have spawned so many animal to human viruses?"
2020-12-30 17:24:20,This article is twisting the perceptive so that people are more inclinced to blame China rather than the US's own incompetencies in controlling the virus.
2020-12-30 17:26:13,"To my mind, the article that might better have appeared first on the pages of this leading newspaper would have been one exposing in no uncertain terms the criminal negligence resulting in mass murder in the United States. That has happened as a direct result of seemingly intentional inaction on the parts of leaders and lawmakers in this country. China made egregious politically motivated mistakes as well, but by now seems to have the spread of this coronavirus under control. The people of the United States, on the other hand, continue to be ravaged by this disease in incomprehensible numbers and still no comprehensive plan for altering this rampage is in place. The many needless deaths creates a situation where heartbreak and monumental rage are both appropriate responses. Please, New York Times, apply the formidable power of your investigative reporting to exposing the bitter truth in this country. After that is accomplished, then might be the time to examine the missteps of others."
2020-12-30 17:40:25,"This comes down to simply a deadly virus at time when we had the worst possible President.  Trump treated the virus as a political tool that he could use to his personal benefit.  He called it a hoax, he isolated CDC officials, he made believe it would just go away, offered cures that no sane person would even suggest and so much more. The end result is that the American economy-the nuts and bolts of this country is in a shambles. We probably will have over 400,000 to 500,000 deaths before things return to pre-virus days. And frankly most of these deaths can be laid at Trumps feet. Even now the vaccine distribution is so mis-managed that most people don't even know where they can get it. In fact in Fla. the phone line to make an appointment has been shut down because it is getting to many calls. That's right just 1 yes 1 single phone line. We have 50 states running 50 different programs and we don't have enough vaccine for all Americans. What a disaster. Again you can lay all of this a Trumps feet and his total inability to properly run an administration. Yet, 70 million Americans voted for this man-does not say much about us does it."

Donald Trump and the Republican Party and Executive branch (Republicans) were more worried about the Stock Market than testing for the virus and isolating, quarantining, contract tracking, and fighting the virus. They are to blame for %80 of the cases and deaths. Donald Trump, unfit to be a human being, let alone a problem solver, became the problem of a generation, with the concurrence and sustained efforts, of the Republicans and their Oligarch controllers, contributors. Ignorance and greed of the liars, cheaters, and thieves caused death for a year now. It's horrible.

The above link clears the fallacies about what flights actually flew out of China and when.
It seems that China banned all transport in/out of Wuhan to other parts of China and the world on 1/23.  China did allow international flights between other cities in China and the rest of the world.   Judge China as you may but at least get the facts straight (and not from Trump or Niall Ferguson)."

When I recovered from my shock, I asked why on earth she thought a failed businessman/ reality TV host should be running the country.  She replied: “ What’s the worst he can do? He’ll be surrounded by smart people who won’t let him do anything crazy”. And here we are."
2020-12-30 17:09:01,"This article confirms my desire to have the United States long with the rest of the world to demand indemnification from China for the deaths and economic hardship caused by China's laggard response to the virus.  No amount of whitewashing can cover over the fact that China placing power over health, sound familiar?, caused the world's incredible pain and suffering and they should suffer the consequences of their inaction.  The responsibility for the spread of Covid-19 is their's and they should be forced to make amends."
2020-12-30 18:03:03,"China made misteps early for political reasons. However, once its leaders understood the gravity of the situation the quickly and efficiently dealt with it. Half the US population doesn't even belive it is real. 
The US deaths/population is 300 time greater than China. That says it all."
2020-12-30 17:17:08,"So Covid 19 ""slipped China's grasp"" for 25 days. All the more reason to rely on the wisdom of your own country. That some countries were barely touched by this virus tells us some countries are wiser than others.

The Journal of the AMA and the Lancet both praised Taiwan's covid response. On 12/31/2019 when WHO reported unusual cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Taiwan sent officials to check passengers from Wuhan before they deplaned. These passengers were monitored via their cell phones, a mode of communication already incorporated into their national health care system. When the first 100 covid cases were confirmed Taiwan deployed their pandemic response plans, which included building up supplies of covid testing, PPE, hospital facilities and recruiting additional medical personnel. It helped that the government was trusted and their VP, a virologist himself, gave daily, factual briefings to the public.  With these actions, Taiwan limited their covid deaths to seven, the last of which was on 5/18/20; lockdowns and school closures were unnecessary. 

The lesson from Taiwan is those 25 lost days in China are only meaningful if you are looking for an excuse."
2020-12-30 17:17:54,"Hindsight is 20/20. We cannot hail Dr. Li Wenliang's leaking lab results as an heroic act simply because he was eventually proved to be right on the prediction. What if he was wrong? Then we would label him a troublemaker instead of whistleblower?  In fact, there were at least half of dozen corona viruses discovered between 2012 SARS outbreak and now. Each was handled carefully among these epidemiologists around the world without much (if any) general public attention.  This pandemic exposed the blindspot of science and disease control.  Eventually people have to rely on their previous experience to deal with the problem.  Those who live in the hard-hitted places from SARS such as China, HongKong, Korea, Singapore, and Thailand, handled the COVID19 pandemic much much better than everywhere else around the world."
2020-12-30 17:34:40,"The Chinese part of responsibility for this pandemic is clear even many crucial details remain hidden.
However, almost all western countries have tragically underestimated what was coming. All had great confidence in their prevention systems but when the first cases appeared it was practically too late.
With the exception of New Zealand and some others who are naturally sheltered from people coming in to their countries in masses, there was limited actions available to the leaders of most democratic countries. 
Yes, America could have done much better with a clear strategy from the beginning but it might have only delayed what is happening now.
Other than the Spanish flu 100 years ago, there is no recent experience that would have motivated people to behave in a way that stops spreading the disease.
I do not think any Westerner would agree to get locked in for an extended period of time to help curbing the infections. Of course there are the privileged ones who do have space and money to isolate and keep safe. But there are others who can't. 
In our western societies we have an unspoken agreement that we can't lock up people in their houses by force. 
All measures in place including vaccines will help to a certain degree but this disease needs time to end.
We have to live with Covid-19 for a long time.
Let's see what experts say in five years from now."
2020-12-30 17:22:39,"The NY Times reports: ""As its trade war with China escalated, the Trump administration had all but eliminated a public health partnership with Beijing that had begun after the debacle of SARS and was intended to help prevent potential pandemics. By pulling out, current and former agency officials say, Washington cut itself off from potential intelligence about the virus, and lost a chance to work with China against it.""

This article puts blame on the CCP officials for putting appearances before public safety, but it also raises pertinent questions about the role of the Trump administration in its coincidental alienation from the Chinese at such an inopportune time.

However, there is more backstory that needs to be told to really get to the bottom of this pandemic; a large body of coronavirus research that has been conducted since the emergence of SARS and later MERS. The Americans and Chinese have partnered on actually producing dangerous coronaviruses through the 'gain of function' technology in order to produce for study what nature might do by itself naturally.

We still don't know how this coronavirus ""spilled over"" over into the human community; it may have occurred with the miners who died after collecting bat guano in the mine shaft; samples of the pathogenic coronavirus were collected by Chinese scientists from the deceased some time ago, but it was only reported on after the SARS CoV2 emerged on the scene in China; transparency needed."
2020-12-30 18:34:57,"These are the most disturbing sentences of the entire article: 

""On Jan. 8, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, George F. Gao, became emotional after acknowledging that danger during a call with his American counterpart, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, according to two people familiar with Dr. Redfield’s account of the call.

Yet neither Dr. Redfield nor Dr. Gao, each constrained by politics, signaled a public alarm.""

Not only is there blood on Trump's hands, it is also on Redfield's for not following the Hippocratic Oath, ""First do no harm"". He should have sounded the alarm on January 8th and this country would have been in much better shape."
2020-12-30 18:41:30,Covid-19 slipped China’s grasp - and flew right into America’s welcoming arms.

It's sad biased American newspaper forever freezes at the first blink moment and never follows how the story developed in China and at least show some respect if not any appreciation and admiration."
2020-12-30 18:19:59,"So, Mr. Trump said to himself ""“We must actively respond to international concerns,” Mr. Trump told the leaders of the Republican Party “and tell a good story of America's fight against the outbreak.”  And ""Mr. Trump said, the party had to “seize the initiative” on how the outbreak was seen and how the Republican Party could reject science, dismantle the CDC and denigrate our scientists and doctors, while claiming that the White House alone was responsible for controlling the virus and getting aid to all Americans...except the blue states."
2020-12-30 18:31:27,"The World Health Organization Controlled By China
I was surprised that the article didn't mention the World Health Organization. The WHO is apparently controlled by China and resisted even saying that the virus was air-born until 400 epidemiologists from around the world signed a letter publicly pleading for them to acknowledge that it was.
Has this ever happened before?
Doctors deal in hard truths every day. It's politicians and their lackeys who have to be forced to tell the truth in this way.
The dirty hand of dictatorship will grasp whatever is there and will control it utterly."
2020-12-30 18:27:31,"This is a misleading headline. While it can be argued that COVID ""slipped China's grasp"", this article does not shed light on the ""how"". It is unknowable whether China could've stopped it by the time they first learned of it. It's like with roaches, once you  seen one on the kitchen wall, there are surely legions in the cabinets. Just maybe, if they completely locked down their borders immediately, just maybe, but likely not. And what country would do that at the first hint of a new infection. Even 10days in would surely have been too late. We are talking absolute lockdown, militarily enforced at the very first hint. Of course, we, the great land of freedom and democracy would immediately threaten military action for unlawfully detaining our citizens caught up in this most authoritarian action. But hey, its' China, so something, anything has to be blamed on the CCP, right?"
2020-12-30 18:22:28,"The definitive history of the coronavirus will be written sometime in the future. As a worldwide catastrophe there will be chapters written about the response of every country. It really is fascinating to see how different forms of government handled the same exact problems

This is clear : the country that did the worst job at handling the coronavirus is the United States. Countries like China and India that have over a billion people each, compare their fatalities to the US
Us= 339,000
India= 148,000
China=4,634

The numbers of fatalities are even more glaring when you consider the death toll from just yesterday
Us=3,626
India =286
China=0

The whole experience of the coronavirus in the US is one of mistake compiled on mistake . Just some of those mistakes :
Politicizing mask wearing 
People refusing to wear masks
An incredible slow initial response to the virus
No clear national strategy
Putting coronavirus patients into nursing homes
Not listening to the science or scientists 
Telling people not to wear mask when this began- which led to confusion to this day
An agonizingly slow bureaucracy that slowed therapeutics and vaccines
And even now , the roll out of the vaccine is moving in the same slow pace, rules about who should get the vaccine first is causing a bottle neck.

Fortunately for the United States and for the world the leadership of the United States is about to change, the US if it continues to let the virus spread is a danger to the world."
2020-12-30 18:28:24,"Excellent reporting. This and other incremental reporting shows that in the critical hours and days of January the Chinese authorities could have prevented the spread of the virus, but for political reasons they did not. Knowing that, they immediately deployed a misinformation campaign to support a false narrative designed to protect the CCP. It's important that the truth be told about the Chinese responsibility for the spread, just as it's important to assign blame to the Trump administration for its incompetent and ineffective response once the virus landed in the United States."

This was so flagrantly suspicious, and no one ever followed up on it.

I would not be at all surprised if numerous people are dying of COVID in China this very minute, and it's simply being swept under the rug.

Not one other nation with good reporting has had such a dramatic elimination of risk--even those that have high mask usage and case tracing."
2020-12-30 18:11:06,"While easy to place blame on others, we also have to be aware that were the virus to originate in the US under Trump, the outcome likely would have been similar even with perceived safety nets in the US. Evidence for this is the US response to the outbreak in the US even as it was clear where things were going with lockdowns being instated much less rapidly than in China. Articles such as this, while useful for understanding the history, must take care to not place blame because no one could have predicted what would happen. As an MD, I personally did not predict this to turn out the way that it did. The fact is that this is the situation we have and we have to deal with it. Were we to lay blame, sure we could blame China, but we would also have to blame the leadership of many countries that failed to launch measures to curb spread. NYTimes, as several US news outlets, is unfortunately now playing the card of biased politics with respect to relations with China. This greatly impacts its credibility and denigrates its favor for me as a viewer."
2020-12-30 18:26:30,"In this dire situation, we have been saddled with a president who came into office with no experience in government, no interest in governing, an attitude that he knows more than anyone else about everything, and whose actions are driven by his emotions, not by facts and reason. Exactly the wrong person for the job.

While the Chinese leaders certainly didn't cover themselves with glory in their response to the virus outbreak, the U.S. could potentially have prevented some of the devastation that followed  in the U.S. and the world. If our scientists  had remained embedded in Chinese scientific and health agencies, they likely would have learned about the nature of the virus early on. If Trump hadn't set up a hostile competition and confrontation with China, its scientists likely would have been more open and honest with our scientists, and the government might have been more open and honest with the world. Hostility tends to motivate people to clam up. 

The question is will anyone learn from this and try to improve the situation. The pandemic task force that Obama established should be mandated by Congress, so an irresponsible president can't once again disband it."
2020-12-30 18:23:14,"There is so much to draw from this very well written article. 
Clearly, we in the US (and China) had the scientific competence, which was overcome by political incompetence and failures. All of which need to be rectified. Asian countries like South Korea were competent in both areas. Thank you for sharing past examples of success as well. We wrote the book on how to prevent a pandemic and then shredded it when we needed it the most. 
It is Trump, the republican party and part of the citizenry who favors Trump and this party, where selfishness, biases and corruption were on display.  
This is the cost of a broken political system in the US where accountability is reduced through institutional set ups like the senate, the electoral college, which gave us Bush and Trump, gerrymandering (resulting in a skewed power structure in many states and the House) and now the resulting judiciary which are clearly meant to perpetuate minority power structure. I look at the overall vote counts to understand the ingrained biases. That is the best way to look for what is morally right. 
The price paid has been heavy, primarily borne by the poor, folks of color and minorities."
2020-12-30 18:57:57,"As we all know, it takes weeks for symptoms to appear when someone confronts the Virus. Now imagine, with the extent of globalization of today's world, that how many people possibly got infected from Patient-Zero until this patient-zero itself knows that something is getting wrong inside my body? How many traveled to other parts of the world already and infected hundreds of thousands before this ""Patient-Zero"" had gone to the hospital? it was a natural disaster and so far, I don't believe anyone should be blamed for this catastrophic disaster except the food Chinese people take: living insects and other animals' wet market. What we could have done is reduce the speed of people getting infected until our beautiful scientists can produce Vaccines."

The question is what lesson will we - on all sides - draw from this.   Viruses are impervious to country boarders, so how are we, the citizens of the world, going to work together/cooperate and start building networks/infrastructures now so scientists and the public have the information needed in the future to combat whatever comes done the road?  There will be a next one and it is far to important to start begin re-creating these on or shortly after Jan. 21, 2021.

And to add injury to insult, we had to elect a most corrupt and brutus ignoramus president whose only interest was himself and his ego, distorting the facts and destroying the truth, all to keep an emotionally-trapped base of his, convinced his repeated lies represented the 'gospel truth'.

This pandemic is far from over.  And yet  thought of the next one looms.  Why?  Because of what this article shows.  Leaders who prioritize politics and worldly affairs over the lives of their constituents are a danger to us all, whether we live under their rule or not.  I'm pretty sure myself and a family member had COVID in December of last year.  For us this is the second Christmas mangled by a virus that should have never been allowed to travel here and wouldn't have if people were taking their responsibilities as leaders seriously.  After what for us and I'm sure many many others has already been a solid year of this, I still try to feel hopeful about the changes and the learning that could come out of this awful experience.  Heavy emphasis on could.  I have no doubt someone will figure out what went wrong if they don't already know.  But will they find someone to listen and take preventative measures?  Guess we'll find out.  Meanwhile, my kid who was in the middle of junior year in high school will probably never set foot as a student inside that school again.  The virus exploded like a meteor and there went high school.  My kid loved school.

However, my assumption and expectations in spring as most west countries and international health organizations would have expected that China would not be able to contain this virus, given all the flaws in their system. Did any of us expect less than that? Please, what shocked me and made me to start questioning all the western countries and our own news media is how quickly China corrected themselves and got this virus contained in two months and lives went back to normal, and US and Europe watched and critiqued on how China handled it and violation of human rights for extreme lock down of Wuhan for 2 months and we did not learn anything, 12 months into this, we failed to contain this virus, and it is out of control. How did Australia able to contain like China and US failed to do so?

This article failed to mention the fact that compare how China handled initial reponse vs how UK handled this new variant of Covid is shockingly same, yet UK got 1 year start cannot contain it.  

Also this article to mention in hindsight, that now we know this virus was detected in Europe before December 2019 also, so how did they fail to recognize it? 

Had this virus started in US or Europe, would we handled any differently or better? Now we know, we would not, we would fail worse than China"

 “Well before the new coronavirus spread across American cities, the Chinese regime was already rather creatively trolling U.S. publications, expelling American journalists, and “weaponizing wokeness” over anything it perceived as critical of China’s role in mishandling the epidemic.”

It’s important to emphasize that it is the Chinese government we should hold accountable, not its people.  The Government waited seven weeks before closing Wuhan, and in that time an estimated 5 million people left there and traveled the world.

America continues on its own disastrous course of denial, with well over 300,000 deaths, more than four times American deaths in Vietnam.  Because of the Republican strategy of using the virus as yet another dividing tool, we still lack a coherent, unified strategy for coping with the pandemic, even as thousands die every day."

2020-12-30 20:17:35,"I am a recently retired physician-scientist.  Few recognize the critical role played by alert and curious clinicians who make key observations.  When heeded, they alert the research community and the health system to emerging threats.  They are not often recognized as the discoverers of diseases because their contribution precedes identification of the responsible agent or full understanding of the pathogenesis.  This report suggests that their voices were suppressed in the early stages of the outbreak to protect people and institutions higher up the food chain.  Those clinicians could have conveyed the human cost of COVID, which was an abstraction rather than an existential threat to the politicians.  I experienced the early days of AIDS as a student in NYC,   At the time, we recognized its lethality but didn’t Know the cause or much about the mechanism.  Our politicians were also reluctant to recognize the threat posed by a mysterious illness affecting a few Gay men and intravenous drug users.  Knowing that history, it is difficult to blame the Chinese politicians for behaving similarly.  The lesson is that the front-line clinicians must always be heard and heeded, no matter how politically inconvenient."

The political ""restraint"" by the Chiese government is well-documented in the article, but what ""political constraint"" did Dr. Redfield have? The article doesn't say, because THERE WAS NONE. Dr. Redfield was free to say ANYTHING he wanted to the American people at ANY TIME.  If Trump had somehow applied pressure to keep quiet, we would have heard about it.

If you need a tip, look at the response of the East Asian countries.

2020-12-30 19:21:18,"In 2015 Bill Gates published key findings from his experience in helping thwart the worldwide spread of Ebola in the New England Journal of Medicine. To paraphrase from that valuable report:

“Because there was so little preparation, the world lost time trying to answer basic questions about combating the Ebola epidemic. In the next global health crisis such delays could result in a global disaster.

The problem is not the fault of any single institution - it reflects a global failure. The world needs a global warning and response system for outbreaks. (Though the World Health Organization [WHO] has a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, it is severely understaffed and underfunded.) Such a system could enable us to manage not only a naturally occurring epidemic, but also one ignited by a bioterror attack. Although I have not seen a rigorous estimate of the cost of building such a system, World Bank projections give a sense of the cost of inaction: a worldwide influenza epidemic, for example, would reduce global wealth by an estimated $3 trillion. (Gates has recently admitted that this estimate of monetary damage was clearly too low).”

He went on to elaborate on some of the key components of a necessary preparedness response, including:

- Health systems and surveillance 
- Human and other resources 
- Medical and other public health tools
- Global calls to action
- Adequate funding

When prescient public health experts like Mr Gates speak, the world should listen."
2020-12-30 20:11:56,"Given China's experience, why did we not learn from it?

Well, for one thing  we have a president, one of whose first actions in office was to get rid of the pandemic task force that his predecessor left behind.

We had a president who puts more faith in what Fox News thinks about the virus, than he cares about the opinion of scientific experts.

We have a president who was against testing  for the virus because it would increase the count of those infected.

We have a president who publicly proclaimed that injecting disinfectant is a good way to deal with the virus. (They kill germs don't they?)

We have a president whose most important gauge of his success in office is the Dow Jones average (based on a booming economy left by his predecessor), than the health and welfare of the people.

We have Republican congressmen who scoffed at the mitigation procedures suggested by medical experts, but are quick to line up for the vaccine when it became available.

The total death count under Trump is well over 350,000. (South Korea as of Dec. 28 has had 879 deaths from the virus. Yes, a much smaller country, but come on, folks!)

2020-12-30 21:21:23,"It is hilarious that all four of these authors, each of whom has built a career bashing China for being ""authoritarian"", should now attempt to spin the narrative that China ""lost its grip"" on the virus. 

Of course, assuming that it was even possible to contain it (unlikely), if China had for some reason shut down all travel upon the first unconfirmed rumor of a virus in December, these authors would have spent all year gleefully penning articles attacking China for ""holding hostage"" foreigners within its boundaries. They would never, to their dying breath, give China any credit for defeating the virus."
2020-12-30 21:23:17,"The central thesis of this piece is that Beijing was incompetent and inefficient, leading to the worldwide pandemic. However, the story itself refutes this conclusion. Clearly, some degree of bureaucratic incompetence partly driven by malicious desire to hold or gain power slowed Beijing's response. But, it should remembered that a significant portion of the world's population is in China and after this 25 day window, China successfully fought the virus, providing much needed time both to the rest of their country, and the world. Many countries heeded China's warning, learned from their experience, and were able to keep the virus in check.  The US experience with the virus is not the norm.

To pick some ""random"" dates:

It has been 327 days since Trump admitted to Woodward he was aware of the deadly threat.

It has been 280 days since Cuomo returned nursing home patients with CoVID-19.

Cuomo has been rewriting history, claiming this did not happen.

It has been around 9 months since Fauci told us that masks were not helpful or necessary.  (It took longer than 25 days for this mistake to be mitigated.)

Even today, the United States has yet to develop a coordinated, coherent plan to tackle this disease.  The obvious economic policies that could have prevented so much hardship have yet to be enacted.

It is extremely difficult to place much blame at all on China.  Further, if this story is an expose of Chinese mistakes or even malice, it makes the US look far, far worse."
2020-12-30 20:32:20,"I don't believe that Mr Xi planned the current outcome of the Covid pandemic reported in this article, but he certainly might be pleased by it: China has an economy that is humming while the US remains sick and stumbling. 

What would have been the response if Mr Trump had taken draconian measures to combat the disease as eventually carried out in Wuhan? I have no doubt that Trump would have delighted in ACTUAL lockdowns, enforced by the police and/or military, with people confined to their homes; after all,  this would have taken place at the centers of the outbreak, in Seattle,  NY and other 'democrat-controlled' cities. It would have delighted his supporters in Red states as well - 'Now we REALLY own the libs!'

I don't know if Trump would even have that authority - weirdly I have never seen a straight-forward analysis of exactly what powers are available to local and federal authorities, short of declaring martial law. In any event, it is disingenuous to say that Trump could have had any great success in controlling the virus in a country that is far less autocratic than China, no matter how early he acted. Witness the second wave of the virus in European countries that acted earlier and more forcefully then we did, and the truly odd example of Sweden, which despite no lockdown has a death rate from Covid lower than ours.

All that said, regarding Xi's 'success' -  to quote Napoleon,  'Never infer malice when mere incompetence suffices as an explanation.'"
2020-12-30 21:19:54,"It is plainly evident what the Chinese government did during the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan was pure evil. They knew the dangers posed by the spread of the virus, yet allowed international flights out of China while banning travel between regions domestically. The result: China was able to suppress the spread domestically through a combination of early warning and a brutal lockdown, but the rest of the world never stood a chance."
2020-12-30 21:22:59,"China has 4634 deaths, or 1 in 300,604. The US has 339,000 deaths, or 1 in 968. China managed to contain it. We didn’t. If you want to blame China and criticize its form of government, you need to be able to point to something better than our miserable, incompetent, malfeasant and murderous government under Trump. People in glass houses."
2020-12-30 21:12:22,"Any and all reporting in the NYT and other American news outlets  needs to come with a warning label and header: ""China is a one-party dictatorship without a free press. It has an ongoing history of censorship of points of view and  facts that are unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party regime. We report their official ""statistics""  and quote their sources, but with a mountain of doubt. You should have that doubt, too. """

2020-12-30 13:56:02,"""Not long ago, China and the United States cooperated successfully to track and halt viral outbreaks in China. But the Trump administration pulled nearly a dozen public health experts from Beijing months before the outbreak — effectively closing the eyes of the American government to disease threats from China.""

Every single asset Donald Trump owns should be confiscated, liquidated and applied to the cost of the pandemic for his criminal incompetence.

As far as China is concerned, they should either forgive the one trillion dollars in US debt they hold, or we should default on it to make up for the Chinese Communist Party's gross incompetence and intentional stifling of information relating to the virus."
2020-12-30 18:31:25,"Reading this piece makes me very angry but also upset because all of this did not need to happen.
China is an overwhelmingly oppressive and cruel regime to its own citizens, but despite this oppression, there were valiant Doctors and scientists, who were trying to do the right thing and communicate that this new virus was deadly and transmissible between humans within China, but also with their western scientific colleagues. 
Despite Wuhan being locked down in January by the Chinese Government, flights were still coming into the UK from China until the UK lockdown in March. The Chinese Government clearly knew that this virus had spread through large swathes of its population, but did not stop these flights throughout the rest of the world.

This virus could have been contained in China, but a repressive Chinese Government stopped this containment.

Many of the world’s leading economies were far too slow to shut down their economies and have let this virus surge out of control.
Now millions of people have died and have been infected worldwide.
 I do not believe for a second any of the data on infection rates and deaths from COVID19, that come out of China.

A deadly SARS virus must be contained and destroyed by containment, which happened in 2003.
 What this all demonstrates is that there has to be open international co-operation, otherwise the world will not be ready for SARS-3 or some other devastating Pandemic."
2020-12-30 22:01:38,What I would really be interested in is a thorough and independent report into the present state of affairs of so-called Wet Markets across Asia and obviously China specifically. Is there any realistic hope for the future that this won’t happen again from the same source? Have we learned from this pandemic?
2020-12-30 22:07:28,"So, China was not perfect in its actions against the novel coronavirus, and politics sometimes were put ahead of medicine.

Yet, China's failings and inadequacies pale beside the massive mistakes made by Trump and his administration."
2020-12-30 22:12:50,"Why is this article focused on China's alleged failures when there is ample reporting of possible cases in Italy and even the US before Dr. Zhong was ever sent to Wuhan.  Sorry but the political failures are universal- China for not acting swifter, Trump for shutting down entry from China but not Europe, Europe for not shutting down soon enough and spraying thousands of skiiers across Europe and beyond, the Republicans for living in a parallel universe where science doesn't matter, Cuomo for re-acting too slowly, the public health establishment for suggesting COVID was affecting communities of color disproportionately instead of raising the alarm for absolutely everyone  and every single American who hasn't worn a mask since March and is partying it up in the basement with their buddies.  The real lesson is that we shouldn't listen to any politicians when it comes to public health only the scientists."
2020-12-30 21:32:56,"There are a couple of things i want to address.  First, even though Wuhan and other cities were locked down quickly, it was only for domestic travel, not international travel, so the virus spread to Europe then the U.S. We also know that the virus entered Italy  at least by early November 2019, not 2 months later as stated. . Second, most of us knew back then  the CCP was drastically under counting those infected, perhaps to the factor of 100. Yesterday a report came out that shows their count in Wuhan was uncounted counted by a factor of 10, meaning, instead of the official count at 50,000, some 500,000 were actually infected.   As George Carlin repeatedly said: ""Never believe anything the government tells you"".  Especially a tyrannical , evil government run by the CCP."
2020-12-30 21:35:09,"And the American response under Trump - and this is important - NEVER improved.  Despite the spectacle of sharply increasing deaths and hospitalizations for months now, in central NJ, where I live,  testing is unavailable for anyone without either ""classic"" symptoms or a contact with someone with a confirmed positive Covid test.  Test kits are still in short supply, and NJ has gone BACK to original c. March 2020 guidelines for who can get a test.  

Friends and relatives in some other states have had similiar experiences. Meaning that the counts of active cases - once estimated in this newspaper to be underestimated by a factor of ten - is almost certainly hugely underrepresented.

That means we have no roadmap for who needs an inoculation and since we still don't have the vaccine accessible for most who need it, there is no corrective process afoot to change any of this.   

You can lay every bit of responsibility for this on Trump and his imperial eunuchs in the Republican party."
2020-12-30 21:48:31,"What fascinates me at the moment is how China with a population of nearly one and a half billion has 3000 less cases of covid than Ireland with a population of nearly five million. This is according to statistics on Worldometer.  Sure, China doesn’t have to be too concerned about human and civil rights in suppressing the virus but is it possible to suppress it to that extent in a country where there is so much poverty and close living?"
2020-12-30 22:04:56,"Didn’t China alarm the rest of the world early January that this virus is dangerous, and the rest of the world was like: it’s a disease only happen in Asian, not western world problem.  The attitude towards this virus even after almost a year of the outbreak, between Asian citizen and western citizen are drastically different: one take is seriously and one don’t.  So what’s this article trying to say? Are you saying it’s Chinese government job to educate the western citizens to act like a good citizen, follow the rules and stay at home so to control the virus?"
2020-12-30 22:12:14,"Based on this article I draw a concludion that China did a better job than the US.
China took 18 days to put in place a formidable program that successfully suppressed the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This included sending 40,000 doctors and nurses to Wuhan, building field hospitals dedicated to treating a COVID-19 patients, and became self-sufficient in PPE including N-95 respirators for health care workers.
The United States has accomplished none of these objectives in 10 months."
2020-12-30 22:09:11,China lied about the virus for weeks.  Our Republican government officials are still lying about it 10 months later.  Which is worse?  Absolutely unforgivable!
2020-12-30 22:07:59,"No, Dr. Redfield chose to be constrained by his desire to remain on the job without making the boss mad. That is immoral, unethical and plain wrong. Why does he still have a medical license?"
2020-12-30 21:56:41,"What we really need to be discussing is the origins of the virus and how to prevent it from happening again. China has irresponsibly tried to save face by obfuscating covid’s origins even going to the lengths of sanctioning Australia for daring to ask these questions. If humanity doesn’t learn from this because it bruises either Chinese or American egos, we are in real trouble. There are diseases far worse than covid."
2020-12-30 22:11:36,This article makes me beyond mad.
2020-12-30 22:37:15,"Those who settle into the overly simplistic narrative of blaming China for the scourge of COVID 19 in America are guilty of both xenophobia wrapped in faux patriotism and willful ignorance of American ineptitude and indifference. The American choice of politics and business over science and health have already cost hundreds of thousands of lives with hospitals overwhelmed and the economy for many severely impacted. 
It is just as overly simplistic to blame President Trump alone as various governors, Congressional leaders, and pundits added to the misinformation and conspiracies. However, it is imperative to state that President Trump missed the opportunity and responsibility of his historical challenge, and he will be forever remembered for his callous and mendacious reaction that placed his political and financial interests above the welfare of those he was called to serve and to protect."

2020-12-30 22:50:12,"No surprise here, China downplayed the virus for months and is now on a propaganda spree contradicting scientists across the world and attempting to suggest the virus was imported into China from “packages.” And yet people here in the comments want to run and defend China... it’s hysterical to see actually. 

Of course the US government needs to be held accountable by Americans (we know better), from deblasio and cuomo to trump, but we shouldn’t forget that China hoarded PPE and attempted to repress information about the virus from getting to its citizens and to Europe, Russia, and the US. 

We, the American people, can start by treating the CCP the way we treat other homicidal regimes: freeze assets and sanction."
2020-12-30 22:22:20,"Going through the article, its clear that this has been a sad affair resulting in an unmitigated disaster. While some of the points like the opaqueness of the Chinese central and state governments and keeping the world in dark  were known, For the first time, The article has thrown light on the angle of American pull back from Chinese CDC. Most likely the damage would have been much less if that collaboration had continued. 

As some have mentioned in these comments, the World should take steps to make sure there is a comprehensive and transparent investigation into the origin of the novel Coronavirus. The Chinese should not be allowed to get away with lame arguments like 'It didn't originate in China', The American marines did it etc. Everything should be based on solid proof."
2020-12-30 22:30:26,Wuhan government definitely made some terrible mistakes last December and early January. Politicians in US and European countries have done no better since then.

Why not just be transparent and tackle this as a public health crisis and give access to independent investors to trace the exact origin so that history doesn’t repeat itself again.  Trying to convince people to believe in their alternate reality only makes people mad, people that are already suffering because of this. That’s what Trump did and it enraged Americans( sadly not all) and made America the laughing stock of the world."

2020-12-30 23:43:18,"China must be held accountable for this worldwide disaster.
Covid-19 did not slip China's grasp, it has always been within China's grasp to prevent zoonotic disease transmission to humans. China (and other countries) refuse to prohibit and enforce, dangerous food consumption and cultural practices.

2020-12-31 00:33:13,"One question where are our intelligence agency reports from Chine from Nov 2019 to Feb 2020, there was something that prompted a senator to dump all his stocks. Trump was always useless but surely there may have been other adults in the room.
I think it is about time we take back the country from the politicians. All of them are useless and so not in touch with ground reality."
2020-12-31 00:01:18,"China's early missteps in handling the outbreak are well documented. Yet those pale by comparison with Trump's ineptitude and gross negligence in handling the pandemic. 

Once Xi acknowledged the gravity of the situation, or was forced to acknowledge it if you like, he took strong and decisive action to bring it under control. In fact, stronger action than most Americans would have the stomach for. 

Trump to this day has continued to do nothing. On February 28th he said, ""It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear."" This even though he admitted to Bob Woodward he knew it was serious and would continue to do so to avoid creating ""panic."" Experts believe decisive action by the U.S. at that point would have saved countless lives. 

So as thousands of Americans continue to die every day, life in China is essentially back to normal. Aren't we glad Donald Trump didn't ""panic"" us?"

2020-12-30 23:47:13,"Yes yes yes, American and other Western governments are horrible but bad as they are, they have not jailed or killed anybody who tried to tell the truth about the virus. The Chinese Communist Government did and is still doing it.
Just this week, it sent a citizen journalist, Zhang Zhan, to prison for three years for having reported on the conditions of Wuhan after the virus broke out. Several well-known citizen journalists have been disappeared since the spring.
A Hong Kong doctor, Guan Pu, who was the real force behind the eventual exposure of the SARS pandemic, went to Wuhan in late December or early January and reported that he was horrified by the situation. He was brutalized and character-assassinated in the Chinese government-controlled media and social media. He has been silent ever since. Fang Fang, a famous Wuhan writer who occasionally published in her blog a very mild diary about her life in the epicenter of the pandemic, suffered the same fate because the blog has not put China in the best light in front of the world.
A full year after the pandemic first broke out in Wuhan, this report is essentially a copout for the Chinese communists. The reality is: should any journalist dare to expose the true character of the Chinese communists, their visas would be revoked or they shall otherwise lose all useful contacts.
Wise up, NY Times readers, the evil ones are not your leaders. They are in Beijing but gaining increasing control of your life, in almost every aspect."
2020-12-30 23:56:22,"No surprises here.  Chinese coverup. Now they bash Australia via trade because Australia had the temerity (or stupidity) to be out the front seeking an independent review of COVID's origin.
China missed a big chance to redeem itself by initiating a suitable review right from the get go.  Instead it races to hide and distort the facts and the timeline through authoritarian suppression and propaganda.  What it needs to realise is that transparency is the only thing that will give it 'face' on the international stage.  Until then China's name is mud."

The Asian countries right on China’s doorstep like Japan, Taiwan and Korea have managed it far better than the US and Europe. Our western governments have proven incompetent and conveniently blame it all on China.

We’ve been critical of China‘s censorship for a long time. So why did we ignore the news on Dec 31st, 2019 we think they can’t be trusted?"
2020-12-31 01:13:15,"I don’t understand the point of this article. Scapegoating? Is anyone actually surprised or unaware about politics being involved? Furthermore, did anyone actually expect China or really any other country to have somehow had a perfect response from the outset? According to what the WHO has reported, the world was given notice on 31DEC and by 07JAN, the virus was already identified and isolated. If I recall correctly, it seemed that most people and government officials around the world were rather flippant towards the virus, not just Trump. Highly rated health systems like Italy’s - forget China’s comparatively weak health system - fell flat on their faces in March and April with literal months of advanced warning. But even then, I think it’s also probably not a stretch to say that even if information had been left to flow freely or if some other disease emerged from any of the other global hotspots like India, Western Europe, the US East Coast or Japan (hotspots based on a paper from Nature Communications), the past year’s worth of experience shows that the outcome would have been no different. Yeah great there’s a virus, everyone knows everything about and the CDC has cute little cartoons about hand washing. Good luck containing anti-mask protests, gaining the cooperation of spineless politicians, and controlling indifferent party goers."
2020-12-31 01:13:55,"Reading some of the comments on this today leave my head spinning. China's governments failed early, but then acted decisively, effectively, and seem to have curbed the virus long enough for vaccines to protect the population. If their early errors and attempts to muddy the record reflect an opaque governmental system, to what are we to credit their ultimate success? That same flawed government?

Europe and the USA had a few weeks warning about this, even if they did not have all the details, their governments seem to have failed as badly as the Chinese central authorities in their initial response. The difference is that the Western governments seem to have adhered to their initial failures and systematized them while the Chinese took steps, even if belatedly, to effectively address the crisis.

Again reading many of these responses leave me perplexed. Are people effectively making the case FOR authoritarian government in the Chinese style? It appears to me that some are of the opinion that the Western populations would be better served by the Chinese leadership. China's leaders groped in the dark, made mistakes, covered some things up, but eventually got it right. The Western governments were not totally in the dark but have acted throughout as if they are still are. The only thing they seem to know for sure is that somehow their failures are China's failure."
2020-12-31 01:15:21,This article is blaming more China than pointing out what China did to control the virus.

And no, we don’t kill journalists here, but don’t think he wouldn’t have if he could have gotten away with it.  The only difference between these two men, Xi and trump, is one can do what he wants with impunity, and the other one tries but has so far been restrained.  Imagine if he had been re-elected."

Prejudice against the Chinese way of running a country is so prevalent that no one bothers to admit the merit of the system. Centuries of looting and robbing from poor countries has cultivated a kind of arrogance in the West to the point that even the slightest achievement made by non-West countries are nitpicked and sniffed and disregarded. It is sad. 

If you bothered to learn a bit Chinese history you'll know how China got left behind in the 1800s and was bullied and sabotaged by the West----we were arrogant and blind to whatever ground-breaking progress happening in the West.

If you were to blame China for the virus in the beginning of this pandemic,I understand. Because at that time there were barely any research done about the virus. But at this point, it just looks like you are tying to spread around hatred towards China and shrift the focus. Just like when people were blaming Donald Trump for his Ignorance and ￼neglect to this virus and he tried to shrift the focus by calling the virus Chinese virus. I honestly had expected something better and fair from a media source like New York Times. 
Besides, there were evidences that the coronavirus was actually spreading quietly last year ( 2019 ) in November in Italy. ( The local water sample of November in Italy already had coronavirus strings).
Please make sure to do some research before publishing an article like that does nothing else than just initiate conspiracy."

This finding was similarly echoed by a German scientist a few weeks earlier, which helps explain the massive outbreak of COVID-19 infection in Italy and Spain in February 2020.

The genomics of the COVID-19 strain that spread in the US shows that it originated from Europe. 

What intrigues me is why the media is intent on focusing on China as the source of the outbreak when science has shown that the virus was present in Italy a month before it showed up in Wuhan? And that for months, Italians were sick in droves by a strain of ""flu"" virus. 

New York Times, are you really investigating this? Or just perpetuating the narrative that it was China's fault?"

Every other major country with a large population, porous borders not surrounded by the ocean, and a government that believes in civil rights, has not been able to contain the virus at all.   This is not a problem unique to the US or Trump.   The only correlation is if the state is ruled principals of Freedom or Totalitarianism."
2020-12-31 02:30:40,"This interesting comment from Dr. Ryan at WHO.

<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/29/who-warns-covid-19-pandemic-is-not-necessarily-the-big-one"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/29/who-warns-covid-19-pandemic-is-not-necessarily-the-big-one</a>

COVID-19 has a low mortality rate in comparison to other diseases. I agree with Dr. Ryan that we owe it to those that have died from COVID that all should learn from mistakes made (those in China and those in the West) to ensure that the next pandemic is (a) prevented if possible, and (b) treated more seriously, and less politically."
2020-12-31 02:36:10,"25 days is too late for China to prevent the virus from spilling into the rest of the world, but 10 months is not late for USA to take any action to control the virus in its territory."
2020-12-31 03:08:33,"History doesn't repeat itself, but people who don't learn from history will always find themselves repeating the same mistakes. Is it any surprise that China has done what it has done? Is it any surprise that the U.S. has given us this very unpresidential President Trump? People who are in the position to keep the world functional have once again failed at their job. Whether they are in China or the U.S., the government and the officials have let us down one more time."
2020-12-31 03:05:01,"No worse than a cold.  Not nearly as bad as the flu.  This is the misinformation that I and other health professionals that I know took at face value last February and March.   Shame on us for our foolish and dangerous desire to hear only what we want to believe.  Could the Times investigate the sources of that misinformation and how exactly it was disseminated?  

The COVID-19 pandemic shows how antisocial lying has consequences for everyone EXCEPT the liars.  We need to fix this!"
2020-12-31 03:32:32,"The psychology of an article like this is worth considering. While the piece seems well researched, it suffers from either bias or an intention to advance an agenda. While the NYT has perseverated for months on the assertion that COVD spread due to ""mishandling"" of the initial outbreak by China, there is absolutely nothing to support this conclusion. If there are any ""experts"" with a recipe for appropriate handling, why has the NYT failed to interview them? Why did they not guide the American response? Yes, there are those who say that if only Wuhan was locked down earlier, if only they didn't have that massive New Year potluck, etc. there would've been fewer infections and deaths by a certain point in time. But without China's containment and mitigation measures, COVID would have ravaged the country a few months later anyway. It started with a handful of cases in the US and look at us now. And there is absolutely no proof that locking down earlier would have prevented international spread. I even recall the NYT quoting ""experts"" who questioned the rationale of the Hubei lockdown. So, NYT, what should China have done? Then there is this suggestion that silencing scientists and doctors allowed COVID to spread. But as we have seen in the US, letting doctors speak  did not help. Nor did knowing what happened in China. This is because warnings are useless without a coordinated and well funded response. 

COVID was never in China's grasp but China did manage to stomp it underfoot."
2020-12-31 03:44:58,"the Trump Virus continues to ravage our nation in service to his pathetic ego, ignorance and megalomania.

every American who who has lost their life, health, family, livelihood has been assaulted by Donald Trump.

the authoritarianism that hindered open reporting of the virus in the early days in China has been more than matched by the murderous incompetence and greed that's permeated the Trump response here.  

Remember...it was his official policy to let ""everyone"" get infected to spread a ""herd immunity"" that might've killed tens of millions along the way.

the Trump Viruis will forever be marked as a definitive moment of American downfall, matched only by the even worse incompetence and dictatorial arrogance of Woodrow Wilson in the Pandemic of 1918.

Wilson's White Supremacist views matched those of Trump.  so did his callous indifference to the death and suffering of  the average American. 

only scientific advances and the lack of a World War have allowed us to keep the death toll under what happened in 1918.  but we're not yet out of the woods.  Trump has nearly three weeks more in office."
2020-12-31 03:51:35,"Both Xi and Trump were foolish enough to think that propaganda could suppress the spread of the virus and the public's knowledge of their criminal irresponsibilty. It is astonishing that educated leaders with access to the world's best expertise could delude themselves and others into thinking that they could strong arm their way through the inevitable explosion of a pandemic. From the first recognition that the virus was being transmitted from patients to health care workers in Wuhan, leaders in China and elsewhere should have realized the potential for catastrophic transmission within and beyond China and triggered well established protocols for containment and mitigation. Their choice to suppress knowledge and communication instead is a terrible indictment of their leadership."
2020-12-30 20:24:27,"I am sorry but the inconvenient truth is that Covid-19  would likely never have happened had China, after SARS, done two important things, cleaned-up its fetid wet markets and banned the consumption of known corona-virus carrying animals such as bats and pangolins.

It didn't and now the country has given the world two pandemics in twenty years. 

I don't know how China ever lives this down. And I think it knows that and is, thus, acting like any guilty party, obfuscating,  aggressive, boastful.

It's up to the world community to call China out. If it doesn't, and doesn't insist on changes there, we will have yet another horrible virus. It's a mathematical certainty."
2020-12-30 20:49:08,"The micromanagement methods of autocracies - of Trump on the one hand and of Xi and the CP on the other - are antithetical to the exercise of creative and responsible research and action down the hierarchy.  This article offers a convincing case in point.  No one can expect creative work - and medical science is without a doubt creative work - when clueless political thugs are in charge of everything.  A previous article detailing the troll farms in China, charged with putting across the official line on everything at the direction of the party, shows the pervasiveness of official micromanagement.  

And yet, substantial populations in the US and China apparently are unable to understand.  The lessons of history going back are far as there is a record are unanimous, and still the struggle to free ourselves of thuggish leaders goes on, decade after decade."
2020-12-31 02:40:12,"The West is begrudgingly conceding that China has successfully brought the pandemic under control with case numbers at minimal, yet the West can never begin to understand how China managed to do that, nor are they willing to even try to understand it. Prejudice against the Chinese way of running a country is so prevalent that no one bothers to admit the merit of the system. Centuries of looting and robbing from poor countries has cultivated a kind of arrogance in the West to the point that even the slightest achievement made by non-West countries are nitpicked and sniffed and disregarded. It is sad. 

If you bothered to learn a bit Chinese history you'll know how China got left behind in the 1800s and was bullied and sabotaged by the West----we were arrogant and blind to whatever ground-breaking progress happening in the West. 

Let's see if history does repeat itself."
2020-12-31 01:39:53,Can someone tell when the whole world is reeling and burning under COVID-19 why China now remains unaffected with the virus? Looks like they created it and passed it on to others knowing how to insulate themselves now from Covid-19. China had a plan. The motives are many. To weaken the world in order to gain ultimate supremacy. To remain economically powerful first and militarily next. The waning United States and the other western powers give China a brilliant chance to be the No 1 nation on the earth. They are certainly succeeding in that . Autocracies are anyway have a majority of the world population under them. The free world has not been able to turn around most of them into democracies.
2020-12-23 11:23:24,"One thing is certain.  The taxpayers who put the dollars in the hands of our trusted managers did so in order to be served and protected, and it is the taxpayers who's money must be returned to keep the consumer supply chain intact so that they are able to eat and sleep and travel freely, and that is what we call Trickle Up.
Funds given back to the citizenry are easily traced, they go right back into the coffers of the supply chain and from there taxed again for Washington to do the business of managing our money.
Get the money back into the hands of The People, not Citizens United pronto, and keep it coming."
2020-12-23 11:25:34,"I thoroughly enjoy Trump fighting with his own republican senators. It does, however, strain the phrase ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" to the breaking point."
2020-12-23 11:48:06,"I don't get the proposal to increase stimulus checks. I'm all for raising unemployment and more funding to help businesses as well as state and local governments. But if you have been employed throughout this, which is the case with the majority of people, this is simply a gift that you and your children will pay for for decades to come. How much of the stimulus money got spent last time? I read a good percent was used to pay down debt or saved."
2020-12-23 11:48:37,"Trump is now advocating for more government money directed back to the citizenry.
The question that needs to be asked is ,what took so long ?
Does Rush Limbaugh know about this ?
It does seem out of character."
2020-12-23 11:49:40,"Trump is right.  He believes Americans should be getting $2,000.  Speaker Pelosi rejected $1200 months ago, despite assurances that negotiations would be ongoing and unaffected.  She had other priorities.  Now individuals are getting only $600."
2020-12-23 11:52:45,The relief check should not be so large for the general population but should concentrate on those who are out of work via the unemployment insurance benefit.  Increase that to $1000 instead of $300 and eliminate the general distribution.
2020-12-23 11:41:36,"I care not the Presidents motives, $2,000 stimulas checks is the right thing to do. Increasing the tax deduction for business lunches is not, along with a host of other perks for the well healed and corporations."
2020-12-23 11:50:42,"I know it's politics, but the miscellaneous items in these big bills has always bothered me. Never more than now. I might actually agree with Trump here. If only he'd stick with fighting a good fight, he might have a happier life. But he seems to have a hard time defining ""good fight"" IMHO."
2020-12-23 11:51:36,So this will probably delay the checks. Then we are going to see yet another delay from Trump wanting to put his signature on the checks. Trump is going above and beyond to leave President Biden a shaky economy.
2020-12-23 11:40:48,"Should Mr. Trump veto the bill after sitting out negotiations, Mr. Raskin said, it would be a “ludicrous way to run government, but it’s a fitting end to his presidency.”

This is the way it has been for the last four years but we will soon have a reprieve. If in fact this is veto proof just pass it into law. I too would like to see a higher relief check for those in need. But look how long it took to get this far. Just pass the bill."
2020-12-23 11:44:21,"The broken clock president has done his truth tweet for the week.  Pelosi shouldn't give the demagogue credibility and risk the agreement that is at hand by offering to renegotiate this one.  Get this money out there and then negotiate an expansion at the next opportunity, probably when Biden is president.  

Most GOP politicians will fear the wrath of Trump as much then so if the broken clock holds this thought he can help Biden push for the changes he claims to want at that time."
2020-12-23 11:42:57,"It's such a relief to know that business people will be able to deduct their lunches.  It's also really great that yet more billions are going to the military, which received a budget increase of more than 100 billion under Trump already.  Absolutely no explanation has been given for what need these increases are addressing, nor has it been explained how the money will be spent.

What we have in this bill is a flimsy gesture toward covid relief, with a huge amount of pork slipped in.  It's no wonder McConnell wants a vote before anyone has time to even read this 5000+ -page piece of legislation."
2020-12-23 11:46:55,"Listening  to trump tout this new disruption and figured out a possible motivation (because he clearly doesn’t care about the recipients of stimulus checks). He states that if Congress doesn’t give $2000, perhaps the next administration will do this....perhaps his administration. So, I’m guessing he thinks this will cause americans to put  pressure on republican senators to sign on to an attempt to overturn the election when they are due to certify on January 6. We certainly know mike pence continues  to support the president’s baseless claims. 
Wonder how many more half baked ideas and additional chaos will ensue in the next 27 days.  We can only hope he stays longer at mar-a-lago and distracts himself playing golf.   And then after January 20, maybe he can busy himself with his legal worries and leave the rest of alone."
2020-12-23 11:44:21,"Sometimes my bad will gets the better of me. In such moments I wish for the president to veto the COVID relief bill just to see the GOP ants scramble. They have a veto-proof majority on the current bill. Why don't they encourage him to veto it and then pass it anyway and let him know he has squandered his relevance?

Along similar lines, I am currently wishing that at least one Dem senator joins Mo Brooks in challenging the electoral college votes in the congress, sending the houses to meet in their separate chambers to vote. That way the GOP senators would have either to vote seditiously with Trump where the rubber really does meet the road, or vote him out and take heat from the rabid dogs they have unleashed upon us."
2020-12-23 11:36:55,"A commendable and very appropriate recommendation by Trump who comes out of his cave but given his craven, bizarre, and self-serving behavior of recent note can his motives be seen as sincere or reflecting some new found empathy? Highly unlikely and suspect - where has he been up until this eleventh hour? Why wasn't he urging McConnell to work with the democratic leadership long before this? One has to wonder about his motives, what's in it for him, always the case with Trump."
2020-12-23 11:53:36,"He could care less about the citizens.  Just a way to make himself look like he actually cares by playing Mr. Generous to gather more allegiance from his base and possibly more support for whatever political maneuvers he wishes to engage in down the line.  And did anyone think he would support money for the arts? But good for the people getting the extra help.  After the way he mishandled so much of the virus situation, it's the least he can do, whatever his motives."
2020-12-23 11:46:31,"Trump is right.  That bill is way, way, way too small.   A wall of poverty is about to close in on America's working class, and Congress is doing nothing.   I don't see how America can throw her working people under the bus like this.  What good is government if it can't take care of its people in their hour of need?"
2020-12-23 11:49:06,"As we Brits might say, takes one to know one. Or, in this case, takes one to accuse the hard and (at least partly) bipartisan work of others that may shadow one’s utter lack of achievement and complete corruption one."
2020-12-23 11:33:06,"If Trump does not like the covid relief bill that passed both Houses of Congress, why did he not take part in the process as the bill was being negotiated (after 8 months)?

If he really believed that as president he had a responsibility to help  shape and pass the bill, his objection this late in the game is noting more than a political stunt.

This is just one more reason among hundreds why Trump is the worst president in American history."
2020-12-23 11:52:53,"He would have no intention of supporting bigger checks. Talk is cheap, he just wants to look good for his base, especially now in Florida. Of course, he just might be slipping over the edge."
2020-12-23 12:02:51,"Trump hadn't been involved in this legislation until now, and now he wants it changed.  After four years, he still doesn't understand how the process works, and he never will.  January 20th can't come soon enough."
2020-12-23 11:54:14,"He's on his way out and trying to maintain popularity- his lifeblood.  I am all for raising what Americans get to $2000- it's fair, will make a huge difference in many people's lives and most of it will be spent back into the economy.  Though I might consider the amount in two installments placed 2 months apart so that people will not just spend it all at once.  Probably not worth the paperwork though."
2020-12-23 12:27:43,"What hasn't he called a disgrace?

Typical Trump.  Can't and won't negotiate or even get involved in the process but is happy to jump in after the fact and tell everyone what a bad job they're doing.  He thinks it makes him seem like a tough guy hero or something but it just makes him look weak and pathetic.

Did you see the video? His song-song voice was weird.  He's living in a fantasy worlds and it's all over in 28 days.  Thank god."
2020-12-23 11:55:34,"Suddenly he cares about the people? I assume he hasn't been watching the food panty lines, the increase of homeless on the streets all because of his dereliction of duty that has killed nearly 350,000 Americans. He should donate all the money in his ridiculous re-election campaign to charities all across America, but we know that won't happen."
2020-12-23 11:56:36,"The long, national nightmare is almost over. Pack your bags and go quietly."
2020-12-23 12:29:51,"The fact that he does not understand that all this ""spending that has nothing to do with covid"" is from the appropriations bill that was combined with the covid relief bill shows us 1) after four years he still does not understand the legislative process, 2) there are no adults in the White House who can muzzle him and 3) he is by far the most ignorant man to ever be President."
2020-12-23 12:17:39,Cut to the chase everyone.  Trump is a knave.  He will do anything to try to reverse is election defeat.  He cares about nothing else.
2020-12-23 12:08:14,"Trump said the virus would be gone like a ""miracle."" Yes, a miracle, and a $2,000 check for every single American. Incompetence of the highest order."
2020-12-23 12:44:09,"Normally, I would second-guess a lifeline from Trump, but I can’t afford to do that right now; I’m drowning here. $600 will give me a few more seconds to catch my breath before going under. $2000 will give me a chance to wade closer to shore. The next couple of weeks are financially crucial for me. If he can add the money without delaying payments, then yes, please allow him to do it."
2020-12-23 11:54:48,"I propose increasing the individual payouts to $2,000 (or more!) as the President requested, offset it by discarding the $1.4 billion installment on the soon to be defunct Border Wall."
2020-12-23 12:07:21,"If Trump really cared about sending larger stimulus checks to Americans, why wasn’t he involved in the talks from the start? Sounds like a typical publicity stunt to satisfy his base."
2020-12-23 11:40:03,Trump is obviously concerned that Biden will upstage him with more stimulus relief money.
2020-12-23 11:47:19,"Wow. I actually agree with DJT on something.
But I still don't trust his motives. My question is ""Why this and why now?""  What is he thinking in that brain of his?  It can't be because he suddenly cares about the average American."
2020-12-23 11:48:07,"Good heavens, Mr. Trump has emerged! I thought he was sleeping all this time, awakening only to tweet curses at voting machines and fire people. 

As it turns out, he's right about the $600. But for him it isn't about concern for Americans, it's about wooing them. 

Bread and circuses. 

He has over the years provided plenty of distractions; he might as well provide money too."
2020-12-23 11:41:55,Now he’s calling for more relief fund?  Where was he when Congress was arguing on the size of the relief over the past several weeks?  Incompetency to the brim.
2020-12-23 11:28:31,"So, Trump agrees with Joe Biden that Americans need more relief!  Has he become a supporter of the President Elect?"
2020-12-23 11:50:52,Recognizing that Trump is right about something causes serious cognitive dissonance.  But Trump is right about this.
2020-12-23 11:39:12,"Graft, greed, and mismanagement again - money for horse racing, the business lunch deduction, yet states are trying to claw back the pandemic relief they’ve already paid out. Trump is trying to curry favor with Americans after throwing them under the bus with the pandemic. We are losing our jobs because of escalating illness and Republicans are offering $600 - the tab for one business lunch at Trump Hotel."
2020-12-23 12:17:38,"Of course non-targeted checks sent to all comers, while helpful and enjoyed by most all recipients- are the least effective at assuaging the most severely affected citizens.  

So much for better unemployment assistance.  You know - for the unemployed ....."
2020-12-23 12:05:49,"This is a perfect example, as the curtain falls on his administration, of how little Trump understands about the workings of actual government. His supporters wanted a man with no experience in government, and they got it alright. 

It's easy to frame this as ""the swamp at work"", but this is how legislation moves. Had Trump put this number on the table a month ago instead of chasing his obsessive fantasies and working to pardon his friends  -- i.e. actually doing his job and providing leadership -- then there would have been a baseline for negotiations that would've sped up the process of getting help to people.

How fitting that he end his tenure in this manner. How sad it would be if this outburst kept much-needed aid from so many just because of Trump's utter lack of competence, his closed-minded refusal to learn how his job works, and his delusional and narcissistic approach to leadership. 

As  Alexis De Tocqueville said: ""In democracy, the people get the government they deserve.""

How sadly, prophetically true."
2020-12-23 11:46:40,Sidelined and taken out of the game. This is Trump becoming more and more aware of his own insignificance and that his presidency has ended in ignominy.
2020-12-23 12:13:40,"Trump decides to burn the house down, so the ex can't live in it.  He tied up the kids and they're still in the house.

Unemployment insurance for gig workers will cease.  Eviction protection will cease.  Congress isn't in session and won't be back for weeks.

Trump couldn't spend any time working with Congress, he had conspiracy theories to chase, this thirteenth hour intervention is meant to destroy the relief bill.

Trump dangles $2,000 checks in front of people about to be thrown out into the cold.  His cruelty seems unbounded."
2020-12-23 11:23:11,"The 'President' wants more money only because he knows that upon taking office President Biden will seek a much better relief bill and he can't stand the idea that: 

a) He will no longer be 'President' at noon on January 20th, and,

b) Joe Biden will get credit for anything.

Trump cares not one iota about the American people, the Constitution, the planet, etc. His only concern is his delusional fantasy of his own greatness.

In this instance he happens to be right that the amount of relief should be much bigger, but this is not (and for him never ever is) about what is right or decent or moral or ethical or rational..."
2020-12-23 11:39:21,"Trump’s last minute push for $2,000 stimulus checks, which many Americans clearly need and most Democrats have long supported, is a cynical ploy to win support for his desperate, dishonest, attempt to thwart democracy!  He rose to power as the “champion” of the white working class, but governed mostly for himself and his cronies; empowering the GOP to pass a typical Republican agenda showering massive tax cuts on the wealthy while gutting regulations that protect workers and the environment. Now, after his own Treasury Secretary helped negotiate an inadequate bill, Trump finds it useful to separate himself from a GOP establishment that fervently believes every dime sent to non wealthy Americans, even during this deadly pandemic, hurts the economy by disincentivizing work and increasing deficits, a renewed concern now that Democrats are back in power. Trump is ever the con man. But for the sake of millions who really do need it, I hope this last con succeeds, then he can get out!"
2020-12-23 11:49:43,"Unreal.  If trump was showing real leadership as Mnuchin tried to assert,  he would have weighed in with his demand for a larger stimulus early on in the negotiations,  not after they were concluded.  The Dems were calling for a stimulus around the same size that trump is now demanding.  Why didn't he say something then?? This isn't leadership,  it's spoke in the eye that will only gum things up."
2020-12-23 12:09:45,"Wow, for once I agree with the President.  Lets get real money into people's hands.  $2000 stimulus and $500 per week unemployment, lets help America out."
2020-12-23 11:57:23,"$2,000 stimulus checks for individuals? I woke up this morning to discover that Donald Trump has morphed into a Progressive. I'm not sure the proposal will be able to limp through Wednesday and Thursday, but the Democrats have your back on this one, President Trump. Just think how successful your presidency would have been if you would have tackled infrastructure improvements with the same enthusiasm. If this is what ""owning the libs"" looks like, we'll take it."
2020-12-23 12:13:37,"Let's not forget that this pandemic ""relief"" bill also allows restaurant employers to steal more tips from their tipped employees in order to raise the wages of their non-tipped employees."
2020-12-23 12:09:25,"Trump, The Art of the Deal ? He is the PRESIDENT. If he wanted $2000 checks why did he NOT negotiate it with Congress ? His adversaries wanted it too. So it would have meant no more than corralling those Senate legislators in his purportedly OWN GOP party. This after the fact gripe falls flat."
2020-12-23 12:16:05,"Trump could have mentioned to Moscow Mitch months ago, that he thought a $2000 payment figure was more appropriate. He didn't. And he knows that Republicans won't go for that amount anyway. Why is he doing this? Because he's Trump. Need anything more be said?"
2020-12-23 11:57:07,"Trump has always been a classic New York Democrat for most of his life, that’s why I voted for him in 2016 hoping that his blusterous approach was what was needed to get things done quickly. 

He has proven to have had good instincts, he called the republican health plan “mean“, he was for gun reform before the NRA got to him and he has decided against military missions that would cause needless deaths. The only problem is, the man is easily swayed into a different direction by those around him him. He is right about this bill’s inadequacies but I have no faith that he will hold on to his convictions this time."
2020-12-23 11:57:13,I am happy Trump got beat and is leaving but on this he is right. The people who have to get in the back of the line to get Vaccinated are now they are told to accept peanuts. If you are going to help someone really help them instead of giving them scraps. The Federal Government totally mishandled the response to The Virus and now they are concerned about debt? It is ironic the people who have not missed a paycheck and are getting The Vaccine before the frontline workers deemed 600 dollars is a bonanza for people standing in bread lines.
2020-12-23 12:17:16,I’m curious if his veto threat has anything to do with not approving the funds to keep government running? Is this another tactic to try and stop Congress from counting the electoral votes January 6 ?
2020-12-23 12:52:39,"It’s a bit misleading to say this has been months of bipartisan effort when no deal was made prior to the election for concerns it would impact election results. Other countries around the world have passed bills that support people and companies impacted by COVID (while holding them accountable) for months now and we are left begging for scraps by comparison. The current bill is not enough and doesn’t go far enough, much like the first relief bill that passed back in the spring."
2020-12-23 13:04:52,"I am usually with the Democrats but honestly - there are many people, myself included who would get but don't need the benefit of those checks.  I'd rather see the money go to people who really need it."

2020-12-23 13:05:36,Trump has given up any sense of being president for the last 6 weeks.  He's happy now just to keep throwing accelerants onto an already big fire.
2020-12-23 12:40:41,"Trump is trying to present himself as Robin Hood-- taking from the evil government and giving to the poor.  This is all about image. There's a reason that the last two minutes of his speech suggested overturning the election  (""maybe the next term president will be me"").  He's bribing the MAGAs to continue fighting to overturn the election.

Ironically,  as a Democrat, I've been pushing for the $2000 option for months.  But I hate to see it used as a bribe instead of being part of a balanced proposal by congress."
2020-12-23 13:16:27,"An additional $2,000 - or an additional $1,400 - would provide an amazing boost to the economy, as well as an essential lifeline to millions of Americans in dire financial straits. I don't care if it is a political stunt from the White House, and I don't care how it gets through Congress. It's an explicit acknowledgment of the pain & suffering so many Americans have endured during this pandemic, and an attempt to redress those grievances. 

Of course that's one of many reasons McConnell won't allow this idea to see the light of day: the last thing in the world he wants is proof that government can be a significant part of the solution."
2020-12-23 11:31:49,"Trump only wants to one-up Biden, who called for more relief for the poor and middle-class Americans suffering right now. This is yet another dangerous stunt brought to you by an inept, impulsive nongoverning resident of the White House who won't start packing up despite having been handed his pink slip."
2020-12-23 13:03:19,"I always known he was mean, dishonest, and incompetent.  Now I truly believe he is insane."
2020-12-23 12:54:20,"You have to admit, if anyone knows and understands 'Disgrace'...It is Donald J Trump."
2020-12-23 12:39:56,"Chum for his sharks.  He understands (but his wee fishies don't) that a lot of the items he mentions (museums, etc) and says are ""closed""... are getting $ BECAUSE they are ""closed"" and have bills to pay!"
2020-12-23 13:09:41,"""Hey look over here, where I pretend to care about the American people....while I pardon twenty criminals over there."""
2020-12-23 12:54:00,"I support President Trump and demanding $2000 for every American and we need to strip out the $500,000,000 Israel got for it’s Iron Dome Missile Defense System."
2020-12-23 11:34:36,"Wow, he has actually done something since election day, other cry how no one likes him. Had he responded to and worked with Congress, we wouldn't be here now. Go away little man, go play more golf. Go scam more of your followers for a winless challenge."
2020-12-23 12:39:52,"I’m not joining the Fraudulent Election Bandwagon for anything less than $3,000."
2020-12-23 12:28:44,"Always the showman, like his early predecessor P T Barnum. Perhaps Trump is going to re-join the Democratic party. Your guess is as good as mine."
2020-12-23 12:36:30,"I *hate* to agree with President Trump, but isn't he correct here? Strip out all of the congressman-specific goodies (see <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/us/politics/whats-in-the-covid-relief-bill.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/us/politics/whats-in-the-covid-relief-bill.html</a>), increase the per-person checks from $600 to $2000, keep the other main items (funds for supplemental unemployment, vaccine distributions and small business subsistence, etc.), so the 5,900 page bill becomes <100 pages that even a congressman (or her/his staff) can peruse in a couple of hours before taking a vote. As a Warren/Sanders Democrat, I support every one of these things. Even if I don't support the man who suggested them."
2020-12-23 12:41:27,"As reported in the infamous Fox News, there is list of foreign aid in this package that seems absurd in my view — I don’t agree to Fox News position in many issues, the sad thing is I have not heard similar reports from CNN, MSNBC, this paper, Washington Post and NPR. We are in deep crisis even before Cordiv. With Cordiv going much worse this upcoming weeks, can American people support and afford these types of foreign aid? These aids are not helping other countries to vaccinate their people with Cordiv vaccine, these aids include funding for gender study in Pakistan, border security for Middle East countries etc etc. My challenge to news media is to read the spending bill in deep and report, not opinionated , the fact to the public. I agree that there are a lot of fat for the rich in this bill, but those are for American at least. Wealth inequality is the fact and reality for many generations, it will remain so for our civilization for long time until Communist Utopia is realizing."
2020-12-23 12:47:51,"Well, for once I agree with Trump partially.  We have no business giving money to foreign countries, giving money to special interest lobbyist, giving money to continue building a boarder wall, and giving money to all of the other special interests while American suffer.   It is a covid relief bill, but like all of the other things these bozos do in congress it is filled with money of the money going to special interests.   While I am not a Trump supporter, and didn't vote for him, he makes a good point.  We need to support and help Americans while this horrific virus is raging throughout this country."
2020-12-23 13:01:57,"Democrats passed a bill in May that republicans completely ignored.  Then when they wanted to do something very small just before the election, Nancy took a hard pass.  

Republicans never wanted to help the unemployed and truly small businesses or our states.  It was just an opportunity to grab more for donors and impart immunity
for reckless corporate behavior.

Facts matter
Republicans obstruct.

Republicans failed to protect us from a corrupt and incompetent president who is now turning his ire in them- let’s see if they have the guts to stand up to him now."
2020-12-23 12:28:04,trump's suggestion of $2000 direct relief checks is nothing more than temptation -- give the $2000 and then all of his transgressions are okayed in return -- quid pro quid.
2020-12-23 12:47:48,"Derail Months of bipartisan work? They just said most of it was written in secret and they voted on a bill they had only hours to read. AOC called it a hijacked bill. I’m all for 2,000 checks. And yes, a covid relief bill should only include covid relief related money 🤷🏽 And I’m not even a fan of trump but I agree with him on this one"
2020-12-23 12:29:48,"His primary concern is himself, as it always has been. His last, best hope is that Congress overturns the election (not that it is likely, just that there are no other paths). That he is so outlandish and outrageous in this pursuit indicates he realizes that when he is no longer POTUS, he will be toast."
2020-12-23 12:39:00,"I know Trump is insane but at this moment in time on this subject Trump gets an A from a this ""democratic socialist"". 
here in Quebec we have a de facto universal basic income and a guarantee of healthcare, education and security. We call these rights in the 21st century.
I am 72 and I remember the 1960s when America was the promised land, suffering may good for the soul but 70,000 years of human civilization has made life far easier and far more rewarding.
Surely in our time of excess hard times call for more rights and fewer privileges. Fifty million Americans going to bed hungry and worrying about healthcare, shelter and basic security is a crime against humanity.
Daycare is a right here in Quebec because we are short workers not because we believe sloth is a virtue. Americans believe far too much propaganda. Most people are wanting to do what helps their fellow man."
2020-12-23 12:58:15,"In the unwritten law where I come from, if you can't win you can at least spoil it for the winner. I come from northern Queens in the 1950s, same as Trump. He's just being a spoiler and Congress should just override his veto. Pellossi and Schumer should stand down, don't take the bait."
2020-12-23 12:38:53,"Trump isn't asking for $2000 payments out of the goodness of his heart, but so he can say he did ask for it and to saddle the Biden administration with a larger debt.

A good third of those that received checks did not need them and had seen no change in their work as a result of Covid."
2020-12-23 12:34:54,"Who’s to say that even if Congress goes for the $2K carrot dangled by trump that he won’t turn and veto that. The man is totally unpredictable. Even though what was passed is insufficient,  it will get the country to the Biden-Harris administration when something better can be passed."
2020-12-23 12:56:12,I'm wondering if Trump can do a pocket veto -- over the next 10 days won't the House and Senate sessions end?  Doesn't that mean the bill dies if Trump doesn't sign it?
2020-12-23 12:41:32,"Rarely in our history has a President, modestly challenged by events fail so utterly as has Trump.   The disaster that was the James Buchanon Presidency lacks modern relevance for worst Presidency.  Trump will serve the role well."
2020-12-23 12:22:59,"Sorry all my liberal friends. I'm happy he''ll no longer be the President but and I've said this all along, he's not wrong about everything. 
The Kennedy Center and Theater in NYC are wonderful, but my fellow citizen who is ready to kill themself because they are back on rent and bills and can't feed their family, well that guy, no matter his political beliefs, he means much more to me and his life is more wonderful than rich cultural institutions. 
Tell the Broadway producers who are worth hundreds of millions, to kick in their own money to keep their business afloat. If a small shop owner is  personally worth many millions and is asking for money to keep his business afloat, there would be outrage. How is it different?"
2020-12-23 13:03:02,"The true disgrace is the refusal to advise ALL Americans--over the last 9 months--to wear masks and practice health measures. Had that been done--and done in good faith--then the critical, economic situation might have been less of a burden. And, most importantly, lives would have been saved. This ""concern"" is disingenuous, we reject this faux leadership display."
2020-12-23 12:28:23,"Each day the President continues in office 2000-3000 people die from COVID-19. The President should be at work 24/7 to change this - instead he is absent from managing the crisis. Yet no one in government has sought to remove him from office in a constitutional, legal way - and bring in someone who can/will manage the crisis and prevent more deaths. The framers of the Constitution had no way of anticipating the nature and scope of the crisis we face today. Clearly, there needs to be an amendment to the Constitution so that government leaders, whether they be the generals, supreme court justices, the White House physician, Congressional leaders, etc. can in a legal and ethical way bring in a new (and temporary) leader on an emergency basis to save the lives of its citizens and our Democracy itself."
2020-12-23 12:49:17,"They worked for months on this, and came up with something that does not help the people. This has nothing to do with Donald Trump. The problems in government run far deeper than him and are not (even remotely) solved by voting for Joe Biden / voting Democrat."
2020-12-23 12:43:15,"It's pretty obvious in what Trump is attempting to do. The first is a bribe to the American public to get them on his side to, in his mind, demand that he stay in office. The second is to prevent Biden from being the hero in his term by getting needed funds to individuals and stimulating the economy. Trump knows he's on the way out but he's still playing both sides. He is trying to do all that is possible to damage Biden's term while hanging onto a last ditch attempt to stay in power. Trump doesn't care about the American public. If he did he would have acted more responsibly in handling the Covid virus. This is the time for a united Congress to put a stop to Trump by overriding his threatened veto and send Trump a clear message that it's over and to move on."
2020-12-23 12:47:32,"Trump will stand in history as the first anarchist President.  If there is any way to disrupt the competent process of government, he unfailingly finds it. However, for once, I’m in agreement that the bill does very little to provide relief.  Most significantly,  and something Trump doesn’t care about, it fails to extend the paid coverage for employees who have to quarantine or have to care for an ill family member.  It also fails to extend paid child care leave.  Consequently, it will be meaningless for those who are in the direst circumstances."
2020-12-23 12:46:57,There are two parts to this spending bill.  One is relief. The other is to keep the government operating.  It's the latter that is so controversial.  Why are foreign governments receiving aid in a bill right now?
2020-12-23 12:23:16,This article says that Trump “sat out” the negotiations and the his Treasury Secretary helped negotiate it. On whose behalf was the Treasury Secretary acting?
2020-12-23 12:34:26,"It was fascinating following the Fox News coverage and comments of the bill that passed late Monday. It was full of commentators concerned that the $900 Billion would be horrible for the deficit. Then, after Trump spoke of $2,000 checks, the comments suddenly shifted to praising Trump's ""concern for struggling Americans"". Unbelievable!"
2020-12-23 12:53:53,"Anyone who has been paying attention knows Trump doesn’t really care about anyone but Trump. So, what is real objective with this latest disruptive move?"
2020-12-23 12:54:18,Be careful what you wish for with Mr Hidden Agenda. At this point no one should trust what Trump says. He was nowhere to be seen when this bill was being negotiated.
2020-12-23 12:57:46,"Reality TV behavior from a reality TV president. Designed to garner support from his base; everyone else gets thrown under the bus.

Remember, we've seen this before, right? It's his MO. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. 

All that matters to the base is the next soundbite/tweet that demonstrates he's giving them what they want (which is not necessarily what they or anyone needs)."
2020-12-23 12:33:07,"I actually agree with trump for the first time.  The measly checks are all Moscow Mitch's doing.  $2,000 is a perfect amount,  but it should only be sent to people who actually need it. My wife and I don't and we received a check from the last bill.  We gave it to a local food bank.  Maybe trump will run in 2024 as a democrat if he's not in prison."
2020-12-23 13:00:05,"Mitch McConnell may look in control and even-tempered, but underneath he's got to be boiling at this attempt by Trump to jump into the game with seconds left to make a final shot at looking good.  I don't know how the ""leaders"" came up with the $600 amount or how Trump came up with the $2,000 amount but throwing free money around like paper towels is not the way to run a country.

Our country is broken and our government is broken."
2020-12-23 12:23:32,"Who knows what kind of madness Trump will engage in before the end of his thoroughly lamentable term. If he doesn't sign this bill, but indulges a pocket veto, the new Congress will have to begin all over again (legislation does not carry over from one Congress to the next). Moreover, a lot of people are going to see their unemployment end on December 26. So we better hope he funds the government before it shuts down. That would add disaster upon disaster."
2020-12-23 12:28:22,$2000 seems cheap enough to buy voters in Georgia and Republican House members who want to support alternative Electoral College votes.
2020-12-23 12:59:15,"Sure, I can say agree with him, but before Trump even tries to do something about it, he will be distracted by a new point of outrage that comes across his phone or his TV screen and forget the whole idea of economic stimulus ever existed.  Someone reassure me that we're not going to have to wait until the Biden administration for even a penny of relief."
2020-12-23 12:21:35,This is president Trump at his best and why he’ll be missed. He is the only person fighting for the middle class against the Elites that run our lives. I pray that he runs again in 2024.
2020-12-23 12:35:35,"I predicted that Trump would come out against the bill, simply because of the coverage he would enjoy. Bet he signs it, though."
2020-12-23 12:25:24,"Sad! If Trump had spent less time tweeting, ranting on Fox & Friends, and listening to his RNC-approved advisors and lobbyists, he would have won re-election in a landslide. I refuse to say ""thank you, Mr. President"" at this point. But Trump's innate populism, i.e. his desire to help the American people, is still there and could return him to the White House in 2024 (for better or for worse). As long as the Democrats offer no credible alternative, his appeal to the electorate will not fade."
2020-12-23 12:31:33,"It’s pretty clear by now that the unemployment system is badly broken. 

Self-employed people face a confusing welter of rules that prevent millions in the gig economy from receiving relief they need and deserve.  Many states, including New York and California, couldn’t manage to process claims for months on end.

We should have just passed the $1,000 / month for everybody Yang plan last March.  At this stage, send out $2,000 per person who made less than $75,000 in 2019.  The next four months are going to be brutal."
2020-12-23 12:36:05,"The Republican Party is already at war with itself. Now Trump could put them all in a double-bind. If he vetoes the bill will they vote to override? The vote in the Senate was 94 to 6, with a similar veto proof margin in the House. This would inflame all the Trump supporters out there who revere him unconditionally.

Will they split ranks and not override the veto? Then the government shuts down, there would be no pandemic relief, no money for vaccine distribution, etc and many Americans and the economy suffers. He quite clearly would love to hand Biden an even greater crisis and mess. 

Will they vote to add another 370 billion dollars to the bill (deficit) in order to give all Americans making under 75K $2,000 checks? This would give very large checks to every adult in this group, ($5,000 to a family of 4) including those who were not unemployed and continued to work throughout the pandemic. It would be far more productive to target the people and businesses who have really suffered economically during the pandemic."
2020-12-23 12:40:42,More performance art for his fanbase.  Where was Mr. Stable Genius Dealmaker when the negotiations were underway?
2020-12-23 12:19:49,Is it too optimistic but are these stimulus payments a test run in national guaranteed income payments?
2020-12-23 12:34:26,"After Biden comes into office pass a new law that all former and current Presidents  must show their taxes 

Trump waited until two days before Christmas to maje this suggestion trying to get attention for himself.

Only low income snd middke income households making less then $150,000 should get any type of help.

In the future instead of sending checks it is simple to just create jobs like a modem national speed train to create millions of jobs. 

We are giving money which will lead to more manufacturing in China. Simply build speed  trains in US ."
2020-12-23 12:30:53,"Both parties cannot resist playing political games, sacrificing our nation’s future to keep their voter bases. (News flash, sad, but highly likely Republicans will win at least one seat in Georgia)

The $2000 per person means a half trillion dollars. 
In the spring/summer, after the $2000 is spent, we will finally realize that certain service industries are not coming back, plus millions of Americans will have left the work force permanently before their time. 
Yes, some bars and poodle grooming parlors will finally have to close. 

We will need a ton of money to develop new paths of economic growth. Save this money."
2020-12-23 12:42:19,"This is the beginning of the Trump '24 campaign.  Trump, by doing this, can undercut Biden's ""much more is needed"" and also make senate republicans bend the knee.  The combination of the bill with general spending provisions is the perfect opportunity for him to play the populist by comparing provisions in the bill to the paltry $600.  To be clear, much more than $600 is needed, but i doubt Trump actually cares about it that much.  He sees an opportunity and is taking it."
2020-12-23 12:50:35,"The very best scenario would be for Trump to veto the bill covid relief bill and the defense bill and have Congress, with the help of the majority of Republicans, over ride the veto.  This might possibly demonstrate to Trump that his intimidating power over the Republican in congress is now virtually nil. 
Republican voters have already rejected Trump as shown by the significant number of Republican voters who voted for Biden as president but then voted a straight Republican down ballot ticket."
2020-12-23 11:51:23,"why now? another lie? or just a way to get senate trumpublicans to, as nancy reagan put it ""just say no"" and then he can stop the bill and punish america for not voting for him!"
2020-12-23 12:36:06,"‘President Trump sat out on negotiations’

Well, he ain’t Jed Bartlett..."
2020-12-23 12:34:28,"I'm ready to agree with this clown. Once again a good chunk of this bill, 200 billion is going to the Uber rich. Read the other article on the front page."
2020-12-23 11:38:36,"Win win headline: ""President bites Republicans"" with Mitch and fellow do-nothings getting thoroughly trashed by their lead dog.
And truly good news, an increase from $600 to $2000 to actual taxpayers. By far the best way to stimulate the economy through on-the-ground consumers.
Never thought I'd hear myself saying this but here goes ""Go (sick 'em) Donald!""  And take another chunk out of Mitch whilst at it ... good boy."
2020-12-23 12:28:31,"This stimulus package is ridiculous, reflects how Congress is detached from understanding our economy and who really needs help. It is financial giveaways to the rich, to businesses that don't need help. It has more pork than China has pigs. It is shameful, and Pelosi, Schumer, an McConnell should be fined, then fired and never allowed to enter national politics."
2020-12-23 11:37:12,What a circus this presidency has been. It hasn’t been “shock  and awe” as much as shock and disgust. I do like that he’s making Mitch squirm and making it harder for the republicans to shout about the deficit starting 1/21
2020-12-23 12:05:36,"Is he ready to run screaming naked from the White House, gone stark raving mad?

I’d like to see that.

Except for the naked part; I’ve had enough trauma in 2020."
2020-12-23 12:44:45,The biggest disgrace is the disgrace running the country.
2020-12-23 12:41:10,"Wait..Trump actually said something intelligent:  that this bill is a disgrace.  100% agree this represents the worst in our politics.  Let's compromise - let's stick with 600$ checks, extend unemployment checks to June and strip out all the pork that snuck in."
2020-12-23 11:42:14,Trump is a passive aggressive baby. Please make it stop.
2020-12-23 13:33:56,Moves like this is why Trump is a hero to me and many Americans. The traditional Washington-as-usual politicians kneel to special interests and lobbyists and never want to push back. Here we have a President who is not afraid to make bold moves and shake things up.  I hope he gets these changes implemented.
2020-12-23 13:36:04,"I don't believe for a moment that these two-thousand-dollars checks are going to be sent to anybody during Trump's watch or even approved.  But if the matter comes up after Biden takes office, I hope that a two-tiered approach will be considered, with those most in need getting more than those moderately in need."
2020-12-23 13:03:44,"Last week, for several days, the top of the NYTs home failed to mention Trump even once. Today there are seven, SEVEN headlines with his name in them. When will the press realize this is what it's all about for him, it's about him."
2020-12-23 13:30:55,"Trump, consults with sycophants, and ignoramuses, struts in his dark blue Serge overcoat, and looks and acts every bit like the big red-haired brother of North Korea's Kim Jong-Un. With tenderness and caring like that, his 'America First' policy is a deep dive into public squalor and private suffering."
2020-12-23 13:33:27,This about the only time I have agreed with Trump: this bill is a disgrace.
2020-12-23 13:24:00,"it may be the only time in his entire life that he is right, but trump is right about this. this is a disgrace. typical congressional pork salad loaded with special interest give aways and little practical use to those who need it the most."
2020-12-23 13:29:17,Speaker Pelosi never misses a beat. God bless her. Take him up on his threat and pass another amendment named something Trumpesque. I dare the Senate to vote against anything with Trump’s name on it.
2020-12-23 11:50:33,"Gosh, I hate when I agree with Trump!!!   People are drowning!  This is not the time to worry about the Arts or any other pet project.  Every dollar should go to the drowning.  There will be plenty of time later to help others.  Sheesh!"
2020-12-23 12:07:13,"Look at that, I finally agree with Trump about something; the bill IS a disgrace."
2020-12-23 12:37:24,"Poor Steve Mnuchin. Trump sat on his birthday cake. Like a pig that smells a truffle once in a while Trump comes out of his miasma of grief over the election loss to seize the spotlight with by all accounts a “benevolent” gesture for the masses the same day he has pardoned convicted felons and war criminals that have supported him, including a guy who bilked Medicare for a billion dollars. A Billion Dollars. But let’s not quibble with the details, if ‘ya can’t pardon them buy ‘em off! This classic Trumpian misdirection is exactly why so many Americans drank the Koolaid."
2020-12-23 13:13:58,"Creating footage for his 2024 campaign. Careful, MSM, what you set up for him."
2020-12-23 11:49:35,"Why did it take this long for him to say something useful? Congress rammed a 5,600-plus page bill through so they could leave DC and enjoy their posh lifestyles."
2020-12-23 11:59:13,"This man is against the poor, the working men and women, the small business owner of America. He hates people that works for a living, he doesn’t trust the average men and women. He only likes and trust the rich. He is using his presidency to make connections, to deepen his pockets and the family’s coffers. What a disgrace to the country, his ineptitude, his lack of action has killed people... more than 300.000 as a matter of fact."
2020-12-23 12:32:13,It’s an appropriations bill not a relief bill . The Democrats added their pork to it!!!!

2020-12-23 11:48:08,He’s right it’s a disgrace.  Nancy Pelosi kept desperate Americans waiting for months to score a political win over Trump and that just blew up in her face.  Prognosis: grim.
2020-12-23 13:40:19,"For the First time I have to agree with Trump. After reading some of the things that are being funded, I ask why? What good does that do to help struggling Americans NOW. It doesn't. Another example of Congress being out of touch with what is happening and about to happen in America. $600.00 is nothing in this economy. People live in the today. They hope they can make it to the future."

Ossoff (D) and Warnock (D) are most definitely going to come out in favor of the $2,000.00 payment to Americans, as will President-elect Biden. We won't get $2,000.00, but Democrats may get the Senate.

Given the current surge of this deadly virus and the reality that the vaccination process has just started, Americans will need much more financial aid from the federal government. Democrats want to help needy Americans by giving them enough money to survive this pandemic and restore their financial stability. It was great to hear outgoing President Trump, a Republican, agree with Democrats that the $600 stimulus payment was insufficient to meet the needs of suffering Americans. But you are likely not going to get a sufficient amount of financial aid from the federal government next year if your Republican Senators, Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler, win the upcoming Senate runoff election because the same Republican Senate majority that happily supported the $600 second stimulus payment will remain in control of the Senate.

He also wants to give a more generous stimulus payment, which would be great, but he should have involved himself in the negotiations sooner in order to make this happen. 

 Should these have been two separate pieces of legislation? Of course. But Congress twiddled its collective thumbs for so long that it had to merge the two. Now, at the nth hour, Trump's belated objections threaten to tank the bill altogether. Messy, messy, messy!"

Sometimes regular old words just don't express my frustration. 
If Trump or any of the Senate members of the Republican Party had to live on the average Social Security check, say in NYC or San Francisco, they would vote to help the lower income folks out in greater ways.
But no way do I think Trump cares. If it meant that he has to pay more than $750 in taxes, and might lose those insanely large tax breaks, the only thing he would want America to invest in would be work houses.
As I write this I remember the courage of the Barack Obama administration who saw suffering and really did work to lessen it...think of the bailouts of the America car industry.
Lately I have listening to President Obama's book as I take my walks...I trust every note in his voice, I trust everything that he says.

2020-12-23 13:14:14,"Trump is right.

About six weeks ago, before the election, the GOP was talking about a stimulus of $1.8 trillion. The Dems were talking about $2.2 trill. Trump was pushing  about $2.3 trill. So what happened to reduce the current stimulus proposal to less than half of the lowest previously proposed amount? Election over? Wealthy politicians who vote themselves tons of benefits feel like they have license to do as they please? Elected officials feel more secure in their jobs so that can take advantage of the electorate and hold on to OUR money? 

Going forward, the key to getting some meaningful stimulus payments to people, businesses and local governments is the election in Georgia. Dems need to get their people elected there. 

On this issue Biden and Trump are essentially in agreement. Pass whatever bills we can get for now and then, when the money runs out, get back together and pass more aid as necessary. McConnell, the poster boy for why we should have term limits for legislators, can stew. 

It's unjust that people have been paying tax money to the Feds all their lives and when they need help, an essential service so to speak, the government that collects our money which we pay under penalty of law, gives us a hard time. All the while we spend tremendous sums on useless military hardware like F-35 aircraft, war ships and a needless war in Afghanistan, a war which was precipitated by W, our dumbest president ever, when he needed to blame someone, anyone, for 9/11."

McConnell is the most evil person alive that I can think of in his absolute obstruction for relief over the course of several months now. He is only playing ball because it may hurt the Senate races in Georgia if he persists in his sociopathic indifference.

I love that Pelosi always rises above it all to serve the people.  She is more than willing to agree with the predator in chief for the greater good.  While the Bill is veto-proof, it is not pro-Trump proof, so the Republicans continue to implode with their lack of values and corruption of power.

I take refuge in one small sign of poetic justice:  the current NYT on-line home page depicts Trump (left column) and Biden (right column) agreeing about the main thing:  more targeted, direct relief to households is urgently needed.

Are you soothed yet, Trump?
There's BILLIONS in the bill for you. Happy now?

There's even a provision to set up a commission to oversee horse racing in Kentucky, a prime concern of Mitch McConnell.
It's my understanding that the economy in Kentucky has crashed 20% and Kentuckians are in dire straits, but, oh yes, Mitch must have his racing commission set up before any of that money goes to setting up a food bank.

But New York is doing fine in the horse-racing department: Ten Million is going to the largest race-track operator, Boise Schiller Flexner, a high-priced law firm (no, I don't get it either, a law firm? 10 million? Oh, well, nothing new here. In the last bill Trump's ""personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz"" was handed a cool $10,000,000, too).

Well, nice to know what ""Republican Priorities"" are: race tracks and high-priced lawyers.

2020-12-23 13:48:57,"Well he certainly is well qualified to speak about disgraceful things. A rare moment I agree with him, yet he is willing to threaten a veto and slow it down. They all are a disgrace. Truly."
2020-12-23 12:20:38,"This is got to be the best most recent example of what our problem with government is about. Its why America people do not trust or have trust in government or with corpocracy of the government. This is the first time one agrees with Trump. He should send this bill back to the Four Corners with no signature, and have them rewrite it while giving the most need to where its most needed while they wait and before Jan 20th, with just a two day break for the holiday weekend. Back to work Monday! And you wanted a pay raise on top of it? 

Again the problem is the way we conduct the business of governing, and yes this relief bill is a Disgrace. 

Happy Holiday to those recipients who know it is a disgrace and still took the money and those who voted in favor of it. Their stockings must be over stuffed once again.

This bill and its passage is just unbelievable."
2020-12-23 12:43:16,"This is not about a $2000 payment. Trump couldn’t care less for the average American. If he did, he wouldn’t have let 300,000 Americans die by calling the pandemic a hoax. This is all about a narcissist and a sociopath wanting to stay in the news. As a GOP lawmaker said - Trump is acting like a petulant child who has been asked to sit down in a corner."
2020-12-23 13:54:50,"It is a disgrace. And really this is win-win for Democrats. Either we get more money to people or else Mitch and republicans will have to refuse Trump and the people, which Trump knows will be catastrophic for them."
2020-12-23 13:46:24,"Well, as a progressive, it pains me to say this but for the first time in his entire presidency, Trump is right. If he wasn't a total fraud and a pathological liar, he might have said things like this back in May and put pressure on his own party to pass the kind of bill the House signed. Trump's words are meaningless political positioning as he is being kicked out the door."
2020-12-23 11:27:37,"And with one attention grabbing rant, Trump reclaims the spotlight and upends Christmas for tens of millions of desperate Americans."
2020-12-23 12:05:55,"Trump called the Relief Bill a ""disgrace.""  If anyone knows a thing or two about being a disgrace, it's him.  Just more noise from the cheap seats in these remaining few, painful weeks of Trump playing president."
2020-12-23 12:04:39,"Trump is now lashing out at Republicans, let him. We'll take the 2000 happily any way it comes. 

The guy isn't gonna be able to fool us so might as well take advantage of this random act. Maybe he is finally trying..too late.. to atone for all his misdoings. We can take his money without giving him credit just like he's done to do many others"
2020-12-23 13:06:42,"No, 45 is the disgrace."
2020-12-23 13:48:18,"The whole government is a disgrace at this point, and Trump is the lead buffoon. Had he worked to reduce the crisis -- rather than actively perpetuate it -- we would not need nearly so much relief for people. 

I don't what the appropriate response from congress should be, but I do know that they are in an untenable position because of the corruption and cowardice of an inept president."
2020-12-23 14:06:26,"Nothing like claiming that the bill doesn't give the people enough, when in fact he wanted to be able to give them nothing.

Even when the next bill comes to him with the upgrades he will find another reason to veto it."
2020-12-23 13:57:49,Good for President Trump. McConnel and Pelosi share the trophy for Grinch 2020.
2020-12-23 13:58:24,Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Is he making this about him? Absolutely. Is the relief a disgrace? Yes sir it is.
2020-12-23 13:58:47,Trump self-inflicted extreme alteration of his own state of mind could result in Trump giving himself a heart attack or a stroke. His current mental situation is totally out of control (and most certainly merits the application of the 25th by-the-way).
2020-12-23 11:39:03,"You know what, as much as Trump has been an absolute disgrace to America himself, he is right on this one. The fact that the bill includes sections to strengthen online copyright laws, is a disgrace. The fact that regular people get $600 while billionaires get tax breaks is a disgrace. We need to look beyond party lines and corporate interests and do what is right."
2020-12-23 13:46:01,"Sorry, but help me out with the math. A $900B bill minus $600 for each of even 300 million Americans leaves $720B.  Which is going... where?  And why is this not the real story?"
2020-12-23 13:49:29,The wheel of Karma is turned by Trump to roll over McConnell and Republican legislators who were Trump's toadies for four years.
2020-12-23 11:48:55,Trump thinks he’s still running.   This is a revenge poke in the eye to McConnell for bowing down and recognizing Biden as the new heir to the throne.
2020-12-23 13:59:48,"Go to it Donald. $2,000 per person is what the country needs. Not $600-chunk change.  We know you are no Herbert Hoover Republican like McConnel and Thune."
2020-12-23 13:19:11,"Too much, too little ,too late !"
2020-12-23 13:28:45,Anyone who voted for Trump because they were afraid Biden would take the country into Socialism really needs to open their eyes.
2020-12-23 11:38:31,"It seems, if as the article says, it passed with veto-proof margins, the veto can be overridden (unless the GOP really has some jelly fish in their ranks). 

Mr. Trump has gone round the bend. The inconceivable (for him) and intolerable has happened to him. Most of us would simply say he lost (you win some; you lose some), but to him the loss means that he is ""a loser."" He is incapable of letting that thought in, so he is working more and more with the lunatic fringe as even the sycophants and toadies begin to recognize reality. It is scary what he might do when Congress affirms the Electoral College results on Jan 6 (even if it is a longer process this time)."
2020-12-23 12:04:10,"Anyone who believes that Trump wants bigger stimulus checks because he cares about the welfare of the American people, rest assured that Santa will be flying through the sky on his sleigh on Xmas eve with Rudolph leading the pack of reindeer."
2020-12-23 13:24:54,"So, after weeks of petulant wound-licking, filing of frivolous lawsuits and the typical abdication of responsibility that is the hallmark of the Trump presidency, Trump all of a sudden wants to get involved? Spare us.

Don't be fooled: The only reason Trump is pretending to even care about the relief bill at this point is that with the advent of Joseph Biden assuming office in January, nobody is paying attention to Trump any more. This is a stunt he is pulling in order to draw attention to himself, nothing more. I hope Congress can get past it, but given the last four years of total capitulation to Trump's willful mismanagement and idiocy by the GOP, I'm skeptical."
2020-12-23 13:11:39,"Reporting that Trump called something a “disgrace” is akin to announcing that the sun is in the sky at 10:00 AM. 

The man has a 15 word vocabulary. This happens to be one of them."
2020-12-23 12:33:33,The Veto threat over more Stimulus money is subterfuge this is an attempt to be a spoiler with no concern for the people it would help. A last hours display of power and avarice by a deranged egotist. When the time comes he should be denied a State Funeral as his comeuppance!
2020-12-23 13:56:05,"Good gawd! This guy has been MIA for these entire negotiations, spending his days whining and tweeting and pardoning his criminal co-conspirators. 

I'm not thrilled with this stimulus bill, but it's better than nothing, and it took 9 months of McConnell intransigence just to get this far. To jump in at the final moments threatening a veto is just 45's way of bringing the attention back to him. His neediness knows no bounds.

I agree, $2000 is better than $600. $2000 a month, 9 months ago, is what real Americans (the non 1%er's) have needed. Just like other civilized countries. But the R's couldn't be bothered to even consider the House's passed bills (since May!) until the final hour. And now their demigod wants to throw a wrench into the gears and halt everything -- potentially leading to a government shutdown.

Now address the 325,000 dead, 45. Ya, sure, when pigs fly."
2020-12-23 14:02:37,"Trump is the worst President in American history!

However even a broken clock is right twice a day.

The millions of people hit hardest by the pandemic need more than a paltry $600. These folks --many of them essential workers or those who have lost their jobs--  need money for food, rent. medicine, the absolute necessities of life. What can $600 do for the economically desperate?

Payments of $2.000 to $4.000 could make a huge difference in those people's immediate futures.

And they will circulate the money throughout the economy. It won't go to stocks and bonds or be  hidden away in some tax evasion shell corporation offshore.

Also, Trump is correct that the more than $100 billion slipped into the stimulus package in the form of tax cuts for the wealthy and industries like NASCAR,  liquor producers and other special interests should be cut in favor of grants to those like people in danger of death because they can't afford their medications or people who have to line up for miles to get enough food for their families.

Trump's demands are moral and the right thing, no matter how dirty his motives. It's the Democrat's dream bill. Let's support it. 

Trump will be gone in less than a month. 

The money in the bill he is proposing will help millions of women, children and men."
2020-12-23 13:38:04,"No mention of Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for it, either."
2020-12-23 13:19:48,"The Democrats have been pushing all along for higher Covid relief benefits. Now donald comes dancing in, trying to appear as our savior. So transparent. 

Less than a month left with President Narcissist."
2020-12-23 13:11:30,"This is simply a divisive political ploy. Trump would never have backed a $2000.00 check. However, pitting Republicans against Dems  so that failure can occur or that passing this""disgraceful"" bill over his veto, shows he is the People's Champion. He wins by achieving nothing. Now if he were to dive into the negotiations and take some responsibility , I'd change my opinion, but he's a reality coward, and won't act."
2020-12-23 12:07:43,"Maybe Trump, stealing a play from McConnell,  is playing to Georgia voters?   Whatever.  Dems should maximize the messaging possibilities of this situation in Georgia ads - along the lines of Trump agrees with us that the Republican Senators Perdue and Loeffler care nothing about the troubles or concerns of the people of Georgia - A Vote for Warner and Ossoff is a Vote for you and your family"
2020-12-23 12:19:17,"So Trump is now trying to play President after spending the last several weeks meeting with nut job 'lawyers' over a 'rigged ' election, and granting pardons to crooks?  If he was in any way focused on his job, he would have known about the $600 payment before yesterday,  His own Treasury secretary crafted this relief package, so the fact that he said nothing until yesterday is the true 'disgrace'."
2020-12-23 12:08:38,"As much as it makes sense to increase the direct payments, it feels like more Trump grandstanding. Dems are all over it and Reps are grumbling. I'm not holding my breath for anything helpful from the crowd of losers, con men and cheats that inhabit all those marble hallways."
2020-12-23 12:27:39,"He had 9 MONTHS to send us checks.

The correct time to pretend you care would have been BEFORE the election, Mr. President."
2020-12-23 11:39:17,"Trump is trying to re-insert himself into the news; in fact he cares not at all about increasing payments to poor and middle class Americans. However,without coverage from the press, he loses his ability to raise money and maintain national relevance. We should all ignore him; thus I feel like a hypocrite even making this comment."
2020-12-23 13:36:34,"It’s all braggadocio, and he wants his name on all the checks.

Republican members of Congress: Is it finally time to denounce Trump?—Oh wait, there’s that runoff in Georgia."
2020-12-23 14:10:28,"Honestly Trump is right. $600 is a joke. Probably wont cover the bill for getting the COVID vaccine for most Americans.  $2000 is a rent or mortgage payment. $2000 is a laptop or a professional course to expand skills. Its payment for some childcare so a parent can catch up at work. 
And at this point, foreign aid should be off the table until our food banks no longer have lines of working poor.  
I'm glad he stood up, whatever his motivation was."
2020-12-23 12:17:05,"After losing his fight (can't even call it a fight, really -- he wasn't, as ever, really interested in what he needed to do), so, after losing the election, a lame duck, he wants to purchase the love (since he can't get the respect) of the American People. So he won't be remembered as a Loser (the worst in his accordion folder of meannesses). Reminds me of an old saying, ""If he had a brain, he'd be dangerous."" He's done a lot of damage, but he's out. I look forward to film of him being carried out by his elbows by a strong young U.S. Marshal."
2020-12-23 14:05:42,Maybe he's looking for an excuse to sabotage the bill and Biden. A pocket veto?
2020-12-23 13:05:53,"Not to be excessively negative during the holiday season, but...disingenuous, self-serving hypocritical liar is all I'm coming up with. How anyone -and there are millions of 'em- could possibly believe anything this character says, or trust any of his motives at this point, is amazing, perplexing, discouraging. 
Where we're at with a few weeks remaining, and the end can't come soon enough."
2020-12-23 13:24:40,"The Relief Bill Demands Changes to the Presidency, Calling it a ""Disgrace"""
2020-12-23 13:33:30,"You write ""The Bill passed with an overwhelming, veto-proof margin.""  Then end the article with a quote from Mr. Raskin contemplating a Presidential veto.  Some clarification is in order."
2020-12-23 12:04:49,The last 4 years have been a disgrace.
2020-12-23 13:35:38,"Even if the House/Senate passed a revised bill with a $2,000 stimulus check (and Trump knows the Senate won't), Trump wouldn't sign it. This is all a game to him and his way of getting back at the American people for voting him out of office. Never underestimate the mind of a true sociopath!"
2020-12-23 11:40:01,Or is this an attempted coup.  He has already replaced Pentagon leadership with cronies.  And shutting down a pesky government could be a direct corollary.  Hold on to your hats!
2020-12-23 12:17:51,It's obvious that Trump is reaping revenge on McConnell for not supporting his inept coup attempt. Dems should take advantage & get the people $2000. Any port in a storm.
2020-12-23 12:41:41,"The whole thing is absurd. One size fits all relief is ridiculous. Millions of Americans are doing fine. $600 will do very little for those in desperate straits. Those of us who don’t need the money then try to share it with someone who is desperate, but the process isn’t equitable. 
Four years of Trump and 10 years of Republican-dominated legislature and this government is crippled in the worst crisis we’ve faced in 100 years."
2020-12-23 11:19:28,"Does anyone watch soap operas anymore?  If so, why, when Donald Trump is providing a living one every day, but one with real blood and tears."
2020-12-23 13:26:47,"Trump is having fun stirring the pot while he can for his Grand Old Reality Show. So, GOP, having fun with the frankenstein you've created, supported, defended, justified??  HA! Now Trump is fully exposed, as are his enablers and his supporters. OK, so now keep Congress in session long enough to override Trump's veto--but wait! Trump won't veto the bill. He will ""pocket"" the bill, forcing Americans to do without even insufficient relief. Then, under Biden, Trumpers will refuse to cooperate with a needed, larger relief bill. So then, Nov 2022; House and Senate becomes majority Democratic Party by a large margin. So, Trump supporters, ""Tired of winning"" yet?"
2020-12-23 11:53:07,"Perhaps Mr. Trump is merely butting in to end Mnuchin's career, as he has with Barr's and so many in his gang of the unforgivable and the deplorable.  Or maybe he thinks he can buy the next presidential election by stealing taxpayer's money and bribing them with their own money?  Or maybe he thinks he owes it to the construction workers he stiffed in Atlantic City or the tenants he robbed by using a fake company to over charge for maintenance?  Or maybe he thinks the American voter is really as shallow as to fall for this?  And maybe he's right.  Let the Democrats and the Republicans work it out.  Trump's as irrelevant to the game as the replay of a video tape at the Super Bowl.  Move on."
2020-12-23 12:59:54,"Did not participate in any aspect of what went into crafting this legislation, yet found his lazy way to getting back into headlines. He knows what he's good at."
2020-12-23 11:26:42,"$600 to the American people after months of unemployment and serious health inflictions?  Yes, that is a disgrace.  It’s a slap in the face, actually.  

Not ever agreeing with Donald Trump, and not understanding his reasoning here - $600 is nothing.  This time he is right.  

Congress, pass that amendment to give the American people more.  $600 is not enough.  The American people have suffered.  They need help.  They need it now.  

Republicans, step to the plate. The Democrats are waiting!  The American people are waiting!"
2020-12-23 12:56:43,"I am holding my breath for the day that the name of the President and ""tirade"" will not appear in the same sentence."
2020-12-23 13:27:36,"He's getting that ""I've been in office long enough"" look."
2020-12-23 12:12:40,"Talk about leading a nation as if you're producing a Reality TV show...

An unstable, lame duck President who won't pay his own taxes finally engages in his role at 11:59 on a matter of spending tax revenue. The spending program is so critical because the leader failed to respond to a pandemic and irresponsibly chose to downplay reality."
2020-12-23 12:25:26,The president wants to be the hero and for people to receive another check with his signature. Reminds me of the bosses in mining towns who would exploit the people all year but would distribute baskets of Xmas dinners.
2020-12-23 13:08:50,"I don't care what Pres. Trump's motivations are.  He is completely correct in his summary of this bill.  Veto it, send it back, and then make it simple. Corona virus relief only!  Focus people!!"
2020-12-23 13:45:49,"Legacy, that’s all he’s concerned about, you can blame Republicans or Democrats,who’s kidding who if he’d won the election 
we would be singing a different tune.It about Americans needing help ,pay now or pay later when we will ever learn."
2020-12-23 11:29:06,"Trump calls the Relief Bill a ""disgrace"".

This coming from a guy who epitomizes the word.

He is probably miffed because his signature will NOT be on this round of relief checks to millions of Americans."
2020-12-23 13:18:06,"Can we get the $2000 checks and ditch the provisions for women's and Latino heritage museums in DC? The former actually is beneficial to society, the latter... well, the money has to come from somewhere, and don't even get me started on my thoughts on dedicating museums to specific identity groups"
2020-12-23 13:03:58,"Trump’s entire business career is replete with similar behavior. Waiting until there is an “agreement” and then pound the table and leave the room. Indeed, his entire “deal making” game is to bully and threaten the other side and to be internationally in predictable merely to convince himself and his audience that he got the better of the other side.This is self-aggrandizing theatre from a weak, incompetent man. He has zero interest in the legislation and less understanding of it. Zero. That he has scuppered Mitch’s deal makes it at least entertaining, though."
2020-12-23 13:26:18,"Trump’s latest surprise action against the COVID relief bill is simply a distraction from what would otherwise be the top headline:
“Trump Pardons War Criminals, Political Hacks, and Corrupt Businessmen”

I expect that Trump will not veto the relief bill, but it will automatically pass without his signature in 10 days.
In the next few weeks, we should expect more Trump pardons, and more disruptive surprises intended to distract from them.

I expect that Trump will resign the Presidency on Jan. 19th and announce a “Trump 2024” kickoff campaign event to compete directly with Biden’s inauguration.  

Pence will be inaugurated on Jan. 19th, and immediately announce a “full, free, and absolute pardon” of Trump for anything he might have done in his entire life prior to Jan. 19th.

After he leaves the White House next month, Trump will retain control over the GOP, and he will issue incendiary tweets on a daily basis to disrupt President Biden.  And no one in the GOP will stand up to Trump."
2020-12-23 11:25:18,"One of the few times in the last four years that anything Donald Trump has done has elicited a smile and a chuckle from me. Being unprincipled, he can stumble on the right thing; and being unprincipled, his congressional enablers in the Republican Party can be hoisted with their own petard.  This is the Party without a platform, only what he President seeks."
2020-12-23 12:39:38,"Trump does nothing about COVID relief since May. Since November 3, all he does is focus on stealing the election he lost to Biden. Now, in an effort to humiliate McConnell and his Senate lackeys, Trump wants to blow up the bill that passed Congress by siding with Democrats on COVID relief. 

While increasing COVID relief is laudable, it’s pretty clear Trump has completely gone off the deep end. 

Will McConnell wake up and support impeachment and removal? (Pro tip: no)."
2020-12-23 13:24:59,"So now The Donald wants to throw a wrench into the process and give the Democrats what they wanted and what the people needed all along, and is Twitter blasting his own party lackeys? I’d say he’d found a smidgen of heart normally, but somehow I know better."
2020-12-23 13:25:44,"Suddenly, Trump is advocating for the little guy, after doing little more than lining his pockets with campaign donations from those he told the virus was a hoax.

If there is a disgrace, it's Trump who told people the virus will just go away, to use Clorox, and advocated Hydroxychloroquine. What was disgraceful was pitting Blue States against Red States for inadequate supplies. Disgrace was Trump's monumental failure to establish nationwide standards and advocate mask wearing.

But my disgust boils over for the republican senate, lead by McConnell, that failed to impeach Trump, that failed to propose veto proof legislation to help Americans in their time of greatest need. My anger will only be extinguished when every Trump enabler faces prosecution and the guilty go to jail. And when their jail terms end, I hope the courts order community service in Atlanta so parole officers like me can help these felons see the damage they caused and mend their ways."
2020-12-23 12:48:03,Trump gets to pretend he wants more money for people and effectively kill giving them anything simultaneously. Maybe that was the republican strategy all along.
2020-12-23 12:24:12,“We are fully committed to ensuring that hardworking Americans get this vital support as quickly as possible and to further strengthening our economic recovery...” - Secretary Mnuchin. Some people may say that some of the hardest working Americans are those who wrote the provisions that fattened the calf for those who need the support the least.
2020-12-23 12:57:35,Trump is trashing McConnell because McConnell accepted the electoral vote decision.  That's what this move is about.
2020-12-23 11:15:13,The president isn't interested in Covid relief for Americans at all. It's just one more headline-grabbing stunt as the clock runs out on his mal-administration. All he wants to do is stick it to Senator McConnell for his lack of loyalty and perhaps shut down the government at Christmas to spite Capitol Hill and the American people. Scrooge can't leave Washington fast enough for most Americans.
2020-12-23 13:47:55,Trump - A president who has repeatedly shown that he lacks empathy - couldn't care less about the suffering of so many of his fellow Americans during this horrible pandemic. A much better economic package could have been passed months ago if he had shown any interest in getting involved then. Lying about losing the election and busy playing golf was much more important. And this sudden concern is all about his running for president again in four years.
2020-12-23 11:40:10,"This is the kind of behavior we have come to expect from someone who cannot tolerate failure, and doesn't understand the meaning of the word compromise, which in his mind is for losers.  Rather than providing leadership to craft this bill he is snipping from the side lines, knowing that a veto will be overridden. 

Worse than that, this is a return to the phony populism, he abandoned the day he took office. I hope he does not believe that going out this way will create the appearance of a legacy he would like to claim, but is in fact completely insubstantial.  I would be happy to be proven wrong, if he can get more money for people who are in desperate need of it, he will have finally, at the last minute, done something for all Americans.  

Shame on me, I'm glad nobody told him that this kind of behavior could have gotten him re elected."
2020-12-23 13:07:28,"He's actually right. And I'm as blue as they come. This ""bill"" is literally stuffed with utterly ridiculous pet projects of legislators that have nothing to do with the pandemic."
2020-12-23 13:53:44,"Instead of being part of the negotiating process, he’s sulked and pouted like a spoiled child for the last several weeks. He’s tweeted and nurtured conspiracy theories instead of using his limited time left to save American lives. He could be touring hospitals around the country, wearing a mask and asking others to do so as well. Instead, he’s hunkered down in the White House and watched television all day. Truly embarrassing. An awful human being."
2020-12-23 11:25:50,"If Trump hadn't bankrupted the country by cutting taxes for himself and the other wealthy, we might have more to give back to Americans."
2020-12-23 12:45:53,Why didn't Trump speak out about its being a disgrace before now?  They've been working on it for months.
2020-12-23 11:38:26,Where was he during the drafting and negotiation of this bill?
2020-12-23 12:34:28,"This is all craziness. If you maintained your income over the past year, and this includes me, why are you getting a check. I will donate whatever I get to our local food bank but that begs the point. The government is insane, especially given the current hard times and the poverty in America, so give money to people who don’t need it when so many actually do."
2020-12-23 13:17:28,"I seem to recall the Democrats originally proposing a relief package of more than $2 trillion. It's the Republicans (as usual) who don't want to spend money to help the American people in an emergency. It's nice that Trump wants to spend more, but where was his sense of outrage back when this sausage was getting made? Oh, I know: he didn't actually care then, and he only cares now because he thinks it might spur people to petition the Supreme Court or something about letting him keep the job he lost."
2020-12-23 13:12:05,I'm afraid his plan is actually to run up a ton of debt that will be a problem for the next administration.
2020-12-23 13:04:13,He may be right. He also played no role in negotiations and this is an 11th hour act of subterfuge.

2020-12-23 14:22:55,"I understand the concept of an economic stimulus, but do why relief checks need to go out to those whose income has been unaffected?

2020-12-23 13:23:03,"So at the very end of his Presidency, to which he was elected as the Republican candidate, Trump proves once and for all that he is neither a Democrat nor a Republican - he is a Trumpicrat or a Trumpican, take your pick.  This time, Americans who are suffering may benefit from Trump's self-absorption and compulsion to strike back at those who dared cross him by rejecting his election fraud fantasy  - i.e. Mitch McConnell et al.  But thank God, the chaos in the White House is just about over."
2020-12-23 13:29:46,"Two thousand or more, but not for incomes above $75.000.  The vast majority of Americans in need do not have incomes of $100,000, let alone $150,000.  And there are other parts of this bill that sociopathic Republicans imposed on America without regard for the dire straits of so many millions of Americans who are victims of how Trump et al  did nothing to control the spread of Covid-19 - so now with about 4% of the globe's population the USA has about 20% of the fatalities.

The tragedy of financial displacement, despair and the disproportionate number of deaths in America is directly attributed to Putin's Puppet and his GOP Congressional Cabal that obstructed efforts to control the Pandemic, and downplay the fact this was and is a Pandemic.

The GOP is responsible for in not  making certain the trillions in first Covid relief bill went to the right places, and now has persisted in not working with Democrats in the best interests of the public good, but as negotiators against the public good.  So what does bi-partisan mean?"
2020-12-23 13:37:45,Why doesn't every bill always reveal which Congressman/woman or which Senator added each item. Would immediately reduce all the pork spending.
2020-12-23 13:42:57,"Trump and McConnell are working together to stop any help for American families, because it cuts into the profits of their donors.

2020-12-23 13:37:30,"I do enjoy seeing the conflation of the departmental appropriations (e.g. foreign aid) with the covid relief legislation which is an add on. The false meme about foreign aid is making endless rounds of conservative media. Granted it is one big bill but the appropriations (and any pork) is a separate issue (even Trump gets it wrong). <a href=""https://crsreports.congress.gov/AppropriationsStatusTable"" target=""_blank"">https://crsreports.congress.gov/AppropriationsStatusTable</a>.  As one can see from the table and the notes, the senate didn't even get any appropriations out of committee and it took them until November 10 to do anything. From my viewpoint, it was McConnell and the senate that dropped the ball on appropriations. As to Trump demanding 2k checks, Pelosi will introduce an amendment today. What McConnell does is anybodies guess."
2020-12-23 13:55:01,"I agree with the $2,000 direct payments to Americans!  $600 is way too low and embarrassing.  Congress could increase that amount even more if they choose to do so."
2020-12-23 14:01:35,Trump could have been part of the solution before Congress passed the bill. Good grief.
2020-12-23 14:16:02,"My guess is that Trump certainly did not read the entire 5,593 pages of this relief bill.  Did somebody summarize all the points that would make him mad with a big sharpie pen?  I’m guessing that, due to his past political affiliations, Trump is done with the republicans and is going to run again in four years -- as a democrat!  Lord help us all."
2020-12-23 13:23:44,"This includes billions in foreign aid to countries like Egypt, Burma, Pakistan, etc. - to me, it seems disingenuous to market it as a coronavirus relief bill.  $600 seems like so little when you think about how much of the dollars are going out of the country via foreign aid.  They're kicking the can down the road - we have much larger problems to address, like what eventually happens when the moratorium on evictions isn't extended."
2020-12-23 13:24:23,"There are many items in this bill , extension of tax breaks for a few that have no place in this bill or in any Bill.

The fact that many Americans need help particularly the unemployed but I have difficulty in wrapping my head around the fact a married couple earning $150000 should get $4000.

The original purpose of this act was to help the desperate, people in interminable food lines, facing eviction , closing down their life time work. 

Thanks to politics a lot of pork was added and Trumps Administration was totally involved in the form of Mnuchin .

Now just two days before Christmas , Trump deprives the desperate of any help. He didn’t do it to help but to hinder in his normal vindictive way this time aimed at the Republicans who have scorned him.

How those Republicans must mow wish they had voted him out of office when they had the opportunity"
2020-12-23 13:56:41,"Trump would have found something to dislike in the bill regardless of the size of payments, recipients of the payments, font that the bill was written in, etc.

He’s complaining about the bill because he lost the election and is bitter about it. If he can’t be President, then everyone should suffer.

It’s that simple folks."
2020-12-23 13:28:58,"The headline to this article should make it clear that Trump thinks $600 is not enough. There are surely some Republicans who think it is too much, and somebody who only glances at the headline could reasonably assume that to be the president's position as well."
2020-12-23 13:53:19,"Sure, $2000 is better than 600, but this isn't about money. Add this to the list of traumas Americans have experienced these last four years at the hands of trump. 

He's been barreling in at the last minute to knock things off the rails since the beginning of this nightmare. Back and forth on everything. Covid, for example, is a hoax, until he wants to take credit for the vaccine. 

Yes, Republicans have aided and abetted him from the beginning, and I suppose most of the blame actually lies with them, but trump is the figurehead, as the Executive branch is designed. I am tired of trump. I am tired of the chaos. I am tired of the uncertainty. I am tired. 

28 days until inauguration. I suspect this last month will be more horrifying than the last four years. At least they passed a relief bill, I told myself, even if it is woefully inadequate. At least I won't lose my unemployment this Saturday, I told myself. At least for up to 11 weeks I'll be able to pay rent and feed myself, I told myself. 

In bursts trump."
2020-12-23 13:51:29,This should be relief.  Stimulus is poorly directed we saw this with industries that didn't need money getting payroll loans. There should be a better way to get relief to the people that need it. However I see Mercedes in food lines and people who are behind on $1800+ month payments.  Entry level house prices are selling at all time highs.  Spoiler alert the new administration is about to tell us the Deficit and Debt is way worse than previously thought! The man behind the curtain is not the Great OZ and made this worse than it needed to be!
2020-12-23 13:47:42,"When someone shows you who they are, believe them.

In this case, we have a 74-year-old who, despite his power, riches, and fame, still relies on temper tantrums and pouting when he doesn’t get his way. 

In other words, Trump is still in the toddler phase of mental development. 

January 20th can’t come soon enough."
2020-12-23 14:09:41,I can feel it coming. Trump threatens a veto unless the congress overturns the results of the election and gives him permission to declare himself president for life and pass it on to his heirs in perpetuity.
2020-12-23 14:14:29,Trump is like the relative who offers no help whatsoever preparing a complex Thanksgiving dinner.  Then spends the entire meal criticizing and complaining about the dishes.
2020-12-23 14:15:28,"Its a little late for the President to show his concern for the struggling, working/non working class. There are billions in the bill for his wealthy friends, and depending on their level of wealth, there are always dreams of a heated swimming pool, larger yacht, private island, or tickets to outer space."
2020-12-23 13:45:00,Trump has some sort of insatiable need for attention. He kept quiet while Congress was working out the details of the relief package and now all of a sudden he could have done a much better job of it. Where was he when it mattered?
2020-12-23 14:14:43,"Why couldn't Democrats push loudly and clearly for $2000+ all along?  From the outside, without paying a lot of attention, it's hard to follow what both sides want.  It doesn't have to be that way.  The Democrats should put together a three-bullet-point proposal and put it everywhere.  Force the Republicans to argue point by point against things like ""$2000 for each American""."
2020-12-23 13:11:57,"I think this article should make it clearer that Trump has the ability to veto the bill.  The House and Senate would then have to vote by two-thirds majorities to override his veto.

The bill passed by majorities larger than two-thirds, but that does not necessarily mean an override vote would pass - especially with Trump's stated rationale, which will put enormous pressure on Democrats in particular to not override and demand the larger check.

As awful, dishonest and self-interested as Trump is, we have to be clear and fair about the facts and the record and not reflexively reject or assume to be bad or false anything based solely on it coming from him.  In this case, all indications are that - to the extent he was involved at all in these negotiations - he was pushing early for larger direct stimulus checks.  This is probably so he could have his name (again) on larger checks, but the fact remains.  

The economy is in terrible shape and the damage is concentrated in lower-income populations.  This stimulus change will be a temporary but very welcome salve for many.  I suggest we all support it."
2020-12-23 13:45:27,"I am not a Trump supporter...at all. But I agree with a certain portion of his displeasure of this relief bill.   The first relief bill showed us what worked for relief to help people through the pandemic. Direct payments to individuals and small business subsidies for payroll were key to helping us get through the first half of the pandemic. With all the  uncertainty in the Senate and the transition of Administrations, congress should narrow the focus on this bill and address the real near-term issue (i.e. the pandemic). Instead, they loaded up on unnecessary spend to buy votes.  This is why the American people lose trust in Congress. This is why you have 74M + following a dictator. Why is it so hard for Congress to do the right thing?"
2020-12-23 13:35:00,"If Democrats worried about a successful Trump coup attempt, they would not agree to any spending bill that funded the military or the rest of the government after January 20."
2020-12-23 14:02:38,"I would be interested in exactly what his proposal is, because I saw last night a $2000 per household limit. It doesn’t take much, if you do the math, to see that this would benefit couples but hurt families with multiple children. The news is not making this distinction clear. Does anyone know the answer?"
2020-12-23 13:15:25,It is puzzling that after accepting a package well below the target that the Democrats (who really believes this is a stimulus bill or a real relief package) would allow it to be lumped together with the government spending resolution. How can Speaker Pelosi allow Republicans not to go on the record to vote on the “relief “ package as a separate bill?
2020-12-23 13:34:34,"Perhaps Trump should have done some actual work over the past month or so and helped his colleagues? 

I’ve never seen someone work so hard to get a job that he clearly doesn’t want to do. A job he failed to secure and given to someone else.

He should resign. I dunno what Pence could do to help over the next month-but given Trump is either shirking the responsibilities of his office or actively working to make things worse for the country and Biden: Pence at least wouldn’t be making things worse. Or at least not purposely"
2020-12-23 13:20:39,"So much for the fiction that Trump is a conservative.  Now he has aligned himself with Nancy Pelosi in an attempt to get support by giving away money.  That is a legal way to buy votes and, best of all, it is done with other people's money."
2020-12-23 13:15:43,"Those in Congress who want to throw bread crumbs at the starving populus with the cheerful and comforting sentiment of a ""Let them eat cake"" Hallmark card holiday greeting should take pause at the president's official response to their latest legislation.  The people are suffering; corporate interests can be paused.  God bless America and good will to all everywhere."
2020-12-23 13:49:47,"So let me get this straight. The American people desperately need relief, but the President wants Congress to start all over because just now, JUST NOW he decides to tell congress what he wants. And he thinks it's implausible that the American would reject the way he runs the country."
2020-12-23 13:41:22,One serious problem with the checks sent out scattershot to the country: many of them do not go to those actually financially impacted by the pandemic. Just because your filed income tax isn’t over the cutoff amount does not mean you don’t have plenty of money sitting in your bank account! Many retired citizens are in this category. I support enhanced unemployment benefits and help to small businesses but not these checks. We are going to pay for this waste in the future.
2020-12-23 14:13:44,"“It’s called the Covid relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,” Mr. Trump said in a video posted online. “Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests while sending the bare minimum to the American people. I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000.""

As the adage goes, even a broken clock is right twice a day.

I cannot believe what I am reading, that Trump is criticizing Republicans and asking that amount to each American be raised to $2,000.

While I am relieved that such a change of attitude has occurred, I cannot help but think what the real hidden agenda is behind Trump's trumping such care, concern and compassion for fellow Amercians.

Something tells me that he is doing some payback to his good buddy Mitch and other Republicans for finally endorsing and recognizing Biden as the new President-elect.

Whatever Trump's motives are, on the surface, they are to help Americans (thank you finally) but deep down and hidden, I cannot help but feel there will be another shoe to drop down the road.  Trump never does anything that does not benefit himself."
2020-12-23 13:44:43,"""Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, enlisted the president in the Democrats’ push to get larger coronavirus relief checks to Americans next year.""

Does anyone else wonder what Senator Schumer thought he was doing, bringing Donald Trump back into a legislative process which had actually produced a bipartisan result?

The Senator has made the President relevant again and given him another appeal to his base. He also short-circuited a process that worked, albeit not well, disrespecting and throwing away the excellent efforts of a centrist coalition.

There may be a deeper story here, one that I do not understand, but I think Senator Schumer messed up big-time."
2020-12-23 13:18:59,"In Trump's warped mind, he thinks he can ""buy"" a second term with $2000 checks.  The funds are needed for relief and Speaker Pelosi is correct to back it, but it won't get even close to a vote in the Senate."
2020-12-23 13:40:00,"This would be the best way for Trump to leave office. If it gets done I will remember him in a much fonder light. I also commend him for bucking Republican orthodoxy on the bloated military budget. These are the kinds of populist policies many people wanted him to pursue for four years that he largely abandoned once he entered office.

But this begs the question: Why didn’t the president make this demand sooner, when he had more political leverage? A little late, don’t you think, Mr. President?"
2020-12-23 13:12:56,The difference for my wife and myself between $1200 and $4000 is the difference between being able to buy a car or not. Our junkers are both over twenty years old. This is the difference between being able to get to work or not. The rest of the bill means nothing to me and I’m definitely willing to risk the $600 on a gamble that Trump can make this happen.
2020-12-23 13:42:25,"First of all, the only reason McConnell agreed to a stimulus bill is to help the Georgia election. With Trump's now wanting more money for Americans Trump seems to be wanting to saddle the country with a higher National Debt for Biden to dig the country out of another financial situation. I trust nothing that comes from the soon to be Ex-president. I'd rather pass this stimulus bill and then let Biden take over after the new year."
2020-12-23 13:18:41,"Trump does not care about the consequences of his actions or how effective this bill might or might not be. He's only interested in exerting presidential power as his time to do so is almost over.

How many days until January 20?"
2020-12-23 13:58:10,"Trump is doing this to stick it to McConnell for his statement last week in my opinion. I live on a very small retirement and could use the money. However,I still don’t like Trump and won’t be buying a red hat with the extra money."
2020-12-23 14:08:54,"If Donald Trump were any more transparent he would be a ghost.  There is nothing this man does that does not have some political benefit directly for himself.

He likes to use the word ""disgrace"" a lot.  His limited vocabulary is evident every time he Tweets or speaks off of his teleprompter.

So now he is painting himself as the champion of the American people by refusing to sign this bipartisan COVID bill.  What a leader!  More chaos.  More disruption to people's lives.  

His presidency has been a disgrace."
2020-12-23 14:15:42,"trump threw his Republican enablers under the bus. Anyone surprised?  This was what Mc Connell enabled and then Mc Connell was betrayed by the guy he protected at every turn.  trump has made Mc Connell look like the fool he is. The Democrats wanted $2000 relief, then $1200 relief, settled on $600 as that was all they could get and get it done before the holiday break. And now trump is stabbing those in the back who were most loyal to him.
There is no loyalty among crass loutish thieves. Bullies are going to do what they do. Be big bullies."
2020-12-23 13:58:16,"Isn't this just perfect symmetry? 

A president who is a living, walking, hate-spewing disgrace calls a relief bill which he never supported before the election a disgrace. You can't make that stuff up, as they say.

2020-12-23 13:49:59,The mad king has awoken from his delirium... But he's actually right. Probably for all the wrong reasons. $600 for struggling Americans is a disgrace. Realistically there won't be another stimulus before March. That's less than $200 per month to make it through the winter...
2020-12-23 14:14:59,"Every headline again about Trump. He’s happy now, or as happy as a malignant narcissist gets. Revenge is his favorite activity, satisfying his sadism and sense of power as it does. This is what evil looks like, friends."

2020-12-23 14:11:00,"This is a poison pill and I hope democrats don't buy into it. Trump's threat to veto the relief bill is not based on altruism. He is simply exacting a price from the republicans such as McConnell who jumped ship just before Trump was about to deliver a death blow to American democracy. This is not about compassion for the poor or for those ravaged by covid. It's about Trump letting the republicans know that if they thwart him, he will try to destroy them. RINO's - republicans in name only- simply means any one who doesn't do his bidding. He is definitely not an ally of the democrats and at this moment, Congressional unity in the face of Trump's attempt at sabotage should be a first priority."
2020-12-23 14:09:49,"The idea of sending everyone either $600 or $2,000 below a certain income threshold is absurd. That is not targeted relief, that is stimulus and right now, stimulus is not what is needed (and would be wasted), targeted relief, a lifeline, to those whose income has been either greatly reduced or taken away by this virus. We will qualify, but we are not any worse off than we were in 2019, that is stupid. The problem with stimulus right now is that we can't go out and spend it on restaurants and travel, two areas that need to get back to normal. Rather, it will be spent online with organizations like Amazon. I don't think Jeff Bezo's needs the money right now. In fact, he could probably give everyone who qualifies the $2,000 out of how much his net worth has gone up since March of this year. Speaking of which, were are the additional taxes on those that have profited massively from this pandemic? Last thing, on waste, Trump is right, there is a lot of pork here that is being hidden behind ""covid relief"". Of course, he is really only crowing about it so that he can see his name in the news and publicly lash out about how ""unfair"" life has been towards him. We, most likely, will need another rescue bill to keep people afloat until the vaccines start curbing this thing and maybe a real stimulus bill once things are getting back to normal and I hope they are far more targeted, but somehow I don't think they will be. Both sides are addicted to spending."

This is too little too late, and most likely he'll have changed his mind by this evening anyway."

2020-12-23 11:53:23,"Something is seriously wrong with American journalism.

I read about the pork in this relief bill on right wing blogs.  I assumed it was misinformation because the media didn't report it. I didn't believe our representatives championed giving money to Pakistan for ""gender studies""?  How is it possible people angry about the murder of a black man in Minneapolis would give millions to the Egyptian military which slaughtered thousands of people in cold blood during the Arab Spring?  I figured it was misinformation.

But, apparently it was true. President Trump confirmed it.

All bills contain some pork, but we are in such massive debt due to this pandemic that this is different. Our debt to GDP ratio exceeds WWII.  And is it the Democrats that want to give money to Myanmar? The media didn't cover it.

In today's Washington Times, Newt Gingrich wrote he refuses to accept Biden as president because the media refuses to cover irregularities concerning the 2020 election. I had assumed, as I was told, that these irregularities were either non-existent or irrelevant.  I felt the election detractors had had 6 weeks to prove their case and had failed. I understood that any investigation was a waste of money because it wouldn't convince Trump's supporters of anything, and maybe that's all still true.

But now I wonder. How is it possible this massive pork was hidden by everyone except right-wing media and Trump?  Why was it not reported? Is it accurate?

If so, what else isn't reported?"

The contemptible meanness to suffering Americans, in the relief bill sent by Congress for his signature, is beyond the pale, especially when one discovers that billions of dollars are to be given to foreign governments.

Congress has shown itself to be nothing more than a collection of elites, wealthy elites, both Republicans and Democrats, most of whom regard the poor and middle-class with disdain, forgetting that they still can be given the boot, by we the people, in 2022 and 2024.

McConnell sat on Covid relief for months as desperate Americans faced the end of unemployment checks and mass evictions.  Then, when he saw a benefit for the only thing that matters to him--the Senate runoff elections--he picked up that bill and linked it to the government appropriations bill.

Sure everybody piled on and added their special interest grabs.  If McConnell had just passed Covid relief in October, there would have been, and should have been two separate pieces of legislation.

Trump has contributed nothing to Covid relief, obssessed as he is with forcing an end to our democracy.  And now he rails to make a political point, and force his signature on benefit checks.

2020-12-23 13:10:50,"A broken clock is right twice a day,

Trump, in my opinion, is right on this one though, to be honest, I preferred this opinion when it was coming out of Bernie Sanders' mouth.  The relief bill is way too small.  It will do little to  help people who are out of work or whose businesses are in danger of going under.

He's also right about the ""extras"".  Let's face it, everyone hates these gigantic bills with everything but the kitchen sink rolled into it.  Everyone except for members of Congress who use them to hide little sweeteners for reluctant members and of course hidden goodies for donors of both parties.

My cynical assumption is that Trump is way more motivated by the idea of all of these checks coming out with his name on them (he will insist on that) than by any good it might bring to struggling American citizens.  Then of course there's the runoff election in Georgia where a nice big check in voters' Christmas stockings could swing votes to the GOP.

Nonetheless, in the real world real Americans are suffering.  This is more important than partisan warfare.   I applaud Nancy Pelosi jumping in quickly to push for the bigger checks.  Sure, she has her own cynical motives but maybe, just maybe, something good might come out of it."

He took no part in the crafting of the bill, and now he makes a grandstand play for a larger payment? This will delay things even more, and those suffering won’t see any help on the horizon. This will not alter the election results and will not undo the damage that Trump has wreaked upon our nation during his tenure in DC, but he’s trying to look like the concerned president that he isn’t. This is just another of his ploys to create a facade of interest while he ponders declaring martial law or creates chaos over our constitutional electoral process. He is bad to the bone and evil to the end."

So why does Congress want to send money to foreign countries?  What does any of the groups listed above have to do directly with Covid relief?

In the end, it seems that not a single package or bill can ever be passed without other totally unrelated elements included in the fine print or thrown in the middle, hoping people will miss it.

Congress just doesn't need him to turn this bill into a law. 

That being said, with the Dems wanting a higher stimulus check amount, and so many Republicans so anxious to stay on Trump's good side that the majority of them won't even actually acknowledge that Biden won the election, I think we're definitely in ""anything can happen"" territory. Again."

Now what? Democrats are happy of course for the people in need out there, if congress does the right thing, re-assemble and up the ante!

Second, what planet are these ""journalists"" working on?:  ""...threatened to derail months of bipartisan work in Congress...""  Seriously?  The Democrats passed an almost $4 trillion bill in the House months ago; the Senate couldn't clear a much smaller bill of it's own in the fall, and the groups were trillions apart.

That election could have easily gone the other way. 

The next 4 years are going to be a transition to populism in both parties. The one that makes the adjustment best is the one that will win in 2024.

M4A will happen,"
2020-12-23 14:30:48,"There are plenty of cynical motives for Trump to interject himself into the process.  He enjoys the spotlight, especially on a difficult bill.  Remember all the negotiations on dreamers.  Trump would tell democrats he would support one thing, they would get something ready, a bunch of influential Fox media people would object, and Trump would blow it up.  

First, Trump craves media attention.  Second, he is a populist, and wants his name attached with populist stuff.  Third, he may just want to blow up the bill, and not give anything.  Fourth, he may be trying to inject himself into Georgia (though at this point, people supporting Trump may be boycotting the Jan. 6 election).

Seventy million or more Americans like to be entertained by Trump who is an infinitely better entertainer than  President.  His bomb-dropping will continue when he's out of the White House.

And now that Trump is threatening to veto the legislation, all the Dems have to do is hold his -- and Republican Congressmen's -- feet to the fire. Whatever Trump or the Republicans do, the Dems SHOULD be able to turn it into a win-win for their side (but they won't because again, they don't how to fight).

I see many comments on here that are wondering why the president has been silent on this issue until now. Except he hasn’t been silent; he has issued multiple statements that he would readily sign stand-alone bills that send cash directly to Americans. He even published a tweet to such effect in early October.

I just don’t care about the DC good-cop, bad-cop routine anymore. Please spare me on how the red team or blue team have respectively held this relief hostage. Just cut the biggest checks possible and we can sort it out later. People are hurting like never before, and they need help urgently."

- anything he does is in service to his interest and ego.
- he needs to be in front without doing the hard work or heavy lifting.

- more importantly, he'd get no thanks for me.

If trump truly understood how to make a deal he would have pressured Mitch during the negotiations, not when the deal was done. He doesn't have a clue about anything, especially how to negotiate, like everything else the bully -he just wants it his way and his way only. The art of the deal, hah!"

He marginalized himself during the negotiations over this bill.  Now, knowing that the bill has a bullet-proof majority in the Senate and the House, he's swooped in at the 13th hour insisting on $2,000 in direct checks -- something the Democrats would have been happy to oblige hm with months and months ago.

So far I've heard a variety of explanations for Trump's sudden move.  If only the real explanation was that his brain fog -- the fog that induced him to switch political parties a few years ago, to become an anti-abortion advocate, to become anti-immigrant (after relying on immigration labor for years, although refusing to pay for some of that labor at his own properties), and then to buy into all of the hideous policies that have become the backbone of the Republican Party -- had suddenly lifted and he'd realized the wrongness of everything he's done these past four years.

To do this, he simply exploits the animosity that has arisen between Democrats and Republicans as the country has become ever more partisan.

The stimulus passed by Congress is too small.  It only delays the end of a moratorium on evictions from December 31 to January 31.  The result may be that millions face eviction at the beginning of February.

How will Americans deal with this?

Yesterday I took a drive through downtown Olympia.  Across Capitol Lake from the Capitol is a homeless encampment.

It has been raining here during the last month.  Next month it may snow.  I wonder what it is like for the homeless to confront the inclement weather in tents.

Somehow the apparent rise of homelessness has been missed by both Republicans and Democrats.  It was estimated that the US had 550,000 homeless in January 2018.  How many will be homeless at the end of February 2021?

Will the newly homeless due to COVID raise the figures of homeless to a million?  To two million?

Suppose nobody really knows."

He could have taken a interest in this long ago and pushed McConnell to accept one of Pelosi’s three packages, but no, he didn’t care back then, because back then he thought he would win the election without having to lift a finger. Now that he’s suddenly popped up again from his post-election coma to hand out pardons to convicted murderers and loyalists, it dawns on him that he can also poke a stick in McConnell’s eye for refusing to support his coup in the Senate, and pretend to be “the people’s” champion all over again at the same time. His base will love it. The Democrats love it, too, because at last they are getting some Republican support for their original intentions. But where was Trump six months ago, when Pelosi was demanding $2000 payments? Ignoring her, of course, because back then, there was no political advantage for him in supporting her efforts on the people’s behalf. He never does anything unless it benefits him somehow. This little stunt allows him to bask in a little last-minute popularity and take revenge upon the Republican establishment before getting tossed out on his ear in January."

Ted Cruz and AOC agree that a 5000+ page bill should not be voted on a few hours after its introduction: they are correct. 

It's hard to know what is true in this agree of internet noise, but it looks like the bill includes billions for foreign nations, billions for weapons purchases, provisions addressing illegal downloads, tens of billions to bail out airlines, trains and buses, $15bn for big agriculture, allowing PPP recipients to deduct their loans from their taxes, excise tax cuts for beer makers, a bailout for NASCAR facility maintenance, tax credits for electric motorcycles... I haven't read the 5500 pages but I'm sure there are many, many more. 

I don't even oppose these things on their faces, it's just... How about we help struggling people who can't eat or pay rent. Do that first, then celebrate with cheaper beer."

Worst, it's a waste of money. That $600 will forestall what's coming by two to three weeks, at best. Bernie Sanders (Oh, no, another Bernie Bro pointing out what we're all going to have to eventually admit was right and what all the economists are saying right now) pushed for $1,200 a week, indefinitely. That's how you restart the economy. WWBD? What Will Biden Do? More like WDBD. What Didn't Biden Do? This will be the last check you'll see to stimulate the economy (maybe, maybe, Biden will get a single measly $300 check out, round about May or June).

His ""concern"" is fake news. All he wants to do is stir the pot, cause more dissention and delay payments getting to folks."
2020-12-23 15:06:00,"First of all , Mnuchin would have known what  the wishes of Trump were in relation to the citizen payment amount .
If anything , the Admin was pushing for a $300figure /pp .

So , if Trump is now coming out with this new figure at this point ,is now indicative  of Trump's primary purpose ,which has nothing to do with the welfare of the American public at large .
Odd that trump makes no mention of the 1.3 billion dollars that went to his infamous wall construction ...what that has to do with an emergency relief bill ,i have no idea ..

As to the accusation that the media should have been highlighting  the various dodgy factors included within the 5.500 page document/bill much earlier , well how could they before it was finalised and published ??

If Trump had won the Presidency presently , I would bet a penny to a pound that individual payments would be no more then $300 pp.

Meanwhile Trump is flying to Mar a Lago later today for the holidays ....the toad has a great sense of his own self interest priorities ..No surprises there ..!!"
2020-12-23 15:02:55,"I guess now the fiscal conservatives in Congress finally know what they’re dealing with. They have been genuflecting to Trump for four years and now he throws them under the bus. Nice guy, that Trump, huh Republicans?"
2020-12-23 14:55:56,"I assume at this point, the bill will go nowhere. Trump will veto and the ""veto-proof"" majority will evaporate as the Republicans who supported it scurry away because they have to always show their obeisance to Trump. Result: nothing for anybody. Except Trump."
2020-12-23 15:13:00,"We have been and are continuing to loose the same number of people who died in the World Trade Center terrorist act on a daily basis to covid-19, and President Trump and his entire Administration are quiet. All he’s doing is acting in more extreme and irrational ways. Can this really be part of an exit strategy (or a poor effort based on his poor hand) of his - to act in such a dangerous way that he feels he can negotiate an exit without any legal challenge to him and his family once they leave office? Meanwhile, people die because they believed his lies.  Now he makes this claim.  It's a distraction.  He doesn't deserve notice, except from the courts and our legal system."
2020-12-23 14:56:47,"Trump doesn’t want $2,000 stimulus checks. He knows the Republicans in Congress won’t go for that amount and therefore this will cause a logjam. It’s a political stunt. When it fails, the low information voter will think Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi got in the way when, in fact, Trump is in the way. There is no way the conservatives and libertarians in Congress will agree to $2,000."
2020-12-23 15:12:30,"If he was the master negotiator he claims to be, he would have been more involved with this bill all along instead of trying to overturn the election he lost."
2020-12-23 15:14:35,"“on Tuesday evening threatened to derail months of bipartisan work in Congress”

This clause represents the bizarre standard of “neutral” reporting.  The House passed a relief bill in May.  The Senate refused to take up COVID relief between May and December. Republican senators spent those months discovering their concern for deficits, falsely lauding an economy that wasn’t really recovering, and denying the plain evidence of the severity of the COVID pandemic. In the past few weeks it dawned on  a handful of Republican senators that people were running out of unemployment and savings, were on the verge of losing shelter through foreclosure or eviction, would not receive vaccinations because localities lacked resources to distribute the vaccine, and could no longer maintain small businesses gutted in the pandemic.  Even that mattered little to the one important senator until McConnell realized that his callousness jeopardized his Senate majority. In a cynical play to retain power, he pushed through in a couple of days a meager and inadequate package that allows two Georgia plutocrats to boast of providing relief.  What railroad in this do your reporters see?  What train was derailed? What bipartisan work happened? Why an easy rhetorical trope in place of accurate description?"
2020-12-23 14:59:28,See how quickly Trump changes his mind if he doesn't get to sign the checks.
2020-12-23 15:00:41,"Trump has gone into hiding while others did the work on trying to come up with some kind of relief, following the GOP refusal to consider what the democrats proposed LAST MAY.  Now, he pops up at the last minute to grandstand and bribe in some hope that it will gain him political traction because he can't seem to find any other way to overturn a fair and free election that has thrown him out."
2020-12-23 15:12:54,"Let's see... a vital bill founded on addressing the genuine needs of our country; formulated by bipartisan discussion, negotiation and compromise; and hated by far right and far left extremists like Trump and Occasio-Cortez. Sounds like exactly the civil leadership process that our country our country needs!"
2020-12-23 15:09:05,"Nancy Pelosi will call a vote and challenge the House Republicans to the $2000 stimulus checks. If it passes then Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans will have to go up against Trump. 

I can’t wait to see how this plays out."
2020-12-23 14:57:05,"I am shocked that so many commenters seem to share Trump's ignorance of the Congressional budget process. This article and the news media at large have made it perfectly clear that lawmakers decided to combine Covid relief with a broader spending bill that will fund government expenditures through next September. Foreign aid, support for certain cultural institutions, etc is always part of that, not some shadowy ploy to sneak other spending into the Covid bill."
2020-12-23 14:57:32,"I generally don’t agree with Trump, but he’s right on the payment, even if his reasons for it are not the same as mine."
2020-12-23 15:05:26,how about just lowering federal taxes for the people who are still working and give money  payments to the unemployed.
2020-12-23 14:27:35,"This ""relief"" bill should have included paying off Covid patient's hospital bills; those with insurance and without. We're the so-called wealthiest country, but no health insurance for all and a government botched pandemic response = DISGRACE. I could scream."
2020-12-23 11:54:35,"Why didn't he say this sooner? Why did he wait until the all the votes were in? Was it to just throw another money wrench (he keeps them in his back pocket in case you didn't know) in whatever he can to muddy up the swampy waters he has left the US in? 

As usual, his modus operandi is to get us to look over here or over there, but only for a minute, now he is ready to throw another monkey wrench later today, now look at that one and we won't be able to pay attention to the real damage he continues to cause to our economy and to our country.

A real leader would have presented his desire to his constituents, not let them work and work to come to a deal only to criticize. 

There is no end to his gaslighting. But that is not the issue, to what end is his gaslighting taking us, that is the real question."
2020-12-23 13:27:24,This last minute bluster of his reminds me of a friend who reaches for his wallet after the meal had already been paid for.
2020-12-23 13:42:49,"Says Woodrow Wilson biographer A. Scott Berg that after contracting the Spanish flu the “generally predictable” Wilson started blurting out “unexpected orders”—on two separate occasions, he “created a scene over pieces of furniture that had suddenly disappeared,” despite the fact that nothing had been moved—and exhibiting other signs of severe disorientation. At one point, the president became convinced that he was surrounded by French spies. President Trump  seems to be repeating history, not only by downplaying the epidemic (that time 675.000 Americans died), but also by showing all the signs of a severe and dangerous disorientation. Who can stop him from throwing the country into chaos? It is almost there..."
2020-12-23 11:56:48,"Trump is doing this because his name is no this original bill.  He was spending too much time on the golf course  or whining about his loss to get involved.  Now that there is a bill, he wants his name attached to it."
2020-12-23 11:20:39,"And again the question is raised: Trump is the GOP's most popular politician and is the leader of his party at the least insofar as being the leader of the GOP base. Yet he did nothing in eight months to get a relief bill passed because why?
Next Q: Trump has made similar statements over time and have done nothing. So why would this time be different? And maybe all he's doing now is lashing out at McConnell and nothing more. I'd also hypothesize that maybe Trump things that this bill failing would help Loeffler and Perdue by making the Dems look like the ones to blame for the bill's failure.
But presuming that Trump's position here is serious and substantive -- you know, what a true leader does -- please.
He's a loser and can't hide it and is lashing out. He was unfit to be POTUS and continues to remain so."
2020-12-23 15:12:38,"Passing a major piece of substantive legislation has become - and maybe always, just not so shamelessly - little more then a process of hostage-taking, where members of Congress hold back their vote while demanding to see their latest pet turkey in there. Perhaps worse, those turkeys are often self-serving gestures to please doners and their own voters, although the ratio is a lot more the big donors to the lesser, littler voters."
2020-12-23 13:46:26,He is incredibly disingenuous. But then again that is all he is ever is. He decides to wait until the bill is at his desk only to try to scuttle it when he could just as easily negotiated a better relief check for the citizens months prior. He does not care about the bill but by the attention his action will get along with the distraction it will cause while he continues to pardon crooks.
2020-12-23 14:04:06,One thing we have to say about Trump is that he keeps everyone entertained with his bizarre and explosive behavior. He could have challenged the Republicans in the Senate to do more months ago. But Trump wants to be the ringmaster shooting off explosives every minute of every day. People are hurting now and need relief. Why would he wait until now to say he wants what the Democrats wanted months ago? If he really wanted this he could have gotten this months before. No; this bomb thrower of a president wants to be the center of attention every minute of every day.  The Republicans got the POTUS they deserved.
2020-12-23 13:53:24,"Good! Delay financial relief from the Trump Memorial Pandemic until the new President takes office! 

Relief checks with Trump's name stamped on the face will be misconstrued as Trump's largess instead of prudent aid from our representative government."
2020-12-23 14:55:48,"I don't think Trump realizes this is a general spending bill of $2.4 trillion and that the Covid part is $900 billion.  The rest, as the Times points out, is normal spending.  It's not that congress is pushing pork $ to favorites under the guise of it being a Covid bill.  It's just that Covid relief happens to be part of the overall spending bill.  (and its not enough)

It appears that many readers of this article fail to understand that as well."
2020-12-23 15:00:38,"One-time checks to people who don’t need them, like myself, are not a good use of government money. Ongoing supplements to unemployment would go to people who do need it.

This bill only adds 11 weeks of unemployment benefits. To that degree, it is a disgrace. This may be the first time Trump has called legislation a “disgrace” and been remotely correct.

Of course, Trump doesn’t care about what works. He’s just interested in what makes him look good to his base. It’s part of his ongoing plan to swindle them for more money, like the “election defense” campaign that put money into his own pocket."
2020-12-23 15:03:00,"Nancy, do not fall for this trap. There is a veto proof agreement ready to go, stick to that and show Trump to be now irrelevant. But it you try to change it, the relief will be delayed and Trump will cast Congress as ineffectual."
2020-12-23 15:15:36,"Rep. Jamie Raskin's comments seal the discussion for me. He and fellow Democrats welcome the president's comments about increasing the payments to citizens to $2,000 from $600. As for the other ""items"" in said bill, that's the part where we know the phrase-making bills/legislation is like making sausage. Pakistan? Museums? My personal favorite is the protection for corporate business lunches and tax breaks. What a country!"
2020-12-23 15:15:42,"Another ""reactive"" move by the President who is supposed to be the leader. At the core of the entire Trump presidency was this very issue that couldn't have been better demonstrated than with this move: he is not a leader and has never been...and that is the reason why we are in this disaster."
2020-12-23 15:16:10,"As much as my wife and I would love an extra $4,000 after my hours were reduced by 25% over the past 6 months, I think the money would be better spent raising the supplemental unemployment back to $600.  People who have completely lost their jobs need it more, in order to avoid eviction, to buy groceries, and keep the electricity on.

Priorities.

Reminds me of an episode of Sanford and Son where Fred was telling a woman he had to drop out of school to get a job in order to support his parents' habit.  The woman said, ""Oh, that's terrible.  What habit was that?""  Fred replied, ""Eating."""
2020-12-23 15:04:47,"1. Trump should veto the bill at once.  2. The Democrats should press hard for bigger checks to Americans AND for resources for the states. 3.The Democrats should take this message directly to the American people as well as to Mnuchin and McConnell.  They are supporting the President.  4. The Ossoff and Warnock campaigns should create some messaging for the January 5th election using provisions in the bill to characterize their opponents.  

Trump has always believed in advancing himself by dividing the nation.  This division of the Republican Party could actually help the American people if the Democrats can be smart and effective."
2020-12-23 15:22:15,"What a lesson in civics. If Trump does not act by signing or vetoing the bill between now and next week, it puts the bill and the whole of Congress into an odd spot. A brand new Congress commences in first week of January 2021. Presumably bills passed in bicameral fashion yet not signed into law lapse to nothing. Will the pocket veto take effect ? If so, on which day precisely ? Can this Congress actually stay in session past New Year’s Day ?"
2020-12-23 15:31:37,"It is a disgrace, that many of those who legislate minimal support for those who most need it, continue to live lavish lifestyles and impose restrictions upon the lives of those whom they supposedly serve. From unfounded evidence, that anything but a Niosh N-95 mask can prevent transmission of a virus or disease,   our fearless Leaders continue to punish hard-working small business owners and their employees, who are just trying to work and take care of their families. For many, it's much Too little too late."
2020-12-23 15:34:41,"Apparently trump was too busy trying to reverse the presidential election to spend any time to engage in the negotiations on the stimulus bill. And now with people going hungry, eviction notices ready to be served the Impeached know-nothing emasculated figure head refuses to sign the bill which just goes to show, there is nothing he won't do to make a situation much much worse."
2020-12-23 15:25:18,"$2,000 instead of $600 to everyday working Americans who badly need it is a great idea. The Democrats and Trump agree on this. Who would be against this? Oh yeah, a corrupt Congress who are in bed with the wealthy and will do everything they can to instead shift billions from the pockets of regular Americans into the bank accounts of the wealthy. I'm guessing Congress will use the distraction of Christmas this week to hope the demand for stimulus payments to Americans will disappear. Democrats, don't let that happen!"
2020-12-23 15:26:44,"They refused to do anything for months. And they barely did this now at the height of the pandemic. So, why would they do anything later or anything better when vaccines are rolling out? Of course, they won’t do anything later!!!!!! 
So, he needs to veto it now, because this is it!! There’s no more after this!! What they’re doing is inadequate. It needs to be done better now, or it will not be done! 
But, will he veto it? Of course not! Why? Because he doesn’t really care! If he does, it will be for another reason I think! The stated reason I think would mostly be a political cover. And, some of his main supporters were the loudest voices against the pay out. If he really cared about it he’d have them support it! So, I highly doubt he really cares about the 2,000! Unless he’s somehow planning to use it for his own political gain!"
2020-12-23 15:22:31,For a guy who claims (falsely) that he is a great businessman this last tirade (hopefully) is proof of his incompetence. A smart executive would have made it clear what he/she expected Congress to deliver long ago. Instead he has wasted time on a snipe hunt and golfing. Not surprised that scurrilous elements have woven unnecessary pork into the bill but to have a tantrum at this hour is counter productive. Introduce an additional bill when congress is sworn in next year. Run with this one now and fix it next month.
2020-12-23 15:35:12,Congress must focus to overcome the pandemic and not mismanage resources to create giveaways.
2020-12-23 15:21:49,"When a piece of legislation is so big it has to be wheeled around on a cart, you're guaranteed none of its signatories have read it.  And not having read it, they should probably refrain from comment about it.  What a colossal waste of time, pretended effort and expense in the face of Americans in dire need."

2020-12-23 15:42:46,Trump doesn't care a wit about us.  He just wants to be seen as a generous Santa at Christmastime.  The images of babies being separated from their mothers have been burned into my soul.  No amount of money can erase that.
2020-12-23 15:15:41,Just another split by a seriously fractured and flawed president with an equally fractured and flawed party. The moderate GOP are his enemy now and one can only hope it’s one of epic proportions with assured mutual destruction.
2020-12-23 15:40:08,"This ""disgraced"" relief bill was a start. Now there won't be a relief of any kind before end of year because the Congress in recess for Christmas. What trump wants to do is cause a total disruption to keep his name in the news. His pardons of fellow criminals wasn't enough to get him attention. He has stayed hidden in the White House. Did he not accuse President-Elect Biden of hiding in his basement? trump doesn't want to lead he just wants attention and power."
2020-12-23 14:53:34,"""President Trump on Tuesday evening threatened to derail months of bipartisan work in Congress to deliver $900 billion in coronavirus relief to a country battered by the pandemic, demanding checks to Americans that are more than three times as much as those in the bill, which he called a “disgrace.”""

This is terrible reporting, once again giving  the Republicans credit they don't deserve.  There were no ""months of bipartisan work.""  The only work McConnell did was to say no, and the Senate Republicans joined in.  It was only when the effect on the election in Georgia became an issue that McConnell decided to do something, and then only as little as possible.  This terrible reporting."
2020-12-23 15:10:53,Finally we see a valuable Tweet from Pesident Trump.  He's absolutely correct to lambast congress for their shameful neglect of the people of the United States and making their so-called relief nothing more than a rider to a large appropriation bill.  It's 5.593 pages of typical governmental babble -- basically a package of omnibus payments to a diverse group of beneficiaries.
2020-12-23 15:21:44,"If not for the utter horrors of this situation, it would be almost funny thinking of Trump’s threats to his own republican enablers like McConnell and Thune—Sorry, gentlemen. The call is coming from inside the house."
2020-12-23 15:28:37,I wish this president would just go away already and stop causing havoc. He just does this to make things difficult.
2020-12-23 15:37:37,"Hmmm.

McConnell should have known better.

He should have made sure that Kushner pockets over $700 million as with the last one."
2020-12-23 14:57:22,This is just pandering to the Georgia elections. Maybe he read the article saying he'd won the elections if he had passed a relief package before - instead of blocking it all along.
2020-12-23 15:05:29,"Easter eggs in massive bills have always existed. Get this done and get the relief, as it is, to those who most need it. I was going to savage the president, but instead I am struck by Lindsay Graham's line, ""Pakistan is a place I really worry about.” I feel safer already."
2020-12-23 15:35:00,"It’s a strategic exit move by Trump because he will be running for PRESIDENT on 2024, 2028, 2031...forevah. Honestly, Trump’s $2K will significantly help all Americans unlike the anemic $600 from Congress."
2020-12-23 14:24:40,"Trump's favorite word is ""disgrace"".   I guess when you live it...you really do know it!

Using what people made by way of income in 2019 is a terrific way to give away money to people who don't need it regardless of whether it's a Scrooge amount like 600 or Trump's 2000 with a ""Love Me ME ME"" signature attached.
Imbedding goodies for those who don't need it like the 3 martini lunch crowd is more grist for the ""disgrace"" mill.  That GOP lawmakers are mired in obvious fealty to donors, lobbyists and corporate interests is nearly as disgraceful as the enabling of Trump's criminality.   Birds of a feather."
2020-12-23 15:30:15,"What the current ""president"" is trying is called extortion.  He's now offered his deal - appoint him ""president"" - presumably forever - and he'll pay $2000 per ""vote"".  Looking for election fraud?  This is it."

2020-12-23 15:28:43,"The stress keeps on coming. Just when you think you can stop chewing your nails and grinding your teeth, there is always one more upheaval to keep you awake at night. Bigger checks? Write them. Sign them. Send them. Please. The whole country is so traumatized by its own government, we don't even need foreign interlopers. Did they include extra cash for universal therapy? Not one of the people involved in bringing this bill to Americans has had to face the looming question of whether or not there will be a roof over their heads or food on their tables."
2020-12-23 15:45:14,"Here’s the plot....Trump finally wakes up from his nightmares and realizes that he’s being marginalized and disrespected by the GOP led by McConnell.  In his waking state he remembers that originally he was a registered Democrat, so he announces that he is changing back and “firing” all those GOPers who don’t agree with him.   He can also claim that since he’s now a Democrat, he actually won the election, since if you put his votes together with those of the Democratic candidate, it’s a super-majority.  Since the aim of his Presidency is to wreck as much as he can, just watch the fallout."
2020-12-23 15:27:09,"First of all, Trump blamed democrats for the bill taking so long, which is yet another lie. 
Secondly, that should be $2,000 A MONTH. $2,000 one-time is ok, but won't do much to help struggling Americans. 
Third, hasn't Trump learned that he works for McConnell. When McConnell says ""no"", it's no. 
Good luck, everybody, you're getting a lump of coal for Christmas. Oh, wait, that's worth money - you're getting nothing."

What a peculiar way to run a country. Sadly, this is the norm."
2020-12-23 15:19:02,"The fact is that the bill became a monster,  because of the pork grease that was packed along with it. And I have a good guess about the identity of party that added most of the lard: it was the party the president belongs to. So the obvious conclusion is  he is aiming to hit his own party (specially the Senate) while securing one more day his place center of the news.  It is populist also so some people may think he cares for them by cutting a 2K check for them (remember the letter and signature last time?). This is just his gut feelings have movements and telling him that he can get '3 wins'. That is the way he sees it."
2020-12-23 15:26:54,"As everything Trump, this is all for the show. He had ample  time to be involved in the negotiation but there is no publicity in that, no drama. As everything Trump he doesn’t give a wit about the American people. He only cares about the show."
2020-12-23 15:25:34,"Well, congratulations to Congress. They managed to approve a bill that pleases none of the people none of the time — including the Executive Branch “leader.”

As others have said, this is a power play by Trump. His relegation to “below the fold” news articles don’t sit well with the Ego in Chief. If he had the interest of his base, the Republican Party or his constituents, in general, Mnuchin and the Republicans in Congress would have crafted a very different piece of legislation. 

If nothing else, his end is like his beginning — deconstruction, empty promises, name-calling and self-aggrandizement. 

Our best hope for this holiday season is that Trump signs the bill, the Georgia voters reject Trump’s minion candidates and that Biden can pull together a true relief package on 22 January, 2021."
2020-12-23 15:34:06,"I have a thought/question on what readers think would be happening at this point if it was found to be the case that COVID-19 originated in the United States as opposed to China.  Would the world, and some Americans, insist that the United States bear the financial burden of compensating and paying reparations to the rest of the world for their economic losses related to the pandemic?  Has anyone seen this being demanded of China or even being written about or considered?"
2020-12-23 15:24:34,Many have praised Trump for this latest comment. But Trump's failure to act months ago is precisely why he wasn't re-elected in November. Trump's failure to act in a timely fashion to help control the spread of the Covid19 pandemic in the spring was another failure of his leadership. Trump never took a true leadership role in anything. He simply tested the winds and started throwing his Tweet Bombs in the direction he thought would bring him the best ego-boosting publicity. We needed a president who could lead the country and instead we got a TV actor pretending to be POTUS.

He only expected the legislature to re-vote on the same bill, so he could then say he TRIED to get more money for us but congress stood in his way. Posing in a Santa hat to boost his brand. If he backs away from his rhetoric based on Pelosi's remarks, it will expose his motive.

McConnell & Crew now have their backs to the wall and may have to actually compromise. Well done, Madame Speaker."
2020-12-23 15:21:31,"I have no earthly idea why top Democrats didn't make this much noise about it, or why the D senate candidates in GA were not beating the drum on this 24x7 in their campaigns down there.

This should have been a top issue going into the 2016 election - Democrats should have never let up on this, spoke about it constantly and loudly, and set them selves up as the party that would get it done.  It's a political winner. 

Now it appears as if Pelosi is ""following"" Trump on this issue.  

Why wasn't she leading?  Why not have a press conference every single day asking for 2K per American, and let the Republicans play (losing) defense?  

At what point to Democrats stop playing by the old rules?"
2020-12-23 15:39:21,"The least likely person to read a 5395 page bill is Trump, but he knows what makes headlines that make him look good to his base. Others have suggested donating unneeded stimulus checks to charity. Trump’s Save America PAC will be asking for a piece of that pie the day those checks hit the mail.
In short he doesn’t care how much public money is spent as long as he gets his taste of the action."
2020-12-23 15:29:41,"Even a broken clock is right twice a day (more frequently than Trump, by orders of magnitude, but still applies).

However, the direct payment is not the only problem. One of the biggest giveaways that has slipped mostly under the radar is the double dip deduction for PPP expenses.

What this means is that if a business receives $100,000 in PPP loans, that is tax free. Then, that business pays the $100,000 out in salary (and this could be to the sole owner of the business) and receives a $100,000 deduction on that money.

So, if the business had $500,000 in profit before the PPP, they now have $600,000 with a $100,000 deduction, meaning they have $600,000 in profit, but will only be taxed on $500,000.

If you add a zero or two to that number, you can see how this is just a massive giveaway to the wealthy that makes absolutely no sense. Even Steve Mnuchin said this was insane.

Yet, here's your $600, general public, oh and if you have a job and are doing just fine (or even better than pre-covid), you still get it because... the people who have suffered, well, you deserve as much as them.

It makes no sense.

And lastly, let's make streaming copyrighted content a felony, because why not? Seems like an important thing to do in a covid bill."
2020-12-23 15:27:29,"Hopefully a month from now, the focus of the news will be what President Biden is doing and saying rather than what President Trump is attempting to stir up.  Trump does have a knack for creating havoc and dissension among his own party not to mention the American people."
2020-12-23 15:41:14,"Trump is right to point out the ""bait-and-switch"" underway.  This spending is being sold as pandemic relief."
2020-12-23 15:44:07,"This budget Bill was planned by the senate to allow the president to offer more money to citizens, just to make him look good at the end of his job. It is a political game, as usual."
2020-12-23 15:24:46,"This is yet another desperate attempt for Mr.Trump to have the proverbial last word. Sure, the bill could have been a lot better. Yet, it certainly is a far cry from nothing at all. But more than that it represents a Congress which at this point in time is manifesting more power than this administration. It reveals that this legislative branch mentioned first before the executive in the Constitution is able to move on sans Donald Trump. Also, let us keep in mind that President-elect Biden had been intimately involved, urging Congress on to produce much needed help for the American people. Think what that must have done to the ever-dominant Trump ego."
2020-12-23 15:32:33,"Lindsey Graham is worried about Pakistan! He should be worried, but would pouring in millions and billions more there do any good?  Their present Prime Minister called Osama Bin Ladin who had been hiding there a “Martyr.”  Does the US want to fund more this country that has repeatedly taken the US for a hike? What world does Lindsey live in? Is he being lobbied by those in pay of Pakistan?  In this instance, Trump is right, whatever his motivations, and he is right to demand larger support for suffering Americans rather than self defeating squandering of funds on Pakistan and elsewhere."
2020-12-23 15:34:46,"The real pity here is that the House under Ms. Pelosi and the minority party in the Senate led by Mr. Schumer adopted an antagonistic stance to President Trump from the first session of  the 116th Congress.  If the three of them had decided to work together for the benefit of the country, things would be substantially different today.  Sure, we'd have been confronted by  SARS-CoV-2 through most of 2020, but a lot more could have been done to limit its effects and keep the country operating on a more coherent level.  Instead, knowing full well, the nature of the president's personality, they chose to oppose virtually every proposal he made to congress for no other apparent reason than they're Democrats and he's a Republican.  Neither side can escape the guilt for their constant bickering and lack lack-luster performance during the last two years."
2020-12-23 15:17:14,"As the Times properly calls the bill a relief bill, checks to the general public seem a misuse of money.  The out of work need extended and supplemented unemployment benefits more than those who earn $50 much less those who earn $75K.
As a senior, I am loath to write that those receiving Social Security benefits have not seen any reduction of those benefits,  those checks to them is questionable.
I have a suspicion that POTUS has designed a litmus test for his Republican sycophants in Congress.  If they vote for an override, POTUS may put them on his enemies' list and he collected enough money to make life difficult for those he perceives as enemies,
In any case, there is no time for another bill."
2020-12-23 15:23:46,"More money needs to help the unemployed, not people who have jobs or in retirement who might be eligible to receive a $600 check."
2020-12-23 15:07:35,"Trump is correct on this.  The ""relief"" plan of $600 is an insult, made acute since it's coming from these well-fed, well-insured, well-housed, and vaccinated government employees.  

""Help is on the way?""  Do you mean the $10 million for gender programs to Pakistan?  Americans are dying, losing homes, no jobs.  This is absolutely not the right time for money to leave this country.  Pakistan can wait -- or some billionaires can step up and redistribute the worldly goods they have hoarded.  Disgusted with all of this."
2020-12-23 11:45:37,"How beautifully ironic that Trump will be remembered as a demand-side loving, and dare I say decidedly “socialist” president?  His $2000 demand is a huge Christmas present for Pelosi and Schumer—and Biden—and is pure Kentucky coal for McConnell and McCarthy."

2020-12-23 15:20:50,"Now Trump is a Socialist? Who knew?

Now watch his supplicants line up at the trough to take advantage of these crumbs swept off the table to help Americans at a time of need. For months leading up to the election, they were slinging around the word ""socialism"" as a swear word against Democrats. 

Yet denying that they were very happy to receive their VA benefit checks, Social Security Retirement checks, Medicare/Medicaid checks, now stimulus checks. Suddenly, socialism works! Yet, big government is bad. How delusional are his GOP followers, including elected GOP Senators and Congressmen. Laughable."

2020-12-23 15:14:53,Stop complaining.  This is capitalism at work.
2020-12-23 15:13:55,Perhaps a good question is whether President Trump woke up early today and got to work READING the package and studying the finer points or did he learn about details from a television set? He has always been a malevolent Chauncey the gardener.
2020-12-23 15:22:55,"Risking a legacy of the American Pandemic President and the Trump Virus, he finally comes around.  Not to mention, if he gives $2,000 to everyone, maybe 41% will send him a check.

The Congress loads up this relief bill with stuff that can be easily attacked by anyone with half a brain. The 3 martini lunch, foreign aid, etc.
So, now, after sitting on the sidelines for weeks comes ""the cavalry"" in the person of big Donald attacking the bill and offering 4X  taxpayer money. See, now who really cares? Not those cheapskates who worked on the bill but Big Donald.
Of course this bill -a clean bill- should have been dealt with months ago but thanks to Moscow Mitch it got nowhere in the senate. Not even a hearing.

Is there a more useless bunch than the Republican Party and the trump party?"
2020-12-23 15:19:12,"Very typical of Trump to criticize the work of others without having contributed anything to a solution. Obamacare? Terrible, he says, offering no alternative.

2020-12-23 15:44:39,This is the type of simple contrast that even the most die hard trumpers can’t deny - pelosi and trump want to give you $2k and the republicans want you to eat dirt. And with Trump leaving office so soon there is no political cost to dems to fully embrace Trump’s request
2020-12-23 15:37:04,"So nice to know Trump no longer has dyslexia and read the 5000 page bill. Even when I agree with him, he makes me sick. And he calls Thune a RINO? Trump was a Republican, changed to Reform Party, then a Democrat, then a Republican."
2020-12-23 15:49:48,"People need relief now. Trump is threatening to gunk up the works to stick it to Mitch and the Dems while staying in the spotlight. He’ll likely sign this bill, but if he truly cared about the people receiving the money, he could’ve gotten involved in negotiations months ago. Trump is lazy and revels in the drama. A sad excuse for a human being, not to mention a POTUS"
2020-12-23 15:50:53,"Pure Trump.

Trump keeps fighting the election results. McConnell and some Republicans come out and declare Biden the winner. Trump is incensed by the “disloyalty”, gets mad, strikes back by declaring no support for the bipartisan bill getting back at Republicans and puts them in a bind.

If Trump vetos the bill Congress is in the position of overriding the veto with benefits 3 times smaller than he “wants”. Trump wins. 

If Trump signs the bill Congress looks foolish for sending him a bill deemed inadequate by Trump on the one hand and packed with pork on the other. Trump wins.

If Congress reworks the bill to up the direct payment there will be fights to reduce the other parts of the bill not essential to pandemic relief. Chaos ensues. Trump will say Congress never consulted him, truth besides the point. Trump wins.

McConnell is left holding the bag and gets the blame either way. Trump punishes him for the disloyalty.

This has nothing to do with the suffering public. No, this has to do with Trump, as always."
2020-12-23 15:52:42,The comments to this article are stunning. Fingers pointing in the opposite direction all over the place. Will the blame game ever end? The political players on both sides are to blame and all we the people have to show for it is a measly $600 and a relief package full of pork that we will be paying for for years.
2020-12-23 15:51:32,"So now Trump joins the Democrats’ fight to send more money to suffering Americans?  Too bad he wasn’t President these last six months, while his Senate Republicans opposed that relief."
2020-12-23 15:49:25,"Making $125K a year (combined), I don’t need $600, much less $2,000, from the government. How many others who also are not in need of such a payment will there be getting checks? Such waste!"

1) Remove all restrictions to commerce, assembly, and travel
2) Allow citizenry to be responsible for their own safety and protection.

2020-12-23 15:48:25,"Trump's gambit to bribe voters with extra money to overturn an election  will not work.  There is no turning back.  Joe Biden will be our next president and will sign this bill if Trump will not.

It is a great idea if it was meant compassionately to raise the direct payments to 2000 dollars, but at this point raising the issue only creates chaos as Republicans reject the deal.  Perhaps Trump is now trying to destroy the Republican party out of spite.

But running a government on the basis of spite does not help the suffering American people.  Trump needs to get out of the way out of the way and let the country and its government do its job.  Mr. Trump it is all over for you and pretending to be relevant just causes more suffering for all of us."

Sickening. Please. No more."

2020-12-23 15:55:44,"Anyone want to bet that Trump's entire rationale for this is to give the public ""buyer's remorse"" over his electoral defeat? The last line of his video is a dead giveaway.

This doesn't mean, however, that Trump didn't accidentally stumble onto a very salient point - one, incidentally, shared by people as ideologically disparate as AOC, and Ted Cruz. Mainly that the bill is a muddled mess.

It really brings into stark relief the reality that any policy that is meant to directly benefit the material conditions of the public needs to be twisted and contorted into large omnibus bills because we live in a country so peculiar that our government absolutely refuses to directly help the public without any strings attached. Like, does anyone really believe that a ""clean"" relief bill would pass any US Congress, regardless of which party controls it?"

That said, by all means call his bluff and get those $2000 checks out STAT! I won't get one, but will sleep a little better knowing that it will go a bit farther than $600 for those who need it. I think Sanders and Pelosi will know how to play this one--let them have some fun!
On the other hand, I fear that the madman shenanigans will only delay desperately needed relief for those already on the brink. That can't happen."

Half of America will roll over as they are stupid enough to believe the election was stolen and the other half will be powerless. Add to all this will be thousands dying in hospital parking lots, a virus spreading like wildfire, and a population terrified to go outside.

And Munchin thinking the important thing about this bill is that it was a nice birthday present for himself is downright tone deaf."

2020-12-23 15:01:40,"THE RELIEF PACKAGE BILL IS A ""DISGRACE""?  Look who's talking!  The biggest DISGRACE in US history.  According to Glenn Kirschner, former federal prosecutor for 30+ years and prosecutor of homicide cases for 20+ years, Trump and Pence have have both perpetrated acts that, according to the federal regulations on homicide, that are criminal.  They both face charges for mass homicides.  These charges can be brought in any state, as homicides are illegal everywhere.  In fact, Trump and Pence are the greatest mass murderers in US History!  Their supporters who support the homicidal acts are accessories to their crimes.  Meaning that the GOP is the party of massive homicide, murder and terrorism.  I'd say that they've much to account for.  And a need to bring themselves back into the realm of civilized governance.  Trump announced his plans for ""herd immunity"" privately.  It has been made public. That is his twisted ""justification"" for the massive deaths.  With this ""herd immunity"" did Trump intend for more people to be killed by COVID-19 than the lives lost by US military in WW II?"
2020-12-23 16:02:39,"Like all of the rest of Donald Trumps' AWOL record as President, Trump has turned yet another hard fought compromise by the Dems and the GOP into another verse of ""The Little Red Hen"" children's fable. The little red hen wants help harvesting the grain, preparing the flour, preparing the bread, and baking the bread, and certain others refuse to help. But when it comes time to eat the bread, then these others want to help. Thankfully for the nation, both the Dems and the GOP in Congress helped to produce the compromise that will bring relief to pandemic stricken families. ONLY NOW DOES THE SELFISH AND GREEDY DONALD TRUMP WANT A PIECE OF THE BREAD, A HUGE PIECE, MAYBE THE WHOLE LOAF. He wants to take credit for the pandemic relief without doing any of the work. This is so typical of a narcissist like him who would rather play golf or eat chocolate cake than deal with the nation's crises and its citizen's concerns. Also, this plays into his other major role in life, namely, The Drama Queen From Queens New York. He can't stand anybody but him getting the spotlight of press attention shown on them. The Press exists only to praise Donald Trump. All I can say is that, short of a disastrous ruling by some court or other, we have only 28 more days of this excruciating torture to endure. On Jan. 20, 2021, the moving vans will pull up to the White House back door, and The Drama Queen From Queens New York will be moved out bag and baggage to his doll house, Mar-A-Lago.

He is too lazy, ignorant, and self-absorbed to bother even learning about policy, let alone making thoughtful, far-sighted, or prudent decisions about policy or how to get something through Congress.  This is one more spoiled-child move:  he has been off in a corner tantruming about his election loss and looks up for a moment and realizes that the big people have begun ignoring him and have moved on to something that is getting some attention -- that is pulling attention away from HIM and his sorry pathetic pity party.  That will never do!! So he jumps into the middle of it with LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME!!

This is so blatantly obvious, it's beyond me how anybody fails to get it.  I realize the Times reporters are forced to write it up as if this man were an actual politician who pays attention to governing and acts strategically; but it beats me how any commenter can still be trying to parse the motivations (don't call them ""reasons"") behind Trump's actions as anything but the desperate thrashings of his toxic narcissism."

Among other components of this lukewarm relief bill that bend reality and stagger the minds of us mere mortals is the proposed $600-per-person ""stimulus"" check. This carrot-on-a-stick is truly a disgrace, or, to put it in more exacting terms: worthless chicken feed.

This ""relief"" bill (yeah, right) once again shows how Stuck-Up Rich White Men like Moscow Mitch McConnell not only don't understand the needs and hardships of the other 99%, but also couldn't care less."

What McConnell and his GOP minions still don't understand is that a sociopath has no loyalty except to himself, and that he will always cross the line beyond where any reasonable, rational person would dare to go. Even those fools in the House who think they are being so clever by supporting trump's baseless claims to another term will get their comeuppance eventually. He'll turn on them too, and burn down the house, just from spite. As they said in the old cartoon, ""When Pierre goes down, Pierre goes down in flames."""
2020-12-23 14:50:47,"I do wish the Times would be more disciplined with articles not including editorialization.  ""The president, who has been preoccupied with the baseless claim that the election was stolen from him, seized on congressional leaders’ decision to pass the relief bill by combining it with a broader spending plan to fund government operations and the military.""  I don't see what his preoccupation with his ludicrous election claims have to do with the statement outside of the embedded clause the comment is contained in other than the fact that they are ludicrous so he's a dope.  (Of course he's a dope.)  And later in the article, it veers into a discussion of his tirade about the election.  Again, that tirade is irrelevant to the subject of this article.  Its only seeming connection is that the election-based tirade occurred in temporal proximity to his spending-bill rebukes.  Other than that, it feels completely disjointed.

Two items for thought.  First, the majority of Times readers already know that he is making these claims and that they are baseless.  But, most importantly, second, these editorializations cheapen the journalism and make it seem viewpoint-tainted.  Later in the article, it says that Trump himself participated in some of the phone calls with Mnuchin.  So I just don't really see the relevance in the context of the subject of this article except as an editorializing cheap shot.  Report the facts, and report them clearly."

Trump is playing all the angles here:  he can appeal as savior to his populist base of working class white men; he is able to “put it”to McConnell for accepting a bill that doesn’t include protection for corporations;  he can make it appear that the Dems have been weak, simultaneously applying that usual Trump pressure to elected Republicans who now have to choose between their own support for this legislation or antagonizing their Trump ensorcelled voters, who actually believe that Trump is serious about getting them this money and not using them simply as levers against the Senate which compromised with Dems in order to get home for Christmas, keep the government working for another two weeks, throw  a bone to their own out of work constituents and alleviating some of the pressure in Georgia.

What a guy!!! So predictable and so anti-patriotic.  You can bet that there isn’t going to be a Republican Senator who points out that Trump has been AWOL for nine months, during which time this bill has been negotiated.  Trump is, as always, looking out for himself.  He wants the talking point to bash Republicans and brag about himself.  It’s a win-win — for him."

Even he, in his sly transactional glory, does not likely see the  opportunity for political resurrection he created this latest hissy-Tweet.

Should he decide, this once, to act like a President, Trump would awaken tomorrow locked in combat with the most despised political institution in the nation, standing bravely against the most hated politician (After himself, of course. No one will knock those laurels off that combed-over pate) of this dour century...Mitch.

Without raising  a teensy-weensy finger Donald would be standing at the fore, set for battle with the corruption that is American government, the nation rallied and ready at his back, panting for his signal.

He would win in so many ways.

He would win Georgia, almost certainly.

He would win the thanks of whole classes, millions of people long ago resigned to never getting even recognition, let alone what they need to survive.

He'd look viable for 2024, or at least a credible threat, a shadow over the whole proceeding.

2020-12-23 17:05:17,"Here a suggestion that might be implemented quickly, and could be presented to Trump for his signature tomorrow: 
Pass a separate bill that gives every American and legal resident, regardless of gender, age or income, an immediate, one time payment of $ 200 in form of EBT (food stamps).  For everyone, no long waits to check this or that. Doing so would immediately lessen the food insecurity millions of Americans experience right now, and free up money to pay for rent, mortgage, car payments, medical bills or buy stuff for all of us, stimulating the economy. Making it the same amount per person regardless of age  means that it's automatically more for families and people with children - a family of four would get $ 800, single $ 200.    And, by making it ""food stamps for all"", it takes away the stigma; if Bill Gates uses them, there's no shame buying food with EBT funds for anyone.  Those who absolutely don't want the funds can donate their one-time EBT to food banks (put that in the bill, too).  Thoughts?"

His complaints now are attention seeking and chaotic, as usual.

2020-12-23 17:29:06,"This thing isn’t over yet. The press is reporting that House Democrats will introduce a bill to approve $2,000 stimulus payments to needy eligible Americans on Thursday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that during the bipartisan stimulus negotiations Republicans refused to answer Democrats’ requests for President Trump’s maximum acceptable number for direct payments. So, Democrats feel justified in putting Republicans on the spot. This development could further sharpen the contrast between the Democratic Senate candidates and the incumbent Republican Senators running in the crucial runoff elections in Georgia to determine which party will control the Senate next year. This is a smart move for the Democrats that should end up helping their Georgia U.S. Senate candidates and ultimately struggling Americans to obtain more financial aid from the federal government."

These two segments came up for votes separately in the House (if one watched). The funding for items like foreign aid are not part of COVID relief but of the budget, and they were requested by Trump in his proposed budget. So it seems fairly clear that Trump never read his own budget request (no surprise there), and his information about the omnibus bill must come from watching some news outlet or other, not from reading the actual legislation negotiated by his own treasury secretary.

In short, Trump has lost it, if he ever had any clue in the first place (which I sincerely doubt)."
2020-12-23 18:00:20,"A lot of people commenting here seem to forget that the direct payments have 2 main benefits - helping out people in need AND getting more money circulating in the economy.

Oddly enough I've ended up in a position where I am living comfortably on Social Security plus heating fuel assistance and Medicare help with my drug copays. With the first $1200 payment I had a new front door put in. Even though I'm not paying much of my fuel bill it was still absurd to have a front door that let a lot of cold air in around and through it.

So, I hired a local 1 person construction company and ordered my new door from a regional manufacturer, plus an in-stock storm door through a regional home improvement chain. We're in the middle of a blizzard today and this morning I had to go stand in the entry and enjoy not feeling the wind inside.

I'm hoping that the $600 will be enough to buy new covering for my 1970s solar heaters and  replace the burned out fan in 1 of them.

So, that money not only got out and spent locally, but will also save money for the Fuel Assistance program - and lower my carbon footprint at the same time."

As  my Senator Chris Murphy posits:
""If trump goes through with his temper tantrum and vetoes the budget/COVID bill there are 2 paths forward:
1. Override the veto. It passed by supermajorities.
2. Pass legislation increasing he checks to $2000. It was the GOP that wanted them smaller anyway."""

The Dems, for months, tried to get greater relief to the really hurting victims of covid and the administrations worsening of its effects--to no avail. 

Trump played no part in the drafting of the bill and now he wants to come in and play the saviour.

No telling what this gambit will accomplish. I hope it throws the Republican party into the insurmountable  turmoil,

""Democrats are rallying behind a plan to give most Americans monthly $2,000 relief checks during the coronavirus crisis, an issue that’s popular with the liberal base and American voters amid widespread economic damage from the deadly pandemic.
Republicans, who control the Senate, are balking at the idea even as the president concedes more aid may be needed for workers.

“The government has told people we need to shelter in place to keep safe. So it’s the government’s obligation to provide for basic expenses while we’re telling people not to work. It’s really that simple,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), 

“We need $2,000 a month for families struggling to pay the bills,” he added.

The idea builds off the initial $2.2 trillion CARES Act, which gave most Americans one-time stimulus checks of up to $1,200, plus more money for each dependent, and has been gaining momentum among Democrats on both sides of the Capitol.

2020-12-23 18:01:58,"It is easy to see how Trump is able to fool people with his pretense that he cares about them.  The average person is completely clueless about how government works.  The Covid relief bill has nothing to do with foreign governments and the Smithsonian.  Those are budget items in the omnibus which is an attachment.

Trump is not interested in doing any work.  He just wants to swoop in and take credit for everything.  I doubt he understands anything either.

And, for those people who are criticizing Pelosi for not taking $1.8.  That was never in the discussions.  McConnell was only negotiating on $500 billion.  The  $1.8 trillion was a Trump tweet that McConnell was never going to put on the floor.  It was not a deal point."

That's probably why he sat on the sidelines during the months of stimulus negotiations and waited until he could claim the limelight for himself. 

Now HE is the story, no longer the loser whom Biden trounced, but our savior, someone we should worship, right before Christmas, no less. Too bad Democrats didn't figure out early on that, if Trump can be made to look like a winner, king, or superstar, he just might go along with their plans."

Moscow Mitch was holding out for full immunity for businesses. But the seriously uniformed never learn these things because they listen to tabloid magazines instead of news and they definitely don't read any of the bills pushed forward. 

Why did the GOP wait until the last minute to work on the stimulus? Because they work for the wealthy and they have money. They've proven over and over that they don't care about Americans. They host super spreaders then have the audacity to get a vaccine before the people who need it most. They shouldn't be allowed to get one at all. I'm so disgusted by this party.

This seems more like a token $600 dollars, and $300 dollar payments to “buy off” or “bribe” the country to allow for the the rest of what it is really about: pork, corruption, self-interest etc, masquerading as “covid relief.” 
It seems like yet another excuse to fleece the great majority of Americans who need help by sending them crumbs in order to actually do something else! 
The notion, which I’ve heard on NPR, that this should be signed because it’s already been agreed upon, I think isn’t good enough! 
Let them go back and have a better deal for people!! They can’t give crumbs to people because “they’ve already agreed!” 
No. Veto this bill unless they increase the help to people!!! As it is now it’s not about covid relief, but using covid to do other things!! 
And the fact that it’s been combined with other things also seems so corrupt!!! 
It’s seems like they’re using the covid emergency and military spending to fleece the country, so that not voting for the corrupt parts becomes not voting for covid relief or military spending!!

The government completely choked in implementing the last ""Covid relief"" bill. $$ Billions of dollars are still unaccounted for.  Red state ""relief"" recipients used their checks to buy guns and ammo to the point of actually causing an ammo shortage in the USA. 

Checks went to the wrong people. People who needed checks did not get them, and even people in foreign countries mistakenly received checks from the US Treasury! 

Checks are the wrong format. Issue debit cards that can only be used for necessities like food, medicine, and housing. 

What we really need is legislation that will outlaw pork and special interest politics. The current bill is a Republican pork loaded bill that will saddle the US with insurmountable debt for decades. 

Any relief bill during this time of profound crises should ONLY address Covid related needs. Instead the bill turned into a political football with each side loading it with provisions that they believe will help them win the special election on Jan 5th.

Why jam a bill through now, with Trump still in office?        
The politicians want to jam anything through so they can go home and take a long, taxpayer funded vacation.

2020-12-23 23:24:09,"America has largely rejected economic measures advocated by progressives in recent years after the renaissance of America’s Left, mainly the pursuit of livable wages across the economy and a government-rendered universal basic income. In doing so, Americans have overlooked the main reason why the Left has risen up like a phoenix from the ashes: economic inequality caused by our government’s wrongheaded embrace of supply-side economic policy.

The Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020 has vindicated progressives by exposing America’s tragic economic inequality and our financially captured politicians’ stubborn refusal to concede that the U.S. economy no longer works for Americans who must work for a living and legislate accordingly. America desperately needs the original bill presented by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that called for a monthly universal basic income of $1,000 throughout this pandemic. 

Where would we Americans be if our Congress had passed and President Trump had signed that bill into law during the beginning of this crisis? You know our economy would be humming and there would be substantially less economic misery than we have today."

He’s not asking them to reduce the help! If they’re really after providing help to people, then, they shouldn’t have a problem increasing it, should they?

I personally don't need it, I can just make a bigger charitable donation with it, but millions of Americans needed it MONTHS AGO.

If there’s agreement on the protocols and lab values needed to determine what’s happening in these cases, then regulators will have more information.

It would be even more helpful for the government to offer covered care for the rare recipients receiving the vaccine who immediately require some hospitalization. These visits are not only disruptive, but are also prohibitively expensive for individuals. A commitment to investigation and to care would go a long way to soothing some recipients’ concerns and vaccine hesitancy."
2020-12-30 18:23:13,"As a physician who has treated his fair share of allergic reactions over a 30 yr career, I am dismayed by this column. There are allergies to virtually everything, so why the alarm to inevitable allergic reactions with these life altering vaccines?  Yes healthcare personnel need caution when administering them, and folks receiving them should hang out for a modest observation period to make sure everything went well, the same style of precautions given for just about any invasive procedure. So let’s not blow these rare reactions out of proportion and undermine the public confidence in a vaccine that is indispensable to a return to a more normal way of life. Allergic reactions are a minute but expected part of every medical intervention. They are also overwhelmingly manageable when properly anticipated. Don’t even remotely insinuate that they are a deal breaker here."

So far, the incidence of negative reactions to the two vaccines (from Moderna and Pfizer) is about 0.000286 percent. So while 1 in 1000 Americans has died of COVID, we have had far fewer adverse reactions to the vaccine, all of which have been treated quickly and effectively with no known lasting effects.

These vaccines are incredibly safe. They will continue to save lives and allow us to move closer to normalcy. Please stop sensationalizing the rare adverse reactions and focus on the incredible efficacy of the vaccines. These vaccines will only help, and your sadly irresponsible coverage fails us, as a society, at a time when we need it most. How shameful, and how avoidable."

Also the vaccine industry is the only industry in the world that creates demand by creating the very problem it professes to solve. Each vaccine, whether the normal flu shot or these weaken the normal immune response. The vaccines manufactures govern themselves. Interesting that the last three letters of Moderna is RNA which is linked to our DNA."
2020-12-31 00:04:38,"Medical professionals have been discredited by healthcare industry failures, thereby making vaccines suspect.  Way too much PR exacerbates the mistrust.  Take the FDA for example, those wonderful people who gave us the opioid crisis by failing to regulate Purdue Pharma. Compared to executing a credible vaccine strategy, regulating opioids is child’s play, but does require moral courage to align with a moral compass."
2020-12-31 00:31:51,"It seems that every single serious reaction has gotten a full story here.  It is my understanding that 2 million doses have been administered thus far, and so it could be anticipated from the vaccine literature that ~ 10 to 20 serious anaphylactic reactions would occur.  So far - 6.  If you have not had such a reaction to other vaccines and aren't suffering any other serious allergies - this should not be of a concern to you.  Please talk to your doctor about it.  Reading about such rare events as featured in the NYT's and then scaring yourself unnecessarily into not getting it would be most unfortunate for you and everyone else."
2020-12-31 01:03:04,"The UK recommended people with a history of severe allergies forego the vaccine.  The US rejected that recommendation, saying instead that any person with a post-vaccine severe reaction can be treated with steroids, Epi-pens and other medications.  That is sadistic.  The uncaring view of the media and medical ""experts"" who tell us to ""shut up and get the vaccine"" is a big part of the reason why many people are rejecting this vaccine.  Anaphylactic reactions are no day in the park and Dr Sadrzadeh's informed response about not wanting anybody to go through what he did should be heeded."
2020-12-31 01:33:27,"If you have ever had a reaction to a vaccine you know you do not want to go into any vaccine unprepared. The more information that gets put out, the better severely allergic people can decide and prepare. 

Make sure you talk with your allergist. Then if you do get the vaccine TELL the person giving you the injection that you have had severe reactions in the past. Epi Pen would be a helpful thing to have on hand. 

If you don't have allergies and are concerned, talk to your doctor and voice your concerns to the person giving you the injection. For example I have this thing about needles and get queasy if I see the one that is going into my body part. I have gotten so queasy I have fainted several times. I tell this to the person at the desk when I check in for my allergy shots. The nurse puts a paper towel over shots and I close my eyes. Communication solved my problem of fainting. 

This is going to be a team effort. Don't be afraid to communicate your concerns or fears. In return, we need experts to tell us the truth."
2020-12-31 01:54:32,"I’m surprised that a physician with a “severe” shellfish allergy would take a new vaccine with a limited track record, when a competing (if that’s the right word) vaccine has been shown to trigger allergic reactions. I would think that he might hold off and wait for more data. I think I would wait, if I were in his position. 

Whenever I get a vaccine I have to fill out a form asking whether I have food allergies. There is almost always some risk for the allergic, it seems. Instances like this are the reason the severely allergic carry epi-pens, but it sounds like even that was not enough. All the more reason to be methodical in administering the Covid vaccines."
2020-12-31 01:58:56,"about this: “... anaphylaxis can sometimes be difficult to confirm without blood work that hunts for an enzyme called tryptase, which is released during allergic reactions. It’s essential, she added, for there to be protocols in place so similar cases can be investigated further.”

Does this mean that no blood was taken for testing. Why? If it wasn’t, someone surely dropped the ball there."
2020-12-17 18:56:10,I'm so sorry she's gone. What a beautiful soul.
2020-12-17 19:04:34,How terribly sad.  Her time on this planet was certainly meaningful and impactful to so many.
2020-12-17 19:10:08,What a lovely tribute. What a loss.
2020-12-17 18:53:36,Yet another person dead due to the negligence and ignorance of Republicans in relation to their response to the pandemic.

2020-12-17 18:56:01,God bless you Ms. Louie.
2020-12-17 18:58:21,"So sad to see truly worthwhile individuals succumb to this horrible virus while others get million dollar care that was not available to her. 
Our values are reversed."
2020-12-17 19:09:21,"All dogs go to heaven, and there is a canine Hallelujah chorus greeting this wonderful woman wherever she now goes. What a loss for this world and for her son Andrew, thank you for sharing your mother’s life and story with us."
2020-12-17 18:56:51,"Such a terrible loss, such a lovely person."
2020-12-17 19:15:26,"What a beautiful tribute to a beautiful person.

Every article that humanizes someone we lost to covid is so important.

Thank you."
2020-12-17 19:17:38,Valerie Louie was a beautiful person.  Condolences to her family.
2020-12-17 19:23:35,"Thank you, Matt for writing this.
Valarie was well known these here parts for her friendliness and her match making for our best friends. How sad to lose her just when so many of us are wanting fuzzy, four legged friends.

I can attest to how hard Valerie worked; I was a regular at those weekend events where Valarie was fielding questions from everywhere. I would have gone berserk dealing with everyone that needed to talk to her.

We mourned her death on the local nextdoor (those pet adoption events were in our neighborhood). If someone hasn't beaten me to it, I'll get a link to your article to nextdoor."
2020-12-17 19:11:22,Thank you. The loss of Ms. Louie is heartbreaking and will obviously leave a deep hole in many people's hearts. Her devotion to rescuing dogs and people was so extraordinary. My condolences to her family.
2020-12-17 19:12:30,"What a great name, Uncle Mort.
  
Ms. Louie will unite in heaven with all those animals she heroically saved and it will be glorious.
Thank God for Ms. Louie and all people who look out for animals!  
And for their fellow human beings.
There are so many good, good people."
2020-12-17 19:16:19,Sounds a a real gem of a human. Is there a fund raiser for her only child? I would love to pitch in.
2020-12-17 19:23:33,Valerie Louie spent her life alleviating suffering and bringing joy to animals and humans alike. Truly a life well lived. The world is a poorer place without her.
2020-12-17 19:34:51,"Heartbreaking. Having done some work in  animal rescue, I can say it is very demanding as the need never ends due to the pet trade. This beautiful soul did it with a smile and also was a nurse. She paid it forward a thousand fold. RIP Ms. Valerie. May we all try to live like her."
2020-12-17 19:39:35,Thank you for recognizing this tremendous loss.  What an impact this caring woman had on the world.  Condolences to her family.  And to the people and pets she would have gone on to nurture and heal.  What a loss to all of us!
2020-12-17 19:40:22,Thank you for telling us about Valerie Louie and her magnificent legacy. Good luck with Uncle Mort. Prayers for strength and healing for Ms. Louie's son. I'm crying.
2020-12-17 19:41:23,"So sorry for the loss of such a wonderful woman. Something the world desperately needs. Rest In Peace, thank you."
2020-12-17 19:24:39,Valerie Louie....a modern day St Francis....living out the gospel...telling the good news without words. Thank you dear one.  May you rest in God's eternal peace.
2020-12-17 19:32:51,this breaks my heart.
2020-12-17 19:36:51,"What a nice story about a tragic death, if that is possible. It will serve the memory of Ms. Louie well. Dog lovers are in mourning at her passing."
2020-12-17 19:53:34,I have know here for more than 15years. Such a sweet person with a huge heart. Our family will miss her.
2020-12-17 20:01:28,Valerie fostered our beloved Roger. Such a beautiful soul. So devastated to hear this.
2020-12-17 20:15:35,"“I cannot fathom how many dogs she saved, probably thousands,” her son said, echoing a figure estimated by fellow volunteers. She farmed out the canines to families after retrieving them from shelters, including so-called kill shelters in central California where many dogs get bred, adopted and abandoned.""

I know in my heart that a ""rainbow bridge"" has been named in her honor on the other side.

Calling Valerie Louie's death a ""particular Covid-19 cruelty"" is quite profound and so accurate.  I keep asking myself that rhetorical question as to why such generous, beautiful and giving souls such as this amazing woman is taken so early from us, especially from her young son.  

The only sense I can make of this is to try and emulate the love, kindness, and compassion demonstrated by Ms. Louie in our daily lives.  My husband and I have saved many a feline over the years, many of which ended up in our home.  But still now, every year about this time, we see another innocent young one, tossed outside like trash or an ugly lamp, abused and abandoned, expected to make it on his or her own.

We will continue to help save the lives of those four-legged creatures who's only ""crime"" was being born and allowed to be given to a family that did not love or appreciate him or her.

Such a heartbreaking story.  Deep and profound condolences to Andrew Louie and to all who knew, worked and loved her.  May her generous nature continue to flourish through the works of others."
2020-12-17 20:17:29,"Thank you, NYT, for including an obituary for someone who lived a life of service! It is so important to honor people like Ms. Louie, who lead helpful lives that may not cause them to accumulate the piles of resources usually required to get an NYT obit, but who unequivocally led lives of importance. 
May we live in kindness and deserve the legacy this woman left :)"
2020-12-17 20:40:04,Thank you.
2020-12-17 20:30:54,"What a life, full of achievement and dedication to her neighbors, especially man's best friend. Could this be confirmation that ""no good deeds go unpunished""? Let's hope not!"
2020-12-17 20:47:00,What a gift her life was to the dogs she saved and the families who adopted them.  Thank you for this lovely story.
2020-12-17 20:51:17,"A wonderful tribute to a wonderful person who has contributed a great deal. Ms Louie leaves a lasting legacy in the dogs she placed and the joy that has brought to so many.

Here in Australia we are fortunate to have largely brought the pandemic under control - it is very sad to read of the people whose lives have been taken by the virus, but I am grateful the NYT is highlighting these individual losses. No man is an island."
2020-12-17 20:56:24,"If we can show a fraction of the compassion and dedication to helping those (two and four legs!) that need to be helped that Valerie did, the world would be a far better place.  Rest in peace Valerie.  You did well."
2020-12-17 20:57:40,"This story should also be featured in the NYT Obit section as well.  Ms. Valerie Louie may not be well known to many of us two-legged creatures, but she is a legend of life saving measures in the four-legged, canine circles."
2020-12-17 21:01:28,"I have read many COVID-19 obituaries now, but only this one has brought me to tears. That someone so dedicated, caring, and selfless should be taken from us by this virus, and indeed, she is one of many, is devastating. There is no one on earth more deserving of an NY Obit than Ms. Louie. I send my deepest and most heartfelt sympathies to her son."
2020-12-17 21:01:31,"Valerie was a true angel. She rescued and fostered our dear sweet Gilbert back in 2012. We were living in the Bay Area at the time and i'll never forget her description of him while staying in her care, she described him perfectly, as a ""true gentleman."" 

We too are a Rocket Dog family and were absolutely devastated to hear the news. Thank you for sharing her story. She was a beautiful soul."
2020-12-17 21:02:51,"Oh, I just should not have started reading this while at work! I am so so sad. What a beautiful soul she is! Having a rescue dog with some “issues” as well, I am grateful every day for people who do that kind of work. What a beautiful article."
2020-12-17 21:07:00,A lovely tribute to a really lovely person. I only wish an article like this had been written while she was still alive. All the space given to celebrities and political folks while the best among us go unnoticed.
2020-12-17 21:19:39,"How beautiful a person, and how sad a loss.

Thank-you for letting us know Ms Louie."
2020-12-17 21:20:48,"What an incredible person...such a loss. To not know someone at all, but still feel such grief for their passing reminds me just how amazing some people really are. If we might all carry some part of her with us and contribute something in her memory, this troubled world will be a little better."
2020-12-17 21:23:29,I can’t resist a good dog story but this one went above and beyond. While Ms. Louie’s story is tragic and gut wrenching I do not doubt that she has touched and inspired all of us and leaves a lasting legacy. Prayers and well-wishes to her dear son Andrew. Every city needs a Ms. Louie. Thank you for sharing her beautiful life!
2020-12-17 21:23:55,"Story like Ms Louie's tells us the power of love and caring for all creatures around us.

A sad but beautiful story to remind us that life is what we make of it. 

Not what the materials we have."
2020-12-17 21:30:43,Reading this beautiful story brought tears to my eyes and hope to my heart. To know that such people exist renews one’s faith in humanity. Thank you so much for sharing.
2020-12-17 21:33:07,What a life. Sending my condolences to her son and family. She ran an amazing race and may she Rest In Peace.
2020-12-17 20:52:22,"Valerie was a wonderful person. She served on our union Board of Directors and never missed a meeting. She was fully engaged with the members that she represented and was an absolute pleasure to work with. She will be sorely missed.

2020-12-17 20:54:06,"A wonderful article about a wonderful, precious person."
2020-12-17 20:59:01,"In her honour, wear a mask, cut down on all but essential errands, do not gather during the holidays, socially distance at all times and tell others to do the same.  Those that don't, literally have blood on their hands in my view, and are killing these wonderful souls by the hundreds of thousands. Rest in peace Valerie Louie.  I hope your death and this tribute to your life in NYT will convince at least some to take COVID more seriously by masking up and cancelling  get-togethers for the holiday season and by doing so  save others from your fate."
2020-12-17 21:13:10,"Thank you, Valerie!!!! A million times. What a beautiful legacy in the form of these saved dogs and the people whose lives they make better! Peace."
2020-12-17 21:25:58,A tragic loss of a beautiful human being.
2020-12-17 20:57:23,"A bright light has gone out in this world. I'm so saddened by her death, what an incredible, loving legacy she has left behind."
2020-12-17 21:25:43,"This so brought me to tears ... there are angels among us and we often don't recognize them until it's too late.  It breaks my heart that she, who worried about hurting people and animals, had to lose her life to this most horrid virus.  What a truly good and light-giving person she was.  Thank you to Matt Richtel for doing right by her ... and helping remind us that behind the numbers are wonderful people the world has lost."
2020-12-17 21:39:22,"This morning I helped sign caregivers in to get their first Covid vaccination.  Then I sat down to read this story.  TEARS!   I have a old guy rescue, who I love dearly, despite the havoc he brings to my home.  The Valerie's in the world make us all good humans."
2020-12-17 21:40:53,"In the decades I have been involved in animal rescue, I have seen some people in it for all the right reasons and (much more common than you might think) too many who were the opposite. It sounds like the marvelous Ms. Louie was firmly in the first category. It is grueling work, getting dogs pulled from far-flung shelters, getting them vetted, assigning them to foster homes and then placing them in their forevers. Bless her soul forever for doing that.

I currently own a dumped dog from the Central Valley. Someone like Ms. Louie drove down there to get him, so I could have this joy in my life.

Something jumped out at me in the details of Ms. Louie’s illness. Eight days lapsed between her text saying she was “sleeping days away” and the day a friend went to check on her, finding her so unwell that she needed to be hospitalized and intubated. Surely she was checking in with family and friends, daily. Is the progression of the disease so gradual that Ms. Louie, a nurse, did not realize how ill she was? That is terrifying."
2020-12-17 21:55:06,"Thank you to Mr. Richtel for telling us about Valerie Louie so we can put another face to America's great losses in this pandemic. It's heartbreaking.

I've rescued or fostered a handful of dogs over the years and that is almost nothing compared to someone like Valerie's massive and enduring commitment. Her work with animals requires a good understanding of humans as well as of dogs' needs. Thanks to rare people like Valerie I only adopt and recommend shelter or other rescue dogs. I am so upset to hear such a kind and giving soul has died so young, needlessly, in our country which once led the world in scientific medical achievements and yet we do less for US inhabitants' survival than Valerie did for the dogs who add such joy and value to our lives. God bless her and this man who's making sure she is more widely recognized and honored for her selfless charity."
2020-12-17 22:50:05,My heart is breaking for a truly beautiful person.  Another tragic death that didn’t have to happen. May her memory be a blessing. What a tremendous person she was.
2020-12-17 21:09:51,"How sad to lose such a wonderful person. Thanks for all you did for our best friends Valerie, I'll go give my dog a belly rub in your name."
2020-12-17 21:32:11,"As a former dog rescuer, I think this story is tragic. 

Why can't people like Valerie (i.e. first line essential workers) get the same medical treatment that the likes of Donald, Rudy and Chris all received? 

Such a disgrace. Now I have to go fund the Gofundme page for her son."
2020-12-17 21:39:02,Few heroes wear capes.
2020-12-17 21:35:55,Our dog Cricket is from Best Friends shelter in Utah. This breaks my heart. Thank you Valerie for the wonderful life you shared with so many. We are much better for having had you live on the planet. Sorry to your family for their loss. We donate monthly to Best Friends and will give something extra in your memory this year. Bless you
2020-12-17 22:29:46,So many good people are being lost to the virus.  This sadness is something we might never get over.
2020-12-17 22:48:35,"God bless her....no doubt she's in Heaven, because if someone like her isn't no one else deserves to be there...may she rest in peace."
2020-12-17 22:50:12,"Blessed be her name and memory. To her family, remember the light she brought into the world and know I, though a stranger, mourne with you."
2020-12-17 21:57:31,"As I just returned from the vet with my Silver English Lab, Mr. Godfrey, who cracked his toenail and had to be sedated before they could remove the nail, I am absolutely overcome with emotion.

Ms. Louie was a genuinely good soul, and I’m heartened to hear that her son has taken up her charge. I’m sickened and saddened that this woman died unnecessarily from COVID.

Not all people are “dog people,” but those who are know how deeply dogs imprint their claws into our hearts."
2020-12-17 22:54:20,"Ha! The dog in the picture looks just like a terrier my wife and I had 15 years ago, our beloved Joey.
He wasn’t crazy about water either.
People are adopting dogs like crazy during the pandemic.  I hope they all get the care they need in forever homes, not just people who need companionship now.
I know because my wife and I are looking for another dog after our 16 year-old Jack Russell died a few months ago.  Literally every dog we have been interested in has been scooped up by someone else within a couple of days.  It’s a good thing if the adoptions are permanent."
2020-12-17 23:01:51,The article brought tears to my eyes.  My condolences to her son and family.
2020-12-17 23:03:55,Absolutely beautiful tribute.  Hers seems a life well lived and ended tragically too soon.
2020-12-17 23:16:49,What the world needs is  simply more beautiful and kind-hearted people such as she.  Those like Ms. Louie serve to bolster my faith in humanity which has been lacking.  May her son have solace in the knowledge that his mom will be dancing with angels in Heaven.
2020-12-17 23:20:43,What a wonderful human being - may her soul Rest In Peace. The “good boys” and “good girls” she rescued are hopefully living a blessed life!
2020-12-17 23:28:21,"Folks like Ms. Louie imprint our hearts. I am so sad for her son and her family and friends, but what a legacy to leave behind. Having saved so many lives, both two and four legged, the echoes of her giving will be heard for a long, long time."
2020-12-17 23:31:40,"There are hardly any words.  

Ms. Louie’s story is that of a beautiful person in every way.  

Sincerest condolences.  Such a loss."
2020-12-17 23:31:54,"I feel so sad, for her son and the dogs who may not be rescued. What an exemplary life. What a giving person."

2020-12-17 23:22:13,And the Presidential Medal of Freedom goes to...Rush Limbaugh???
2020-12-17 21:28:30,"Another tragic and unnecessary loss!!!  Ms. Louie put so much love and healing into this world, how sad that she was not afforded the same by our pathetic federal government.  I'm sorry for your loss, Louie family."
2020-12-17 20:48:15,This story demonstrates that life is unfair;  the good die young while the evil succeed.
2020-12-17 23:24:25,"She brokered unconditional love.
That’s a special person."
2020-12-17 23:14:33,"When I buy my pet food and supplies, the cash register asks me, ""Do you wish to make a donation for the pets without homes?"" or something to that effect, pet rescue or some other not for profit pet oriented organization. 

I indicate NO.  And I inform the clerk, I adopted two formerly abandoned cats, and they are quite hefty of an expense and job for me.  

For the last fifteen years of my life I have been taking care of abandoned cats where ever I lived.  This time, they are mine. 

And this is due to the laws changing in California.  Now it is lawful for anyone to have an animal as a pet, for emotional support, provided a doctor signs a letter to that effect. 

But I would love to take care of all of the abandoned animals, who need a shelter, love, walks, (cats love walks), good food not just junk food kibble, and water and warmth and again the love of a human. 

I am so so sorry for the untimely death of this hero, Nurse Louie.  Animals have souls, despite what Catholics might state.  She will be surrounded by many friends in her after life place."

2020-12-17 23:46:17,What an incredible woman she was. May she RIP.  Prayers for her son. Does anyone know how to contact the. Go Fund Me?
2020-12-18 00:52:49,"This one hit me particularly hard. I have a soft spot in my heart both for animals and for selfless people who rescue and care for them. Hers and Alex Trebek’s passings are the ones that affected me the most this year. 

My deepest sympathies to Valerie’s family and friends."
2020-12-18 01:16:16,"Heartbreaking loss for her son, animals and humans.  So very sad to read this."
2020-12-18 01:22:34,"What a loss for humanity, Ms. Louie's son, and for the rescue she volunteered for.  What a beautiful woman who made such an great impact on our world.  I am so sorry for her family and friends."
2020-12-18 01:39:14,"Thank you, NYT, for sharing the story of this incredible nurse and mother.  We need more stories like this in the media to give meaning to these numbers.  Our local hospital with its tall buildings always seemed so large to us.  Now its garage is filling with patients because of this terrible pandemic. God bless Ms. Louie, her son and all of the lives she touched."
2020-12-18 02:17:55,Everyday I expect to see her walk through the door with her usual big hello. It’s hard to believe that she is gone. She welcomed me to the Highland ED family 27 years ago and was one of the reasons I stayed. Besides rescuing all the doggies she would also be in charge of the ED adopt a family at Christmas time. She had help but did a lot of the shopping on her own and she would bring her son Andrew into work to help wrap all the presents. She always did a lot for others. I will miss her.
2020-12-18 02:15:23,"Valerie immediately reminded me of a Pittsburgh area RN, whom we lost to a different scourge, cancer. Her charge was to help all of the injured and abandoned animal kingdom in her spare time.  Joann, my sister's friend was also known as Bunny-momma to her  friends. She won one of Pittsburgh's Jefferson service awards. Ms Louie would clearly be a local shoe-in. 
I find that those nurses-they certainly can be like this. God Bless 'em all. 
Zac, our rescue Doberman, and Jasmine, our rescue mutt? would both agree."
2020-12-18 03:25:04,"What a beautiful soul. What a lovely way to commemorate her. My condolences go to her son, who must be heartbroken."
2020-12-18 03:47:23,I am so grateful I read this and I am so very sorry for her son and her friends.  What a beautiful woman and healer.
2020-12-18 04:19:25,"I am glad to have learned about this beautiful woman’s life. I am so sorry that she is no longer here, but the fact that she was here and never lost her passion for caring deeply for people and animals is heartening in these cynical times. My sincere sympathies to Andrew and to all who knew and loved her. Her influence will live on, and the love she brought into the world will not die."
2020-12-18 03:13:15,"This is gut wrenching. Her 21 year old son left alone.  Her amazing work rescuing animals cut short. And her selfless work as a nurse no more.  It burns me to the core that these 300,000 plus people did not have to die.  This is totally at the feet of the Trump Administration.  A more callous, evil and sub-human bunch there never was."
2020-12-18 04:18:05,"This is just heartbreaking. I remember clearly that Sunday in June, 2014 when Valerie was setting up for the Rocket Dog adoption event outside the Stonestown Pet Food Express and asked my husband and I to hold Betty Jane, just while she pulled her car around to unload.

Matchmaker extraordinaire, Betty came home with us that day and made our family complete.

Valerie, you are a hero, a saint, a true living angel… any one of us could only hope to have brought as much love into the world as you have."
2020-12-17 23:04:55,God bless her! My husband is an ER doctor and his heart was broken by this too. We have seen far too much COVID and deaths from COVID which could have been prevented had this administration not made a plan to get as many people infected as possible. This gentle soul shouldn't have been lost
2020-12-17 23:58:03,"There are indeed angels amongst us.  It's not hard to figure out whom the Christmas ""star"" next week will be for."
2020-12-18 01:03:56,"I'm devastated ... Val was so full of life and had such a big heart. I'll always remember her as a 9-year old with pigtails arriving alone at our home on Jackson Street in SF to visit our dog, Spunkie.  Her love and passion for dogs was in her soul as a young child.  She leaves a gaping hole in our family.  My heart goes out Andrew and all of you.

2020-12-17 21:22:05,"Thank you for this beautiful tribute to this remarkable woman. There is a Jewish saying, noted in 'Schindler's List': ""He who saves one life, saves the world entire."" Ms. Louie saved countless lives--the human lives she helped save as a nurse, and the animal lives she saved indirectly by finding loving homes for the damaged souls she rescued. And in saving those animals and matching them to owners--she saved the owners as well. If there truly is a Rainbow Bridge, she no doubt has been greeted with joyous abandon by the many dogs she rescued who have passed. RIP Valerie."
2020-12-17 23:28:44,"Valerie was brimming with warmth and kindness. She truly did have an intuition about matching people with their perfect dog. Though we had our eyes set on a different dog, Valerie showed up to a meet and greet with a dog that she thought we had to meet. She was right. Our Olive has recovered from the horrible life Valerie rescued her from, and she's is the sweetest girl in the whole wide world. The world lost a light when Valerie died."
2020-12-17 23:39:09,"My husband and I share our home with two rescue dogs and a very tolerant cat.  One dog was so badly abused, she will have lifelong issues; the other, despite everything, is a perfect little gentleman.  The easy part is adopting these dogs - giving them forever homes and tons of love.  The hard part is pulling them out of ""kill"" shelters, rescuing them from China or wherever, and then finding the perfect homes for these poor souls whose luck has changed because of people like Valerie Louie. I can't imagine how emotionally difficult it must have been for her.  That takes courage.  We definitely need more people like Valerie in this world.
As if that wasn't enough, her day job was being a nurse.  What an incredible person we have lost to this terrible pandemic.   My sympathy goes out to her son, who lost an amazing, wonderful Mom.

2020-12-17 19:48:32,"These are the people we should be honoring. People who live normal lives, but do extraordinary things with those lives. People who put in work because they love it or feel fulfilled by it, but don't do it for attention. I'm sick of reading about so called famous people. I want to know about ordinary people who should be famous because of how good they are. These are the people who deserve our respect and admiration.

Ms. Louie sounds like an amazing person and I am so terribly sad she is gone from this world. I can only imagine how much more good she would have been able to  do had her life not been cut short by something that shouldn't be as dangerous as it is. If only Americans could be less selfish and actually wear masks and keep a physical distance from one another for a few months, the Ms. Louie might still be here rescuing dogs and people."

But I wonder why she didn't get to the hospital sooner, and before she had to be intubated. The story says her son lives with her and is studying to be a nurse. Couldn't he have persuaded her that she needed medical help rather than suffering at home -- or even just called 911?"
2020-12-18 22:46:07,"This hit the local community hard. I met her through Rocket Dog Rescue, a couple of times. It never occurred to me that she had a job outside of animal rescue.

Much love to her family and friends."

2020-12-17 22:41:47,"Most of the suffering and deaths from Covid 19 are in the older 
demographics, both in long term care facilities and at home, often home alone. I am particularly concerned that the older demographic get their vaccine shots as soon as possible. This is the most important issue before us today, often a matter of life and death."
2020-12-17 22:48:20,"I suspect that this will become the vaccine of choice because it’s more portable and can be easily stored in your local pharmacy.

And the competition with Pfizer will certainly be to everyone’s advantage when it comes to prices. We now just need to wait to see if the few publicized allergic reactions to Pfizer’s vaccine will also happen with this one. But everyone’s allergy situation is different from each other so it may be individualized and therefore not endemic to the vaccines.

Only time will tell."
2020-12-17 22:51:10,"Now that we have, at least at this point in time, two solid performing vaccines, my question is...why doesn't manufacturing ramp up by getting MANY drug companies to start mass producing the vaccine? The formulas, processes, procedures should be shared with any competent drug manufacturer to get two proven vaccines to market. What is now killing us is NOT a bad vaccine, but the lack of mass manufacturing. Yes, we will need to also ramp up distribution systems, but it's a lot easier to find folks to inject than to make the vaccine."
2020-12-17 22:53:57,"Inching closer to normalcy.

Given the choice I would choose Pfizer’s vaccine. Why? Because I do not trust the Operation Warp speed influence on Moderna’s vaccines. 

Also, looking forward to an independent analysis that there are no micro chips in the moderna vaccine. Seriously!"

Shipments to the states are curtailed pending the current administration's greater priorities of fighting to stay in power while a lame duck impetuous POTUS sits with arms crossed denying facts and the inevitable. 

These vaccines need to get distributed across the land at MAXIMUM WARP so that hopefully I'll get my shot in June at best. There are millions of more important folks in front of me who need their 2 vaccines NOW."
2020-12-17 22:55:43,"Given the Expert Panel’s overwhelming endorsement of the Moderna vaccine, and given the FDA’s own endorsement on December 15, the FDA needs to get the EUA completed tonight, so that shipments may start Friday morning. Over 3600 Americans died from Covid on Wednesday. Time to finish up the paperwork immediately so that the important distribution can start tomorrow morning."
2020-12-17 23:11:02,"Surprise, surprise.  

The Pharma captured, 45% pharma-funded and staffed (via the revolving door) FDA ""approved"" (rubber-stamped) the EUA, which ""Contains Nonbinding Recommendations"" on every single page.

The clinical protocol endpoints to be evaluated are the mild cold-like symptoms listed on page 13.

Nothing about preventing an infection as one might naïvely expect.

""Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19: Guidance for Industry""  

<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download</a>

Once you get infected, these vaccines might mitigate mild symptoms.  Of course, 80% of infections are already asymptomatic (you don't know you have it) or have mild symptoms.  

But those are nonbinding recommendations, designed to be ignored, and not required for the billion-dollar rubber-stamp.

Plus Pharma has no liability, which makes it a pharma win-win.

Could the EUA's low bar for approval explain the too good to be true 90% effectiveness rates that has everyone throwing their hats into the air, and no one dares to question?

Isn't it odd that Moderna and Pfizer execs cashed in their stock (cash-outs of 100% and 62%) the day after their big announcements?  Pharma is projected to rake in $14,000,000,000 from these vaccines, so why wouldn't they hold on to make a Real killing?  

Guess we're supposed to get with the program and not question.  That's certainly what the media is doing."
2020-12-17 22:44:36,"Excellent news, keep it coming! Fingers crossed for an approval for the Oxford and Johnson & Johnson vaccines as well in the coming months."

2020-12-17 23:32:55,"Some very welcome good news. 

There is a path through the pandemic but people have to hunker down until the vaccines become widely available."
2020-12-17 23:27:42,"The two vaccines are supposedly very similar structurally. Is Pfizer trying to change its product to make it more like Moderna’s? Why can’t Moderna teach Pfizer how to make theirs so it doesn’t need to be transported and stored at -100 degrees? Why doesn’t the government facilitate that exchange? This isn’t about capitalism. It’s about saving lives and saving the economy. OK, so Moderna gets paid something by somebody for the teaching. 

This whole setup we are in is simply nonsense."
2020-12-17 23:42:29,"The Pfizer vaccine can be called orthodox, whereas Moderna's RNA-based approach can be called novel. Both have been tested. Modern vaccines can be expected to be much safer than the vaccines developed in the 50s and the 60s. Risks of the vaccines must be balanced by the severe risk associated with not taking the vaccine, which is huge given the current US Covid death rate of about 4000. It is exponentially increasing.

The amount of work involved in getting these vaccines out must have been enormous.

The Moderna approach is interesting. If I can be applied to other viruses as well, say CMV or the flu, the benefit would be large. So there is even a glimmer of hope that something good may come out of this terrible pandemic. 

The indication of a possible end to this epidemic, however long the tunnel is, may calm people, may let them come to their senses, and may let them start to behave rationally. Temporary use of common sense, mouth caps, social distance are the way to go: irrational denial is highly dangerous. In the future, this denial will only look silly, comparable to the argument against the first locomotives that they sour the milk of the cows."
2020-12-17 23:45:47,"This is good news, however, the public needs to be cautious on its unknown or known ASE since ""both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech studies reported a small number of cases of a temporary facial paralysis called Bell’s palsy."" I believe at this point people, especially medical doctors, nurses, health care workers, etc. will grasp to that vaccine HOPE no matter what its side effects (short term or long-term or mild-severe). Furthermore, I believe there is still a lot of questions to be answered and to be researched about this vaccine. Wouldn't you agree?"
2020-12-18 00:02:42,"So very glad to see another vaccine approved, especially one that's easier to transport to smaller communities lacking appropriate freezer facilities. However, if all of the mRNA vaccines use polyethylene glycol, I (and others with a documented history of anaphylaxis upon exposure to PEG - assuming PEG is the problem) will be out of luck.

No one knows how common PEG allergy is. It's widely used in cosmetics and medications.  I'm certain I had exposure for much of my life without problem, until the day the day something changed - I applied a hand lotion and nearly died. I had no history of allergies, but a rapidly spreading rash, itching, swelling, and vomiting forced a call to my doctor.  I tried to describe my symptoms, but my lips and tongue were swelling so rapidly I couldn't speak clearly, my daughter took over. My quick-thinking internist called an advanced life support ambulance immediately. Medics were able to set up an IV for life-saving medications /oxygen until we could get to the nearest hospital. 

The New York Times ran an interesting article on this topic in Dr. Sander's ""Diagnosis"" column. 

I hope that PEG allergy is extremely rare. Time will tell. We need vaccines desperately.

2020-12-17 23:48:32,Can we assume that Mark Meadows has already issued the obligatory threat to Stephen Hahn?
2020-12-18 00:33:48,"Prioritizing ""essential workers"" ahead of the elderly and those with risky underlying conditions opens a whole can of worms. Who is ""essential""? Just about every industry thinks their workers are. What about the ""essential"" workers in low risk groups, such as the younger and more robust individuals? Do they get priority over those individuals who are at risk of serious illness or death because of age or condition? It seems that the fairest and least divisive priority should be simply by age group."
2020-12-18 00:48:44,"Re Older Americans need to be prioritized more. As to the CDC subcommittee recommending prioritizing restaurant workers, all restaurants in California are closed due to the crisis.  It hardly makes sense to prioritize a 30 year old furloughed restaurant worker residing at home, over a 60 year old working individual in any industry who is automatically at risk due to her or his age.  Older teachers should have priority, but not teachers under 30 who have a low risk of complications. 

The CDC subcommittee recommendations leave 60 year old Americans unprotected and severely at risk.  Mortality sharply rises at age 60, not 65. Also, I am concerned that a CDC subcommittee is meeting yet again on December 19 and December 20, prior to starting Moderna vaccinations. Health workers, aged care residents, and people over 80 are or should already have been prioritized. That population exceeds available doses anyway. The article makes it sound, unbelievably, that the CDC must still sign off, on the heels of the coming FDA approval, before any Moderna vaccinations can begin. With 3600 casualties yesterday, get going with Moderna vaccinations this weekend.  Each day’s delay, and there have been a number of 1 week and 1 day delays, kills at least 3000 Americans.  Start vaccinations, and the CDC subcommittee can then meet and confer all they want, but get going with the Moderna vaccinations now!!  Moderna is ready. It’s our government officials saying, hang on a minute, just one more thing."
2020-12-18 00:51:33,"@Paul, it is an incredibly complicated and specialised effort. Not every organisation has the right setup and there is absolutely no room for errors. Lives are at stake.

2020-12-18 00:58:27,I know multiple doctors who already had Covid or are in non-emergency positions like dermatology receiving this vaccine. If this is how the government treats a scarce resource I’m reminded of why we don’t let them manage all our healthcare.

No, opioids didn’t make the Sacklers’ Purdue Pharma rich, government regulators were the lynchpin of that Hindenburg.  Enablers to be sure.  And now comes the “holy grail” vaccine in record time."
2020-12-18 00:46:15,"These vaccines should be headed over seas where the healthcare facilities for those who get sick are non existent. Why should a low risk 50 year old in say Pennsylvania get this vaccine, probably by mid march, when their are nations that have not even ordered any vaccine not even for their 80 year olds because of lack of funds. Instead nothing is going over seas form our supply and funds until everyone in the USA who wants the vaccine gets it. So a 50 year old healthy American gets vaccinated before an 80 year old Diabetic in Guatemala .........where is the outrage...particularly when travel restrictions from those nations are in place and interestingly are not being protested. Funny stuff."

Not clear how trials tracked participatants. Some number vaccinated, others given placebo. But how did the control groups go about their daily lives?  Rigorous protocols remain in place so how can we really know if the vaccine works....  before considerable number of people go to restaurants, bars, fly around the world, live as normal. 
Plus are those vaccinated immune but still able to spread Covid? Many more questions remain beyond threshold clear and....
Time will tell."
2020-12-18 01:58:29,"The recommendation seems identical to that for the Pfizer vaccine, except for those between the ages of 16 and 18. Yet, it is based on a much smaller trial (with 30,000 people), while the Pfizer one had 44,000. It would be helpful for the panel and/or the FDA to explain how one can draw similar statistical inferences as to safety and efficacy with a much smaller sample size. Did this trial observe subjects for a longer period of time, for instance? Or did this trial omit more segments of the population (other than those between the ages of 16 and 18) than the Pfizer trial did? Some clarifications to explain this glaring difference would be helpful."
2020-12-18 02:05:30,"Just remember, in all the timelines you’re seeing right now for population-wide vaccination, those predictions are based on only the currently-approved vaccines. With so many talented people working on this problem and getting close to an answer, there will be more entrants, and the vaccination is likely to proceed even faster than initially predicted.

The Trump admin didn’t do a lot right, but they REALLY nailed Operation Warp Speed."
2020-12-18 02:27:20,"From Pfizer: “ This week, we successfully shipped all 2.9 million doses that we were asked to ship by the U.S. Government to the locations specified by them. We have million more doses sitting in our warehouse but , as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses.”

Just when you thought the Trump administration couldn’t screw up the national response to the coronavirus anymore than they already have, comes more proof that they are going to finish where they started. The ultimate clown show, the ultimate not ready for prime time players. In over their heads from start to finish.

What good is any vaccine , if the federal government can’t get them out of the warehouse and into arms."

He still wants to be seen as the best!  Imagine!

Pfizer, on the other hand, advises that there are millions of doses ready to go, in their storage facilities, waiting for orders from the feds to ship. A number of states have received notices that the promised amounts will be reduced by about a third.

Pfizer is puzzled. People keep dying. Azar seems oblivious.

We would never tolerate this when it comes to car-manufactures, so why this when it comes to a different industry that also needs to be regulated? Can the NYT please do some reporting on this in terms of the laws and legislation in this area? I think it’s an important fact that is getting overlooked."
2020-12-18 14:04:14,I may have missed it but I read the story seeking to find out where the Moderna vaccine is manufactured and did not find that bit of information. If efforts were made to vaccinate everyone within the immediate area of the production facilities and then spread out in increasingly widening circles the virus would be eliminated thoroughly region by region instead of the scatter-shot distribution patterns being used currently. As more vaccine is produced more areas could be completed covered and economic activities could resume in those places. This strategy would be particularly effective with vaccines that require extreme refrigeration. Patients could participate in a drive-up system until all of the immediate production has been used. At that point distribution could be made to the next closest locations.

Beyond the co-morbid conditions that seem to contribute to the severity of the illness, there had to be other reasons for some without the described risk factors being devastated by the illness with either a prolonged hospitalization, death or becoming a long hauler. I suspect the viral load is a major factor but with time observational or laboratory studies will identify other mechanisms to explain the coarse set for the illness. The CT is an extremely helpful tool for the first responders to identify those needing emergent care and implementing the extraordinary interventions."
2020-12-30 15:07:43,"I appreciate this clear explication of viral load and testing for coronavirus.  It also makes clear the possibility, depending on the way the lab 'sets' testing levels, to miss some very low level infections.

I declined, out of both an abundance of caution for myself and the knowledge - because of my own attitudes - that we are all getting a little tired of SIP...we all want a little 'fun' with others.  We all want to shed our masks now and then.  
This article compares covid load to HIV - as with HIV, we may all know our friends and intimates, but we don't always know others with whom they have had contact; they may see those connections as 'safe', but we might differ.   Right now, especially in CA, better to err on the 'safe side' than not."
2020-12-30 15:22:12,"Question for medical people:  

Does this mean a higher initial viral exposure likely causes a more severe case of Covid?

Or, is initial exposure less relevant and the way it multiplies in the patient's body what ultimately makes the difference in how severe a case is?

(Wondering if mask-wearing and limiting time indoors - grocery store, for example - would likely help prevent heavy viral load even if exposed, or if the bigger factor is what happens once any of the virus enters a body.)

Thanks for any advice on this!"
2020-12-30 17:16:01,"The overwhelming majority of people who get sick with COVID do not get seriously ill, and can just recover at home, with no need for interventions like measuring the amount of virus in their systems. A whopping 40 percent may not experience any symptoms at all."
2020-12-30 19:02:59,"Why on earth would this information not have been included with tests if its being recorded anyways from the outset? I have been wondering about this, as a non-medical professional, since March 2020. 

Sometimes the omission of a policy is a policy.

This is such a forehead slapper, the story of how this happened at Trump's FDA should be reported on fully, as people were clearly involved."
2020-12-30 19:03:10,"During the initial spread of the HIV pandemic in the 1980s, it was soon discovered that the victims' T-helper lymphocyte count was prognostic. By itself, it was not a diagnostic test but it was predictive of outcome.

I suspect that, like other viral diseases, being infected with a with large dose of SARS-CoV-2 versus a small dose, you have a greater chance of becoming very ill or dying. Masks, distancing, and hand washing almost certainly reduce infection severity even if they do not prevent infection all the time."
2020-12-30 19:51:20,"No test in medicine is perfect - and waiting for the development of a perfect test is unrealistic. The job of clinicians is to assemble all the information together and figure out how the puzzle pieces fit together. PCR has flaws, POCT has flaws, Ct and viral load measurement all have flaws - but assembled together really might have helped diagnosticians and epidemiologists in tough situations in the last ten months. Withholding this information and messaging the public that these tests are imperfect has been unfair and difficult to navigate."
2020-12-30 20:04:15,I was infected with Covid19 in early March.  As a physician I wanted to know the turnaround time for the new tests.  12 days back then and I came back positive with few if any symptoms. In speaking to a friend at CDC he asked if I knew my PCR cycle threshhold number.  I had not heard of that before but called Quest and a medical director was kind enough to get me that number. I repeatedly tested over the next two weeks and watched the CTN rise slowly until it was over 35 at which point my test was reported negative and I developed antibodies.  The cycle threshhold number should absolutely be reported as a possible tool for tracking disease progress. 25 years ago when viral load testing for HIV first started being used as a research tool front line providers were told we could not access it because we did not know how to use it. But researchers were using it for their own patients.   We forced them to make that test available and doctors on the front lines helped to figure out the best ways to incorporate the test into practice.  With CTN we're getting the same tired push back.  Give us the data and we'll figure it out.
2020-12-30 15:50:47,"Ct values are very useful for diagnosis but there are large inter-individual differences in patients’ viral load progression. Some of these are due to genetic differences, while others are affected by co-morbidities and nutritional status:

2020-12-30 19:12:52,"...And a final question. Is the viral load information, the Ct value, in the metadata of tests already taken since the beginning of the pandemic? Has it been there all along?"
2020-12-30 21:07:55,"It's been almost a year since the onset of the virus in the US and the talk is just beginning about measuring the viral load? I'm not a virologist, but, it seems to make sense the more viral particles  you're exposed to the sicker you become.  
Is the viral load ever measured with the flu or other contagious diseases?"
2020-12-30 22:28:04,"Viral load normally progresses along a curve in Covid-19. To best assess viral load it may be necessary to obtain multiple samples. Clearly a very high viral load is worrisome, but a lower viral load may rise to high levels in a few days. A followup result may help determine if the immune system is taking over or being overwhelmed. We have the resources. We should do it. Just don't report a second result as a second case, please."
2020-12-30 23:10:17,"""This is not a change in policy — labs could have reported this information all along, according to two senior F.D.A. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity..""

Why on earth was this information withheld if labs could have
reported on it all along ?"
2020-12-30 17:13:16,"This is valid science. 

Put enough of these data points into a big enough computer can you can come up with a kind of crystal ball.  A 38 yo black male with high blood pressure on d 3 of symptoms with a Ct of x ... has xyz risk of death ... admit this guy. Or a 65 yo female type 2 diabetic on day 10 of symptoms with a Ct of abc ...should be safe to go home.) 

Patients need to know what to expect. A sort of crystal ball, even one that goes to the shop occasionally, is better than nothing."
2020-12-30 16:27:48,"""Fortunately, data on viral load — or at least a rough approximation of it — is readily available, built into results from the P.C.R. tests that most labs use to diagnose a coronavirus infection.""

I found this statement extraordinary given that less than two months ago, MIT's Associate Medical Director, Shawn Ferullo, indicated:

""At this point, Ct [i.e., cycle threshold] value is not included in the test results MIT Medical receives, and we have no way of obtaining that information.""

How can an estimate of the viral in P.C.R. test be ""readily available"" if MIT, a university committed to scientific method, affirmed that it had ""no way of obtaining this information""?

Surely there is no way for each statement to be correct.

2020-12-30 22:49:29,"It's odd that this is being discussed now. Viral load was originally talked about in China, in the context of healthcare workers getting sick and dying. More exposure to covid = more viral load = more severe illnesses."
2020-12-30 21:04:36,"What causes a high viral load? Is it, say, higher if you're in a small space all day with an infectious person as opposed to just getting a whiff of virus while you were at the grocery store for 15 minutes?"
2020-12-30 23:36:44,"This is not surprising but very frightening given that the viral loads detected in the rapidly spreading ""UK strain"" are quite high."
2020-12-31 00:02:01,"I really dislike the Times’ cutesy two-sentence headlines.  In this case, the disconcert emotional impact — by addressing the reader directly with a hypothetical infection— is also misleading as related to the article’s content , and in poor taste.  The pandemic and the science behind it aren’t about me or “you” but about all of us.  A more appropriate headline might read “Viral load may impact course of Covid illness.”  I would still find this incredibly relevant without being condescended to by the headline writer."
2020-12-31 01:54:19,"I remember “viral load” being brought up very early at the start of the pandemic as a determinant of the severity of one’s illness. 

From a laypersons perspective it makes perfect sense."
2020-12-31 02:11:52,"It’s puzzling that viral load is being touted as a “new” idea.  

Dosis sola facit venenum  - “only the dose makes the poison” is a first principle in toxicology (Paracelsus 1500s).  I wondered why viral load was never discussed at all.

Perhaps it has nothing to do with lack of basic knowledge but with the fact that NONE of the Covid 19 tests are FDA approved.  They are all authorized under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and therefore were not required to provide such basic data.

Certainly there was and still is a great need for quick and dirty tests but after almost a year it is a puzzlement that not one marketed test has FDA approval.  I am certain that viral load and other critical factors to develop sound scientific and medical policy would be captured in an FDA approved test.  

My concern with the vaccine is similar.  After listening to the Pfizer EUA sessions on C-SPAN it is clear to me that vaccines will not achieve the outcomes that one would expect from a FDA approved vaccine but a minor blip on the road to eradication. I am not claiming that the EUA vaccines are unnecessary but I have not heard many discussions of their limitations other than broad warnings that mitigation must continue.

The difference between an EUA and FDA approval is enormous.  I hope there are companies that are developing tests and vaccines that can/will meet or exceed the rigorous criteria necessary to gain FDA approval.  Short cut EUAs are not the way to go over the long haul."
2020-12-31 02:53:39,"Where you are infected is important as well. I was one of the first people infected in the US. My main focus was on keeping it out of my lungs. I think that saved my life as while I had respiratory issues and thought I was going to die at one point, it wasn't as bad because I kept it out of my lungs for the most part. I have other respiratory issues which, combined with Covid, gave me the near death experience. But I think one should focus on just keeping it out of the lungs more. For me it started like a head cold. I took overdose levels of neosynephrine, NyQuil, Advil, and Sudafed to keep it from moving into my lungs. All I can say is, it worked for me."
2021-01-05 14:41:45,"Viral loads can be interesting from an academic perspective, but they aren't particularly useful clinically. Knowing how likely a patient is to have a difficult disease course doesn't change anything about how we treat that patient. The only situation where prognosis is taken into consideration is when resources are limited and we are unable to give every patient the care they need. It's entirely possible that viral load could be an objective way to determine who gets the last ventilator and who is given comfort measures."
2021-01-05 14:36:19,"This doesn’t seem to mesh with the reporting on the new variants, which apparently cause you to have more viral particles in your airways but do not seem to cause a more severe course of illness."
2021-01-05 16:00:08,The Ct value is an indication of viral load at the time of the test. A high Ct value could change to a lower Ct value 48 hours later or it could be the complete opposite. The Ct value is useful for clinician treating patients in hospital but it will be hazardous to transmit Ct value to individuals because it will lead to misinterpretation.
2021-01-05 18:38:41,"Generally when equipment and tests are approved for clinical use the machine settings are fixed so that they cannot be changed and the software gives a simple positive/negative result (often data like Ct values are not readily presented by the software in the results, although they do exist and are stored somewhere) This is usually determined based on many experiments and outcomes over time to show the reliability of the assays. The Covid tests were designed and implemented quickly under an ongoing emergency. Diagnostic approved machines were not available and many labs scrambled to use whatever equipment was available often from different companies and using various sources of reagents. Aside from the variability in collecting samples and different time points of a developing case, testing facilities have had to deal with raw data for which specific thresholds are not rigorously established. Thus there can be confusion as to what cutoff threshold to use and what level will result in being contagious. Best to be conservative and report more false positives and isolate, than false negatives and have an increase in viral spread."
2021-01-05 21:25:41,"Glad you are reporting on this. Very important.

I do wonder if some labs are bundling tests to save time and if so, if this will prevent them knowing the viral load.

I worry that when the FD finds that ""clinical labs might report not just whether a person was infected with the coronavirus, but an estimate of how much virus was carried in their body"" this is a far cry from requiring it. It should be required.

How do the rest of us request it? Do even home tests indicate the viral load?"
2021-01-05 23:29:58,"Thank you for this information. 
I believe I had Covid in November. Supposedly a mild case. No test done until two weeks ago and then results were: Covid undetected. 
I might get an antibody test but at this point I'm not sure I'd trust the results if my Covid load was light. 
Hoping to get vaccinated in February. 
I was quite ill, extremely fatigued for ten days. Better for a week then bam, hit with a second wave of illness though not as bad as the first. Second wave affected my lungs. Never did feel ill enough to go to an ER. 
Should have been tested but at the time thought I had the flu. 
Upon reflection, illness behaved like covid. 
Guess I was in denial because I had been careful. Used my inhalers and cold steam 24/7. Now I realize nothing would have helped had Covid taken me down."
2020-12-31 14:11:44,"With some 17 genes varying but the fast replication rate of a virus, what is the probability of this same variant arising separately in two different locations?"
2020-12-31 14:27:28,It is premature to label a cluster of viral mutations (at the nucleotide level) as a “more contagious variant” without experimental evidence of viral infectivity/replication/shedding in humans or within appropriate models. Most often such clusters of mutations are merely nucleotide signatures on a specific viral variant that gets propagated through hosts (in this case humans) by happenstance. Increased PCR-hits of a certain nucleotide signature in a population alone cannot be considered as experimental evidence of increased infectivity.
2020-12-31 14:35:07,My guess is that you have trillions of viruses and eventually they will mutate to this new variant.  I think with the numbers we're talking about it doesn't need to travel from any place. It just happens as a matter of course in the life of viruses.  It's natures evolving trend.
2020-12-31 14:35:48,"As a physician who has been practicing for 30 years in  public sector medicine I find it somewhat irresponsible to be spreading news with tiles ""scientists alarmed"" at virus variant. I have treated numerous persons with covid 19, had it myself and take this virus very seriously, it can kill. That said, we still have no clarity on whether this variant  is more dangerous or lethal than the previous covid 19 we have been dealing with for almost a year.
Does it spread faster. how much faster and what does that actually mean? 
Yes, let's continue to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible,. Let's continue mask wearing and social distancing, but please spare us the data less headlines to scare unnecessarily  an already impacted world population."
2020-12-31 14:16:01,"COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is  neither benign nor malign.

COVID-19 is merely acting according to it's RNA genomic evolutionary fit nature to  be fruitful and multiply.

COVID-19 currently knows far more about our DNA genetic evolutionary fit African primate ape aka person nature than we do about it.

People are driven by their nature to crave fat, salt, sugar, habitat, water, kin and sex by any means necessary including conflict and cooperation.

COVID-19 has thrived and been welcomed into America by Donald Trump and his white European American Judeo-Christian Republican Party GOP voting majority base surrendering to COVID-19.

Because in America corporations are people and money is speech.

And all white lives matter much more than any COVID-19 black infected and dead Black life."
2020-12-31 14:48:37,Why do we only use our military to kill in useless wars? Why don’t we use their logistics capabilities to distribute and vaccinate the masses.
2020-12-31 14:58:23,"One thing that is not being discussed is whether the new variant may be less dangerous. I have read that in general, the more transmissible a virus, the less lethal it is. If this virus variant could be less lethal, shouldn't we let this overtake the other more lethal variants."
2020-12-31 15:15:33,"I’ve been on board with the science and data from the beginning, and I genuinely trust our public health officials. That said, I am lost on this new variant. I just find it incredibly coincidental to have two vaccines approved and then a variant starts making headlines that researchers have said was identified in September and maybe earlier? It just seems like a ploy to get Americans to continue practical measures until we have enough shots in arms. That is admirable objective, but we need to be honest with the American people, and it just seems like there is no public health consensus about what this is, and what it actually means. Also, it’s completely a self fulfilling prophecy at this point. If it’s in small town Colorado, it’s everywhere by now."
2020-12-31 15:18:53,"Does this new mutation really change anything? We still should be wearing masks and social distancing so why the new concern?  Apparently the existing tests work in detecting it and so far it seems that the treatments and vaccines work against this new strain. We are already in a pandemic that is still spreading, so if we are not doing anything different for this mutation I suggest the media not make such a big deal about it as some people are starting to needlessly panic."
2020-12-31 15:19:04,"This strain came across an ocean. It didn't swim.
The original strains came a across the ocean. They didn't swim.

This entire thing was preventable in the USA, and the Left has been protesting to stop this for forty years, while Conservatives and Centrists called them extreme. 

Regulation of airlines that required them to track new viruses and keep thm off of airplanes, combined with a government that shared intelligence about new viruses, could have kept this virus out of the USA. 
The argument against these regulations was that it would weaken the economy. But the effect of NOT regulating has crushed the economy, plus permanently removed the productivity of 330,000 Americans from the economy.

Article I of the Constitution says to Regulate because regulation is NECESSARY to free markets, not an impediment. Are there bad regulations? Are there regulations that can be improved? Of course, but that is not what Conservatives demand. Conservatives keep trying to end all regulation, EXCEPT the bad regulations that are used by global corporations to crush their small competitors. Small business and small farms keep supporting the party of bad regulations designed by lobbyists from global corporations to put them out of business.

Meanwhile, tax cuts, slashing investment in Americans, and deregulation LOWERED Avg GDP Growth 1/3 compared to 1950-1980.

Covid was not inevitable. Covid was brought to the USA by Conservatives with the help of Centrists who called the Left extreme."
2020-12-31 15:22:42,How much testing has been done for this new variant? Curious if it might be contributing to the large rise in US cases that started in November.

A guard unit was dispatched to help with care at an Elbert County nursing home. The first identified guard member is now isolating at his or her home in Arapahoe County, outside Denver and not far from our international airport. In all likelihood, that's how the variant got here."
2020-12-31 15:35:29,"To call the recent discovery of the virus its ""arrival"" here seems to me ingenuous. I read that the UK does more genetic typing than is done in the US.

2020-12-31 15:43:48,"While there has been a great deal of news about a more contagious variant of Covid, I have yet to read a definitive explanation of why it is ""more"" contagious, in what ways,  and how that as been determined.  I read that the same precautions should be taken ( social distancing, masks , hand washing) but it is not clear if those precautions will be adequate in the face of the new strain. What additional precautions can be taken to protect oneself and one's family?
Failure to provide more definitive information will not only make people more vulnerable and cause panic, but will feed the anti mask virus deniers with more suspicion. We need all of the facts on the table."
2020-12-31 15:51:06,"Maybe it's time to get serious about this virus. A vaccine is on the horizon, yet a million people a day are flying. I live in Colorado, our governor wants to open up the state some more, so we can infect each other a little easier. It's as if we can't just take a 2 month vacation and open up in the spring. Not socializing at bars and restaurants and schools won't kill us, but opening up too early might well."
2020-12-31 15:53:11,Not really a surprise since travel was continuing while this new strain was percolating. I guess it is around the world now as well. What is even more disturbing to me is how little of an understanding we still have about the Coronavirus in general. How long will a vaccine last and what about the after affects for people with health problems after they have had the virus initially? Can you be reinfected? Mainly my hope for the New Year is that these new vaccines are delivered quickly and efficiently.

If the amount of masking and social distancing we were doing weren't enough before, they will be pitifully inadequate going forward. 

I'm still waiting to hear if fomites are back. (Fomites is what they call the virus that spreads by contact with surfaces). Is it time to start spraying my groceries with alcohol again?

2020-12-31 15:32:07,"Wouldn’t be much more productive for the medical and health “science” establishment to devote its time, resources and energy to actually getting willing folks vaccinated, rather than chasing its tail looking for yet another virus variant? Of course there are mutations, that’s what viruses do. This isn’t really news. The failure to mount an effective vaccination program, with lots of time to have anticipated the need, now that is newsworthy!"
2020-12-31 14:59:33,As this varient is more contagious more stringent protocols should be put in place. Since mask wearing is so abhorent to nearly half the population porta potty isolation should be mandated for anyone who has come in contact with an infected individual until the incubation period has passed.
2020-12-31 15:13:26,"If someone has already had Covid-19, can they get sick again from the variant?"
2020-12-31 16:01:30,"RNA virus's vary in their ability to survive outside their hosts. Measles, for example, can infect after several hours in the air or on surfaces.
RNA virus mutate rapidly and it is likely that the new variant has overtaken  its earlier brothers by surviving longer outside the host. Therefore it remains important to mask, and even more important to socially distant, avoid crowds especially indoors, and where crowds have been and wash hands and use sanitizers etc."
2020-12-31 16:13:34,"It would be better not to mince words about this new strain of the virus. It is more deadly.

The degree of contagiousness is an inseparable part of what makes a virus deadly. If the original strain of Covid-19 were minimally contagious, there would have been a few deaths in Wuhan and it would have ended there. 

The article itself implicitly acknowledges the reality: after saying that the new variant ""is not thought to be more deadly than other versions of the virus"" the article later states ""...it will bring not just an increase in the number of cases, but also of hospitalizations and deaths."" 

Since when does increased deaths not equal more deadly?

If policy makers and media want the public to trust them, they have to earn that with with truthfulness. 

The early coverage of masks, saying there was no evidence that they offered protection, was little other than spin intended to protect supplies for hospitals. When masks supplies increased the tune changed, but many continued to march the original one - at great expense in lives.

This strain of Covid-19 is more deadly, and it would be good for all of us to understand that, rather than sedated with what is, substantially speaking, misinformation."
2020-12-31 16:18:05,"It is hard for me to think about waiting three more weeks until the Biden administration takes over before we can get serious about vaccination.  Trump's people should have been thinking about PPE, syringes and vaccination logistics for months.  They were fond of telling us all about the research they were funding to develop a vaccine.  Did they think that was ""Mission Accomplished""?   Right now, we should be vaccinating every one of our National Guards and every one of our military academy students.  They should be trained in how to vaccinate people.  They should be sent across the country in small teams of 5 or so with a nurse to supervise both them and the post vaccine observation area.  They should be setting up vaccination stations in closed theaters, sports stadiums, the garden centers of big box stores and closed malls.  We should enlist nursing students, medical students, pharmacy students, veterinary students, respiratory therapy students, x-ray tech students, physical therapy students to join this effort.  We must think fast, big and differently if we are to prevail in this battle in a timely fashion.  But we have to get moving!"
2020-12-31 15:27:46,This reinforces my belief that Darwin quite possibly came up with the most important discovery in science. All life changes and always will in an attempt to survive. Sometimes those efforts work and sometimes those efforts are useless.

2020-12-31 16:55:05,Why are we still traveling?? Stop planes coming in from England. End border crossings. Give our country a chance to get the vaccine and heal. Not surprised at all that this has happened whether the person travelled or not. Others have brought it here.
2020-12-31 20:41:33,"While I appreciate this reporting and I think may be it should be known to all.

But I really think - that much of Wuhan reporting including many of Faucci pronouncements - have proven to be way premature.

And in many cases to paraphrase Twain - way way over exaggerated.

We are just starting to administer vaccines and in less than a few months, we would know if they have had any effect on curbing the spread towards the so called herd immunity.

In the mean time, masks, distancing (I think social distancing is an oxymoron) and generally keeping clean and healthy - and then hope for the best -  will keep Wuhan away.

I am sorry but the rest is simple gossip or as WW II poster said ""loose lips sink ships."""
2020-12-31 23:37:31,"This whole episode has been the offspring of an unnecessary trade war. 

An event spawned by an ignoramus-in-chief who considers himself a genius but has a disability of seeing things from a global perspective."
2020-12-31 17:53:48,"I find this article to be incredibly irresponsible.  We do know there is (are) a variant(s) - that's been expected all along.  Viruses mutate.

We have no idea if it's more virulent, but research to this point suggests not.  The vaccines developed by Pfizer and Maderno were developed against the spikes that drive rapid infection in some and make it highly contagious.  The mutations are highly unlikely to remove the most novel aspect of this virus, based on decades of science in virology.

For epidemiologists or any scientist to forecast gloom and doom at this point is an outrage!  But for the times to engage in panic, as it's done for some time, depending on the narrative they chose to sell, is even worse.

Get the vaccine when you can, wash your hands and avoid touching items that are frequently touched by the public.  Wear a mask, correctly, for extra protection.  Try to think positive, even in light of this article.  But please, do not point to how well other countries are doing - especially China.  Other countries are not using the 'probable Covid19' in their data, and China can never be believed."
2020-12-31 20:10:53,"Congratulations, everywhere is now NYC circa April.

All because a percentage of the population could not keep their own ""feelings"" to themselves."
2020-12-31 19:10:48,"Alas, the fine people of Simla, Colorado demonstrate for us that they are intellectually outmatched by a virus.

The virus values its survival above all else.  Americans, not so much.

The virus, when faced with an existential threat, adapts and evolves as quickly as possible. Americans, OTOH, demonstrate their God-given Constitutionally-guaranteed right to refuse to adapt, because it infringes on their rights to....  Rights to *what* exactly?  Rights to refuse to wear a mask because...  Why?

When an observable fraction of the population is dumber than a virus, then we are truly doomed."
2020-12-31 19:47:04,The antibody tests performed by Red Cross from the drew blood uncovered the CONVID19 had been in circulation many months(as early as Oct 2019) before the first reported case in Feb 2020 when the virus already widely transmitted on both coasts.  The US has been slowing in response to viral spread all through the year and it is no surprise they are dimwitted on this new covid strain.  Ignorance is bliss but it can also kill in an epidemic.
2020-12-31 23:03:16,"If the variant is not more deadly, yet infects more people then
logically an analogy to consider: If a gunman shoots several people in a crowd he is deadly, if he is able to shoot more of them then he is deadlier."
2021-01-01 00:19:15,"“It was really early speculation and caused a lot of distress. There is no evidence to suggest this new variant was more common among certain age groups.” Dr. Cevik 
Isn’t it that way with the early speculation that this is more contagious? We have no hard data to say that. Only that this is the strain that people are catching. Correlation vs causation argument here."
2021-01-01 01:38:10,The fear mongering continues to steal more of your freedoms. We are losing our freedoms for a virus with a 99% survival rate.

Think this:
1. All the non-believers
2. All the non-maskers
3. All the Trump backers
4. All those who traveled over the various holidays
5. All the Sports teams

Too bad the 5 categories of people above can't be separated and sent on a one way trip to Alcatraz and let the rest of us Live.

The U.S. is in a world of hurt. Our ICUs are already filled. Wake up.

Can we just let Trump stay in Florida? And put Biden in charge tomorrow.

Operation warp speed was of no value if nothing was put in place to actually administer the shots. Everything should have been stock piled (syringes, vials, etc.) and strategically put throughout the U.S. months ago. Trained personnel. But what else is new with this president and his lack of forethought?

Years ago, I was in charge of seeing that flu shots at 6 dozen sites (approximately 2000 people) were administered in early fall. I would start to acquire the supplies, personnel, and schedule in early spring. In Israel they planned with precision and already have 10% of their population vaccinated. 

My friends in other countries said the U.S. was once admired. The key word ""once""."

But these people keep electing the likes of McConnell and Paul.  And in the end all of us pay the price of their ignorance."
2020-12-28 21:42:19,"Kentuckians voted for their Senate and House representation in legal and valid elections. 

Now they have to suffer the consequences.  

It’s sad, it’s unfortunate, it’s confounding.  But that’s the way it is."

2020-12-28 21:43:40,"Why, then, did Kentucky voters re-elect McConnell and Paul? Perhaps both of these Republican senators should have their campaigns investigated."
2020-12-28 21:45:24,"Once. a not-so-great man said, ""It is, what it is"". Kentucky had choices, they now have to accept the consequences of their decisions."
2020-12-28 21:46:11,The people of Kentucky wanted this.  They enjoy the challenge of trying to make it without help. They re-elected both McConnell and Paul.
2020-12-28 21:46:29,I truly feel sad for these people. But I would be willing to bet that the areas mentioned in this story voted overwhelmingly for Trump and McConnell; and will do so for Paul when he runs again.  I’m sure they blame their economic troubles on “socialists”
2020-12-28 21:48:00,"Conservatives simply find it anathema to provide public handouts.  Anything that even hints at Socialism borders on heresy.  McConnell and Paul are shaped by that mold.  

I guess the trade off of ""Liberty"" and no Fed or State aid as against, what, filling out some forms and getting aid is acceptable to McConnell, who, I suppose is well off by now.  With his Fed pension and retirement system and Social; all the Socialist stuff decried so passionately by those who benefit from it."
2020-12-28 21:50:22,And yet they re-elected McConnell and Trump by an overwhelming majority. How does this make any sense to them?
2020-12-28 21:52:20,"Why Kentucky needs McConnell. Here it is: 

""What explains the stubborn reliance on federal largesse by McConnell’s home state?
We speak of Kentucky, where in a recent fiscal year, 39.5% of the state’s overall budget came from Washington, making it the fourth most DC-dependent state in the nation. By another measure, Kentucky is the nation’s second most federally dependent state.
Kentucky, which, despite having 3.8 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents, collected $1.7 billion from D.C. in the massive new virus-focused stimulus, which works out to $377 per resident. New York, with a per capita death rate 20 times that, got roughly the same amount per resident."""
2020-12-28 21:53:42,"Shortly before the election, I saw a huge Trump sign in a field right next to another large sign that said, “Tired of the mess. Vote Republican.”  Too many of the good people of Kentucky seem to have fallen victim to the same lack of logic and continue to vote for the people who have actually caused the mess in our country.  Defeating Mitch McConnell would have been a good start to a return to government that might actually help ordinary Americans."
2020-12-28 21:41:21,Who cares?! They consistently vote against their best interest. Bye!
2020-12-28 21:45:05,"It’s hard to feel sorry for them , somehow they got the the government they voted for ....
Realistically these people are victims of a substandard education system, victims of media illiteracy, victims of failure to understand how their representatives do not have their best interest at heart...."
2020-12-28 21:48:01,Kentuckians suffer from Stockholm Syndrome - they have learned to love their captors Mitch and Paul despite all the abuse they hand out to them but they are oh so grateful.
2020-12-28 21:43:43,My parents took me out of Kentucky 84 years ago. Thank God.
2020-12-28 21:46:25,"Republican voters always vote against their own self interest, from hating Obamacare to supporting right to work legislation. They never learn, and now they will pay the price."
2020-12-28 21:46:28,"Ummm, who voted for Mitch McConnell?  Cue me completely unsympathetic to anyone who did, not matter how badly off they are."
2020-12-28 21:53:35,"Sounds awful. So why do they keep voting for these guys?

Textbook case of how skillful the Republicans are at convincing the poor to vote against their own economic interests."
2020-12-28 21:55:32,Kentuckians knew who they were voting for. Now they are reaping the benefits. What are they complaining about?
2020-12-28 21:58:32,"I guess that I'll always be gobsmacked by the excellent job that Republicans do by brainwashing poor folk to protect the financial interests of the exceedingly wealthy at any cost.  

As a (now registered) Democrat, I've been accused of not having a job and wanting ""free stuff"" when in fact it's my tax dollars paid to feds and my wealthy Blue State that supports these folk in states such as Kentucky."
2020-12-28 21:59:17,"Republican senator, Rand Paul, was one of just six to vote against the package in the Senate, on the grounds that it amounted to handing out “free money.” 

The money is not free and it doesn’t belong to Paul. It’s taxpayers’ money but Paul talks about it as if it were his only. Paul, a supreme hypocrite, has never had a problem with giving “free money” to corporations and the wealthy. Rand voted along with all the Republicans to give “free money” in the amount of $281 Million every year for 7 years from 2021-2028 to coal industry executives, (not workers.)

It’s hard to understand how Republicans like Rand (and all the rest) can sleep at night."
2020-12-28 21:59:38,"I’m sorry, but I don’t have an ounce of sympathy for Kentuckians. McConnell easily won re-election. They made their choice, and choices have consequences."
2020-12-28 22:00:01,"If my neighbor has a nicer car than me, and I decline to take it, I am arguably ""voting against my best interests"".  Voting to take something (tax dollars) that belongs to someone else, is theft, not  enlightened self interest.  Many (actually most) people would rather stay poor and honest, rather than helping themselves to another's property by means of the ballot box."
2020-12-28 22:05:14,"“Why do Republicans keep voting against their own self interests?” Good question though not a situation unique to Republicans. How many people with six figure incomes keep voting for Democrats even though it will mean high taxes for them? (Disclaimer: I’m one of them) Reality is people routinely do things which are not in their best self interests. 

As for why Kentuckians keep voting for Rand and Mitch, that’s easy: pride. They love the fact that their little state has two of the most powerful men in US politics. These two routinely thwart the best laid plans of politicians from bigger, wealthier states and their voters love them for it."
2020-12-28 22:06:56,"I think Ms. Hardwick is having trouble separating ""the government"" from the policy choices and spending decisions made by her elected officials. ""“I didn’t trust the government that much before because we know they keep things from us, but now it’s almost like the government is evil,”  The government is doing what it can, but what it can do it limited by the voting decisions made by her elected representatives and how they have limited what all the other elected representatives can choose to vote on."
2020-12-28 22:07:39,"I am just confused as to why folks that need so much help and support would go out and vote for and re-elect people who would deny them that very sustenance. McConnell and Rand Paul are not new in politics or not unknown as to their stances on Govt support. Rand Paul has especially been a vocal critic of any government assistance, yet the electorate go and enthusiastically vote for them and then complain about lack of any govt support in times of need."
2020-12-28 22:07:46,"If Kentuckians want the federal government to take action to help them, why do they keep electing extremists like Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul to represent them, when a list including not using government funds to help people to the greatest extent possible, except when channeled specifically to the rich or business interests, and self-preservation comprises a full inventory of their principles.  If people like Ms. Hardwick want the federal government to work for them, they need to get their current senators out, and stop electing libertarian or ultra-conservative senators that will never give them this sort of assistance willingly.  The rest of the country would also be much obliged should Kentucky get rid of those two clowns as well, as they continue to obstruct proposals that would benefit those outside of their state as well."
2020-12-28 22:08:16,"They voted for Trump, McConnell and Rand Paul. In return Kentuckians got a partial wall between the USA and Mexico, a giant step towards corporate oligarchy, tax cuts for the very wealthy and complete alienation from all of our allies all over the world. Is this not what they voted for? Maybe read a newspaper or two before you vote next time..."
2020-12-28 22:08:51,"It is unfortunate that creatures like Trump and McConnell know how to spin a story, they know how to speak in a format that conceals what is true and what is fantasy.  For many, they saw someone who had a higher hierarchy, one that could bring bragging rights to their state, after all, he was the Speaker of the House, what they failed to see, was his need for power and visibility of prominence, at no time, through not only the last four years but for the majority of his time in the Senate, has he ever done what was right for Kentucky, why would he, he had wealth, power and naivety on his side, for every challenge the normal Kentuckian endured, he was shielded, he had wealth mostly thru his second wife, whose Chinese family is privileged in status and fortune, he received the COVID vaccine, to prove it's safety? for his constituents or really to make certain that if he had to encounter, shake hands with the public, he would be immune. So now, barring medical issues, the State of Kentucky is once again finding itself under the thumb of a selfish leader and knowing that if he must leave before his term is ended, the state governor will most likely put a McConnell carbon-copy in his seat. For Kentucky, this will be an extremely Long and Challenging four years but that should have been expected though it won't take away the harm and pain."
2020-12-28 22:10:11,"Mrs Hardwick, and others like her need to realize that when you elect people who do not want to defund and dismantle the government, it will not work.  Thus, if they could manage to turn away from the propaganda they are bombarded with on a constant basis thanks to Facebook, Fox, Newsmax, and the like, they might actually learn something and can work to elect representatives who will create a government that work with them, not against them."
2020-12-28 22:12:10,"I was hoping to gain some insight from this article why the majority of Kentucky residents continue to vote for Mitch McConnell and others who work against their interests. But, no."
2020-12-28 22:17:10,"A note to the poor around the country and for those suffering in Kentucky. Vote out the Republicans including Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell at the next election. The Republicans are not working for you, they are not working to improve your state or the conditions and opportunities for your children. The Republicans can stand and support Donald Trump only because they are cut from the same cloth. You, the citizens, do not matter to them. There only goal is aggregating self-wealth. Until the people of Kentucky can acknowledge this fundamental, underlying  truth, they will continue to suffer. At some point, they have to realize that the Republican Party wants people to pull them selves up by their own bootstraps. This means they must drag themselves to the voting booth and vote in their own self interest; voting against those pretenders who abuse the impoverished population for their own benefit.  This a really a very simple concept."
2020-12-28 22:17:36,"Yet they keep voting for Senators and members of Congress that continually only deliver what is good for big businesses, ignoring the needs of most. Until that changes nothing will change."
2020-12-28 22:20:01,"And Kentucky is ranked #2 in states that receive more than they provide to Washington (behind only NM).  And still Kentucky's municipalities need a financial shot in the arm.  One has to wonder how Mitch McConnell can be so callous toward municipal finance.  Municipalities employ lots of people and provide essential services like police, fire, schools, ad roads.  I guess it's just that none of the super rich work for municipalities.  With Mitch - it's all about serving those who already have money, not particularly those who need it.  Congressional term limits area very good idea."
2020-12-28 22:21:30,"Frankly, I have no sympathy for any of these people; they are getting what they voted for. McConnell is the sole reason that COVID relief legislation hasn't passed earlier, and voters in Kentucky turned right around and sent him back to Washington anyway."
2020-12-28 22:22:16,"""She said she had been skeptical of the federal government even before the pandemic. This year’s events have solidified that sentiment, she said, proving to her that people in Washington are incapable or unwilling to help those they represent.

“I didn’t trust the government that much before because we know they keep things from us, but now it’s almost like the government is evil,” Ms. Hardwick said. “It’s really driven it home that I was right to not fully trust them — never, never, never.”""

2020-12-28 22:11:33,"Well, Kentuckians, are you pleased with your choice of Senate representation?  Will you continue to vote against your own best interests?  Time will tell, won't it.  Good luck."
2020-12-28 21:56:23,"It’s important to remember that not every Kentuckian voted to re-elect Mitch McConnell. 

McConnell was re-elected with 1,233,00 votes to McGrath’s 816,000 votes. 

We suffer here from the urban-rural divide just as many other states do who also elect undeserving and truly embarrassing candidates. See: Texas, Wisconsin, Tennessee. We also suffer from low-information anti-choice voters who think voting for a Democrat means voting for a “baby killer.”

McConnell has masterfully convinced wide swaths of his adopted state that he’s fighting for them in Washington. He’s vile and conniving but he’s successful."

(And, by the way, you will never hear a Christian fundamentalist preacher address gun violence or domestic violence— but I digress.) It’s because Republican politicians demonize proponents of health and environmental standards that otherwise would curb pollution abuses and workplace hazards. It’s because too many people are mentally lazy and prefer to absorb simplistic slogans like “Coal keeps the lights on” pasted on giant billboards, rather than dig a little deeper into issues such as the explosion of deadly black lung disease and its connection to mountain top removal. Whatever “news” the good citizens of Kentucky get is predominantly via right-wing talk radio. And the local school boards make sure that science and history textbooks have nothing that might call into question the Christian fundamentalists’ version of truth.

Abortion is wrong and abstinance only is right so rich people can pay for their secret ""family planning"" while asking poor women to make choices with no institutional support because, religion, passing on poverty to a new generation. Hold onto your coal jobs so we can keep taking outrageous salaries and then cut and run with severance when things go south.

2020-12-28 23:15:55,"I can't decide if Kentucky voters are (a) getting what they deserve or (b) deserving what they get.

2020-12-28 23:20:50,"The genius of the Republicans party is that they have convinced their base that they are not worthy of any help and assistance whatsoever from the government. And the base gladly accepts that message and keeps voting the likes of McConnell back in even though polling shows his policies are unpopular and he is personally unpopular and disliked. 
That they vote for McConnell and others like him in spite of dislike for them and their policies is merely a reflection of how many of these voters feel about themselves."
2020-12-28 23:21:52,"Kentuckians, like all southern state inhabitants, use much of their money to tithe  their churches and spend more time praying than reading anything helpful.

It's their choice so let them change or live with it."
2020-12-28 23:23:15,From Australia this looks like a prime example of people ideologically voting against their own better interests...it has always stunned me that a state such as Kentucky with such poverty would continue to vote for the Palpatine of the senate.
2020-12-28 23:23:20,"I cannot, for the life of me, understand how McConnell and Paul get elected.  Do Kentuckians like being snookered?

2020-12-28 23:25:12,"It puzzling and sad that majority of Kentucky voters and other southern states continue to vote fro Republicans like McConnell and Paul who do not represent the economic interests of these voters. They either helping their wealthy backers or use slogans such ""free money"" to mislead the middle class and poor people. Until people wake up and consider their economic interests are more important than slogans and cultures wars Kentucky and other states  like Kentucky will have senators like McConnell and Paul misrepresenting them in Washington DC."

2020-12-28 23:31:52,"Not that I agree with them, but many Kentuckians won’t blame Mitch McConnel or Rand Paul for the state’s economic problems; they’ll blame Andy Beshear, because of his closing of indoor dining and other unpopular steps he may have taken due to the pandemic. When he comes up for re-election, they’ll replace him with a Republican made from the same mold as McConnel or Paul.
As outsiders to the state, many of us will scratch our heads and wonder why. But it’s wrong to be condescending. It’s Kentuckians’ right to make choices for their state and their responsibility to bear the consequences of those choices."
2020-12-28 23:32:03,"“There’s sort of a disconnect between people that go to Washington and the people they represent in very small communities, especially rural areas” Actually, the disconnect is between the interests of the voters and the people they choose, bizarrely, to vote for. People in red states seem to have a strange predilection for voting for the candidates whose politics are most antithetical to what they need. Frankly, I just don't get it. The two counties mentioned in the article where the state is by far the largest employer, employing 2/3 of workers in one county(!) are probably full of people who routinely vote for politicians who promise to reduce the size of the government and reduce government spending, and then act confused when they don't have jobs.  Federal and state legislators don't just magically appear in their jobs, people vote for them, and if their actions have destructive effects on their constituents it's only the fault of the people who elected them.l"
2020-12-28 23:34:17,"Neither McConnell nor Paul give a rip about Kentucky and her citizens.  What I don't get is after 36 years of depression, why their Senators have done NOTHING to help the State.  To the contrary, they have made life worse, yet they are re-elected.  WHY?"

We mostly distributed food, toiletries, and books. I still recall the shock of seeing a level of poverty I'd never experienced or personally known. Unfortunately, little has changed for this state and others like it because voters are mired in being ""Big Red Republicans"" regardless of the impact on the citizens' lives.

What is described in this article is a classic example of those who refuse to vote in their own best interest. Kentucky has historically been a poor state, containing some of the highest poverty areas in the country. 

I am astounded each and every time the citizens of Kentucky return McConnell and Paul to the Senate.  It is obvious they have done very little to improve the plight of the citizens they purport to represent. I guess Kentuckians really like that ""Big Red Republican"" label no matter how much self-harm it causes."
2020-12-28 23:38:38,It's difficult to feel much sympathy here. McConnell has put party before country for 35 years. And it's now clear he will put party before Kentucky by trying to limit Biden's efforts to help America's working class. Yet Kentuckians keep electing Mitch. And Rand Paul is cut from the same cloth and they continue to elect him as well. At some point the average Kentucky voter needs to realize that Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul don't care about them.
2020-12-28 23:39:01,"My father and grandmother left KY when my father was relatively young to move to OH. It was a state that was hard on its people then and it is still such a state. I hope that getting back at liberals is worth it to the people who are supporting McConnell and Paul. They have the means to make their government work for them but they are much more concerned about making sure that black people don't ""get ahead"" of them that they won't use them."
2020-12-28 23:39:03,"Why then do Kentuckians elect and re-elect Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul?  They are voting against their own interests when they elect them back in office.  McConnell doesn't care about the average American much less the average Kentuckian.  Rand Paul lives in his own bizarre world.  

Kentucky is one of the states that benefits mightily from the tax dollars New York and California pay.  And yet people in Kentucky and other poor states refuse to acknowledge that preferring to pretend that they produce the money they need.  They don't want big government and they don't want government interfering in their lives yet they depend heavily on federal subsidies to keep the state afloat.  

Don't keep on voting for the McConnells and Pauls who say what sounds good but never produce.  If you want more freedom vote for politicians who will look for solutions to problems instead of ignoring them or saying that that's the way it is.  But don't complain when the people you keep on electing do nothing for you crisis after crisis."

And this same scenario can be seen all over the country. But apparently big bad coastal libs are too mean to salt-of-the-earth Heartlanders, so they continually vote to make their lives materially more impoverished."

Even though he sold out the country’s rules, norms and unity time and again to appease Trump’s fragile little ego. Even though he literally laughed about people in Kentucky suffering during a debate this year. When it came time they all voted for him once again. Better to hate “the libs” than help your community or country."

There's a county in Mississippi where more than half the personal income of the inhabitants is from transfer payments.  90% are black and they vote overwhelmingly Democratic.

I'm sure in both areas the majority of residents would prefer to be working to earn their own income to spend as they wish.

Why does one group see the GOP as the path to that, while the other group sees the Democratic Party as the path to that?

Maybe neither party is the answer - but if those people and all the others like them in the US combined forces, they could run the country and the economy for the benefit of people like themselves.  Running it for the benefit of the .01% isn't working for them, yet the poor have far more voting power."

Mr. Royse's business is in Letcher County, Kentucky. Letcher County voted for Senator McConnell by an almost 3 to 1 margin over Amy McGrath (71% to 24.7%). 

But, I wonder whether Mr. Royse has tried to hold his Senator accountable? Has he called McConnell's office to express his needs? Has he emailed Senator Paul? Has he sought a meeting with either of them? Has he gotten together with other business owners in his town and county to demand that McConnell and Paul actually represent their interests?

I rather doubt it. 

Republican voters are so enamored of the win that they almost never question their leaders and hold them to account. If you want something from the system, you actually have to work to bend the system to your interests. That's what the billionaires do, after all."
2020-12-29 00:10:25,"Kentucky has elected a Democrat for Governor since 1950 except 3 times.  The General Assembly meets annually starting in January, with only 60 legislative days in even years, and cannot extend beyond April 15. In odd-numbered years, sessions may not last more than 30 legislative days, and cannot extend beyond March 30.   Though the Governor can call special sessions, Kentucky state legislature seems it is set up to be ineffective.  

Kentucky is the 8th poorest state, with a little under 20% of its residents living at or below poverty levels.

I feel bad for the Democrats there, mainly in the cities, who tried to get him out, but Kentucky is a poster child of a State which votes against its own interests time and time again.  Rural Kentucky can rot away - maybe it needs to.  Maybe continued economic pain will teach rural Kentuckians that they need to change their representation in Congress.  I doubt it, though.  For the ones that voted for McConnell and are now whining about their representation being ""out of touch"" - you reap what you sow.

It's practically comical, because I tell myself, they can't all be that stupid.  But then, the results keep pouring in for the GOP.  The voters of Kentucky have to fix this themselves.

It is part of an on going pattern.

Whenever the Democrats do not get their way, whether it's the restrictions, following the restrictions, gun control laws or federal spending, it is always the Republicans and their voters that get hurt the most.

Many people have noted that the people who are voting for the Republicans are so ignorant that they vote against themselves.  The Democrats are trying to give the people living in red states and red parts of the country their money only to see these people foolishly vote against it.

Somehow we have to end this madness where the Democrats are voting against themselves to help Republicans while, at the same time, the Republicans are also voting against themselves which helps the Democrats.

The Democrats should bypass this dysfunctional government and start direct depositing their unneeded paychecks directly into the back account of people with addresses in Kentucky.  Why should the Democrats wait for the Republicans to agree to tax them to help these people?

Oh, he may care about the poor,,the disadvantaged, etc. , but it’s against his principles to help,them. Those folks are on their own.

But would Democrats be much better?  Certainly. a national health plan would ensure that communities would have access to healthcare, but I have no clue how they might create access to money other than straight cash payments.  Other than manufacturing jobs, which are not coming back, what economies can we create in rural areas?"

2020-12-29 00:52:42,"Honestly as mentioned.
Kentucky is one of the poorest, worst run states in the Union. The tragedy is these people continue to vote in these senators.

It's tragic for them and for the country.
Obstruction of this party is on the way to destroying the country."
2020-12-29 00:55:37,"Mitch sent $70 billion in federal dollars to Kentucky in 2020 - $9,145 per person.  But it isn't distributed per person. McConnell opposes most federal aid and virtually any form of protection for workers.

But, hey, Kentucky has great roads and funds all kinds of projects for business owners.  Higher income Kentuckians vote for Mitch because he brings in more federal dollars per person than all but Virginia, which is full of defense installations and defense contractors.

The wealthier Kentuckians love Mitch for lining their pockets with tax dollars.  But, don't call them welfare recipients - just know that they are."
2020-12-29 00:56:36,"You know, the Republicans kept complaining about voter fraud. But I want to know why McConnell got more votes than there are registered Republicans in the state? Perhaps there was voter fraud and compromised voting machines, but not by the Dems."
2020-12-29 00:58:23,Even though McConnell has taken more federal money it does not go to the poor. So thats what the state gets for voting republican and supporting trump
2020-12-29 00:59:49,"Let's be honest, Kentucky has replaced West Virginia as the most politically and economically backward state east of the Mississippi River. Jim Crow Mitchy only cares about corporate welfare such as liability expenses and continually demanding lower corporate taxes. He also put in the least discussed portion of the CARES Act that allows those with $500,000 and above incomes to write off up to 100% of their 2020 and 2021 federal income taxes, or roughly about 800 times the value of the $1200 check that workers received. Mitchy stated that $1200 would ""provide a possible disincentive to work"" for the middle class, but had no issue with slicing income taxes for the wealthy in 2017 and potentially eliminating them for 2020 and 2021. Neither Senator acts in their own state's best interests and yet both are re-elected to misrepresent Kentucky."
2020-12-29 01:00:50,"What's the saying? ""The rich pay to keep half of the middle class and poor fighting against the other half so nothing changes"""
2020-12-29 01:01:52,"Once again Senators McConnell and Paul perform the card trick and slight of economic hand that demonizes government, which is a major employer and economic engine, and that squarely place the burden of COVID, and of life in general, on those least able to bear it. And of course, who benefits, non other than the wealthiest in the state, all under the false pretense against holding the line against the dole of ""free money."" In my view, theirs is just another form of discriminatory behavior, now not towards people of color (for which there is ample evidence), but towards those who by sheer happenstance were not fortunate enough to be born into the advantages that Senators McConnell and Paul have. A pity that they are not modeling their behavior in the spirit of FDR, who was born into wealth and privilege, but nonetheless understood the needs of all of us. But it must be difficult to be grounded enough to understand the plight of those less fortunate when your wedding gift from father-in-law has a seven or eight digit dollar value. 

Imagine for a moment that Senator McConnell had been President during the great depression, but then again one need not if one recollects the record of Herbert Hoover. Surely both Senators know their history, which makes their adherence to austerity politics all the more appalling and shameful."
2020-12-29 01:03:55,"If the voters of Kentucky want to foul their own nest, I guess that's their concern, but their choices foul the Senate and House for the rest of us.  Why should any of us have any sympathy for their troubles?"
2020-12-29 01:04:09,"Almost all commenters on this article have no sympathy because Kentuckians voted against their interests. I’m a liberal in one of the few blue parts of Kentucky, so I might not get this right, but I’ve worked with many Republican voters. They don’t want more federal handouts, they want decent-paying jobs. They want to be able to hire people who can pass a drug test and show up for work. Many can’t easily move to where the jobs are because they have land that is hard to sell and their support systems are often family-based. For historical reasons, many are not well-placed to succeed in the meritocracy that serves urban liberals well. Local governments in Kentucky often don’t set a good example. Kentuckians who vote are often not the ones receiving direct federal aid. Your (and my) objections to rural conservative culture are totally justified, but it’s also a culture that works for them in their circumstances. They would see all these comments as an example of liberal hostility and ignorance of their situation. They are certainly voting against your interests, but to say they’re voting against their interests is too simplistic."
2020-12-29 01:07:50,"Not everybody in Kentucky voted for McConnell or Paul or what's-his-name. As I recall, McConnell's opponent got a lot of votes. As for the others, they are swimming in a red sea of dishonesty. What's to be done about and for the good people among them who continue to make the same terrible mistake election after election? This terrible mistake pales beside the genuine evil of those who use these lies in the name of power, money, the dismantling of our democracy. It goes without saying that the disconnect is leviathan, between what McConnell and Paul are doing and saying, and what would help the state. Cynicism aids only McConnell and what's-his-name, at the expense of not only Kentuckians but the rest of us who are also under the thumb of the foot dragging and mean spiritedness of McConnell."
2020-12-29 01:08:20,"And yet Kentucky voters just gave Mitch McConnell 6 more years as Senate Republican leader, and likely Majority leader, and by wide margins. It's kind of hard to feel any sympathy for them."
2020-12-29 01:09:57,"I was hoping for more coverage of poor Kentucky and it’s rotten Senator before the election and, frankly, during Obama’s presidency. There has long been this dissonance between the real lives of Kentuckians and their choices for Congress. This could have opened a lot of people’s eyes during our time of troubles."
2020-12-29 01:10:33,"“I didn’t trust the government that much before because we know they keep things from us, but now it’s almost like the government is evil,” Ms. Hardwick said. “It’s really driven it home that I was right to not fully trust them — never, never, never.”

This is what Mitch and the republicans want. Deep distrust of govt so that they can continue to slash services and benefits and keep giving money to the wealthy. If only this woman was a little more educated she may see who the devil keeping things from us really is. Her and who she’s voted for."
2020-12-29 01:11:51,"Someone needs to inform ordinary Kentuckians about the real activities of their senators in congress.  Not only are they both professional liars allied to big business and power leeches, but their actions (and inactions) have relegated the state to share honors with the likes of Alabama and Mississippi in terms of the availability of equal educational opportunities, adequate health care, access to healthy foods, and essential governmental services.  When will ordinary people wake up and see the devils for what they are?"
2020-12-29 01:14:05,And yet Kentuckians continue voting for these Senators who are taking actions that are against their best interests. Republicans have done an amazing job is conditioning their base to vote against their own interests
2020-12-29 01:17:03,"For years, KY is been a contender for the most federally dependent state in the country. So, while it may look like McConnell doesn't do much for his constituents, he sure can carve the pork for some of his constituents."

2020-12-29 01:26:45,"I think the state of KY needs to focus: They are obligated to provide good education to the children; they must therefore do that. The children’s parents are obligated to feed their children and they must do that. 

 We in the US spend the lowest percent of our income on food as compared to any other nation on Earth; food is heavily subsidized by our federal government.  

I worked in west Africa during the Ebola crisis there.  Folks lived in tin-roofed huts with no running water or electricity; schools were closed; there was barely a medical system to speak of ....even before the Ebola crisis.  Yet the kids were fed; their parents fed them. 

Feed you kids, fellow Americans.   It is the most basic parental responsibility. It’s shameful that we American parents abdicate it."
2020-12-29 01:32:34,"The lack of trust described in the last paragraph is misplaced. It should be lack of trust in the two heartless Senators, who could care less that they won’t do the right thing for desperate Kentucky citizens."
2020-12-29 01:33:05,"And yet, the people voted against their interests again to re-elect him. Hard to feel bad for them when McConnell has clearly shown them who he is over and over."
2020-12-29 01:35:31,"I guess it’s easier to believe that providing help to people in need is worst than receiving help. And that we are all inextricably tied to one another. I find it interesting that every republican I know, and I know quite a few, never make that connection. From that mindset I can understand how Kentucky’s poor can and do vote against their own interest."
2020-12-29 01:41:03,"Republicans, including Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, have no problem giving out ""free money"" when it goes to the wealthy people this country, or part of corporate welfare. 

People in this country need to start focusing on which party is really going to advocate for them rather than fixating who is going to ""stick it"" to their perceived political enemies. Actually, rethinking who their enemies really are might be a good idea."
2020-12-29 01:41:42,"I wonder why McConnell is rich and getting richer, while other Kentucky people are getting poorer and poorer. Hmm. 
I also wonder why Kentuckians voted him back into office, even though he is abusing them. Hmm, hmmm."
2020-12-29 01:43:53,"As much as I would like people in Kentucky to have things better, me voting in my state isn't going to do a thing if they won't vote in their own best interests. ""I don't trust government"" dooms these folks."
2020-12-29 01:46:30,"I suppose a supporter of Senators Paul or McConnell could tell me I don’t understand.  As a supposed “Coastal Elite”, I am out of touch with whatever philosophy of individualism drives someone who clearly needs help to reject it.  And it you are living alone, single, and you choose to subscribe to such thinking, so be it.  But if you have children, and you back people who don’t provide aid, when desperately needed for schools and food, I admit I have little interest in trying to understand such thinking.  
What makes it worse, or maybe more hypocritical, is a favorite talking point of conservatives is to condemn welfare recipients, casting them as drains on the national coffers.  Oddly, or maybe appropriately, many of the so called “red states”, receive much more in federal funds than they pay in federal tax dollars.  The “blue states”, it appears, fund them.  I don’t know for sure, but I imagine Kentucky is one that receives much more than it pays.  Apparently, even that is not enough."
2020-12-29 01:49:30,"People in Kentucky have gotten the message since childhood that they are inferior simply because of where they live - that they must be toothless, shoeless, and illiterate, even if that's clearly not true. (Excluding Appalachia, much of the state is right on par with other parts of the country.) This sets the scene for McConnell, for whom many vote because he has enormous power and makes them feel a strong sense of pride. Personally I can't wait til Charles Booker is one of our senators."

2020-12-29 01:39:29,"“ Kentucky Is Hurting as Its Senators Limit or Oppose Federal Aid”

I hope Kentuckians are happy with their overwhelming votes to re-elect him. They get what they deserve."

2020-12-29 01:45:02,"But Kentuckians vote McConnell and Paul back into office anyway because the people-haters in US politics have proven, as they always do, exceedingly skilled at turning the people they abuse against politicians dedicated to improving their lives."
2020-12-29 01:36:35,poor white rural voters will vote against social safety net programs because the possibility exists that they might possibly benefit people who are not white
2020-12-29 01:50:52,"If it weren't for Paul or McConnell, I wouldn't have boycotted Kentucky bourbon, and would have never found the great whiskeys that come out of Vermont and Oregon. There's always a silver lining."
2020-12-29 00:41:49,"Why is this article surprising? Conservative white politicians have been doing this to thier constituents for the last 100 years.  Liberals always look at these issues through the lense of economics. Conservatives adroitly use hot button issues like, guns, religous freedom, race and immigration to divert the attention of their constituents from economic issues.  Liberals always assume economics, trumps - no pun intended, social issues.  Time and time again this has been disproven at the ballot box in the South.  I say let rural GOP Kentuckians sell their guns  and have god save them from their economic calamity."
2020-12-29 01:07:12,"As many other readers have noted here, elections have consequences. As a resident of Texas, I'm dismayed that our Republican ""leadership"" includes the rogue's gallery of Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, Louie Gohmert (truly, the worst of the worst), Ken Paxton (wait, HE'S the worst of the worst) and Dan Patrick, execrable men who continue to be reelected, some many times over. My fellow Texans, mostly in rural and small-town areas, are rabid Trump supporters. I haven't an iota of sympathy for Republican voters who love guns, hate abortion, socialism (but don't touch their Medicare!) and liberals, and who are now suffering economically, and with Covid and mask resistance, physically as well. The same goes for the Republican voters in Kentucky. They vote against their best interests over and over, the very definition of political insanity."
2020-12-29 01:57:25,"I lived in Bowling Green for 16 years up until 2000.   I liked Kentuckians then and I still do.   What I don’t like is that they overwhelmingly voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.   So when I read this article, I had mixed feelings.  Yeah, they deserve what they vote for, but then not everyone voted that way.   The impact on families, especially children, makes me sad.  Change has always come slowly for Kentucky but it seems to be self-imposed this time around.  Hard to understand."
2020-12-29 02:09:37,"If senators from Kentucky and other states don't want their citizens to get any Covid relief or other aid, leave them out of it. Approve aid for other states, except for those states whose elected officials are opposed to it.

It would only be fair. States opposing aid (their elected officials) should have an option to decline any assistance, and allow states whose representatives vote for a bill to go forward.

That, or let all citizens cast votes for each bill. I'd like a say as to where my tax dollars go, anyway."
2020-12-29 02:10:12,Kentucky thought Mitch had Trump under control. He doesn’t and Kentucky citizens are paying a hefty price for the old senator’s pride and ego.
2020-12-29 02:14:58,"More often than not, freedom in the US is uniquely defined as freedom of obligations to greater society... with this in mind, such insane and harmful decisions make perfect sense."
2020-12-29 02:20:14,"For those people in Kentucky in dire need of assistance and whom voted for Republicans, particularly Paul and McConnell, sadly the late and relatively small amount of relief, this is your own doing by voting for these people. They are clearly only interested in themselves and those that can help them get and maintain power."
2020-12-29 02:24:54,"The quote from Mrs Hardwick saying that the government is evil and she was right not to trust them is enlightening. It displays a total lack of understanding for how representative democracy works. We the people entrust our elected officials with the duty to work in our best interests. If they don’t perform, we get to  fire them. Instead of doing so, Hardwick is rejecting democracy as a failure. It only fails when voters fail to do their part."
2020-12-29 02:25:59,"I'm not feeling much sympathy here. McConnell was just re-elected by a very healthy margin. Rand Paul has been a gadfly since the day he was elected. When state residents start looking for someone to blame, they should check the mirror."
2020-12-29 02:28:59,"Kentucky voted for Trump 62% to 36% Biden. They also re-elected McConnell at 58%. 

Kentuckians are getting exactly the representation they deserve."
2020-12-29 02:29:17,Among the many sad lessons I've learned during the past four years is that paying close  attention to what my representatives are doing or not doing is absolutely  essential. I feel very sorry for the people of Kentucky. I hope the Biden administration's stated concern for every American will result in so many practical benefits that most of those previously uninformed voters soon realize how gullible they were.
2020-12-29 02:29:30,Well this is what happens when a state continues to elect officials who only care about hanging on to power and making themselves rich. Mitch is holding America hostage because it doesn't benefit him not to.
2020-12-29 02:30:36,"Like many Americans I really thought Kentuckians would not re-elect Mitch McConnell but, inexplicably, they did. The state is at the bottom of so many barrels in terms of healthcare, education, services and yet all the while McConnell has enriched himself while his state goes further downhill. No one likes to be wrong but it's time for Kentucky voters to realize what's really going on in their state and make some changes."
2020-12-29 02:38:55,It is my understanding that Kentucky gets the highest amount of federal dollars in return for income tax collected. I am not sure why you think their senators are failing them.
2020-12-29 02:40:36,"The people of Kentucky should demand a look at the vote.  Seems there were many, many statistical anomalies.  Otherwise, I just don’t understand why these people vote against those that would help them stand on their own two feet and those that would step on them and push them further into the quicksand."
2020-12-29 02:41:35,"The relegation concept in European fútbol should be applied to the USA —
the bottom 5 states should have no representation in Congress, instead, they should be managed and represented by the top 5 states."
2020-12-29 02:52:25,"Not my problem. I’m one of those blue state people that they despise. They chose their senators, with gusto. If they expected something different after 20  years of Mitch McConnell, the they are even more delusional.  Maybe their plethora of evangelical churches will help them. Not holding my breath."
2020-12-29 02:54:57,"And yet, Kentuckians continue to vote for these two Republican stalwarts election after the election. Meanwhile, KY reels from a plethora of ills: high unemployment, uneven health care and a fractured economy. And a large percentage of the population is on opioids and meth. Handicapping Kentucky’s present mess is easier than picking a 50-1 longshot at Churchhill Downs. Kentucky Despair will reign with Rand, and we all will be in a Ditch with Mitch."
2020-12-29 02:57:54,"Something going on that I don’t understand. Smart people in Kentucky keep electing these two. McConnell and Paul seem to be consistent speed bumps on the road to improvement for millions of Americans. And with this thumb-in-the-eye I’m even more confused.

Kentucky Republicans ‘splain it to us..."
2020-12-29 03:01:19,"Maybe this state is near the top of the sadomasochistic scale of governance...ruled by fear, pain and ignorance all of which are bonds that can be overcome should the residents so choose.  What a tangled we we weave, indeed!"
2020-12-29 03:03:05,"It is not 'the government' that creates problems and leaves people to put their children to bed without dinner and die of treatable diseases. 
It is the government representatives that the people of Kentucky have elected decade after decade in spite of the disinterest in the needs of the people of Kentucky.
Insanity is the repeating the same action time after time and expecting a different result.
Kentucky seems to be the proof of that theory."
2020-12-29 03:10:14,"Huh. I have to admit I'm pretty shocked at the callousness of the comment section here. Usually I see a lot more sympathy.

People don't intentionally vote against their own best interest. If we liberals believe that lack of access to education and misinformation are systemic problems to minority groups, why do we suddenly place all of the personal responsibility on the rural white folks? They're being duped and victimized too, but in different manner and degree.

I'm liberal as they come but our neoliberal, technocratic policies didn't help these folks either. They're not wrong to feel deep distrust when their system of government fails them at every opportunity."

2020-12-29 03:12:38,"The overall opinion here is how can people vote against their best interests and the answer is...longstanding and intentional economic and educational shackles regardless of race, creed and color only now the poor whites are the victims and the disenfranchised.  This plays well across the south and has been the ace in the hole for the GOP over the last 50 year’s.  Ironically what goes around comes around only now it too has been politicized.  Indeed what a tangled web we weave."
2020-12-29 03:15:33,Why do they keep electing McConnell? The logic of keep sending this guy back every six years escapes me. He serves the rich and not the people of Kentucky and he is so brazen that he doesn't hide it. I used to blame McConnell for being McConnell but now it is time to blame those more deserving. The people of Kentucky keep giving us Mitch and all I can say is you get what you vote for. People suffering does not move McConnell giving rich people tax breaks does.
2020-12-29 03:15:58,Who wants to bet that Rand Paul will keep winning re-election until he's 90 years old? I hope that they do the country a favor and vote these two out.
2020-12-29 03:22:17,"The arrogance of Rand Paul, who apparently lacks any ability to experience empathy for his constituents, is epic. Ditto Mitch McConnell’s obstructionism. They have all but ensured that the people of Kentucky will continue to suffer—not to mention the suffering that they inflict on the nation’s citizenry by extension."
2020-12-29 03:22:36,"I simply do not understand why the people who vote for McConnell and Paul vote for them.
Is it because they do not read about what they do in the Senate and how they vote on bills that do not offer a reasonable amount of help to those most in need?   Do they just believe the lie ""I'm in Congress to HELP you"" and not think or try to learn more about what that 'help' is and how it is handed out?
For people trapped in poverty, $600 is a drop of water when there is a flood."
2020-12-29 03:24:49,"Kentucky is not that different from anywhere else. Like all of America, our cities are blue and our rural areas red. Lexington and Louisville are reasonably progressive cities. But Kentucky is largely a rural state. The charges made by many in these comments could be leveled at any state by this logic. 

That said, I teach mostly low income students at a very progressive college. I've learned that intelligent people from disadvantaged backgrounds have all kinds of reasons to vote conservative that people from wealthier and more privileged backgrounds could not understand, as I could not until I heard their stories in the classroom. 

I am not originally from Kentucky. But I've met many good people here; people not that different than anywhere else I've lived. We have major research universities, liberal arts colleges and Fortune 500 companies. We also have a great deal of rural countryside, most of whom vote Republican, as they do in rural New York and California.

Nothing particularly good or bad about Kentucky in this regard.  We are just a microcosm of the US writ large, albeit with a larger rural population. Not much the progressives among us in Louisville and Lexington can do about that except, well, try to empathize and understand. A good idea, perhaps, for all of us."
2020-12-29 03:28:04,"The people of Kentucky keep re-electing Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, who are acting against their interests.

Why do they do this?"
2020-12-29 03:35:04,"I share the age-old bafflement at why poor people so often vote against their own best interests.  Yes, there are the usual age-old unkind, but probably not inaccurate, theories and observations.  But it still baffles me.  And Kentucky is, and has long been, such a shining example."
2020-12-29 03:36:22,Rand Paul has been peddling dangerous falsities since the start of the pandemic. The herd immunity argument has been comprehensively debunked but he's still peddling it. But even if herd immunity was validated (it has been for some viral diseases) for COVID-19 it is an extremely worrisome proposition. Why? Because we just don't know what the long-term consequences of COVID-19 might be even in individuals asymptomatic or only very mildly affected. But we already know that this is a viral illness that can inflict serious mental and physical disabilities after apparent complete recovery from the acute infection. Myocardial MRI as an example has demonstrated serious heart damage in patients with only trivial symptoms after infection. Will post-COVID-19 syndromes affect 1% or 10% of individuals - it is too early to say but my preliminary scanning of reports in the medical and science journals from many countries suggests it will be common enough to impose a substantial new burden on health services.

In fact, many of you probably already know the answer.  Get ready.  Here it is.  Guns and religion....with a dash of racism.  Just like so many Americans, they are single issue voters and just not really that informed.  America gets the politicians it deserves, to include Trump."

Get McConnell OUT of control in the Senate.  Vote Ossoff and  Warnock."

2020-12-29 02:06:33,"Why the heck do people keep voting for two of the absolutely worst Senators. It's like taking a knife and picking away at your own skin, day after day, month after month, year after year. Talk about sheep. I mean there have to be other Republicans (somewhere over the rainbow?) that people can find if they can't hold their nose and vote Democratic. You get what you vote for."
2020-12-29 02:10:28,The people of Kentucky have no clue how Mitch McConnell keeps being re-elected. I really hate living in the state that keeps sending this guy to congress. It hurts.

2020-12-29 03:21:49,"The animosity towards ""socialism"", which is obviously what democrats want, in the usa comes from the realization that public programs, if instituted fairly, would also help black people.

That explains why this place is like a backwater among western nations."

But she does not equate McConnell's stranglehold on Kentucky with the problems she's having. It's some amorphous ""them"" (the elites no doubt) in Washington when ""them"" is right in her own state. Right in her own backyard. I don't think this is ""sad"" I think this is amazingly and willfully ignorant. And now that they've made their bed, time and again, they've got to lie in it."
2020-12-29 02:37:24,"Kentucky, you demanded this misery with your vote. Actually, you’ve done it over and over again, keeping Mitch and Rand in power. I am so sorry for the hungry kids. They don’t deserve any of this. But the rest of you? You’re volunteers. You got what you voted for. Enjoy."
2020-12-29 03:25:15,"Dear hard working Mrs Hardwick: If you don't want your children or grandchildren sewing masks for a living, please get on board with some progressive policies.

2020-12-29 01:57:32,"If there is some reason why disenfranchised lower-middle class, lower class and impoverished citizens would trust in and support the Republican party in 2016 and 2020, their reasoning is a mystery. A complete mystery.
At a time when the Republicans held majorities on both chambers of congress, Trump passed his huge and much lied-about TAX CUT. After the tsunami of lies and hollow promises subsided, our Federal Department of Finance analyzed the bill and concluded that 85 percent of the tax cut’s benefit would go to the top 1 percent, the richest of America’s rich.
That tax cut was Trump’s most outstanding accomplishment in four years.
Yet the citizens of Kentucky are Republicans. Some sad to say are “can’t pay the rent. Can’t buy groceries. Unemployed and worried, but they’re still Republicans.”
They reelected Republicans who don’t seem to be concerned by their plight. Who fought to keep emergency pandemic support payments as low as they could.

If you’re an angry, disillusioned voter who wants fairness and justice to be restored, looking to Trump,
McConnell and Rand Paul for help is a terrible mistake.
They serve the rich and priviledged. Now that they got your votes on Nov. 3rd — they couldn’t care less about your mortgage falling into default or your kids crying from hunger,"
2020-12-29 03:27:49,"Don’t forget Kentucky elected the reprehensible Matt Bevin to the Governorship. It was only after four years of gross incompetence that he barely lost to Andy Bashear. On his way out Bevin thanked the citizens of Kentucky by pardoning several murderers and child rapists.  Here is the thing if Bevin was a senator or congress critter, he’d still be in office. The difference is that governors have practical responsibilities which can’t be ducked. All the Washington gop pols have to do is stoke the culture war issues. Rand Paul would be an abysmal failure if he were governor."
2020-12-29 02:21:38,Good grief!

Taxes are low and they all seem dirt poor to us.  However, their are rungs for the neo-middle class, poor and poorer.  This hierarchy keeps all of the “have nots” in line.  The fear that socialism will take jobs from the poor and hardworking and hand them to the poorer and less worthy... or worse, to blacks and Latinos... the fear, that the social ladder that puts those near the bottom, will put them next to those actually at the bottom (in their eyes), is terrifying to ones self worth..."

Their decisions are the expression of chaotic unprincipled thinking, threatening the fabric of their own states. How pathetic. How tragic. I hope this is a lesson to the people of Georgia and Kentucky and the nation of the governance we can expect from these individuals."

<a href=""https://kcma.ky.gov/Documents/Final"" target=""_blank"">https://kcma.ky.gov/Documents/Final</a>%20Report.pdf
The military spent about $12 billion in Kentucky during 2014-15, a reduction of $3.5 billion since
the last report was published in 2012. The spending is primarily accounted for by activity at the
Army’s major installations - Fort Campbell and Fort Knox – and to large health-care related
contracts with Louisville’s Humana Corporation.
 Among organizations that could relocate outside of Kentucky, the military is the largest
employer. With 38,700 full-time active duty and civilian employees, military employment
exceeds the next largest state employer, United Parcel Service, by more than 21,000 jobs. In
addition, there are 15,421 Reserve and National Guard personnel in the state.
 The military supports the largest employee compensation, $3.85 billion, among Kentucky
industries that export their product out of state (and hence could relocate). The second largest
such industry, motor vehicles and parts manufacturing, has $80 million less in employee
compensation than the military.
 Kentucky ranks twelfth highest among the fifty states in the number of active duty military
personnel stationed there (34,595), and sixteenth in the number of total military personnel
(including civilian workers, reservists, and National Guard). Kentucky has the fourth highest
number of active-duty Army personnel (34,300), following Texas, Georgia and North Carolina."

2020-12-29 03:33:57,How can Senators McConnell & Paul abandon their people in this moment of need?!  Do they only care about themselves? When elections come around their people should give them what THEY deserve—retirement.
2020-12-29 02:16:08,"I have seen this with family members of mine in the US. There is something fundamentally broken with the way Americans understand their political system and how they vote. It seems too many people consider themselves either red or blue. Forever. That’s it. That’s the way they will always vote, no matter who the candidates are, what the situation is, or which crisis they’re facing. They have lost their ability tonuse their vote to influence policy and politics. 

They pin their political identity to a few landmark issues, like guns or taxes or gay rights, and they will tune out anything that contradicts that identity, no matter how many contradictions pile up. One family member of mine considers himself a „died-in-the-wool Republican“, although he’s from a Native American / Hispanic background, has a homosexual daughter, and has been living on Social Security for decades. He once owned a business when he was younger, and that imprinted „red“ on him. 

That’s how you get people voting against their own self-interest. They don’t think about it anymore, their minds have been made up for decades, and they‘ll find someone to blame when it goes downhill - except, of course, themselves and the choices they‘ve made."

2020-12-29 02:41:14,"It's about time that The New York Times took the Republican Senators from Kentucky to task for the woeful state of affairs in their state.  They couldn't care less about the people who elect them.  It's time to go beyond Kentucky.  Why not point out that the Senators from Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee have also kept their states in arm-pit status - with poorly funded and performing education systems,  poor environmental quality, and feudal labor standards that oppose unions and raising the federal minimum wage?  These throwbacks to the days of slavery have no right to criticize states like California, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, who value their citizens and strive to improve their lives."
2020-12-29 03:16:56,"These folks voted 75% for Trump and McConnell. You get what you pay for. What I can't understand is the shallowness and hypocrisy of their thinking. The federal government is evil, yet with a poverty rate approaching 30% - and 45% for those under 18 - they depend on welfare and food stamps and Medicaid to keep them alive, all of those ""socialist"" programs that the politicians they vote for continually denounce and try to kill, while the people they have been taught to hate - ""liberal left socialists"" on the northeast and west coasts - are continually voting to put food on their tables. 

Yes, the nation's economy has left them in the dust, but whose fault is that? Well, there are trade pacts like Nafta that weren't followed by the promised job retraining, the coal industry produces an expensive and lethal product and nobody prepared for its demise, but perhaps most of all it's the politicians they vote for who have served them poorly yet keep getting re-elected. 

Their poverty has become a vicious circle, their counties have been losing population since 1950, and rather than try to vote their way out of it all, they keep on voting for the same people who are literally stabbing them in the back.

These are folks you just can't reach with reason and evidence. If their young hope for any future, they should just get out while they can and see what the outside world is really like - not perfect, but better than what they've grown up with."

2020-12-29 02:07:20,"Considering the constant questioning of the Presidential I am tentative to say this but ... here are some surprising statistics about Kentucky voters. 
 
KY has 100,000 MORE registered Democrats than Republicans. It also has about 326,000 independent and third-party voters. 

<a href=""https://elect.ky.gov/Resources/Pages/Registration-Statistics.aspx"" target=""_blank"">https://elect.ky.gov/Resources/Pages/Registration-Statistics.aspx</a>

It had a 60% turnout in 2020. Democrats were ahead in the early vote. And over 75% of their mail ballots were returned at a 2:1 margin, D to R. 
<a href=""https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/KY.html"" target=""_blank"">https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/KY.html</a>

Given this, it's amazing to me that McConnell beat McGrath by such a wide margin. I know he's a KY legend and I'm sure most of their 3rd party voters swing conservative - but still. 

I think there could be a lot of room for change in Kentucky. Why else do they have Andy Beshear?"
2020-12-29 01:59:33,"This is why adopting a race-class narrative will be essential for Democrats going forward. Kentuckians are voting on the culture wars and shooting themselves in the foot economically, much like pretty much all the red states. They have fallen prey to the GOP’s apartheid tactics of “divide, divide, divide” in order to maintain power and wealth accumulation at the top.

Democrats absolutely MUST start pointing this out at every turn: that Republicans are dividing Americans up by race, gender, sexuality, origin, religion, and any other difference they can, simply to distract from the unpopularity of their agenda, which continues to rob nearly all of America blind in the form of wage suppression, right-to-work laws, and tax cuts for the rich. They need to stop agreeing with Republicans that we are in a demographics war; we are not. We are in a war of the rich against everyone else, and culture war issues are a tactic the Right thrives on. Don’t give it to them. If we want to win rural America, which is essential to winning power, we need to lean into economics and not focus so much on “representation.” I guarantee you that most minorities will benefit far more from larger incomes than they will from having more people of color on corporate boards or television."

2020-12-29 03:54:04,"During the senate campaign it was clear what the differences were between the Democratic stimulus package and what Mitch McConnell was willing to offer.

But rather than make that the central focus of the election, Chuck Schummer poured millions into bland TV ads trying to prop up a candidate whose main appeal was that she was a veteran.

She was a former fighter pilot but that had nothing to do with the bread and butter kitchen table issues that had made Bernie so popular.

So, the senate negotiations remained behind closed doors and the Democrats spent 80 million dollars and lost big. Then, after the election a more embolden McConnell met the Democratic demand for 1.9 trillion with a counter of 900 billion.

The final compromise was 900 million. Guess who won?

The DNC Democrats never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. McConnell and his banker friends got everything they wanted in the CARES Act and promised to pass a stimulus later. And Pelosi and Schummer believed him.

The American working class suffers because they don't have leaders who are willing to truly fight for them."

She needs to look more carefully at which people are unwilling to help, rather than painting with a broad brush. The fact is that in this divided government, one party and one chamber has led the charge to support those who have felt this crisis most severely: House Democrats passed a second pandemic relief bill in May, only to find that Senate Republicans, led by their state’s two curmudgeons, have blocked all efforts for seven months, relenting only to consent to an inadequate bill when a special election in Georgia threatened their majority.

2020-12-29 04:14:56,"@Opinioned!

I absolutely disagree.

Firstly, I can’t think of a Californian who could endure the culture shock of Appalachia for more than two weeks. And that includes the residents of our extensive rural population. Managing Kentucky can’t be done from Sacramento or Albany.

Getting realistic, originally the Constitution provided that the needs of the people be balanced by the needs of the several States. Hence, we have two houses of Congress. But Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution was amended in 1912, and ratified in 1913 to allow direct election of Senators. 

What does that mean? Possibly, no probably, the Senate has been extraneous for the past 107 years. I hate to pick on Kentucky but Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul are doing a job (Yeah, you got that right) that no one needs.

We need to complete the process begun 107 years ago by amending the Constitution to establish a single house of legislature, with a single term limit, of reasonable duration to actually accomplish something."

2020-12-29 04:27:37,"As a recovering Kentuckian whose family was deeply involved in politics, I see the state has changed in my long lifetime from Blue Dog Democratic when I lived there to Trump Republican.
Many things happened to bring about this change. 
The exodus out of rural KY, the very small percentage of people with a college degree, the fatalism that keeps the most needy from voting, the evangelical churches becoming more political, the poor regard for public education, loss of coal mining jobs and union workers.
The list could go on.
A cynical KY Republican was asked why people would vote for him when he pledged to cut Medicaid said'People on Medicaid do not vote'. 
He won the election.
There is nothing that Democrats can do to be a consistent state wide force in states like KY or all of non metro America.
We can only hope to turn out the vote where Democrats live, abolish the filibuster, increase the number of House seats and stamp out gerrymandering in state elections after the results of the 2020 census are in and districts are redrawn."

His tenure has seen Kentucky hold steady to bottom five positions in many measures of physical, economic and social health, yet he's elected again and again.

But if the government starts providing too much, Republicans like McConnell and Paul are afraid that people might ask for more, are afraid that people might actually come to believe that government can solve problems, can actually improve people’s lives and livelihoods.

2020-12-29 04:55:43,"I take issue with Senator Paul’s (R KY) assertion that the Covid Relief bill is ‘free money.’  No, Mr. Senator, this is US taxpayer dollars being distributed to US taxpayers and their families in a time of need, crisis and desperation.
Should you beg to differ with me, I welcome your comments, however they may be better tempered after having listened to those of your constituents who stand to lose the most without the bill and it’s support for their local, educational and municipal services."
2020-12-29 04:56:24,"“The best way for Kentucky to recover is to repeal Governor Beshear’s lockdown edicts that have caused massive unemployment,” the senator said. “I support extending unemployment and paying for it by reducing foreign aid and nation-building expenditures in Afghanistan.”

Afghanistan?"

It would be interesting to know who Ms Hardwick voted for, both for the Presidency and Senate. I suspect that although many in Kentucky have identified Washington as the problem, they are unable or unwilling to see which Party has denied them Federal aid."
2020-12-29 05:16:25,"Isn’t this the small government Kentuckians want? The home of freedom loving libertarian spirit folks that eschew federal government handouts and interference in their lives? Aren’t these the folks that turn to prosperity churches for security? 
It’s unfortunate to live in states that offer little to its citizens in the name of freedom."
2020-12-29 05:26:31,"If the good citizens of Kentucky had wanted to avoid financial ruin, they would have voted for Col. McGrath. Instead they re-elected Sen. McConnell, who will insure that welfare mothers don't drive Cadillacs."

2020-12-29 05:30:01,"Such a confusing story. McConnell in his own primary debate bragged that he pulled in 17-billion dollars from his seat in the senate. That’s federal welfare folks. If it’s not going to the people in their state, or municipalities of his state (and we know it’s not getting them healthcare or infrastructure), just where is the money going?"
2020-12-29 05:31:21,"Yet they keep n voting for that blight on American society, Mitch McConnell.

The extent of the damage Trump could do was limited to 4 years, but McConnell as Senate leader continues to harm the country over the years. He not only does not deserve to be a political leader, but he is the complete antithesis of what America is."
2020-12-29 05:32:05,"Based on all the other comments I've read, we've all come here to say the exact same thing. This should be a textbook example of how the right continues to vote against their own interests that should be studied for years to come."

2020-12-29 04:51:29,"The GOP has won, I have given up trying to understand the mindset of so many red state voters who vote for representation so corrupt, so blatantly beholden to their Citizen's United donors.  The romantic attachment to ""The Lost Cause"" with zero understanding of the legacy of slavery and discrimination, Black Lives Matter and the list goes on.

McConnell and Rand Paul are no more odious than Loeffler or Purdue, or Cornyn or Cruz."

2020-12-29 05:03:07,"Kentucky voters and residents, your economies might boom if you get rid of or hold accountable your Senators in Washington. 

They are so out of touch with the needs of most Americans it is truly a tragedy. Especially McConnell who has made his millions, is comfortably settled and will retire with a fat pension and healthcare paid for, in part by you with your votes. 

The problem of your inaction is that he refuses to help people in need through no fault of their own. Even in his own State. 

He is a sociopath as is his colleague, Rand. If you do not protest it is entirely your fault. 

Poor voters in ""developing countries"" know their politicians will never perform for them, so they expect cash during elections or big screen TVs and such.

If you don't feel like getting rid of these two clowns or holding them accountable, at least ask for a new flat screen TV? you or your children may be starving, but a new TV!"
2020-12-29 04:48:55,"I've voted against both of them every chance I had. Never worked. It's tough here. 

Though some of you should learn your history a bit better: Kentucky never seceded from the Union. We were not a Confederate state. We were partially occupied by the Confederacy, but holding the rest of the state was a huge priority of the Union. ""I would like God on my side but I must have Kentucky,"" is a quote attributed to Lincoln on the subject. The stereotypical Kentuckians you think of, the Appalachians, balked at fighting for slave owners when they were all way too poor to own slaves. That's also why West Virginia broke away from Virginia."
2020-12-29 04:48:29,You get what you vote for. But I am sure the Republicans will find a way to blame it all on the Democratic Governor...

2020-12-29 04:49:22,I wonder why they re-elected McConnell? He and Rand have their millions and could care less their constituents are suffering.
2020-12-29 04:47:40,"Perhaps other commenters aren’t saying exactly what they mean, but it frustrates me deeply to read the many outright condemnations of Kentuckians on this page. Yes, our state voted heavily for Trump, Mitch, and Rand — but to portray KY purely as a Republican haven is very much falling for “the danger of the single story”. Hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians voted for Democrats in November. We elected a Democratic governor who has been as emphatic about Covid regulations as nearly any governor. You’ll find plenty of BLM flags or signs depending on the part of the state you’re in.

KY is far from perfect, as many here point out. But clearly so is America. For those who say “Kentuckians are getting what they deserve” or “I have no empathy for them” — how would you have felt if non-Americans had said that to you following the 2016 election? “Well you elected Trump, so I feel no sympathy as he uproots your democracy.” As if the fact that Mitch was re-elected disqualifies all Kentuckians (including those who didn’t vote for him) from the aid they need as much as other Americans?"
2020-12-29 05:31:00,"Well, Mitch McConnell of course had to have the port barrel funding for the horse racing.  I imagine some of those involved in racing donate to McConnell.  However, Mitch doesn't care about Main Street Kentuckians.  He may be just saying ""let them eat cake."""
2020-12-29 05:13:53,"The reason Mitch McConnel does nothing is because the media largely MSNBC FOX and CNN tend to focus their stories on people who are suffering in states like New York, California and very few, if any, on the people in red-states like Kentucky, Iowa and West Virginia.  

Republicans know that there are no consequences for their intransient and inaction because their constituents are convinced, by watching these networks that only people in Democratic run states are suffering.

Reporting has to be redoubled - more stories on the suffering of Americans in the red-states and less on the problems in big cities."
2020-12-29 04:58:22,"Something I'd like to see when the Times does these 'location reports' is some basic contextual information.

Is there a local newspaper? How many households have internet? What's the educational level like?

It's easy to blame people for only watching Fox News -- but I'm starting to wonder if a large part of the issue is media content deserts that go unnoticed because there's no thought to asking.

I live in a midsized city and Fox is the only network with a local affliate. NBC, ABC, CBS all are from the next largest city. 

We keep hearing the same story over and over again -- nothing will change until we find out WHY so much of America tunes into Fox News."
2020-12-29 05:19:59,"Yet, this year and many prior ekection years, Democrats can find no message to alter this safe Republican state. Mind-boggling how M McConnell had smooth sailing to his re-election."

Southern states stay poor because a) black citizens are excluded from economic opportunities and b) the inadequate funding of schools, infrastructure and government services.    

But as long as the senators and their cronies are doing fine ..."

If McConnell wasn't in charge of the Senate, we all, including Kentucky, would be much better off. Instead, they hoisted him on us for another six years."
2020-12-29 06:08:47,"There is probably no public radio or television In rural Kentucky.  I suspect Fox is the only news outlet there as well.  And McConnell and Rand are always trying to defund public radio.  The education system and libraries are underfunded as well.  The Republican Senators like it that way, it’s how they keep their jobs."
2020-12-29 06:21:58,"Kentuckians will be OK when they realize they should expect one of the wealthiest nations in the world to make sure all citizens have education, housing, health care, and civil rights. Like every other advanced country."
2020-12-29 06:28:23,"Ask these poor people why they vote for the likes of Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell.  I guess my sympathy for them is limited when I consider that they have visited ON THE ENTIRE NATION, including where I live, the likes of these two nightmare politicians, who have outsize influence on what happens in the lives of all Americans.  What is their excuse?  They don't trust government?  So they give us senators who destroy the government in which they serve?  Yes, in that case I suppose it is hard to trust government.  A nice paradox."
2020-12-29 06:31:50,A good guide to understanding Republican politicians is  to listen very carefully to what they say and then know  that they will do exactly the opposite.
2020-12-29 06:47:29,Good people that have been let down for decades but currently disdain Democrats more than Republicans even as the latter contribute more to their loss of well-being. There is no easy solution to their problems but there are no solutions as long as they continue to place in office those with little regard for them or the problems they confront.
2020-12-29 06:59:27,This is going to continue to happen until the residents of Kentucky open their eyes and start voting for a politician that actually has their interests in mind. Very sad state of affairs and a great reason why we need term limits and a massive investment in education.
2020-12-29 05:43:23,"Gosh darn. You voted for them, and for Trump. Not sure why."

He has won re-election easily in spite of KY not improving in any metric (schools, infant mortality, longevity) since he has been in office.  Do the citizens of Kentucky not realize that his push to release companies from liability in the recent Covid-19 Relief bill would have disproportionately hurt the most vulnerable.  It would be the companies who pay beneath a living wage (#amazon #walmart) who would have benefited and since the median wage in Kentucky is $34,000 it would hit hard in the state he supposedly represents.   All Mitch cares about is Mitch and his power.  He went into office poor and is now worth over $40M.  It isn't smart investing since he was paid less than $200,000 before he became Leader...ask yourself how you start out making less than 60K a year when he began and end up with millions.  Insider tips on stocks...knowing that a bill will be killed and the impact to the companies in that sector....    Until Joe Biden published his books he was not financially flush...so who is the crook?  Joe Biden has 20 years of taxes posted for your review.   crooks hide their tax returns..Sound familiar?"

And in their GOP purity, they keep hating democrats that basically feed them, through money sent from the blue states that are the real economic engines of America. Dystopian is the word that comes to mind to describe the alternate reality most of the inhabitants of thise states live in, abetted, no doubt, by its  senators, that are more than happy to perpetrate this fantasy as long as it keeps them in power."
2020-12-29 07:07:23,"Once again I read about low-income, low information citizens that keep voting for people who will do nothing but hurt them. To stop this cycle, we need to teach civics every year in school. Kids should be able to recite the major party platforms the way they can memes on Instagram. They should understand the positions in government the way they understand what a forward does in basketball. Education has failed."
2020-12-29 07:53:17,"Kentuckians and all the rural poor conservatives get excellent opportunities for fellowship with like-minded others.  They pass news about food banks, pay medi-share bills, and share conspiracies about the lost election. They also take all these feelings to church.  The good feelings derived from these collaboration events compensate for material well-being.  People may be poor, miserable, but happy to share the pain together.  If they were in more liberal areas or countries, they would get subsidies and stay alone and depressed.  
The democrats had better understand the evolutionary reasons why the poor turn conservative."

2020-12-29 08:14:36,I'd like to ask some of those diehard Trump fans and McConnell supporters in Kentucky how much longer they will continue to vote against their own interests.

2020-12-29 08:28:54,"So, from way over here, my Blue State Democratic Party tax Dollars go to pay for Federal and State government services and jobs in rural Kentucky and other Red States.  And I'm okay with that.  The United States includes Red and Blue and Purple.  I don't even complain when Red Staters take my tax money and then insult my Blue State values.
 
But then Kentuckians vote for Congressmen, Senators, and a President that insist on taking my tax money away from them, then complain about jobs lost and hardships suffered because of the cuts they insist on.
 
I hate to say it, but i find it hard to feel sympathy for people who insist on repeating the same mistakes over and over."
2020-12-29 09:04:32,"It would be interesting to see the source of campaign funds for both Senators McConnell and Rand.  Used to be the coal  industry that held sway in state politics, but it seems to be losing power. Wonder where today's funds originate. 
Instead of suggesting that money for foreign aid steals dollars from the state, Senators Rand and Mitchie could introduce legislation to build up infrastructure, including internet service to rural counties---FDR did it with the REA, an agency that still exists today.  Add funds to wire all the houses down those hollers---offer internet learning for both kids and adults, with a focus on job skills and enhanced literacy for the adults. Include things like an online simple medical and health site with professional advisors online.
The repubs act like it's their own personal bank account when considering public works and support for the poor while assuring us that the deficit is not a problem while throwing billions at the big corporations and uber rich.  
The second the dumpster lost, the Deficit became the bogey man again---a deficit incurred by cutting taxes on mega rich, and engineered by the repubs, let us remember.
President Biden and his team will try to improve the lives of these folks while battling the very people those states count on to represent them in Washington. Weird isn't it?"

They can work two minimum wage jobs if they can get hired but that’s it. Until these people walk in the average voter’s shoes long enough to understand trying to make ends meet, hassle with bureaucracy for aid for food, housing and heat, and have to choose between filling a prescription and paying the electric bill they are clueless. Lack of empathy ought to be disqualifying for  any candidate as well."

With the dismal results for the people of this state turned in by their representatives in Washington, year after year, and after electing a Democratic governor, why aren’t Democrats doing more to make the case for change.  McConnell just won re-election overwhelmingly.   His challenger, McGrath was crushed.   She failed to inspire voters but was the party’s ‘safe’ choice."
2020-12-29 09:03:37,"When you fight quality education for all, it is easy to dupe the uneducated. You can then convince them to vote against their own interests. Republicans have a history of supporting only the schools that they want their children to attend--the private ones."
2020-12-29 09:36:34,"“It’s really driven it home that I was right to not fully trust them — never, never, never.”

Why does this not translate to not trusting Republican and changing Kentucky’s vote?  McConnell foments gov’t failure to achieve this outcome.  Kentucky votes for him because Republicans claim to be for small govt when they actually believe govt is to serve the rich.  Ridiculous logic to claim giving more money to the wealthy makes them work more and giving it to the poor makes them work less.  Same logic blames “others” those “foreigners”  receiving US aid as the problem.  The scale is wrong. Like claiming that if one did not buy a pack of gum they could make a mortgage payment.

Rand Paul, born to a famous father and given every advantage,  is a libertarian representing one of the leading welfare states, the least libertarian acting state in the country?  How does this make sense?  Republican logic is absurd."
2020-12-29 07:13:34,tragically you reap what you sow.. but my guess is that most people in Kentucky support these guys they vote them into office overwhelmingly. This is another significant deficiency in our system of government where you can have a state like Kentucky basically dictate to the rest of the country what is passed in Congress. it is tyranny of the minority end of the ignorant - somehow we've got a rectify this part of our democracy we can't keep going like this forever it will sink us

It wouldn’t be right for Mitch to accept all your votes and then laugh while he goes back to serving the millionaires ‘n billionaires, and giant too-big-to-fail corporations, and our over-priced for-profit health care system.
Mitch wouldn’t go to working for companies that destroy the land and air, by eliminating regulations, and blocking the efforts of the EPA? Would he?!
At heart, good Ol’ Mitch’s primary concern is those Kentuckians who’re struggling to survive through this awful pandemic.

One example demonstrating the confluence of all of these influences that gives a disturbing insight into the area is the case of the fast-talking preacher Dan Johnson who rode Trump's coattails of white grievance to elected state office from Bullitt County just south of Louisville. In some states his history of hate speech, racist Facebook posts and general derision for African-Americans and Muslims might have disqualified him as a candidate. That wasn't the case in Bullitt County, KY.

America is supposed to be a constitutional democratic republic. However, it is obvious that the demos, we the common people, are not sovereign and our representatives in the legislature are primarily representing their own financial interests rather than ours. Considering America’s issues, gross economic inequality and resulting severe socioeconomic problems and how poorly our government addresses them, I think the time is long overdue for us to formally reconsider our system of government and how we are operating within it."
2020-12-29 08:31:24,What we see in Kentucky is a form of 21st century American Feudalism. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul are fronts for the state’s feudal ruling elite.

Trump won Kentucky by a wide margin but there were only 2.2 million voters  total out of the  155 million total voters in 2020 election.These republican voters have not only voted against their own best interests, but also have given craven politicians like McConnell and Rand the ability to undermine  the interests of our entire country. This represents a grave threat to our future and should be changed if we hope to have a sensible government that can manage future challenges like this pandemic."

It can be assured that the wealthy and corporate interests that make up the donor class of Paul and McConnell are prospering greatly due to the GOP tax cuts.  And the trickle down effect has proven again to be a fantasy.  Sadly GOP message that government is the problem seems to have taken hold to the point where government is blamed for the problem and for not solving the problem when Trump, McConnell, Paul, et. al.  have been driving the bus for four years."
2020-12-29 11:24:56,"Conservatives have been wooing working-class whites from the Democratic Party for over 50 years now by appealing to their hidden opposition to the cultural changes in American society, primarily the push for equal rights by people of color, women, and LGBT members. In some instances, in their rhetoric, conservatives felt the need to blame the advancement of minorities for the economic problems of the white working-class. But over time, white working-class cultural opposition grew so intense that this became largely unnecessary. In the 1960s, during “The Civil Rights Movement,” conservatives used this approach, “The Southern Strategy,” to end the Democratic Party’s domination of Southern politics. Over time, conservatives have seized upon openings left by the Democrats’ advocacy for other minority groups and working-class whites have responded by increasingly abandoning the Democratic Party. So, to answer a question many readers are asking, many working-class whites across the heartland of America vote Republican primarily due to an ongoing culture war that is framed and stoked by conservatives in the Republican Party to persuade them to abandon the party that is more closely aligned with their economic interests, the Democratic Party."

2020-12-29 13:58:13,Rand Paul blaming Kentucky's Governor  for the economic pain caused by the pandemic is one of the big reasons for the upsurge.

Kentucky stands as perhaps the best example of people who like to be abused, but they are not alone in that desire. Many states, including all red states but many blue states as well, are filled with people who can do nothing but elect leaders who do not represent them.

The members of the cults like abuse. I guess that is not NEWS.  They have faith that in the end their selected leaders will be cruel and they will suffer and God will be happy, and that is how they will go to heaven. They could also just smash themselves in the face with a hammer.

Their desire for abuse is, of course, denied by the cult followers, but their actions say otherwise. We must believe that if someone continually repeats actions that lead to their own suffering, it is not a mistake, but their true desire. Mass cult masochism will always drag the rest of us down."

McConnell is prime example of Republican voters choosing any Republican, no matter how bad the candidate, over a Democrat to their own detriment."

2020-12-29 17:16:22,"Typically, the states representatives to the House focus on their constituents in the local community.  Somehow the House has morphed into some national policies driver.  The Senate typically focuses more on national issues.  These Senators are right to question the bill.  

It's not about $300 or $600 or $2000.  It's about the pork, which is astounding and should embarrass DC as a whole.  But it's also about a lack of consideration as to need.  $600 doesn't do much in NYC, but does a whole lot for people in KY.  When a couple is making $149,000 a year, they do not need any money from the government.  When a family makes less than $30,000 a year, and it's due to covid, they do need help.

But, the House sees this as an opportunity to redistribute wealth and uses a sledge hammer to pound a safety pin.  We wonder what's wrong with government?  Look no further than DC corruption, laziness, and sheer stupidity as they push 
forward one size fits all solutions in a drive to be reelected."

McConnell had been vey vocal about not wanting to support government in the pandemic relief bill, stating the position over and over agin since last spring and during his reelection campaign.  Given that, nobody in Kentucky should be surprised by the suffering.  A look at election results brings home the fact that, apparently, rural Kentuckians are more than happy to suffer as long as the other guys (blue states) suffer more.  By a factor of over 2.4x the voted for continued poverty for their counties.

Aside from child and opiate abuse, the state excels in nothing.  We're poor.  We're sick.  We're hungry.  We're uninsured, unemployed, uneducated.  But they insist on voting for politicians who will not help them.  This is a self-inflicted wound.  Instead of cleaning and treating it, we dig deeper into it with a dirty knife.  This is what they wanted, voted for.   Even in the middle of the pandemic, watching family and friends struggle, most likely struggling themselves like they never have before, they literally chose poverty over progress.  Bless their hearts."

In my county more than 80% voted for McConnell and Trump. In 2012 Obama got 19% of the vote. I gave money. I wrote posts. Of course, I voted. But Andy Beshear, our slightly nerdy practicing Christian who nearly tears up talking about people who die is in memes wearing an SS uniform and I'll be surprised if he wins a second term (if his predecessor hadn't insulted teachers, he wouldn't have squeaked by this time).

If these very voters had voted Democratic, they would have made the difference in the Senate that would have allowed greater relief to have arrived months ago.  
Their conclusion is to never trust the government again.  The correct conclusion should be never to vote Republican again.  What do Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisana all have in common?  They are all states in desperate need of relief, yet they voted for Republican Senators that are blocking the relief the Democrats have been trying to get to them.  
Why can't the voters in these states see the connection between how they vote and their situations?"
2020-12-29 18:24:48,"This is a response to many of the readers who don't understand why Kentucky citizens vote for McConnell and Paul. It is because the Republicans have done a great job of demonizing Democrats. Voters are not enamored with McConnell and Paul. Voters have been convinced that Democrats will raise their taxes and take away their jobs. Democrats need explain that the wealthy have not been paying their share of taxes; taxes will go up for the wealthy not the middle class. We need to explain that the economy is changing and jobs need to change with it. Clean energy is the future, not coal.

The free money the left wants to provide is only so that it can buy time to destroy the little guy. If you haven't noticed, the stock market is doing fine. Why? Big highly capitalized companies are picking up the slack where the little guy can't compete.

2020-12-29 20:03:05,"It's amazing, but unsurprising, that Republicans try to blame Gov. Andy Beshear for their problems.  Flat lies are always more effective than anything else.  

The facts tell a different story.  Kentucky and Tennessee aren't that different, but Tennessee has a Republican governor who followed Trump's murderous advice about pandemic safety, while Gov. Beshear followed science to save Kentuckian lives.  The results so far?  

In Tennessee the death rate yesterday was 99.1 per 100,000 people--about one in a thousand Tennesseans have died of COVID-19.  In Kentucky it was 57.7 deaths per 100,000 people, almost half the death rate in Tennessee.  If the two states had the same rate, there would be 1,830 more dead Kentuckians.  

It's sad and painful when bars, nail shops, and other ""essential"" businesses close, and people lose jobs.  But it's temporary and survivable, and would be even more survivable if Kentucky's two senators had been willing to fund the more generous relief bill that both Trump and the Democratic House tried so hard to pass.  

My own opinion is that people's lives matter more than money.  I guess that makes me a radical socialist liberal communist dupe in the universe of Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell.  I'm for sure a fan of Andy Beshear."

The current occupant of the White House signed the bill after unemployment assistance lapsed for millions of Americans, but before a government shutdown.; he guaranteed that many of the least fortunate among us receive one less week of help through this pandemic than they were entitled to under the bill.  I’m certain his enablers in the Republican Party are actually cheering this development.  We can’t be rid of him and the gop quickly enough."

2020-12-28 01:27:22,"Of course he was going to sign it. The threat to not sign it was all part of Trump's modus operandi to drive the GOP who might not support his coup attempt, the punditry who can't believe any human would act like this, and his base, crazy (the last cazy with delight). I'm sure he loves the knee-jerk responses he gets from acts like this... 

I am particularly disappointed in the media who go into a frenzy on T's actions on these things. Rather, they should matter-of-factly report in very dry terms that ""T has said he won't sign the bill but we won't believe it until the deadline has past."" End of story and on to something else."

2020-12-28 01:26:22,I would like to personally thank President Trump for picking up his pen and doing the right thing.  He’s now about three weeks away from truly being The Conspiracy Theorist In Chief.  We all know that the real reason that Trump didn’t sign right away was because he wanted a beat to figure out if he could skimpy of that money for himself.  Donald put the “dis” in Disgrace.

So, it was no surprise that he suddenly decided the Bill stunk to high heaven (even though his WH had worked closely on the deal) and refused to sign. And, again, no surprise when he just as suddenly changed course . . . gosh, how he shall be missed by the chiropractors of the world (less whiplash patients)."

The country is in crisis and he managed to make the story about himself."
2020-12-28 01:25:07,"You know what I was going to comment on this but at this point thoughts around Trump’s actions or inactions are not worth my time.  I am done - consider this the last time he will take up any space in my outlook.  

May 2020 end knowing the world is a better place without him having any authority for decision making affecting others but only himself."
2020-12-28 01:24:24,"Trump never cared about the plight of average Americans. In four years, when he runs again, he will say he tried to get $2,000 checks but the establishment stopped it. Unfortunately, a substantial percentage of Americans will believe it."
2020-12-28 01:27:43,"He’ll be remembered for a lot of things, none of them very flattering. This last hissy-fit accomplished nothing except for ruining the Christmas holiday for tens of millions of Americans who are on the edge of financial ruin. He loves to create stress and confusion so that he can be the center of attention, have everyone on the edge of their seats waiting for his next idiotic utterance. He can’t be gone soon enough."
2020-12-28 01:27:35,"The president must have become bored with the unenviable burden of a week of carefree golfing.

Perhaps someone on his staff might tell him how many Americans infected with the virus were turned away from ICU beds while he was in Mar-a-Lago.

Perhaps someone on his staff might tell him how many Americans face evictions or foreclosures while he was in Mar-a-Lago.

Perhaps someone on his staff might tell him how many Americans are unemployed while he was in Mar-a-Lago.

He signed a bill in which he had no skin in the game? And he wants a victory lap?

2020-12-28 01:32:03,"Another sign of Trump's weakness.  Ever since he lost the election, he has become more desperate and even pathetic.  He could have done this last week, of course, without yet another tantrum."
2020-12-28 01:32:26,"What was the point of all of this?  So Trump could be in the headlines again?  The presidency is a plaything to him.  Doesn't matter if millions of peoples' lives are at stake.  After a day of golf, he abruptly signs the the pandemic relief.  Trump not only is the worst president in U.S. history, but the most disgusting."
2020-12-28 01:31:39,False heroism in action.
2020-12-28 01:33:25,"I knew he'd sign it today after milking it for all the publicity he can.

This is a pattern he established early in his mis-administration, i.e., do something outrageous on at the start of a weekend to keep the MSM in a tizzy for days as they bandy his name about ... Trump did this ... Trump did that ... Trump didn't do such and such  ... all weekend long ... Trump Trump Trump. 

Trump hates the media and he loves getting them all spun up and making them work all weekend while he laughs his way across a golf course. He does this a lot and the press falls for it every week."
2020-12-28 01:31:05,Consistent with his long known business practices over more than 40 years. Stiff the creditor mentality. Suspect that his youngest son sat down and explained the bill to him. Maybe some enticement from his companion. Entire nation just counting the days.
2020-12-28 01:32:24,"This is partial good new since “... the move came after two critical unemployment programs lapsed, guaranteeing a delay in benefits for millions of unemployed Americans.” He’s still a monster who has jeapordized American lives again because... he never really cared."
2020-12-28 01:34:19,"Keeping the spotlight on himself. In his alternate world all and any attention flatters his ego, feeds his hard-core audience, and prepares for a new Trump un-reality news channel that will  funnel dollars into his pockets."
2020-12-28 01:31:52,"What’s wrong, Trump? Did you become bored with this game you were playing with the lives of Americans? You could not care any less how much money Americans got in that stimulus package. You just needed to fiddle some more while everything around you continued to burn."
2020-12-28 01:32:48,"600 dollars might not be enough for a lot of people, but it’s better than nothing. Hopefully our new president, Joe Biden, will be able to follow up and offer a more generous package. At least we know Biden will not be playing golf in a multi million venue while pretending he cares for struggling American people. From day 1 to the last day in office, Don’s presidency will be remembered as a hard-to-erase stain on this beautiful country"
2020-12-28 01:31:27,$600 worth of crumbs from the oligarchs. This is not relief. This is mockery.
2020-12-28 01:31:05,"We are now learning how much damage Trump can do in the short time he has left.  If there are still any grownups left in his Administration and Congress, please invoke the 25th Amendment now so that he can be removed from office, like tomorrow!"
2020-12-28 01:31:27,"Surprise, surprise, surprise. Always was going to sign this. Kept the charade long enough to continue the grift—make a few more bucks from supporters inexplicably believing he is working.  Probably did not even realize the timing issue that cost many innocents their unemployment benefits—while he makes a few more bucks at their expense.  Worst President—ever."
2020-12-28 01:33:01,"Thank goodness he signed it!  Now Toomey won't have to worry that 45* will be remembered for ""chaos and misery and erratic behavior""!  Phew!"
2020-12-28 01:33:02,Another reminder of why he should never have been president and thankfully lost the election.  But as bad as he is the people who continue to support him are far worse.
2020-12-28 01:32:16,So millions of people lose out on unemployment for a week so he could have temper tantrum and pretend like he matters or cares. The next 24 days can’t go fast enough.
2020-12-28 01:32:53,The $600 in direct payments to individuals is insulting and a slap in the face for tens of millions of Americans who are desperately suffering. The bill is packed with pork for special interests and a few crumbs for the people. Shame on Democrats who first proposed the bill with zero direct payments and these were introduced after Bernie and Sen. Howley insisted but they got far less than demanded. A sham all around.
2020-12-28 01:32:56,"Was he visited by three ghosts in the night?  Playing games with peoples' lives isn't funny.  I don't know why any of those republicans are letting him bully them.  Those in office already won - they're in, he's out.  He's a big man-child having a tantrum and making all kinds of threats because he didn't get his way.  Let him go and move on to a better future.  Trump already checked out of doing anything Presidential after the election."
2020-12-28 01:32:04,"Of course he did, no surprise; it was all just keeping himself in the news. Media is over-analyzing, as if Trump has any plan, any role in governing. He’s bern a random mistake in history, start to finish."
2020-12-28 01:33:20,It will be an even greater relief than having the Coronavirus Bill finally being passed (as needed as it is) when it can be finally said that the lives of so many Americans can no longer be held hostage in the capricious hands of a President Donald J Trump. What more mischief he may engender between now and his eventual ejection from the Oval Office I shudder to imagine.
2020-12-28 01:32:47,"Trump has all but checked out on anything requiring leadership or caring in general, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he just signed it as a way to just get to Mar-a-Lago as quickly as possible and not have to do anything work related."
2020-12-28 01:35:07,"What a ""disgrace"" is right.

The President literally panicked millions of Americans and sent them to bed in tears the last few nights while pretending he was not going to sign this economic relief bill.

What a sadistic, cruel, petty man."
2020-12-28 01:34:30,"If I pour bleach into my ear, will this horrible man leave my mind?"
2020-12-28 01:35:19,Only a lunatic would do what #45 just did!  January 20 can't come soon enough!
2020-12-28 01:36:17,"MSM is trapped... chasing its tail every time this lunatic leaves his hairdresser, freshly sprayed... and shows how utterly nuts he is...

Attention, attention, the Orange Man is in charge. How are my ratings... 

Ed Koch used to ask, how am I doing... to citizens emerging from the MTA.

Well, Trump knows how he is doing. Maria B at FOX owns her seat... and she gives this buffoon more attention at every interval... as he raises money from the hapless fools that see him as their savior... 

What has happened to America. We cannot see the fool for what he is? Or do we want a fool to entertain us? 

We need David Riesman, Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denny to return with an updated version of The Lonely Crowd..."
2020-12-28 01:35:27,"The chaos-creating, attention-seeking, self-absorbed, beyond-dysfunctional, pathetically narcissistic, wildly racist, rabidly anti-immigrant, disgustingly anti-LGBTQ , deeply misogynistic, flagrantly immoral, astonishingly inept, disturbingly unethical and incomparably child-like inhabitant of the White House believes he'll be remembered for signing this COVID-19 relief legislation. He is much more likely to be bitterly remembered for four long years of pain, misery and upheaval - see above."
2020-12-28 01:36:30,"Typical Trump!

Here's how it goes

1. Trump creates a crisis
2. Everyone runs around, hair on fire, trying to soothe Trump and placate him and do damage control with the press. 
3. Trump reverses himself and backtracks on his reckless actions. 
4. Trump claims VICTORY for solving the crisis he created. 
5. The MAGA-heads genuflect to their Dear Leader for his generosity and care. 

By now completely predictable, and thoroughly, thoroughly  sickening. 

This is no way to run our nation. Begone, Trump! Begone!"
2020-12-28 01:36:25,"""... chaos and misery and erratic behavior..."" is EXACTLY what he'll be remembered for, along with being a serial liar. He's THE WORST president this country has ever had, or ever will have."
2020-12-28 01:35:02,"There is something especially sick about this latest stunt. Trump can play games once he gets to Mar a Lago, but this was such a disgrace with so many people in need of this help."
2020-12-28 01:35:39,"This guy. This vile, bile-spewing grifter “we” elected still has a few weeks to do more damage. Let’s all hope to stay upwind of him until he’s out."
2020-12-28 01:36:28,"Everybody- go to your windows on Jan. 20 at noon- and yell as loud as you can "" You're fired !""."

• golfed 296 times
• at a cost of $152 million to taxpayers

Thanks, Republicans!"

2020-12-28 01:36:05,"Toomey; “But the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior...""

The danger is already set in stone. Trumps legacy is set. But what was missing, was his whining and sore loser personality."
2020-12-28 01:36:35,I have long assumed that Trump suffers from a broader range of mental illness than just the narcissistic behaviors that define him. The events of the last few days lead me to wonder about bipolar disorder.
2020-12-28 01:34:36,"""This is a disgrace.""

""I alone can fix it!""

""New Information coming!""

""Look, I saved everyone! I'm a hero!""

Rinse, repeat, put it back in the Trump tumbler.

Stay tuned for more theatrics to follow . . ."
2020-12-28 01:35:11,"Once again, the President and his clown car of Congressional supporters put the American people through days of worry and fear while he stayed the center of attention. 

I, for one, will neither forgive nor forget what he and his allies have done to this country."
2020-12-28 01:35:53,"Nothing changed in the deal. Where was the art or the heart?  It was brinksmanship fueled by pique that sowed only more misery and anxiety. Good job, Donnie."
2020-12-28 01:35:27,... And now a word from our sponsors.
2020-12-28 01:35:18,"Just seems like another temper tantrum, or is that Trump tantrum. Only a few more weeks and we can relax a bit."
2020-12-28 01:36:06,"Not sure of the timing (this week vs next week), but because Trump signed the stimulus bill today the unemployed will lose one week of unemployment insurance... Smh"
2020-12-28 01:36:34,True to his behaviour Trump does what he is good at and known for. Just to tell the world I exist. And that is the way he feels he is important. The drama was uncalled for. It served no purpose. Except to satisfy Trump’s ego. 74 million people who voted for this man are also complicit in this act.
2020-12-28 01:34:29,"Someone reminded him that Nancy Pelosi/Democrats would get credit for the $2,000 as she was bringing it to the House TOMORROW for a vote.

Couldn't have that."
2020-12-28 01:34:43,"“...legislation that will offer an economic lifeline to millions of Americans...”

That sounds a lot better than “legislation that was thrown together at the last minute that gives ￼but a fraction of the monetary aid that other developed democracies have given their citizens”."
2020-12-28 01:34:09,"Wonderful news. 

My only regret is that we won't get a roll call vote in the House on the $2000 check proposal to see the names of Republicans who would refuse more aid to Americans in need."
2020-12-28 01:34:58,"His base may continue to adore him, including those who are unemployed and just lost a week of benefits.  But the GOP  enablers who have feared him will be as thrilled to be rid of his chaos as will Democrats.  Trump is going to have such a crisis when he learns that the main stream media, which he loves both to hate and to watch, will not be covering him after January 29.  To not have his histrionic need for attention satisfied may finally lead to that nervous breakdown of which he has always been on the edge."
2020-12-28 01:35:54,So now that unemployment expired in order to reinstate it will there be a delay? What are the differences now from what was happening before? What’s the impact to ordinary Americans?
2020-12-28 01:36:05,"By signing the Omnibus/Pandemic Relief bill into law I believe Mr. Trump has sealed his status of fading into the background after January 3, 2020 and January 20, 2020. 

By obfuscating he has shown to be incapable of making valid and reliable decisions."
2020-12-28 01:41:07,"Meanwhile, Gov. Inslee had already managed to eke out a one-time $550 check from the State budget for each of the 95,000 Washingtonians who receive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, to help tide them over. He has also extended the eviction moratorium through March. Having a Governor like Inslee does take a little bit of the edge off."
2020-12-28 01:38:14,"Sad little drama queen begging for attention.

He looks weak and cold hearted.. not too far removed from his true self.

Hurry up January 2021.  Can we warp speed it, please?"
2020-12-28 01:40:39,"We have a deadly pandemic, a floundering economy, devastated businesses...but our biggest problem is the idiot in the White House. 
Can’t wait til he’s gone...just counting the days!"
2020-12-28 01:40:53,He is the disgrace!  Playing with people's lives.  JUST LEAVE

2020-12-28 01:39:01,"Cruel, cruel, cruel...."
2020-12-28 01:36:55,Trump is a disgrace .Whatever he was thinking -what ever game he is  playing needed to stop. Across the country people are suffering and many are dying. What does he do instead of performing the duties of his office? He sulks and throws a fit like a child who did not get his way. That is not leadership that is dereliction of duty. I am glad that he signed but what he people through was cruel & unnecessary. Thankfully on January 20 2021 adults will be back in charge. I wish he would stay at in Florida and cheat at golf. The nation will be better off and besides he has checked  out after the election.
2020-12-28 01:39:50,Narcissistic press ploy on the part of the president.  Playing golf all weekend on our dime and exponentially increasing the despair and panic for our citizens at highest risk.Please go away NOW.
2020-12-28 01:40:21,"He must of ran out of toys to throw out of the pram during this, his latest tantrum. 

Just a few weeks to go and his tantrums will no longer hold your country hostage."
2020-12-28 01:39:03,Gone soon is not soon enough.
2020-12-28 01:41:17,"Perhaps he was hit on the head with a golf ball, his caddie told him to sign the bill or he worried   that Rudy's hair dye might run again if he started sweating with the anguish."
2020-12-28 01:38:35,"There’s no good explanation for his behavior, political or otherwise, so the only remaining explanation is that it’s personal. 
We have at the helm a man who jerks the country around for his personal amusement."
2020-12-28 01:40:07,I wonder what the behind the scenes negotiations were. Trump demanding complete immunity in exchange for his signature. Deals with the devil always go awry!
2020-12-28 01:41:37,"As always, why do Congressional and Senate Republicans bow to him?  His actions make him appear out of touch and unable to keep up with his own negotiations besides uncaring and thoughtless.   He does not appear very smart when it’s obvious he is not paying attention. 

McCarthy and the rest of his delegation look pathetic and weak when they toddle after him."
2020-12-28 01:40:26,"He got, by delaying, what he wanted,, attention, power, revenge. From an Adlerian perspective, that’s 3 of the 4 goals of misbehaviour.
A little boy displaying similar behaviours in an elementary school sandbox would trigger a major behavioural intervention.
Thankfully 80 million people did intervene."
2020-12-28 01:39:35,"The sad part is Trump gave up a chance to play the Grinch Who 
Stole Christmas and New Years and some date beyond, one upping the Grinch who merely stole Christmas. What a guy, what a grinch, what an unhappy fella."
2020-12-28 01:40:15,"Every day that President Trump didn't sign the COVID-19 relief bill, many Georgia early voters were influenced to vote for the two Democrat candidates for a real change in 2021 and beyond!"
2020-12-28 01:40:17,"He met his goal; cause turmoil and angst and get more attention for himself before he headed off for a golf weekend. We are under 30 days with this guy, hope the military is ready to resist any major military strikes he wants to do on Iran."
2020-12-28 01:37:51,"Donald must have been so busy looking for more criminals to pardon that he simply forgot that there was an economic relief bill lying on his desk.

What a guy."
2020-12-28 01:38:18,"“I understand he wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks,” Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on Fox News. “But the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.” News flash, Senator Toomey: the cow is already out of the barn on the chaos, misery, and erratic behavior."
2020-12-28 01:40:10,"Ds and Rs should be ashamed for failing to address the massive financial crisis millions of Americans are enduring and for failing to address the millions of people without healthcare during a pandemic.

But instead of standing up like heroes for those who really need their help now, the plutocrats in congress throw them crumbs."
2020-12-28 01:41:10,"He probably thought that after this, he will be irrelevant. What else is there for him to do before 20 Jan? Even his hinting at some big news event on 6 Jan is not gaining much traction."
2020-12-28 01:39:05,"Same old song and dance...drama, drama, drama. Then...backpedal...mission accomplished. People talked about him.
I'm still praying for a time that I don't hear, see or think of this stain on America."
2020-12-28 01:37:46,"I guess he just wanted to be the center of attention. A four year old. I think he finally realized that a veto would have lost both Georgia Senate elections. Those poor Republicans would have been in a lose-lose situation. Side with Pelosi and vote for $2,000; or vote against Trump. Lose-lose."
2020-12-28 01:38:59,"Of course Donald Trump signed the bill. He just wanted to put himself in the spotlight once again, in the waning days of his playing at being president. Twenty-six days left to spend his time destroying all he can get his hands on."
2020-12-28 01:41:04,I guess he figured he’d gotten as much mileage as he could out of this publicity stunt.
2020-12-28 01:37:35,"I honestly thought he would veto it. It would be a way to test Republicans’ fealty. But he didn’t follow through. When it comes down to it, he’s basically gutless."
2020-12-28 01:36:52,"Good news for all those who will receive support through this bill.  

Too bad it had to be an anguishing waiting period for all before the President did what his people needed so desperately."
2020-12-28 01:39:11,"Maybe somebody explained the contents of the omnibus bill to Trump? Graham? No matter. Trump got his attention, but the important thing is to have it settled. Perhaps it's too much to hope that this is the last petulant episode we'll need to suffer before this circus ends."
2020-12-28 01:37:56,"This stall on signing the relief bill gave Trump what he continuously craves above all. Attention. Like a petulant child he demands being center stage. As the final curtain falls on his disruptive, irresponsible leadership, the relief America will feel will be more than about the extension of pandemic relief. America will be relieved that there will be no second season of the entertainment extravaganza known as Trump Apprentice President. It’s been cancelled by popular request."
2020-12-28 01:40:42,"Of course this whole fiasco had nothing to do with fiscal responsibility, concern for the people without food, lodging, work.  It was all about grabbing the spotlight for a last curtain call.

Trump is like the man who pushes someone in the water and then dives in to save them to play the hero. So now for his cult followers, he is the savior of the downtrodden masses by rescuing them at the last minute."
2020-12-28 01:40:47,"The passive voice, “The president had largely been sidelined during months of negotiations...” is less than accurate. “The President busy sulking and creating alternate election realities sidelined himself during months of negotiations..” would have been more so."
2020-12-28 01:37:43,"Only Trump could sign thus bill after he already  delayed unemployment benefits to the vulnerable Americans on this Christmas weekend. Why did he not sign the bill before the benefits expired?
What was the point? Other to demonstrate how callous, unthinking, and incompetent he is.
If he were truly interested in a  more generous 2000 dollar payment  he could go on TV and endorse Pelosi’s upcoming bill and demand that the Republicans pass that increase as a Christmas gift to those suffering immensely from the pandemic! He could  use political pressure  and persuasion to threaten McConnell by getting his base  and the Right Wing media to support his goals."
2020-12-28 01:38:06,"I'm not sure why he's even worried about the bill passing at this point. He'll be able to retire in style on January 20, and have millions of adoring fans willing to do anything he asks of them...I sure wouldn't be worried about anything.

Don't forget -- for everyone who thinks Trump is ill-suited to lead, there are tons of others who think he's their savior. He was very smart to tell his followers in the beginning to only listen to him...it makes it very easy to control the message,"
2020-12-28 01:42:50,This has been ridiculous and asinine.
2020-12-28 01:43:22,"What a sick, cruel and inhumane person. And I use the word “person” lightly. 

He got his last minute last round of sadistic pleasure at the expense of millions of Americans fear and anxiety. 

He can’t leave soon enough."
2020-12-28 01:43:22,"My goodness, Trump lost the election fair and square to Joe Biden  , even in the five red states.
Now he is refusing to leave and throwing fits at every chance he gets , he has about three some weeks left to relinquish his dominance and vacate the White House.

So his last chance was to show his weight around he refused to sign the stimulus check and was watching with glee to see people  starve.

Then while vacationing the tardy President  said he is going to sign ."
2020-12-28 01:43:39,"Yet another show, the trump show. Just trying to capture headlines and attention, making people react and comment. His cruelty and lack of empathy for Americans is a bottomless pit. He never will do anything that is not in his own self interest. This was another one of those things. He is trying to keep everyone’s attention. I hope his last attempt on Jan 6 goes up in flames. I pity those who think he is their savior because he will be sure to save himself first and leave everyone behind to drown as his ship goes down."
2020-12-28 01:44:50,"As soon as it lost it's media punch, he reneges."
2020-12-28 01:43:50,"Trump, the most superfluous person on this planet. 
Wrecking everything he touches."
2020-12-28 01:43:11,"True to form, this immature petty, man-baby creates, yet again, chaos and misery.  We are all better off if he’ll just stay at home eating fast food and watching Fox News until January 20."
2020-12-28 01:44:45,Our hero! Whatta guy.
2020-12-28 01:44:07,Temper Tantrum Trump trips over the latest tribulation of his own making. The country suffers. To think 70  million sad souls willingly voted for this charlatan...
2020-12-28 01:43:19,"Maybe Trump just wanted to be in the news over the Christmas holiday.  He probably felt ignored and without giving it a lot of thought, he decided to hold up the Covid Relief Bill.  He realized that would surely get the mainstream media’s attention, which it did. 

Then during four days of golf, he must have seen the stuff hit the fan across the ideological spectrum, including on the Sunday morning shows.  With the government scheduled to shut down on Tuesday, he realized there was no easy way out of the mess that he had created.  So, he put his tail between his legs and signed the bill.  

The real disgrace is that Trump would be so cavalier about the fate of millions of Americans— whom he shamelessly mocked with his “let them eat cake” move and who have been waiting for this assistance for months!  January 20, 2021 cannot come fast enough—as the saying goes, good riddance to bad rubbish!"
2020-12-28 01:42:22,I wonder if he’ll put his name on these checks too?
2020-12-28 01:43:32,He signed the bill so he wouldn’t have to return to DC.
2020-12-28 01:44:50,No lights on the golf course? Donnie has to be in the spot light. So predictable and so reprehensible. He and his Republican enablers all need to take a final bow and leave the country to heal.
2020-12-28 01:44:53,Seems to me Trump was making a stink about raising the support amount to $2000 so he can appear to be “looking out for his public.” He knows there was no way it would get through Congress. But he looks like the hero and he can blame someone else for the larger amount not going through.
2020-12-28 01:43:20,"No applause from this American.  Think about what Trump did.  He basically held the American people hostage.  Do we really believe it was ever about a $2000 check?  This was revenge to his Republican colleagues particularly in the Senate, and specifically Mitch McConnell, for FINALLY asserting that our elections were not fraudulent but indeed fair and lawful.  This was about Trump's insatiable appetite for the proverbial ""last word,"" and to show his faithful supporters that he remains omnipotent and omniscient.

No one can forget his machinations to overturn, by whatever means, a fair election. No one can forget his deceit. At the penultimate moment he has enhanced the prospects of Loeffler and Purdue in Georgia and other Republicans as well. My theory is he in a moment of irrational fury made a hasty decision, without adequate advice, and boxed himself in for there was no way out except to do what he should have done days ago. No one capitulated to his threats. He is done, almost gone and we are now wiser    (not as wise as our fellow citizens who saw through him earlier) and I rejoice in his departure."

“I understand he [trump] wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks,” Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on Fox News. “But the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”

COMMENT:
trump will surely be remembered for ""chaos and misery and erratic behavior"" -- at best, and irrespective of his petulant and 'disgracefully' delayed execution of the latest 'stimulus' bill. 

The meanwhile and forever, there is so much as bad and worse for which he'll be remembered, but nothing having anything to do with ""big checks"" -- except those he'll have to write to close the NY AG's investigation."

2020-12-28 01:50:53,"Wow, what an amazing and abrupt reversal in politics.  Trump joined the liberal left wing socialists in promoting a $2000 direct payment while the Democrats backed Mich McConnell and the conservatives that were against it.

This adds credibility to the claims by the Democrats that they do not support left wing political ideologies like socialism and communism.  We could be witnessing a return of the right of center, moderate Democrats from the Bill Clinton era of politics.

With approval ratings in the 70s, Clinton ran on a campaign to end welfare as a way of life and a tough on crime platform.  He signed both of his campaign promises into law, ending additional welfare payments to women that had more kids while they were on welfare.  His crime bill was so brutal that parts of it have been struck down due to global protests by human watch groups, civil rights leaders and foreign condemnation.  

He was a fiscal conservative that fought for the line item veto that Bush and Reagan had also wanted before him.  He got it for three years and slashed pork from every budget until he balanced it.  Bill Clinton is the only US president that ran a balanced budget in the last 50 years.

Joe Biden, who is right of center or a moderate on a global political scale, may very well be another Bill Clinton."

2020-12-28 01:50:27,He never intended to raise the checks. He just wanted to appear on the side of the American people and somehow blame the democrats for the failed bill. Which is why I'm suspicious of his last minute signature.

In four years he still doesn’t know how a bill becomes a law, or how government works. And he never possessed the curiosity to find out. This proves it. It was all about him and his perceived ‘winning’ legacy. What a monstrous disgrace he is.

It is time to end the “lame duck” period of the presidency. Once the Electoral College certifies the results, power should transfer immediately to the winner and be voided for the outgoing president.

Mitch McConnell refused to act for months even as the clock was running down. If not for the senate run offs, McConnell would likely still be resisting action.

Trump spent the last two months trying to overturn the election instead of doing his job. Too many in the Republican Party were actively supporting him in sedition.

At the last moment, Trump has signed off on a package even he derided as too small, even as he was complaining about “pork” that was requested by his own administration. (Not that he could be bothered to pay attention.)

The aid will have to do, but the real help will not arrive so long as Trump and McConnell remain in power, along with the Republican Party.

They are the real plague on our house."

Total attention seeking, narcissistic, sociopathic behavior.  

So glad he is not going to be our president in a few more weeks but worried about what other mischief he will cause.

There were more unemployed who were evicted and there was a separate foreclosure crisis that gutted countless neighborhoods, including mine. So those displaced far outnumbered those displaced today. 

There was no stimulus money to ease the pain back then. The present crisis is mild by comparison. And it has to be obvious to many readers whose neighborhoods were hit like mine. 

The outrage over far greater suffering during the Great Recession was insufficient to spur meaningful government aid. Now we shed crocodile tears and dole out trillions. Inconsistency to the max."

2020-12-28 01:59:23,"Over two days of worry and stress for people already burdened by the serial failures of this weak and incompetent president, more chaos for a nation that doesn’t need it. This is on you Trump voters & Republican sycophants."

2020-12-28 02:00:38,"Another Trump publicity stunt that caused unnecessary pain and stress for the nation, especially those in dire need of funds. In the annals of Trumpism, this will go down as one of his most uncaring, heartless actions."
2020-12-28 02:00:19,So the despot will sign the Covid Relief Bill.  After four years of Trump theatrics is anyone really surprised? It is ALWAYS about vanity and ego with this man.

How about you school and town and city and county and state workers, staring at mandatory layoffs in the next fiscal year? Nothing in that ""Pandemic Relief Bill"" to help you there.

Too bad you're not in the 1 percent that now pays Trump-sized taxes. What was that, $750 a year? Too bad you're not big-time investors manipulating Wall Street for record millions. Too bad you're not Republican senators from Georgia who get those sweet inside trading tips.

Too bad."

2020-12-28 01:59:50,"As Trump golfs while people die and scratch for food, I am reminded of a lead paragraph on a story by the late, great writer Hunter Thompson.

Thompson, then writing for ""The National Observer"" -- this in the days before turning ""gonzo journalist"" and achieving fame -- described the following scene in Sao Paulo:

On the rooftop of a modern high rise in that city split by opulence and poverty, wealthy British businessmen sipped gin and tonics between taking turns driving golfballs off their high throne into the shanty towns far below, where residents cooking dinner over open charcoal fires dodged and took cover.

I never thought I'd see the metaphor/anecdote depict what is happening in my country.

Trump might have finally signed this miserly aid package, but Thompson's imagery still stands. We have become a caste society."

The mark of a true authoritarian.  No empathy.  Endless cruelty.
2020-12-28 02:01:15,"Just another of Donald J. Trump's outrageous, cruel political stunts to deflect attention from the fact that he lost the election to Joe Biden by more than twice as many popular votes as he lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Loser!

He knew could only continue his ludicrous nonsense for a very limited time that he won the election, no matter what the vote tally and courts said. 

So he did what he always does when he fails (as he almost always does) and sowed chaos and confusion that would assuredly keep the focus on him, The Great I-AM (in his own mind).

Part of the outrage in his stunts is that almost always someone or lots of people (including small children) will get hurt, as they clearly did once again when he threw a monkey wrench into the relief package--all of which took place during a raging pandemic.

What a legacy, and what an exit for Trump from stage right. Here's hoping he takes lots of his GOP enablers with him.

So, if you want to know what a sociopath and a psychopath looks like, all wrapped into one--look at soon-to-be Ex-President Donald J. Trump."

He effectively destroyed the Christmas of already overtaxed, overanxious and ambiently distraught Americans by putting on a big grandiloquent dog and pony show of not signing this relief bill only to turn around and sign it today.

At first he seems to be entirely out it laying low and not appearing at all, while for months the two parties and other representatives of the government engage in grinding and slow negotiations.   Finally, an agreement is reached--a surprising accord in this era of partisanship--and both sides could not imagine that the accord would not be signed.  Suddenly, the lion awakes out of his hibernation and has to show his power, as temporary as it will be. and inflicts chaos on the completed negotiations and the cash distributions that might make life a little easier for Americans in these dire times.  What a disgusting display of ego and lack of empathy.  Where was Mr. Trump  all those months and why does he make his appearance after all is settled?  Does Senator Toomey really think Trump is thinking about his legacy and is not reacting like any child throwing a tantrum? Trump will be remembered as the unhappy grouch who could not accept losing  and would rather that all suffer than he be ignored.  So finally   the tantrum stopped.  Surprise."
2020-12-28 02:04:52,This is a Trumps style.He creates a crisis and then steps in as a savior to save the situation he himself created. All to get more attention. He can never have enough attention and will never get enough attention. And people will still take him at his word.

This was either a fit of pique or a bumbling effort to get Congressional Republicans behind his final coup attempt. (I don’t think he cares what people think of his pardons.) What a disgrace to the office and our country. 

Now can someone babysit the man-baby while he finishes out his term? Start with hiding the nuclear codes and give him a toy phone to ‘tweet’ on."

2020-12-28 02:07:32,"This late action is totally in line with everything else he's done in the course of his term in office.

His extreme narcissism has led to him waiting for legislators and his own advisors to come to him and kiss the hem of his garment (figuratively) and beg him to sign this legislation which is needed, not only for people desperate for relief from the effects of the shutdowns, but also to prevent the government from shutting down. A shutdown at this time would be catastrophic and even he knows that.

He wants, like he always wants, to be the center of attention. He also doesn't care who or what has to pay the price for that."

Representative Adam Kinzinger, (R) summed it up perfectly, ""I don’t understand what’s being done, why, unless it’s just to create chaos and show power and be upset because you lost the election. Otherwise I don’t understand it because this just has to get done.”"

2020-12-28 02:13:26,"I suspect Mr. Trump doesn't care whether the citizens of this country wind up with two grand or twenty cents in stimulus support. Yet the timing of his abrupt about-face suggests a complete vacancy of any political acumen. His charge that the bill was a ""disgrace"" (a word he uses far too often) was pulled from his usual arsenal of grievance, as if he was merely an innocent bystander in his own administration. But why not sign the bill on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day so he can finally upstage Jesus and be the (short-term financial) savior his followers proclaim? No dice. Two days late and 1.4K short. The showman's instinct has left the building and all that's left is a walking, talking tantrum whose only policy has been, and forever will be, 'spite.'"

2020-12-28 02:17:28,"As massive numbers of Americans are dying of Covid, or starving to death, or facing eviction, Trump took pleasure, as he golfed in luxury, in traumatizing them even further. 

Nice of Trump to take a second out of his non-stop vacation of golfing and whining about his unquestionably and decisively losing the election to Joe Biden to put a signature on a bill that he, not the Democrats, wanted. 

Talk about a disgrace; Trump refused to sign a relief bill (definitely not a stimulus bill) because a handful of Republicans finally had no choice but acknowledge what the world has known for almost 2 months; that Joe Biden beat Trump and is the President-elect. (Biden won by over 7 million votes, breaking the record for most votes in history for any presidential candidate, and Biden received 306 Electoral votes, while Trump got only 232, meaning this wasn't a close election). President-elect Biden's win was so decisive that even Republicans, like the venal Mitch McConnell, couldn’t overturn the results, no matter what Trump wanted. 

Trump has no problem signing so many pardons for his criminal co-conspirators that he's running out of ink; but out of pure vindictiveness he refused to authorize disbursement to millions of Americans of money which is already theirs, not his, and which was the package he wanted, not the Democrats.

Trump is a vicious, nasty piece of work. His cruelty knows no bounds.

2020-12-28 02:16:34,"Trump finally signed the Covid relief legislation and probably will demand some give him credit for doing so, while at the same time having a tantrum over the election. When will this guy grow up and take responsibility and accountability? I realize that won't happen. While I agree that the payments to the unemployed need to be larger, he could have been involved earlier in the process to push for it. This whole deal was by Trump all about Trump and his feelings. BAHH -- how about all the unemployed worried about going hungry, being evicted, being behind on bills, unable to support families? They do not matter to the tantrum throwing Trump. He is all about himself and no one else. January 20 brings in actual leadership to our country and the country desperately needs it."

This bill, with more generous payments, should have been in the can months ago.  They better start thinking about a larger stimulus for the American people in the new year.  Instead of wasting money on special interests and foreign entities, the American's that are hurting need to come first.  Stop telling us there is no money to improve the lives of Americans.  Shame on you all."
2020-12-28 02:16:52,"A friend asked me earlier this evening, “Does Trump think that his destructive, dramatic sulking and erratic behavior is somehow going to improve the general public’s opinion of him or his presidency?”
A good question, but I had no answer at the time.

However, after some consideration, it occurs to me that answering any question which begins with the three words, “Does Trump think...” is bound to be a shot in the dark.
Applying the verb “think” to whatever goes on in the president disordered mind, is probably misleading.

2020-12-28 02:19:50,"The only point of this drama was to keep his name at the top of the headlines, at the beginning of our newsfeed. Trump's greatest fear is coming true. His irrelevance. 
His parents witheld their attention, their approval and their praise. And this broken pathetic childish old man is just flailing about trying to be noticed. 
Next, please."
2020-12-28 02:19:07,"Oh but he loves the limelight.  Doesn't matter if it's 'good' or 'bad' just keep your eyes on ""ME""."
2020-12-28 02:19:10,LOL - I've got news for you Senator Toomey - he will be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior anyway.
2020-12-28 02:19:09,You can't run a private business in such dizzying fashion nor the government. The dysfunctional executive branch of Donald Trump can't end soon enough.
2020-12-28 02:20:14,"After ruining the holidays for millions of Americans by his infantile temper tantrum, Trump tries to hog the media’s attention by finally signing the funding bill. What a microscopic man. He, his political party and every single American who voted for him should be ashamed of themselves. Our country is in a nose dive."
2020-12-28 02:20:09,Quick cash the check before Pharoh changes his mind.
2020-12-28 02:21:41,Trump is such a Drama Queen waiting for the last minute to sign.  He only and always cared only for himself. He always played with the public and this is no different. I can't wait until he is gone and we the citizens will deal with reality.
2020-12-28 02:21:23,"Mr. Trump's antics over the weekend were cruel and totally unnecessary. Now there will be delays in restarting some programs, as I understand it, and millions of people will have suffered because of his chaotic behavior. 

In the meantime, he fiddles while Rome burns, playing golf and enjoying himself with his cronies; not a word about the thousands of deaths from the coronavirus, not a mention of the people who are left to fend for themselves after losing loved ones. 

Who knows what he will think of next before he leaves office? Why doesn't he stay in Mar-a-Lago with his pals."
2020-12-28 02:22:51,Such a pathetic cruel destroyer. Such cavalier disregard for people
2020-12-28 02:23:00,"Tone deaf and out of touch, no direction nor purpose, a raving spinning lunatic."
2020-12-28 02:23:07,Unfit to hold office.... Good riddance
2020-12-28 02:21:52,Thank God he’ll soon be gone.
2020-12-28 02:22:05,"Ever the drama queen, Trump rushes in at the last minute to solve a crisis of his own making."
2020-12-28 02:22:33,"The world looks on in amazement.  How could 70 million plus Americans vote for this spiteful narcissist?  Have they not seen his track record of using people for his own ends, cultivating loyalty and always betraying it himself?  Look at the litter of broken relationships, constant litigation, insults, business bankruptcy, failures, convicted felons, lies, demeaning insults behind him.  He cares for nobody outside of his family.  Why isn’t it obvious and motivating to more people?"
2020-12-28 02:22:21,Crazytown 24-7 is soon over.
2020-12-28 02:23:26,"It’s all about fake drama, narcissism and good television for Trump.  He has no principles and could care less about suffering Americans."
2020-12-28 02:23:17,"Trump was right about the $600 being a disgrace, but he really couldn't have cared less whether the amount was $2000 or 20 cents.The real reason he tried to derail the relief bill was because he wanted to stick it to Mitch McConnell for refusing to follow him into the election abyss."
2020-12-28 02:21:51,"It appears that Trump has set the stage for his ""supporters"" to be called out -- Pelosi announced as follows after Trump signed the bill: “Now, the President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000, which will be brought to the Floor tomorrow. Every Republican vote against this bill is a vote to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny the American people the relief they need.” 

Stay tuned . . ."
2020-12-28 02:22:17,"As usual, Trump can't even do something nice for people without torturing them first.  He and his need to be the center of attention left Americans -- his constituents (remember?) -- in limbo; in fear for days of losing benefits, with no comfort, no peace of mind, in a state of constant worry.  Trump is incapable of putting people at ease.  Everyone is expendable when it suits him.  What a cruel, rotten, unempathetic child.

This is what passes for a president to 72 million voters?"
2020-12-28 02:23:18,"Again DJ Trump comes to the rescue for a problem he created. ""Mr. president sir"" indeed..."
2020-12-28 02:22:34,This stunt helps further distract the people from how bad this Bill is.
2020-12-28 02:24:12,"The voter fraud scam, with less supporting evidence than the lock ness monster has, is not working for Trump. So this threatened veto was his next reality TV act,  to draw attention to him, to show that he still matters, even though he is  a lame duck who was decisively rejected by the voters."
2020-12-28 02:24:30,Please don't call it his estate and golf club. It is his motel and golf club. He signed away the right to live there.
2020-12-28 02:24:32,What more perfect a place for a psychopath to inflict pain than to be president of a country with 300 + million people dependent on you.
2020-12-28 02:24:59,"Once again, it all had to be about HIM.  Him and only him.

Without a doubt, this man will go down as the absolute WORST president in the history of this country."
2020-12-28 02:24:38,The American people are in an abusive relationship with the president.
2020-12-28 02:23:54,"Trump ""was sidelined during negotiations""? Let's correct: Trump refused to participate in negotiations."
2020-12-28 02:24:35,"Unfortunately Trump is actually right in that a 600 dollar check is an insult.  It's not going to keep people from being evicted, or catch up with bills.  That being said, if Trump really thought the amount was too low, why by wasn't he pushing the Senate to back a higher amount?  The House passed a bill in May, but Trump did nothing to push for action sooner.    And at the end of the day, his hissy fit didn't do anything except cause a lot of confusion and anxiety.  Yet now he will act like he is a big savior.  Just another example of how Trump really doesn't know how to make a deal."
2020-12-28 02:24:54,"The $600 is a pittance. Now Trump can look like the hero, for pretending to hold out for $2000 for everybody, and can now pretend to cave-in (cue the applause) and look good just for doling out the inadequate $600 after all the posturing."
2020-12-28 02:25:14,"The point of all this drama was to pressure congress into agreeing to $2000 checks so Trump could point, in 2024, to his heroic ""save"" of millions of desperate Americans, overcoming the will of congress in favor of the working class. His real fear is that Joe Biden will take office and the $600 checks will be, as Biden had stated, just a ""down payment"" toward the real relief needed by so many. The battle, in Trump's mind, is over who ""gets the credit"" for providing relief. The fate of those in greatest need is the least of Trump's concerns. I believe the applicable word in this situation is 'optics'...creating the illusion that Trump protected the people from a heartless congress. Another failure added to the scorecard of the worst president ever."
2020-12-28 02:24:28,"So now all we have to do is over-ride Trump's veto of the defense spending bill and we are done with him. No need for him to return to Washington, no need for him to address the nation as the president ever again.   He can stay in Florida playing golf forever."
2020-12-28 02:25:17,Who can doubt that the CNN story about the aborted Christmas Eve signing was the impetus for this? Trump is cracking under the strain of not being able to acknowledge he lost an election for a job he shows no signs of being willing or able to do. It's not too late to invoke Amendment XXV and remove him from a position he was always unable to fill. We should not have to wait to see what additional damage he can do to the nation in the next 24 days.
2020-12-28 02:25:39,"Anyone else think it was inappropriate for the First Lady to wear $1795 Louboutin boots to Mar-a-Lago while her husband was messing with the neediest Americans?  Not shocking, just typically inappropriate."
2020-12-28 02:25:44,Trump’s picture should be next to the definition of drama queen.
2020-12-28 02:25:57,"Trump pardons all these crooks. What's the message? Then he stalls the stimulus bill. What's the message? He signs the bill. What's the message? There is no message. These are pure assertions of power with no meaningful content. ""Call me a mafia boss? A heartless boor? Who cares? I'm doing it."""
2020-12-28 02:26:10,"More shameless, self serving behavior by our conman in chief trump.

Good riddance to this morally bankrupt enemy of our country and democracy.

I’d say trump should move to Russia to be close to his buddy Putin, but now that Putin has played trump like a cheap yo-yo and gotten every last penny’s worth out of this corrupt conman, I sure Putin wouldn’t let him into the country."
2020-12-28 02:25:58,The Art of the Deal. Really?  Some Art....Some Deal.
2020-12-28 02:26:01,So…he made you look!
2020-12-28 02:26:25,"Does Trump have ANY awareness that he recklessly ruined Christmas for millions of families? What unnecessary turmoil. It’s downright evil.￼ Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza ...  jerked away the safety net for everyone."
2020-12-28 02:25:43,"And yet millions of Trumpsters who are unemployed and were until a few hours ago, facing eviction, losing their unemployment and sending their kids to bed hungry on Christmas still think he's their savior."
2020-12-28 02:26:06,Me Me Me Me Me!!! That’s all this was about—seeing his name above the fold again. This deeply damaged individual still has 4 and 20 days to make us feel the pain and turmoil he experiences within himself every day. Deepest gratitude to everyone who helped vote this gorgon out of office.
2020-12-28 02:25:43,"Trump is treating the transition as a reality show season finale, complete with teasers. Reversing course and signing the relief bill at the last minute—during prime time, of course. The nightly pardon binge, or execution, as the case may be. The promises of surprises on January 6. I really don’t want to know how he’s going to spin his inevitable exit from the White House. But I never have been much of a TV watcher."
2020-12-28 02:25:35,"Oh for heavens sake.  Let’s not have people quietly enjoying a long Christmas weekend— as best they can— making due.   Let’s not have folks quietly counting their blessings and finding what joy they can salvage out of this very weird and disturbing time.  
No!  
Let’s have all eyes on Trump!  Will he or won’t he?  He won’t! He really won’t!  He might!  He will most likely!  And then he does it—- he signs a bill that he probably was going to sign anyway... but not until after he squeezes as much drama out of it that he can.
Bah!"
2020-12-28 02:28:43,For once I agree with Trump.. $600 is an insult to the working class American!!!
2020-12-28 02:27:45,And the GOP???? Silent accomplices of this mess. C’mon grow a spine.
2020-12-28 02:28:04,"Remember when Trump complained that Obama spent too much time playing golf?  Hipocracy, thy name is Donald."
2020-12-28 02:28:17,"Never again;  Never Again  should be the vow of every  Representative and every US Senator

  Never Again will we allow a President hold
our entire nation ...Hostage..."
2020-12-28 02:28:26,"When will we learn to ignore this drama queen, who always buckles at the end before things get too real."
2020-12-28 02:27:30,"O.K. Let them have $600,  they don’t protest Biden’s win and they don’t deserve to have more."
2020-12-28 02:28:08,"One can only think; did Trump get a visit from a ghost overnight?
We probably just wanted Congress to take their vacations and get out of his hair."
2020-12-28 02:28:32,I think he was told that he was signing up for tomorrow’s tee time and Mnunchin just gave him the signature page.
2020-12-28 02:28:36,"Unpredictable, chaotic, manipulative, erratic, deeply unprofessional and abhorrently unpresidential from beginning to end: the Donald J. Trump administration."
2020-12-28 02:27:40,"Narcissists will do ANYTHING to divert attention from somewhere else back to themselves.  Let's remember that basic fact, folks."
2020-12-28 02:28:58,I have just two words: Drama Queen
2020-12-28 02:29:02,Trump is confusing power with leadership.
2020-12-28 02:29:43,"How dare he? He holds up the bill which Congress and the recalcitrant Senate fought over for months and which millions of people desperately need; goes golfing instead – and then resentfully signs it at the last minute – and calls IT a disgrace? We all know who is dishonourable here – trump and his Party. He should have stayed in Washington until this was resolved; that’s his JOB. Please, please, can his supporters finally see him for who he is; a pathetic excuse for a human being who cares not for the dispossessed, the unemployed, the hungry – never mind the over 330,000 dead he is largely responsible for."
2020-12-28 02:29:28,art of the deal baby. Trump (not us of course) always wins (ratings and donations).
2020-12-28 02:32:57,"“It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.”"
2020-12-28 02:34:01,Can we stop reporting on this guy? Everything he does is for attention.
2020-12-28 02:30:12,"This clown will be done on 1-20-2020 12:01. It is up to the future political structure to snuff his future political career out like a discarded lit cigarette. Don't go away mad Donald, Just go away!"
2020-12-28 02:30:19,Paper tiger.................................
2020-12-28 02:32:45,"trump’s an insecure little boy who has always had everything handed to him. This temper tantrum was just an amplification of his pain and cruelty, the only things he knows.
It’s him and gaetz now, alone together."
2020-12-28 02:34:57,I always remember him as our black hole president. Get close to him and you will never be the same. He eats your sole and spits out whats left. He is not someone I will remember regardless of his last second decisions.
2020-12-28 02:30:29,"Trumps Borderline Personally Disorder Front and Center. Why would anyone believe this man wants to help Americans? He’s self obsessed. Trump is Bizarro Kennedy. Ask not what you can do for your Country. Ask what you can do for meeee. JFK asked Americans to give service to Peace Corps, to sacrifice for Country, to help out others. Trump sacrifices Americans because his sadistic proclivities get free reign."
2020-12-28 02:33:53,Apparently trump has had enough media coverage and generated enough emotional anguish across the country so the spoiled toddler signed the stimulus. Never has our country experienced such a horrible excuse for anything resembling a human.
2020-12-28 02:34:48,Now we can finally ignore him.
2020-12-28 02:35:08,Did he sign it before or after his scorecard?
2020-12-28 02:33:08,"Yes. 2K would have been great; however, the narcissistic attention seeker never cared about anyone. His cruelty knows no bounds."
2020-12-28 02:31:44,"The rodent just wanted to ruin a lot of people's Christmas and have them talk about him. He could care less about the $2,000 and was too cowardly not to sign it in the end."
2020-12-28 02:32:27,"That quote from Toomey at end... this is the same guy who wants to eliminate the incoming administration's ability to use the Federal Reserve's emergency tools. This is a gang of fools, divorced from the needs of the 99%. Trump, Toomey, the entire GOP... all the same."
2020-12-28 02:30:55,"Trump’s hissy fit and selfishness in delaying the signing of the measure is just one more very egregious reason why history should remember his presidency by three words: 

CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY"
2020-12-28 02:34:37,"To dampen the mood a bit (if possible) we need to look at the sad truth that ""free"" money to all Americans is a gift by our grandchildren.  That helping the financially strapped can be done in better ways than helicopter money.  That the economy in the large is not so bad.  That Pelosi's dream of making the House Republicans all vote on the $2000 checks was a piece of the political dreck that is Congress."
2020-12-28 02:33:53,Let them eat tweets.
2020-12-28 02:30:12,Trump wasn’t “sidelined.” He chose not to engage. Times is misleading readers about what transpired.
2020-12-28 02:31:06,"If there ever was any question, this administration demonstrates that it's a bad idea to elect a president with the emotional maturity of a spoiled five year old."
2020-12-28 02:33:01,"All talk, no action. The macho man with the little hands backs down yet again. I still can't figure out why his cult followers think he's a tough guy."
2020-12-28 02:31:22,"Classic Trump. Out of ideas and opportunities, he desperately manufactures a crisis that he alone can resolve. His sycophants and followers blindly perceive him as the savior. Of course, had he just signed the bill to begin with, there would have been no crisis, and no break in unemployment aid to millions of Americans.

Here's to hoping Republicans get help for their short-term memory loss prior to the next election."
2020-12-28 02:33:18,MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Trump got his name at the top of the news and made people feel terrible over Christmas (although not as sick as the thousands who came down with Covid-19).
2020-12-28 02:31:19,Only he (trump) can fix it because only he would and does break it. There is no glory gained here. Only derision.
2020-12-28 02:31:43,And yet still most of his cult followers will believe everything he says and blame the Democrats for the torture he has engaged in. We are in so much trouble in this country. Our current situation demonstrates how much public education has failed in teaching critical analysis.
2020-12-28 02:34:45,He has the Minus Touch. Everyone and everything is always far worse off for having been involved with him.
2020-12-28 02:32:39,What happened? Was he threatened with the 25th amendment?
2020-12-28 02:31:36,The end of the latest cruel TV episode.  Can’t wait for last show.  No reruns please.
2020-12-28 02:31:37,He didn’t care about getting 2k to struggling Americans. If he did he would have been actively pursuing it months ago. He just needed to be in the center of things and throw people’s lives into chaos.  Just hope the next 3 weeks pass and we can start to put things back together again.
2020-12-28 02:31:42,"Well this little game of chicken ended rather abruptly. Trump called an audible at the two-minute warning and realized he hasn't played football in years and can't move from his couch, so he took a knee. Trump tried to join a club his senior year to pad his resumé, but they wouldn't let him in. Trump realized they write history books, don't they, and wanted a last minute list of good deeds to avoid becoming Trump the Tumultuous. Blast it, he's still Trump the Tumultuous. Trump wanted to do America a favor, though."
2020-12-28 02:31:10,"I’m not conspiracy-minded, but I can’t help but wonder if Trump didn’t extract some sort of concession or quid pro quo from McConnell and his caucus. Perhaps a promise to put on a disruptive show in the Senate on January 6th, when there should be a formal recognition of Biden’s victory in the Electoral College. Just sayin’."
2020-12-28 02:38:09,The narcissist demands attention one last time.
2020-12-28 02:37:37,"One need not be rich nor smart nor enjoy status to deserve dignity.

Donald Trump is a sociopath who simply does not recognize the decency of being human.

We had better learn form this episode of our history, so that we may treat one another with kindness, as we chart our future course."
2020-12-28 02:37:50,"Aren't we all sick of this drama queen yet?
this is all schtick, i don't know why it's being taken seriously. 
More news coverage, more histrionics, more nonsense."
2020-12-28 02:36:21,"Too bad he can't be treated like Clark Griswold's boss in Christmas Vacation after he stiffed his employees on their holiday bonuses. Even that scrooge eventually saw the impact his behavior had on other people. I don't think it would ever be possible to get this through to Trump's non-functioning psychotic, narcissistic brain."
2020-12-28 02:38:15,"People can wring their hands all they want about Trump, but until the consequences of mass economic ruin, homelessness and COVID death due to his incompetence and inaction is met with good old fashion 18th Century guillotine justice...this is just nothing more than another day in America."
2020-12-28 02:36:04,"Show man.  That's what he is.  Rather, what he was."
2020-12-28 02:38:11,"Once again, Trump can take credit for averting a crisis that he alone created."
2020-12-28 02:35:41,Somebody needs to tell Toomey that Trump is going to be remembered for chaos and misery regardless of anything he does now.
2020-12-28 02:37:19,Food lines hundreds of cars long.  Hundreds dying every day.  Millions out of work.  And this cruel despicable waste of protoplasm cannot bring himself to even consider other people.  He cannot be gone soon enough.  This country desperately needs to heal itself. It needs to call its elected officials to task and demand respect.  The American carnage wrought by Trump needs to be reversed.
2020-12-28 02:36:34,"This is exactly I predicted. That Trump didn’t want to do the hard work or negotiating while the aid plan was being hashed out, then when it is done, throw a tantrum and upending everything. While everyone going crazy, he signs it the last minute. The next thing he is going to do is to declare himself hero for signing the bill. 

What’s that saying again? Something about the arson dousing out a fire that he started?"
2020-12-28 02:36:09,"Official notice was now received that Trump no longer rules. Mitch McConnell now rules the GOP. Imho, the better of two very dark evils."
2020-12-28 02:36:48,"This Individual 1 isn't through punishing us.  I feel greatly relieved that millions of us will get a little something as result the Relief Bill.  There are millions upon millions that will still be in need, hungry and in harms way. My mind will not ease until Trump is where he belongs.  He will torment us, create havoc and mayhem until he cannot."
2020-12-28 02:38:57,"Since Donald threaten to veto the bill, the MAGA zombies have been saying Donald was looking out for people and blaming congress for only providing $600 in relief--go figure.   It should at least be entertaining how the red hatters explain Donald's reversal--proof that it is possible to fool some people all the time."
2020-12-28 02:38:28,"He was fine with not signing the bill because he relished all the squealing and squirming.  Then his aides told him it was hurting the GOP candidates in the run-off election.  So there he was, between a rock and a hard place, enjoying his revenge on Congressional Republicans and the whole reality show aura of the tension and drama, but in the end, he had to sign it."
2020-12-28 02:37:08,Trump got something for signing the bills. Most likely a Republican senator or two will join some Republican House members in challenging the Electoral College results on January 6. That is what’s most important to Trump and most likely his price for signing.
2020-12-28 02:39:06,Trump was much faster in pardoning his thug friends.
2020-12-28 02:39:15,"Republicans are the problem, America."
2020-12-28 02:40:17,"What a sick, egotistic, narcissistic and selfish human being. He signed after unemployment expired. There are no good words to describe this person..."
2020-12-28 02:40:43,"Today the two main news items are about a man in Tennessee who decided that if he was going to kill himself he might as well take Nashville down with him, and a man in DC who decided that if he was going to lose his job he might as well take a whole country down with him."
2020-12-28 02:40:48,Not to forget: Trump ruined everybody’s Christmas.
2020-12-28 02:39:43,"What a giant baby. If only we could vote to ostracize, like the inventors of democracy."
2020-12-28 02:40:03,"“But the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”

That’s his legacy already. You too, Pat Toomey for your behaviour."
2020-12-28 02:40:59,The Speaker should still put the $2000 payment on the House floor and pass it on Monday.
2020-12-28 02:39:18,"The pox on Trump and his enablers for going several days before his signing of this bill.
As nothing was changed in the bill from when it as passed to his belated signing indicates that it was just his fecklessness that was the hold up. Tell that to the millions that suffered anguish due to his pettiness.
I swear if I were a billionaire, I would hire a chorus the likes that have never been seen before to follow him around to the ends of the earth singing “loser”."
2020-12-28 02:40:28,"“I understand he wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks,” Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on Fox News. “But the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”

He'll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior regardless."
2020-12-28 02:40:39,so is the gambit that he signed these bills and got republicans in the house and senate to vote against the veto-override on the defense bill? stay tuned
2020-12-28 02:39:41,This circus is Trumps' last debacle before we the people prosecute him for crimes before and after he was elected.
2020-12-28 02:39:28,"My only regret is that Trump, besides himself, had to come in from his FL golf course, to take the time necessary to sign and keep our government operating, and helping those who need financial aid and assistance the most.

The Inauguration can't come fast enough to prevent the further destruction of what is left of our democracy!"
2020-12-28 02:41:22,"If Trump was so concerned about Americans who are suffering because of COVID19 why wasn't he present during any of the negotiations?  Why didn't he, during the long hot summer, step in and show all of us what a master he is at the art of the deal?  He was the president, not a bystander.  If he had wanted to solve the problems all he had to do was tell McConnell to do something or, as stated before, step in himself.  

All he's doing now is punishing the country for not re-electing him.  I doubt that he cares about the size of the stimulus checks, the size of payments to small businesses that are struggling now, or how many will lose their homes, be unable to get medical care or fill prescriptions they need to survive.  

Trump cares about one thing and one thing only:  Donald Trump.  The rest is noise."
2020-12-28 02:41:07,Mad King Donald strikes again.  What can anyone say?
2020-12-28 02:41:21,Umm.  Just curious. What does foreign aid and new museums in the national mall have to do with covid relief. Shame shame shame.
2020-12-28 02:41:52,"Many Republicans say Trump was sent by god, if thats the case he must have been out of locusts."
2020-12-28 02:41:18,It seems clearly evident now that deep down in his family tree Trump must surely be related to that ancient and failed Chinese philosopher Wang Kur.
2020-12-28 02:41:39,He toys with ruining lives because he can. He’s the most broken person to ever hold that much power.
2020-12-28 02:41:43,"""[Trump] will be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”  I would also add, this statement summarizes the entire 4 years of his disastrous presidency.  Trump has only cared about one person and that's him.  The cruelty of this man really knows no bounds, and the Republicans that enabled him during these 4 years are equally culpable for the harm they have committed.

If lives weren't at risk, ""better late than never"" could apply, but it's really ""too little and too late.""  Sad."
2020-12-28 02:42:31,In the early days of the Trump Presidency an acquaintance asked me what I thought of the President and I responded that we should not give credence to what he says but rather pay more attention to his actions. My opinion has not changed. His words are so often mere bombast. One can absolutely not trust anything the man says. Let him be judged primarily by the actions or the lack thereof.
2020-12-28 02:42:47,Such a drama queen of course he signed the relief bill he was always going to he had ten days once he got the bill but he decides to milk it with 2k ramble he was never going to give the American people. This is the distrust this is the crime that is perpetrated on us over and over again.
2020-12-28 02:43:37,Don’t naively refer to this as a reversal.  This is what he’s always done. Say some outrageous thing to get attention then after everyone goes bonkers say never mind.
2020-12-28 02:43:16,"People are still falling for his game. He has a simple play book - he just repeats the same moves over and over again.  This was one of his most common - make a statement that will garner lots of attention, ensuring the conversation will be about him, then either do nothing, make a symbolic but impotent gesture, or prolong the crisis by stalling."
2020-12-28 02:44:10,He saw the light. I wonder which traitor got to him first? Maybe that talk of ousting him today woke the beast. Now let's all sing Kumbia and pay our electric bills and fill up our gas tanks. I'll take a bottle of Champipple if there is any $$$ leftover.
2020-12-28 02:44:19,The best reply to all the cruel craziness Trump has been responsible for since the election is for Georgia to send two new Democratic Senators to Washington.
2020-12-28 02:45:50,"We have long known that Trump was a pathological narcissist whose decisions and actions are based entirely on self-interest. Now we know definitively that he is also a sadist - someone whose only source of true pleasure is the suffering and degradation of others. If he has to choose between self-interest and the pleasure of causing harm, sometimes he'll choose the latter. 

He will be gone soon - though no doubt he'll find a few more ways to  cause wanton damage before the end. Our task now is to address the larger problem: at least 15 or 20 million Americans still see this man as someone worth following. And he leaves behind a party so debased that even now they have stayed silent during this horrible piece of theater. Silent, complicit, compliant."
2020-12-28 02:45:24,"I continue to be puzzled by any remaining support for the toddler POTUS. The cries of “fraud” not aimed correctly at the emperor lacking clothing or conscience- but at an election deemed fair by every judge, governor, and the conservative SCOTUS. Oh yes, lapdog Barr proclaimed it fair. Yet. Fox is too liberal now. It’s America One and Infowars as the only not “fake” sources of “news”. How can tens of millions actually believe in orange kool-aid?  The petulance. I don’t care."

After all, he assured us that his support won't wane if he shoots someone on 5th Ave.   That meant that he felt bold enough to do anything, seeing himself above consequences.   We elected him nonetheless.  Four years after all the pain he's caused, 72 million voters wanted to reelect him.  Talk about disgrace!   The real disgrace is that so many Americans wanted to ignore his damage to our nation and reward him with their vote."

That Trump remains a cruel and unpredictable political 'weather vane' is a royal disgrace, clearly a mentally deranged individual that, for the good of the country, ought to be released from his duties (of which he has been awol during his entire presidency).

2020-12-28 02:52:00,"Trump held this bill up because he was desperate to remain relevant. In a statement today, as he signed the bill, he insisted he was returning the bill to Congress redlined. A ridiculous posture without meaning since the president lacks line by line veto authority and the bill had already passed Congress by a 2/3 majority. Who knows who finally got thru to Trump: a president who has spent the last few weeks involved in a pathetic coup attempt to overturn the election results, tweeting his grievance and lies, or playing golf while thousands of Americans suffered from the pandemic fallout or died.

And it struck me that when he proclaimed on Saturday that either Congress sends him a bill he could sign or the next administration would have to pass a covid relief bill, it was the first time Trump admitted publicly he had lost to Biden.

My guess is Trump will not return to Washington. To that I say alleluia.

Shame, shame, shame on the GOP for protecting this unfit and incompetent president. The aid will finally arrive, but it is too little too late for thousands of American families. Bring on the Biden administration!"
2020-12-28 02:52:25,"“I understand he wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks,” Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on Fox News. “But the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”

Is Toomey that out of touch.   First and foremost Trump will be remembered for GOP anti-science national security Covid-19 debacle that killed 300,000 Americans.

What saved people's butts was the Democratic plan of OR's Ron Wyden to boost unemployment so working people could pay rent, heat, car, food due to Trump/GOP shutdown economy.

How on earth can 70 million Americans believe he has their best interest at heart and that Donald Trump represents the best that America has to offer?

It is, in my opinion, more productive to analyze the reasons and fact driving our fellow Americans to follow these misguided ideas; for I refuse to believe that a plurality of those being lead by Trumpism are malevolent; they are perhaps misguided by fear of the changes inevitable in todays environment.

Our country ought to be true to itself. We are not honoring the ideals of our Republic when our representatives separate children from their parent and puts them in concentration camps.  Mean while the so call First Lady parades in her designer clothes that can easily feed and give sustenance to several of them for a while.

The very people who vote to elect the representatives to Office. Elections do have consequences. Because, what we see is that, it is only upto the time of voting, the politicians are as close as possible with the people. Once elected, what they do, and how they behave, is all far away from the people. A lot has been observed and learned, until the next election time."

However, those of us who are the losers in the neoliberal order (where inequality and poverty are considered just desserts), have been waiting since July for Congress to come to an agreement.

This story had almost fallen off of the pages of this publication.

In every other wealthy developed democratic nation the citizens have been receiving a considerably greater degree of economic help and they all have state sponsored universal healthcare - which funnily enough, comes in handy during a global pandemic.

The US has institutionally failed to respond effectively to the pandemic and the economic fallout that it has wreaked.
And it’s not ALL because of Trump.

In January, Joe Biden (with the help of the corporate media and Obama and the corporate Democrats) will take office.
Joe has assured the financial and corporate sectors that “everything will essentially stay the same.”

The real story here is that 40+ years of neoliberal economic policy has destroyed the lives of 90% of our populace, destroyed our ability to respond to a crisis and destroyed our standing in the world as a nation worth living in.

Does trump's cheering section for a minute believe trump's treasury secretary was working in a vacuum?

If the largest aid bill ever passed doesn’t win widespread approval, it can only be said that the will to attack exceeds the will to accomplish great things. This bodes poorly for the future. The prevailing sentiment is that revenge is sweet, a petty and self-destructive notion."

About six weeks ago, before the election, the GOP was talking about a stimulus of $1.8 trillion. The Dems were talking about $2.2 trill. Trump was pushing  about $2.3 trill. So what happened to reduce the current stimulus proposal to less than half of the lowest previously proposed amount? Election over? Wealthy politicians who vote themselves tons of benefits feel like they have license to do as they please? Elected officials feel more secure in their jobs so that can take advantage of the electorate and hold on to OUR money?

Going forward, the key to getting some meaningful stimulus payments to people, businesses and local governments is the election in Georgia. Dems need to get their people elected there. 

On the stimulus issue Biden and Trump are essentially in agreement. Pass whatever bills we can get for now and then, when the money runs out, get back together and pass more aid as necessary. McConnell, the poster boy for why we should have term limits for legislators, can stew. 

It's unjust that people have been paying tax money to the Feds all their lives and when they need help, an essential service so to speak, the government that confiscates our money gives us a hard time. All the while we spend tremendous sums on useless military hardware like F-35 aircraft, war ships and a needless war in Afghanistan, a war which was precipitated by W, our dumbest president ever, when he needed  someone, anyone, to blame for 9/11."

It will takes weeks most likely before they receive checks. And even though the bill includes compensation for missed benefit periods, a landlord who is dunning a tenant over missed rental payments, if not already well into the process of eviction, isn't going to erase the penalty fees that accumulate for past due rental fees. So in essence Trump and the GOP – by waiting until the very last minute to produce an aid bill, compounded the financial distress and emotional anxiety for hundreds of thousands of American families.

are not strict enough, or not enforced when people ignore the rules.

""Why not pay as many people as possible not to go to work so as to avoid interactions in the workplace or on crowded public transit.  No doubt one reason there are so many cases in Ontario cities is because it's
spreading on public transit and in workplaces via workers who cannot
afford to stay home.""

Even more true here in the USA. 

But what if, for lack of an effective and coherent plan, that is what we are doing.

Donald Trump had the opportunity of a lifetime to help the American people where it counted most.  Instead of doing all
 he could to protect them from the pandemic, he left everything up to the states. 
He should be given the Nobel Prize for his Operation Warp Speed, but unfortunately he has diluted his message with so much baggage that it has been lost in the shuffle.  Instead of focusing on the greatest achievement anyone could have made as president, he has wasted precious time complaining about the results of the last election, and deliberately withholding much needed relief from the American people."

2020-12-28 12:38:02,He took this threat as far as it could go benefiting his need to project power. This fake crisis then becomes mercy or kindness. But he stood to lose a lot more by not signing we can rest assured.
2020-12-28 06:59:25,"Why can’t we expect basic decency from the leaders in power of this country? How is it we elect people to “fight” for us. When will we learn we don’t want a fight, we just want some problems solved and we want our tax money invested to raise our quality of life?"
2020-12-28 11:25:42,So essentially Trump paid sticker price for his car without getting the extended warranty or the free oil checks for the first year. Remind me not to let this guy close the deal on the next house I buy. I'll probably end of with a mortgage 15 points above prime.

2020-12-28 05:37:25,"Of course, expecting Mr. Trump to read more than 5,000 pages of proposed legislation was asking an awful lot.  That may have been what took him so long.  But it certainly looks like a last-ditch attempt to prove that he's still a force to be reckoned with....."
2020-12-28 10:31:39,"For the 12M who lost enhanced unemployment benefits Saturday, this was not a TV reality show of any sort.  It is reality.  And between now when the funds are restored in several weeks, how many of this group will go hungry, go without prescriptions, be forced not to pay rent, go through mental anguish?  trump's moves were reckless and why?  Because he wanted to be the center of attention?  He is the one that checked out of negotiations before and after the elections.  He is the one that has spent 8 weeks in a temper tantrum that he lost the election and has not been doing his job.  He is the one that didn't state his preferences.  This is on trump, and all the members of the GOP that allowed it and like McConnell, are now taking a victory lap.  They need to face all those whose unemployment benefits have been cut off for now and explain how that is a victory!"

When someone we encounter realizes we are Americans there is an embarrassed silence and then expressions of sympathy.

For Europeans, feeling sorry for Americans is a new and unfamiliar emotion!"
2020-12-28 08:48:29,"Donald Trump's timing always seems to leave a sour taste in my mouth. Ewww!

This time, he tried to play both sides of the table;  all he ended up doing while making  it seem as if he is trying to create a better deal for the American people  was make more friction between lawmakers. I dislike that kind of 'holier than thou' attitude; his final signing of the bill preceded by his more money for the people could have been implemented through Mnuchin in the long months that they were crafting this bill. He isn't being sincere in signing the bill, his motive may be just to appear to be 'the good guy'.

Senator Graham going to play golf on Christmas Day in a private setting  to try to convince Donald Trump to sign a Bill that would have kept Ms' Bryant and Martinez from an anxious Christmas shared by so many others who are representative of their situation is like a Dickensian tale, 'A Christmas Carol'.

2020-12-28 10:31:36,Let's not forget that McConnell could have acted much sooner since the House passed a bill in May. There has been lots of time for negotiating and passing a bill in the Senate with no 11tb hour panic. Georgia: flip those two seats. McConnell doesn't care about anyone but himself.
2020-12-28 12:28:05,What exactly is so excellent about guaranteeing a gap in unemployment benefits and forcing his own party to vote against $2000 stimulus checks? Because that’s all he achieved by his grandstanding.
2020-12-28 11:06:04,Why did he wait to sign this bill? Political retribution? Just to show he is still relevent? Is this some kind of political theater? Who knows. January 20th can come fast enough.
2020-12-28 12:03:15,"For once though, I’m not mad at him. I know. I know. It’s Donald Trump. However, as poorly motivated as it was, the holdout illumined the dysfunction of our government, the insufficiency of its responsiveness to the problems experienced by the demos, and the capture of our democracy by wealth. At the end of the day, the U.S. Congress worked very hard in a bipartisan manner to craft a nearly $1 trillion supplemental response to a historic coronavirus pandemic that is killing hundreds of thousands of Americans and threatening the financial security of millions more and all our congressional representatives in the House and Senate could approve for the majority of us beneath the affluent classes is, wait for it, $600.  When considering the great crises of history, there is a phrase that scholars often use, “meeting the moment.” This Congress did not meet the moment of the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020. Unless America’s elites suddenly listen to their better angels and make some serious changes to our politics, government, and economy, I doubt if the U.S. government is even capable of rising to such a challenge anymore."

2020-12-28 11:29:22,"When we are left at the whims of politicians such as Trump and McConnell- men who during a pandemic use us as chess pieces in order to gain their goals of money and power- you can't help but think we're being used and abused. Not remotely close to the kind of government we thought we might have. And when you consider that Japan and many of the EU countries gave economic aid to safeguard families from the pandemic as a matter of course, not a matter of maneuverings like this... It angers. We have to return to of the people, by the people, for the people as we are now so removed from that. Trump and the Republicans who support him do not care. It's astounding that the pretend cowboys and pretend bikers and company that appear maskless at his rallies don't have the horse sense to see through all the posturing. Maybe because they're posturing too? Whatever the reason, people have to try to wake up and turn off the television! To finish on a good note, I voted for and am encouraged by Biden as he is making good cabinet choices and seems to know real from pretend and cares about the well being and future prospects of Americans and America. We have a chance, but we're really going to have to work the program. We could be so much better!"

2020-12-28 11:44:41,"The deadline for extended unemployment was created by Congress. The deadline for supplemental unemployment was created by Congress. And Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, said no to $1200 checks before the election because she didn't want Trump to get a win. Let's all be honest here. This was a failure of the Congress, regardless of which political party you belong to."
2020-12-28 07:06:16,"I suspect Trump was simply acting according to his mood, and eventually signed the bill to avoid more controversy than he wanted at this point. He’s got a an official acceptance of the vote by the Electoral College to confront and his members of Congress were going to be distracted by the blow back from not signing this bill. 

Trump is going to inflict pain until his interests change. So we all must just keep cool."
2020-12-28 06:01:15,"Let's see- Congress is debating for months on this bill, but Trump should be blamed for delaying it a few days causing some benefits to lapse. Please."
2020-12-28 12:28:55,"Toomey's remarks suggest that he believes Trump had some coherent strategy for holding up this legislation and demanding larger stimulus checks.  But given the fact that Trump's own people had resisted the higher payment throughout the negotiations, it appears that his sudden ultimatum was more likely an impulse arising from his anger over the election.  

Another possible explanation for Trump's erratic behavior relates to his ego.  Over the course of his presidency Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be enamored with the awesome power of the presidency.  Perhaps his fascination with the fact that a President can destroy the lives of millions by simply pushing a button or, in this case, refusing to pick up a pen, is what drove his decision to delay signing.

Whatever the explanation, this fiasco is just one more example of this man's lack of fitness for his office.  In these final few perilous days of Trump's presidency, Congress must be resolute in its commitment to protect the constitution.  This incident has unified the Congress to a degree not seen before in Trump's term.  Congress should use the legislative success brought about by that unity as a guide for assuring an orderly and peaceful transfer of power to Biden on January 20."
2020-12-28 05:49:23,"it is like dealing with a cranky two year old. All this drama for nothing. I still have a job for now and the delay and uncertainty was stressful for me. I can't imagine what people with kids, no money, running out of food and behind on their rent must be going through. I can't wait until we have actual adults in White House again. Now if Congress could stop being a daycare center for preschoolers terrified of tweets, we might actually have some stability and progress in this country again but I know that is just too much to ask. When my check comes, at least $200 of it will go to the local food bank and the rest will go to savings in case my job disappears. With the grim reaper on the Senate, this might be the last economic stability act we see. I  can't believe he tried to tie the hands of the Federal Reserve. You can be sure we will see more of the same from him  for the next 4 years."
2020-12-28 06:45:44,"This is not just an ordinary stimulus bill. It is the greatest energy bill in a decade according to Senator Schumer. No wonder Trump found all kinds of excuses not to want to sign it.

There is no reason why a large stimulus package in late January isn't possible if Georgia turns the Senate Blue. Mitch McConnell has always been the problem, not Donald Trump - it is the Senate controlled by Mitch McConnell & the acquiescence of even moderate Senate Republicans to his policy or hostage taking."
2020-12-28 12:23:05,"The stimulus checks should be $1000 per tax return rather than $600 per person.  Why do couples always make out better in these scenarios than singles!!?

It doesn’t cost twice as much to maintain a household of two vs a household of one.  And solo households likely have less earning power and less savings.   

(Non-earning stay home spouses should get zero.  If they can’t be bothered to work and pay taxes in good times, let them make do on one check when times are tough.)  

If people can pool their incomes for purposes of filing taxes and getting tax breaks & credits, they should also be treated as one for stimulus checks too, and solo-filer households should be their equal.  Not second-class."
2020-12-28 07:23:03,"My understanding is that many Congress people signed a letter petitioning Trump to sign this pandemic relief bill today and sent it to Mar A Lago.  

""5,593-page legislation""  I would like to see the PDF or text version of this.  I know I could find it on Scribe.com or perhaps on the Senate or House's website, but a reference to the document would be nice. 

Mike Pompeo is said to be in quarantine, at least from one news source. 

Trump's cut to the Defense budget is horrifying to me.  We are vulnerable.  We are being attacked cyberly and our military is what Trump loved to accuse it of being, in disarray.  

But Trump is leaving not only the public in a state of acute distress, emotionally, but also all of the armed forces and intelligence agencies which are focused on protecting us. 

I went grocery shopping today.  The store which is normally packed, because it's a discount store, pandemic or not, was nearly empty.  

At that moment, I figured the normal customer flow was stopped due to the imminent catastrophe the individuals were about to experience. 

I've never written a president of the United States but this evening I was preparing a letter of pleading to trump.  When people don't shop in America, they are expecting the worst; fire, bombing, earthquake, mudslide, and no money to buy food."

He was always going to sign it but he had to make it about himself first. To the folks that thought him standing up for $2000 vs $600?  He was playing you. He knew that would never pass Republicans but he had to mess with people one last time. Good riddance."

2020-12-28 05:37:08,Consistently inconsistent. Like the month of March he (Trump) came in like a lion. But in the end ... in this case he’s leaving ... and that’s all that matters. Vale.
2020-12-28 11:10:23,"Can you imagine if we had four more years of this?  I don't think the antics are anything new with him.  He's done it before when the budget has come up, waiting until the last minute to object and claim he won't sign.  With his demands for future action, he ridiculously acts like he is not leaving office, thus making even more of a fool of himself.  No wonder his businesses kept going bankrupt and no banks would lend to him except Deutsche Bank."
2020-12-28 12:33:39,"Quoting from the article: “It’s just so frustrating that he couldn’t have figured this out yesterday.""  Trump has great difficulty figuring out anything.  He has been a loser his whole life, including his businesses and politics.  He hasn't figured out that he has lost the election.  He hasn't figured out that 81,000,000 Americans  want him out the door on 20th January 2021 and never to be heard of again."
2020-12-28 05:10:16,"If people need the money now, why did he not sign it before? To wish everybody a happy Xmas? I think he wants chaos because an insurrection is his only chance of staying out of jail. He was found to have obstructed justice 10 or 11 times by Mueller. Slam dunk obviously; and we all saw the liar's signature on the Stormy check.
If he had not colluded with Russian oligarchs (of course not the official Kremlin); then why was he frantically trying to obstruct justice? That doesn't make sense. That obvious deduction is almost never discussed. So he obstructed justice allegedly for what? To hide nothing?
So the relevance to the current flip-flopping and confusion peddling is clearly he faces certain imprisonment. Uncle Joe has little taste for locking him up, locking him up or even for locking him up. But Joe will steer clear of the new AG's decision on the matter- because to intervene would be corrupt.
The only time DJT has ever delivered on an obligation was to pardon his sleazy criminal buddies. His only chance is sowing confusion and cooking up a military coup. Do you think he would not do that that if he could?
America is still in grave danger."
2020-12-28 12:36:15,"At the end of the story was a cute little tease from the President. Here's another one: The good news, Mr. President? The inauguration is only 23 days away. The bad news? It's not yours."
2020-12-28 09:22:45,"I'm sure that every one of the loan bailouts Donald Trump got from lenders after he couldn't make his debt payments were also a ""disgrace"" in his eyes. But he signed those, too. Not paying contractors so he could squeeze a few more bucks out of them would also be a ""disgrace"". Filing bankruptcy several times was also a ""disgrace"". Cheating on multiple wives routinely--also a ""disgrace"". Using the presidency to make money for yourself would also qualify as a ""disgrace"".  

And finally, on Trump's way out of the door, pretending a deadly virus doesn't exist and ignoring the pain and suffering of the nation you are supposed to be leading would simply be the ""coup de grace"" of all of his ""disgraces""."

Brutal negotiations between the Democrats and the Grifter-Owned Party go on until well beyond the eleventh hour, an agreement is finally hammered out, and trump says something that completely disrupts the entire process. Had he said it six months ago, and stuck to it, perhaps a better deal for the American people could have been struck. 23 more days or so...

Of course, the takeaway message for his cult will be that Dear Leader fought for them in the never-ending battle against the evil political establishment. Sigh."

It is, frankly, a disgrace. Congress are supposed to debate the issues and vote on them one by one instead bundling everything into a must-pass bill and holding all the legislators hostage. Let's be honest, no legislator even had time to read the 5500 pages before voting yes on it. 

The tech industry already found the horrific case act that was bundled in there. So many other special interest legislation were passed in this bundle that would not have survived debate, committee and a real floor vote. Who knows how many horrors hide amongst the 5.5K pages."

People with PPD are always on guard, believing that others are constantly trying to demean, harm, or threaten them. These generally unfounded beliefs, as well as their habits of blame and distrust, might interfere with their ability to form close relationships. People with this disorder: 

Doubt the commitment, loyalty, or trustworthiness of others, believing others are using or deceiving them
Are reluctant to confide in others or reveal personal information due to a fear that the information will be used against them
Are unforgiving and hold grudges
Are hypersensitive and take criticism poorly
Read hidden meanings in the innocent remarks or casual looks of others
Perceive attacks on their character that are not apparent to others; they generally react with anger and are quick to retaliate
Have recurrent suspicions, without reason, that their spouses or lovers are being unfaithful
Are generally cold and distant in their relationships with others, and might become controlling and jealous
Cannot see their role in problems or conflicts and believe they are always right
Have difficulty relaxing
Are hostile, stubborn, and argumentative"
2020-12-28 14:09:26,"This whole bill is about what and how congress came up with for a relief bill. It is its contents that are the concern(s), and who benefits the most from them. Everywhere one reads the articles about this, is how it effects only the unemployed, possible evictions keeping government open for another year. How long are the continued unemployed benefits to last - 11 weeks, the eviction moratorium - one month extension...it's been and being a huge sell job to the Americans most effected by the pandemic with most benefits going to the wrong groups of the public.

It is a disgrace by Trump to have gone about it in this manner, but a larger disgrace by Congress in coming up and allowing once again lobbying to spread the wealth to where its not needed the most. A 5600 paged bill read by none to very very few passed by veto proof margins in both houses.
Pork, again, for the holiday season, is getting old.

The rules/procedures/laws enacted ect, the how we conduct business in governing, is where the problem lies.

So who was hurt the most by this not signing this bill last week....those in need the most, or those with need the least? Why is this? It didn't stop anything unless one was/is unemployed.

But hey tucked in this bill new guidelines for 401(k) where the investment industries will be making millions more monies on your wallet only if you are employed continually, with less responsibilities on their end."
2020-12-28 14:16:15,"His little stunt reached in and snatched another week of unemployment. Why do I say another? Because the original bill was for 16 weeks. Then Mnuchin demanded the $600 in stimulus per person, including minors and dependents, making under 75K. Do you know how that $600 was paid for? By taking it out of the 16 weeks of unemployment. So say you're a family of 4 making 150K, you're getting $2,400 dollars of an employed family's money allocated in the original bill. In California, we cannot legally open our business. I literally am not allowed to work. I do not see that changing anytime soon. Did you know if you take a PPP or EIDL, you can't take unemployment? So most of us Mom & Pop businesses took the PUA because banks wouldn't even give us the loan paperwork until the 1rst round ran out. If we then took it, we'd have to repay the EDD. Oh, and we're the only ones that our unemployment is based on net, not gross. We live in the Sacramento region, our state capital. The refusal to help state and local government means huge layoffs, which means less customers. I'm 60. Who will hire me when my business goes under? But hey, NYT employees, enjoy the $600 and ignore the now missing 6 weeks of unemployment. The good news is the food stamp rules changed and I can now apply for the $190 per month and maybe get a discount on my internet bill. So there's that ."
2020-12-28 14:10:13,"Americans have been played by Trump and McConnel.
Millions of Americans were the victims of this gambit.  Only through the heroic efforts of Speaker McConnel did Trump agree to sign the legislation on December 28th.  Trump did get McConnel to agree to take a bill to the Senate floor increasing the stimulus to $2000, something He said he wanted but just failed to ever mention.

When would that vote be taken?  Prior to the Georgia runoff?  Would the republicans finally agree to Trump's generous demand.  Win win.  McConnel got a relluctant Trump to sign,  Trump a hero because he got McConnel to allow a vote on the $2000 package.  Does it take immagination to believe he republicans will finally approve a $2000 stimulus?  Mabye, after all the only looming and immediate events is the runoff in Georgia and control of the Senate.

It is folly to believe this President did this out of honor.  This was a well corrdinated and well executed plan and Shummer and Pelosi fell for it.    Like or dislike Trump and McConnel, never underestimate them.  They are truly Machiavelian."
2020-12-28 14:18:02,"For once he did say something right.  The bill is a disgrace.  It took half a year for Rs in Congress  to agree to a bill that provided $600 to people who have a mountain of debt, rent/mortgage payments and medical bills, and probably have delayed home and car repairs.  We know what he is, and thank god he's leaving, but they're not.  In fact, the country elected more of them to the House, and there's a good chance it allowed them to keep control of the Senate.  These are the people who couldn't move fast enough to give away a trillion or two in tax cuts, mostly for the wealthy, when he took office.  So let's keep the spotlight where it belongs, on the Rs in Congress and their supporters."

2020-12-28 14:16:04,"What we’re not seeing here is the behind the scenes deal making between Trump and Congress, which over the last few days since Christmas Eve, have more than likely been filled with his demands for more money for a) himself, b) his family, and c) his donors. If you peel back the fake demand for $2000 for Americans, you’ll see he was really trying to negotiate for more for himself. And like everything else, he failed. If you could read the more than 5000 pages in the bill, tucked away in there I’m sure there are things in them that benefit a),b), & c). That’s really why he signed it."

Have to ask the departing Senator--why would we be sending hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax cut to individual billionaires (2018 tax cut)?  Were these billionaires in food lines then?

Moreover, where are any evidence-based studies establishing that any GOP supply side tax cuts (a) have been effective in generating economic activity and (b) were desperately needed by their largest beneficiaries, the very rich?  

The GOP's rank hypocrisy and disdain for regular Americans evidenced by both their Covid bill positions and their backing an overt criminal and kowtowing to the rich is their only defining legacy."

Over and over he proclaimed he doesn’t like losers... although he has been a loser, now losing the biggest battle of his life.

It is also a ridiculous argument, given by Lindsay Graham when the first amount of an extra $600 in the first round was voted on, that  an extra $600. will just incentivize people not to seek work.

Maybe the answer is withholding the Republicans in Congress' checks.  
They have not worked for the benefit of those who are suffering.  
In fact they have not done much of anything except fight the ACA and give huge tax incentives and reductions in taxes to their wealthy donors.  
In addition they seem to always be in favor of shutting the Government down.

Trump's pretense of wanting to give every American a $2,000 stimulus check is a scam.  

I expect the next tantrum will result in him declaring Marshall Law, so that he can remain in the White House."

2020-12-28 14:41:32,"In this story, and in reporting across national media, I fault the NYT and others for consistently supporting Trump's false messaging by referring to the bill as the ""pandemic relief bill"" or ""Covid relief bill"" in both headlines and in the bodies of stories.   There was NO separate bill; the bill in question was ALWAYS the Omnibus Budget - but Trump chose to ignore and obscure this, in his attempt to look like a ""good guy"" with his  after-the-fact criticisms of spending provisions.  And reporters/editors went along with it, amplifying and confirming his messaging to his supporters even though buried down in the stories  was the fact of the true nature of the bill.  Just a final example of how foolish, sloppy,  and sometimes even biased reporting in the mainstream media served to (initially) promote his candidacy then supported his false assertions, even while intending the opposite."
2020-12-28 14:45:01,"So, if any were still wondering, President Trump has enormous sway over our lives right up until January 20. He can do damage in many ways as long as he holds power. And he relishes holding power, rattling cages, and affecting political careers. It's probably the reason he so much wanted to win. Probably the reason so many American voters wanted him out of there. 

Power corrupts but the already corrupted should never be allowed to hold power in the first place. Lesson learned."

2020-12-28 14:43:34,"One wonders what changed so that the President would sign the bill.  One thought might be Sen. Sanders' pledge that if Mr. Trump signed, a $2000 stipend bill would be passed this week (as if Sanders can possibly deliver on that!)  A conspiracy theorist might speculate that Kevin McCarthy and Lindsey Graham (both of whom were in contact since Christmas with the president) agreed to contest the Electoral College Count in exchange for the signature.  That's just cynical enough a possibility as to be plausible, IMHO."
2020-12-28 14:50:21,I don't know if Trump waited until Sunday to sign until unemployment benefits lapsed purposefully or unknowingly.  Either is consistent with his profound Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
2020-12-28 14:51:23,"There is ""disgrace"" with this bill everywhere you look. It is a disgrace that the president was more focused on his own issues than those of needy Americans for the past seven weeks. It is a disgrace that Congressional Republicans felt $600 was adequate for citizens at the same time the pandemic is slated to infect far more people than before. It is a disgrace that when signing the bill the president didn't  immediately specify those items he views as wasteful. However, his list of specified items to come is perhaps like his healthcare plan; it will be here ""in a few weeks."""

The indecisiveness, while letting Americans down on Christmas, while creating chaos, while creating confusion and ambiguity, only to ""surprise"" the people by signing the bill anyway is mind blowing.

And there it is. A routine and minor aspect of the much larger effort by Congress has now become the leading headline on every front page this Monday morning, unintentionally casting Trump as the pivotal hero. That's all he wanted. He certainly doesn't care about how large the stimulus checks will be.

2020-12-28 14:39:38,"Once again our destroyer in chief, ""author"" of ""The Art of the Deal,"" demonstrates his complete ineptitude at accomplishing anything but chaos to absolutely no end. He has a complete lack of knowledge or understanding on how our democracy actually works.  Whether or not one believes stimulus checks should have been larger (and I do) Trump's timing, action, and the mechanics were never  going to be productive.  Equally as mystifying were Democratic leaders like Pelosi and Schumer taking the Trump bait and thinking they might get something productive out of his destructive behavior. They should have just ignored him"

2020-12-28 14:55:39,"I can only read Trump's actions here as a sign of total incompetence.  From a managerial standpoint, if he really wanted more money for families, he would have worked with Congress, either directly or via his Administrative assistants, to advocate just that.  He could have used his Bully Pulpit to help.  The fact that he did absolutely nothing, waiting until the very end, not even clueing in his congressional allies or his Administration, is a sign of complete incompetence.  
One thing I look forward to with the Biden Administration is a President who respects and knows how to work with people.  Yes, he may have difficulty getting things done with a likely divided congress, but he knows how to focus, delegate, make his objectives clear, and work with people.  What a refreshing change it will be."

The two have turned America against itself and now when the money is dwindling he goes golfing. This must be a joke, right? What president could care so little about his fellow Americans? Only one: Donald Trump."

Then, as he steps up to be inaugurated presumably for a second term, reveal to him at the last minute that it was all a hoax and that he lost — bigly.

2020-12-28 15:05:57,"Is Trump basically an unstable character, responding to his personal inner turmoil... a calculating sociopath... or an agent of America’s antagonists?

Pay back to campaign donors - NOT about the poor

The measure IS a disgrace,  to both parties

NOT about the  poor, payback  to rich campaign donors"
2020-12-28 14:59:11,"Such a petulant, spoiled child. If he really wanted everyone to get $2000 he could have made it clear while the legislation was being written. He probably didn't even think about it then. And at the end of the day, he's a Republican. In other words, he doesn't want to give anything to anyone unless they are already rich or his friends. This is just more populist posturing."
2020-12-28 15:12:56,"I respectfully submit that Trump cared not one bit about American citizens in his raging that the stimulus should be at a $2,000 level. Trump's rage was about rage. The Republicans ignored him and the Democrats used the rage to push back at the Republicans. 

This is what the end of malignant presidency looks like. There is no concern for American citizens by the president. Only unabashed, uncontrollable lashing out at everyone who has defied him."
2020-12-28 15:14:56,"I hope we can hang on for twenty three more days. Trump will then have no presidential power, and he and his administration will be a vile note in history. All we need to do is to get the media to ignore him."
2020-12-28 15:12:43,"Where was the need for this drama? Didn’t Mr. Trump know that the package presented to him was the outcome of prolonged negotiations in which his own top deputies had participated? Why didn’t he let them know what his preferences were? Why did he wait until the bill was approved by Congress to air his demands? And, most important of all, why didn’t his deputies apprise him of the main provisions in the bill before it was submitted to Congress?

Let's not fool ourselves. It is not a sudden compassion for the millions who would be suffering if the relief they have been receiving is stopped that prompted the president not to veto the bill. It was his awareness that the bill was passed by Congress with a veto-proof majority.

Ironically the main condition he had put on signing the bill – that the relief payments to individuals be raised from $600 to $2,000 – was agreed to by Democrats in Congress but opposed by Republicans. Only a few Republican stooges of his had supported that condition.

However, the one who aptly summed up his laughable performance this weekend was another Republicans, Sen. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania. “I understand he wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks,"" Mr. Toomey has been quoted as saying on “Fox News Sunday.” ""But the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”

We had a taste of President Trump’s erratic behavior not just this weekend but throughout his four years in office."

2020-12-28 15:16:47,"There are many things to complain about in this pork laden budget, starting with foreign aid.  Trump is right about this. But, to attempt tow swoop in at the last minute to make changes is a failed strategy.  Using a 1974 law to sequester funds won’t work either as Trump is gone in 23 days and Biden can simply release the funds I assume."
2020-12-28 15:19:44,"Nice picture of Melania. Makes me realize once again, the people like wives, kids, vp’s, senate who do really well interacting with Donald J Trump are the ones who keep their mouths shut and when talking tell him what a smart wonderful guy he is. Good riddance."
2020-12-28 15:15:24,"Her boots must cost at least $3,000 who would borrow them the money for her clothes when you know they don't have any?  Hum?"
2020-12-28 15:17:34,"Dying to know why Trump changed his mind on the bill. Did he realize that his 74 M voters would probably be the most hurt if he didn't sign? Was he trying to tweak the Republicans to remind them that they are nothing without him? Or was he simply, yet again, pointing out the failure of the two political party American system to produce sensible legislation? Or was Trump just being Trump...cruel, petty, whiny, broody, self-absorbed and chippy just because? 
On a similar note, I was impressed by AOC's sensible comment early on regarding how any member of congress could be expected to read a 5000+ page bill and be prepared to vote on it in under two days."
2020-12-28 15:23:24,"‘ “I applaud President Trump’s decision to get hundreds of billions of dollars of crucial Covid-19 relief out the door and into the hands of American families as quickly as possible,” Mr. McConnell said, without any mention of the delay Mr. Trump caused.’

Senator:  You and President Trump by blocking a meaningful stimulus have hurt many American families.  You certainly know it and really don’t care.   You deserve all of the disdain you get by uttering such disingenuous drivel.   Don’t use the deficit as an excuse, that ship has sailed."
2020-12-28 15:23:21,"Trump started a fight when everyone left the ring. The $2000 should have been the theme 9 months ago, not after Congress voted. This grandstanding had a negative economic impact on millions of people."
2020-12-28 15:28:01,"This was like a scene out of his reality show the Apprentice when all eyes were on trump and he got to decide who stayed and who was fired.  He lacked any business acumen but he loved to read the script and watch people squirm.  He was a pretend businessman then and he's a pretend president now, but he still craves being the center of attention and still feeds on others' suffering.  Thankfully, in 23 days, he exits stage left."
2020-12-28 15:31:06,"Just wondering if the people who are suffering the consequences of the 1 or 2 day delay in the President signing the bill understand that he (the President) wanted to give each of  them $1,200 more. It was the leaders of congress who opposed this additional aid to suffering Americans."
2020-12-28 15:25:05,Does anyone think that 600 or 2000 will provide meaningful support to anyone who has suffered financially during COVID? The article talks about a couple with five children $10 K in arrears on their rent. The extension of the moratorium will let them kick the can down the road a little longer but they will eventually need to pay. $600 might pay the groceries for the one month for that family. I know lawmakers have spent a lot of time on the relief bill. Focusing on the one-time payments is a way to get people interested but it’s really just a pleasant windfall for the many who don’t need it and grossly inadequate for those who do.
2020-12-28 15:29:52,People are focused on the one time $600 payment.  The biggest item in the bill is really the extension of unemployment benefits.  $300/wk on top of state benefits to those who have lost jobs is really more effective than a one time $600 payment.
2020-12-28 15:26:56,"Hopefully this is the last gasp of the chaos administration.  

Hopefully we learn to not elect fake businessman/reality show conmen going forward.

Hopefully we pay attention to ALL the marginalized in our society so they don't set dumpster fires in the White House anymore.

Trump experiment = abject failure and horrific disaster."
2020-12-28 15:28:03,"Most Americans knew that Mr. Trump was psychologically impaired and yet we elected him anyway.

If there is ANYTHING we have learned over the last four years, it is the incredible danger that awaits when someone who is mentally unfit is nonetheless sent to the White House.

This must never, ever happen again."
2020-12-28 15:25:16,The long coat that #45 wears all the time thinking it makes him look like a leader or cool or something is so absurd. He is a prime example of how money can not give you class or intelligence if you have neither to begin with.  Goodbye doofus.

How long has it been since we had a US President who didn’t “vacation” at his private seaside manse or gentleman’s Texas spread, but instead went home to a normal house, apartment, or condo of the type most Americans are lucky to hold on to?  Do we secretly, unconsciously vote for these millionaires and billionaires because we yearn for an aristocracy? Do you have to already have a fortune in real estate to qualify for nomination? Is being a member of the landed gentry some kind of qualification? Would living in Levittown or a trailer be an automatic disqualification?"
2020-12-28 15:32:33,"Well, hopefully, the gilded age is coming to a close. We certainly have the uncaring monarch- Let them eat cake!- whiling away his time in luxury as millions of Americans stand in food lines, stress about the rent, evictions, stress about jobs, being unemployed, collecting unemployment not to mention not having health insurance in the middle of a pandemic.
Can it get much worse? I am afraid to ask for fear that this pseudo monarch might reach for the red button and push it- claiming he had to it for the security of our country."
2020-12-28 15:35:07,"So this is how he makes America great again - by pulling infantile, attention-getting stunts like this that toy with people's lives.

They are so small, in fact, that they will do next to nothing to actually help Americans who are losing their homes, jobs, health and retirement savings.  We're drowning, and congress is throwing us a single water-wing--with a leak."
2020-12-28 16:00:17,"For once though, I’m not mad at him. I know. I know. It’s Donald Trump. However, the problem is so much bigger than Trump. As poorly motivated as it was, the holdout illumined the dysfunction of our government, the insufficiency of its responsiveness to the problems experienced by the demos, and the capture of our democracy by wealth. At the end of the day, the U.S. Congress worked very hard in a bipartisan manner to craft a nearly $1 trillion bill during a historic coronavirus pandemic that is killing hundreds of thousands of Americans and threatening the financial security of millions more and all our congressional representatives in the House and Senate could approve for the majority of us beneath the affluent classes is, wait for it, $600.  When considering the great crises of history, there is a phrase that scholars often use, “meeting the moment.” This Congress did not meet the moment of the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020. Unless America’s elites suddenly listen to their better angels and make some serious changes to our politics, government, and economy, I doubt if the U.S. government is even capable of rising to such a challenge anymore."
2020-12-28 15:58:18,"So the bill was signed after unemployment aid lapsed. Will all those who have been waiting now have to start the unemployment application process again, causing further delays in receiving desperately needed financial assistance? How on Earth is this fair or right?"

What about the landlord who still has a mortgage payment?"
2020-12-28 16:12:49,You have to admit that Trump is so good at getting the press and everyone else to focus on him and have his name in the headlines.  Just count the headlines the day after he finally signs the bill and compare that to the number of Biden headlines.  We all are so gullible and culpable.
2020-12-28 16:30:55,"Trump is deliberately creating controversy with his disruptions, in order to distract attention from his other actions:  pardons of his cronies, family, and ultimately, himself.

Trump may leave the White House next month, but he still controls the GOP.  Trump will issue incendiary tweets on a daily basis to disrupt President Biden.  

Senator McConnell will obstruct everything that President Biden tries to do. This will make defeating COVID difficult, and will make any economic recovery very slow.

But to McConnnell, ensuring the failure of President Biden is the main point.  He did it before with President Obama.

McConnell’s obstruction will hurt America.  But I’m sure that it will make Trump and Putin quite happy."

He should be removed from office immediately for his incompetence in making our pandemic the worst in the world and for prolonging the misery of our people."
2020-12-28 17:59:24,"There was nothing “unexpectedly” about Trump signing the bill. He intended to do it all along. He only said he wanted a $2,000 stimulus in the bill so he could (and did) dominate the news over the Christmas weekend. Once again Trump mocked the American people and controlled the media.

2020-12-28 18:17:59,"As of this morning, this stimulus back and forth is starting to look like a sly ""set-up"" to me.

Trump gets to look like a ""good guy"" by proposing $2000 for individuals and the Republicans get to pretend they oppose the President...we know that's not true. The Republican Party and our Republican elected representatives are firmly under the control of Trump. 

Meanwhile, neither has any intention of truly providing reasonable, reality-based financial support to the American people.

News flash! The money that's being bandied about...is ours. It is the hard-earned tax dollars of the American public. We earned it, we need it...give it to us.

These facts seem to have been lost in the ""alternate reality"" and ""alternate facts"" that now pass for truth.

The reality is that 70% of our economy relies on consumer spending and almost 50% of the people who lost their jobs in early Spring are still unemployed.

It's not rocket science...Jerome Powell gets it. If you want to save the economy, provide the people with money to spend.

Right now, the people have neither jobs, nor money and the economy is poised on a cliff.

And the President and Republicans play one more shell game with the well-being of the Amercian people they are sworn to serve.

The only thing which should have been in that bill was money to help the unemployed.  900 billion would go a long way if it all went to the people who needed it.  As usually our elected representatives who still got their paychecks, played games.  The only thing that Trump did was to let us all know just how selfish and arrogant our representatives are.

2020-12-28 21:22:03,"President Trump did sign the stimulus bill and he had every intention of doing so. $600 was a paltry amount and it should have been higher since the pandemic has caused so much devastation￼ and hardship. President Trump was willing to offer more but Congress declined to agree. Shameful. 

This is just a drop in the bucket and won’t help very much. The amount should have been at least double￼. These politicians are handsomely paid and don’t have to worry about where their next dollar is coming from. If you ask me, they were pretty stingy and as long as they￼ receive their salaries that is all they care about. This is pathetic and extremely selfish.

When I walk by the restaurants in New York and see them empty, it breaks my heart. They are open for restaurant outdoor dining but it has been very cold and few are taking advantage of this. In California where the weather is beautiful, they could certainly allow outdoor dining where it has proven to be safe.￼￼ In New York City, they could spread the tables far apart from one another and it would be all right for people to dine here. 

The politicians in these states have nothing to worry about. They are receiving hefty paychecks and don’t have to be concerned about paying their bills. Hopefully when these politicians terms in office expire,  they will be voted out￼. The hardships that they have created for these workers is cruel and mean spirited.￼"
2020-12-30 22:04:49,It would be great if people who don't really need the $600 donated it to food banks and housing advocates. There are people who are unemployed and facing eviction who need it more much than the Zoom-percenters.

I realize I am not in desperate need of aid but I do pay my fair share of taxes and use the public school system. Not sure why I cannot get some money back from the government. Once again I know many people have been more adversely affected then me, but since the idea of the deficit being bad has been de-bunked (New York Times Best Seller The Deficit Myth).

""A more effective approach, experts say, would have raised unemployment insurance benefits to the jobless by $600 a week, matching the supplement under the stimulus package Congress passed last spring, rather than the $300 weekly subsidy the new legislation provides. Democrats had pushed for larger payments to the jobless and included it in legislation that passed the House, which they control. But the measure met stiff resistance from Republicans, who control the Senate, and was not included in the final compromise bill.""

As always Republicans block any decent humane sensible public policy.  I'm above the income limit due to $140,000 a year in unreimbursed medical expenses  for my wife with Alzheimer's.  Withdrawals from her IRA for her care count as income so we get nothing.  No Problem.  But Republicans prove again that  they are unfit to make public policy"

People like me and my husband, retired (and semi-retired). Target it to the most vulnerable, those who have lost jobs and facing eviction and food insecurity, and the small businesses -- the family-owned restaurants and shops -- who will be forced to close without some relief. This is not ""free"" money; we all will end up paying it back in one form or another. So let's be smart about how we go about it, investing in our nation's future by saving those who need it most."

But be sure we understand that this is not about ""stimulus"". It's about helping the huge numbers of newly unemployed get through this unprecedented time. Other people will be fine. Giving a wider range is people money may be good politics, but it makes no sense if you want your policy to help people. During this pandemic, households with jobs saved more than usual because they had less opportunity to spend. It makes no sense to give them more money."

While people might immediately save the $600 or $2000, that becomes a lifeline for many families, including my own. It means that a family may not have to use a credit card to buy groceries, put off getting new tires or making a car repair, or make them able to pay medical bills. After saving a stimulus check, a family might be more inclined to spend money in other ways, e.g., order takeout for dinner one night. Purporting that saving a *small* stimulus check during a pandemic is bad for the economy is not only not true, it only further support Mitch McConnell...."

So what if people are saving more money. Most people don't have a savings cushion at all. If you're well-off, I don't think any less of you if you save the stimulus money either. Foodbanks should be given a priority of the stimulus over any payments to businesses. It should not fall on people to have to be good Christians to donate their stimulus checks. That's just poor management. 

Bottom line, it is the taxpayers' money, and why is Mitch McConnell and all the other politicians playing hardball with it?  Absolutely infuriating."

But, McConnell would hear none of that.  Consequently, we are stuck with an inefficient check being sent to every one earning $75K or less and with much of it saved (or invested, which is effectively the same thing).

We could make a public plea for that kind of display of unity on the airwaves and internet as well.

The question then becomes why do the Republicans oppose this, but favor sending checks to essentially all Americans, whether they need it or not. Aside of the fact that they are skinflints, their calculated view is that sending checks to most of us will have a pro-GOP impact, particularly with the Georgia senate runoff election next week. Mitch himself factored that in and the Republican candidates Senators Loeffler and Perdue enthusiastically welcomed the passage of the aid bill, became worried when Trump refused to sign and were among a handful of Republican senators who were in favor to up the handout to $ 2000 when Trump demanded that."

If you get this stimulus check and you have no debt to pay down, then use it to stimulate the economy. Buy something produced locally, like candles or soap; hire a handyperson to do jobs; buy gift certificates to local businesses, which will give the business an immediate infusion of cash. Donate to the local food bank, especially items that can't be bought with food stamps: toothpaste, tampons, diapers. there are plenty of ways to put this money to use to help people in need."

There is no reason to give seniors on Social Security any of this money.  Give larger amounts to the unemployed and those working through this pandemic.

I spent much of the last check on donations to Biden, et. al.  This is just going to sit in my checking account and be whittled down over time.

2020-12-30 22:43:00,"So disagree. These payments have an income cap already. Very few people under that cap are not hurting. Sure. some have planned their financial life out perfectly and don't need the money - but I would bet they are few and far between.

Additjonally, there is a problem with how the government defines ""unemployed."" When that term is used it generally means individuals that have filed for unemployment benefits because the last job they had was with a company that actually treated them as an employee, reported their employment and paid unemployment taxes. Target to that group and you miss the millions of young people that have been scrapping by for years doing gig jobs or work in industries where the employers routinely dodge benefits costs by staffing with ""independent contractors."" I believe it also excludes people whose unemployment has expired and who gave up looking for a full time job because they have found they are unwanted by companies because they are too old (age discrimination is rampant) or for many other reasons. 

We have a huge portion of our population that are invisible to many government programs and cobble together their income from a patchwork of part time and gig economy jobs so when those jobs have disappeared now, they don't show up anywhere in any system as having lost their income. 

The stimulus checks may not be perfect, and they are certainly too meager, but it is the simplest, quickest way to avoid missing people that need the help."

The only difference is, while it was necessary to rush a blanket solution out back then, there's been plenty of time for a smarter, needs-based distribution process to have been configured this time around.

Purely anecdotal, but of ALL the people I know who received first round checks, only ONE family needed it for reasons related to C-19. Proves nothing, but certainly says something."

This is a seasonally adjusted rate updated monthly.  There was a bump in April, it has trended downward each month since.   Dollars deposited in a savings account today are quite likely to be spent fairly quickly returning the ratio of savings to disposable personal income to the mean.

Naturally, I do not mean to say that the money is optimally allocated to go to those in the greatest need.  It is not.  These direct payments are intended to take the eye of the general population off the ball.  Everyone is talking about the direct payments and little is being said about the ""three martini lunch"" provision, or the accounting for the PPP program being actually tied to recovering losses for the borrowers.

Sadly, it is simply easier to get something like a $600 check done, than do the heavy legislative lifting of really helping solve the homeless problem, systemic hunger, overburdened renters (and small landlords), and an overwhelmed medical system."

This benefit assisted those who had been employed and self-employed.  The CERB was $2,000 per month and ended in September.  Then our regular federal unemployment program kicked in with some adjustments due to the pandemic (maximum payment $573/week).  Other assistance from the federal government went out to aid with extra costs of health care and education, small business support, etc.  We've never had a ""stimulus"" where all families were sent out money.

The $600 has already been approved--leave it at that.  It's easy to say there are big numbers of people who would like more free money, but at some point the government will go too far--probably already has."
2020-12-30 22:58:52,"Missouri and Mississippi pay the lowest per week maximum unemployment dollars listed at $235 and Massachusetts with an $800/week max the highest. What you have to make to qualify for the highest rate varies, usually dependent on what you earned last. In a family where the gross filing did not exceed $150K joint, that person may qualify for the max in their state. So if you qualify for the highest rate and add $300 a week, even the poorest, get  $3000 in10 weeks. A one time payment to a family of 4 with no income is a one time max of $2400. HOW is that depleting the potential for the unemployed to collect? Not sure if the children are eligible in the scenario of the breadwinner getting unemployment but if they were then the total collected in that family of four would be a total of $4200 compared to the other family getting a total of $2400. How is that depleting from the family on unemployment? Looks like the unemployed family gets $1800 more, maybe not all at once but by the end of 10 weeks. Maybe it should have been a lower salary qualification for the one-time pay and at least double it. Don't remember the length of time the unemployed could have collected the $600/week extra when one time payments would have been a max of $3400 for a family of four. A quick math review shows that by week 6 of unemployment the unemployed person would have collected $3600 and gone on to collect more. Still do not see how the unemployed are hurt more...math and facts please.."

That's what these stimulus checks are.

My husband and I came in about $1000 below the threshold. We are below the threshold because we paid private health insurance for $1600 a  month and wrote that off in 2019, wrote off interest on our home, etc. (Yep. Privilege.)

We got checks in spring, we'll get checks now. 

We are BOTH employed. We don't need the money. Do we want it? Yes. Of course. We desperately need a new roof.

But we should NOT be getting these checks and my guess is many, if not most, NY Times readers shouldn't be getting it, either.

This money should be going to the unemployed. This money should be going to people's whose hours are cut. This money should go to families under 50K who are not making it. This money should go to small businesses who are struggling. This money should go to food banks, community health centers, homeless shelters, and other non-profits helping people in need.

(Please don't tell me to give the money away, we already have, we will in future. Don't be irritating.)

WE paid for these stimulus checks by paying taxes. We are DROWNING in debt as a country. 

This whole thing just smacks of the total incompetence of our president and congress. 

Yeah, give me and my husband more money.

For example: the Gateway project to build a rail tunnel from NJ to NYC; the NYC subway needs $20 billion or will closedown, destroying NYC; the thousands bridges and tunnels crumbling. How about High Speed Trains between Boston and Washington DC, The HSR  projects in Florida, California, Texas, etc. It's a shame that the US does not have HSR, but XIX century trains!

Who is to say that my livelihood is not on the chopping block next? Better to increase my savings or pay down bills than give away my stimulus check, when the government already takes home a large chunk of my monthly income toward taxes.

Why not give them enough to enable them to have some peace of mind as they search for a job or try to retrain themselves or even relocate to where there is a job?  And why not make the unemployment benefits portable so that people can move to find jobs?

I have been unemployed for long periods of time.  All that stood between me and homelessness was my savings once unemployment benefits expired.  The help from the NYS Labor Department was useless because I knew how to look for a job.  Employers weren't interested in hiring anyone who couldn't do 99% of the job with no training.  They weren't interested in someone with experience who was over the age of 25.  

We have serious problems when it comes to employment, pay, and education in the US.  We tell people to get a college education in a useful field as if that will guarantee them something.  It doesn't but it does give the industry a big advantage when it comes to hiring.  We don't have real choices in high school for students who are not interested in college or not college material.  And we continue to pay CEOs far more than they are worth while underpaying the rest.  We give tax breaks to entities that don't need them.

Other countries hard hit by the virus and looking at economic distress focused relief on workers not employers. As a result, business got millions of PPP, spent it on God knows what, laid off employees and banked the difference. Workers got a one-time advance on any future income tax refund and unemployment subsidy. Now  Republicans won’t put more money on the table because they are certain that providing support to workers who were laid off ensure they will not return to worker to employers that laid them when things got tough. Republicans are the political party of cruelty and absurdity."

I find the talk of ""stimulus"" odd.  Although the pandemic (as the article notes) lays bare the very different economic strata at play these days, I do not understand how we can ""stimulate"" an economy where so many are subject to lockdowns and restrictions.  Where are people going to spend this money?  Not at a bar, thus keeping it open.  Maybe some extra takeout - but not enough to lead cash-starved restaurants to rehire.  Pay the back rent?  That is doubtful, where it matters, for those protected by eviction moratoria.  I suppose they can shop on Amazon, but I am not convinced this will do much for employment.

Elsewhere, I have read that a sotto voce justification for such payments is ""morale"".  I think that is accurate, and I find it compelling enough.  Maybe we should be more candid about the basis for such a policy, lest its likely failure (to stimulate) erode public confidence in further measures that may be needed down the road."

Certainly $600 stimulus checks would be plenty if your rent was $10 a month and your family could eat on $1 a day.  The tiny $600 stimulus checks are blanket targeted at VOTERS instead of the unemployed.   In contrast many European countries, had existing safety nets set up well before the pandemic that helped to cushion the blow for people.  The GOP elite has decided that 614 American billionaires growing their net worth by a collective $931 billion in 2020 balances out 12.6 million people now unemployed."

I being one of those people.  The industry I worked in as a video engineer working on (LIVE EVENTS, anything with an audience basically) won't be happening anytime soon.   I've thought the stimulus should base the Pandemic Assistance Unemployment payments on your prior year Tax return.  That way the people who made from the range of very little to a decent salary can be paid out according to the ratio of what they were making before.   It would target the funds much better based on income and what they were spending in the economy prior to the pandemic.  Less income familys had less spending.  More income families spent more.  In any case I want all people to be taken care of.  Isn't that what your government is suppose to do?"
2020-12-30 23:42:29,"I never, ever thought I would agree with McConnell on anything, but I agree with him on this.  A stimulus should boost the economy, and so much of this money will just go into savings for people who do not really need it.  This money, this half trillion dollars and more, needs to go to the unemployed, to small businesses, to states and cities, where it is desperately needed and can reenter and revive the economy quickly. 

I think the Democratic leadership know this, but they are using this issue to beat up on Republicans and maybe thereby win the Senate seats in Georgia.  I hope we do win those Senate seats, and maybe all this nonsense is worth it in that sense.  But to saddle future generations of Americans with dangerous and burdensome debt in this inefficient and irresponsible manner is wrong.  Spend the half trillion dollars to help the economy by all means, but spend it wisely, productively and humanely."
2020-12-30 23:43:13,"I am financially secure and I am grateful. I have friends who are not. I am interested in the fact that so many will save their six hundred dollar check rather than spend it. That's fine. But I have been under the impression that too many Americans are behind in the rent, mortgage payments, choosing between groceries and medicine, etc. 

It has been my expectation that to actually help Americans in need would mean helping the neediest first. And for the most part, six hundred dollars is good for a few weeks until the next payment is due or the next trip to the grocer is needed. I would think that for the fiscal conservatism that has been espoused by republicans there would be resources available for a 'rainy day' such as today, and that it would be administered according to need. But it turns out that trickle down economics is a lie. It seems a government that helps the needy is socialism, the dirty word kind, not helping your neighbor, or something akin to a barn raising.

A new generation will realize this, and there will be progress."

I'm surprised the $600 went through but at least I can help with the recycle of money. It will all wind up back at the treasurer's office in taxes.

stimulus can't create inflation because the basic needs of people are not satisfied, of course those who can will save this money but it doesn't mean that it will be invested in financial market of fuel the financial bubble, because the finance turned into chaos despite looking attractive, nobody can know for sure what will happen in the short term, they can lose everything in one day.

You want an apt analogy, try operating an automobile with both the brake and gas pedals fully depressed.

This is an aid to relief the effects of a natural disaster which persists. Once it's past, then a stimulus package will be appropriate."

I support and hope for the $2,000, and if you’re doing well enough to give it away, that’s great, but there’s a lot of people that need it.

Indeed, it is only when giving a 2 thousand dollar tax cut to the American people that logic, fairness and math come into play."

It's nice that there are people who ""don't need it"" and will donate to food banks etc. but please don't think that you are in the majority -- you aren't.

I make more than a million dollars a year - my kids have an existing safety net and don't need the check.

No general “stimulus payment.” All the cash payouts should go to unemployed people; that would be about $5000 each.

Next, a wealth tax: Five percent of the aggregate wealth of U.S. billionaires would give each of the 20 million U.S. unemployed about $10,000 each. Yes, just take it.

Paying $15,000 each to the people who need it makes more sense than paying an average of $850 each to 128 million people, most of whom don’t need it.

For those of us who don’t need it: give to food banks, shelters, etc. Get take-out and delivery and tip shockingly well. Ever leave a $100 tip for a $20 pizza? It’s fun. It makes people happy, and it wasn’t really your money anyway."

If you had asked me, or any of my 3 out of 4 adult Kids what we would do, we would say: Pay my next months (or last 2) month's rent, catch up on my utilities, pay my phone bill,(which has been shut off for two months) and anything left over (hahaha) buy some groceries. Their jobs are GONE, by the way. Never to return.

What must it be like for those of you who believe that giving desperate people a few lousy dollars to tide them over for less than a month during a catastrophic, once in a lifetime pandemic, is just a frivolous endeavor ?  

That 600 check? It was spent well over two months ago for those of us in the margins. Save your empty pontificating about deficit spending because at this point we are  all very well aware that the only time Congress cares about deficit spending is when they have to give the People money or programs that help the average American.

This is the only action which make sense whatsoever.  The entire bill should only contain provisions for helping unemployed or partly employed (because of the corona) and should fit into 3 pages.  Sending (fake) monies straight into the account is plain stupid, profligate, mindless, and does not recover anything in the economy.  Treats people who largely do not suffer the stupid virus.  Sending money to Wall St,. which was by far the most important, disgusting, and shameful element of the spring tranche of fiat money must be stopped by all means.  The rich got massively richer in the midst of the pandemic, mind you !  Mentioning ANY help or giveaway in this situation to foreign countries should be punishable by law.  The current bill, in which the Americans got pittance and which is full of insane politicization deserves the wrath of God.

However former coworkers that made less than 75k last year but didn’t lose their jobs did got the first check. I was able collect unemployment which was less than my previous pay. I used my savings to make up the difference. Savings have since dried up and another round of stimulus is going out and again I will miss out because it was based on 2019 income before the pandemic and before I lost my job. It should be based on people’s need as it stands now not pre-pandemic income levels."

Only 15 percent of people said they had spent it, or planned to spend it. Most said they would save the cash or use it to pay down debt.""

Just who were the participants in this study? Investment clients? Here is an article from December 2019, showing that almost half of the people in this country work for meager wages.

Add to that the disabled, older people relying only on social security, and people above the ""low wage"" point that are helping to support family members (and unless living in the same household, cannot even be claimed as dependents), and everyone else falling through the cracks in our ""economy"", while the rich get richer, and you have a whole lot if people out there struggling to make it. Also, just as there are those who are underemployed, unemployed, or with additional financial burdens, you have employed people who are living in cars or shelters.

Many have incurred additional expenses to work remotely and for children to remote learn as well. Shall we get into the Covid medical bills, the missed time from work due to personal illness or care of family members?"

I am 70 years old, on early retirement Social Security and a very small, under $500 monthly pension from NJ.  So my income is under $25,000 per year.  There has been no substantial increase in SS payments in a long time, not since I've been on them:  yet the deductible goes up as does the cost of my private Party B supplement - every year.  I spent part of the money for such luxuries as a kneeling support for gardening and an electric wok...and to pay down credit card debt stemming from brake and battery repairs to my 20 year old car, which I will take to the grave with me.  I do not take vacations, and haven't flown in a plane since my divorce in 2007.   So I'm a real high ""liver"" (renter) who could use that $2000 without wasting any of it.  

May I point out alongside the fact of no major increases in SS in decades, the Federal Funds rate, the target interest the Fed charges to its banking customers, has been approaching zero ever since the 2008 Crisis; meaning that the banks, financial management firms and large speculative businesses have an almost zero cost of borrowing; how about small businesses?   No quite so good.  And the banks who can borrow from the fed at .5%, what do they pay on deposits and money market funds?  Under 1%; what do they charge on credit cards?  For most of us in the hole -20-24% percent.   Now that's a fair system!

Trump wants to portray himself as the champion of the downtrodden in final days of his reign after having trodden on them in various ways over the past four years. Pelosi is intent on pitting McConnell against Trump by supporting his demand for the increase and McConnell, in turn, is cleverly turning the table on  Pelosi by piloting  ""poison pill"" legislation, though recommending the increase, which the Democrats cannot stomach.

I'm so sick of this selfish ruling elite in this country who have devised an economy that serves those at the top and that commoditizes ultimately the suffering of everyone else.

Just like this current scam by ""fiscal conservatives"" who are against sending money to states that need that money to pay for the ongoing extra expense of pandemic related expenditures. 

So these same neoliberal economist cult members turn a pandemic into a sledgehammer to further weaken state and local governments to ""prove"" their mantra that ""big government"" is bad and that the private sector is the answer to everything.  Austerity on steroids.

I submit that Austerity and this assertion that direct payments as stimulus won't be spent is actually the tired argument of moral hazard for the little people.

That moral hazard of course is never asserted when another line item is entered into the tax code to benefit .01 percent of the population in yet another way to shelter money from taxes that pay for the infrastructure that percentage of the population wants to use for free e.g., interstate highways, courts protecting intellectual property, State Dept, Military, Patent office, local services, state services, etc"

That’s not that people don’t need the money: it’s that, in case of a further disaster, there will be no help to be found. It’s an indictment of the lack of social supports in this country.

Many people in this situation have been forced to cope with the pandemic seriously disrupting their normal day-to-day activities, but they’ve suffered NO Covid-19 related financial costs. None.
Or a senior married couple, both of whom worked and now collect pensions —> Assuming neither hudband nor wife have contracted Covid, depositing $4000 in these folk’s checking account, while other people aren’t able to buy groceries or pay utility bills, is serious misuse of government funds.

It’s a much more difficult task for the government, but giving assistance to those who have endured serious financial harm seems a better idea than giving everyone $600, or $1200, or $2000.

I have job security and my career and health insurance are safe. Things that I could buy to ""stimulate the economy"" I can buy without this $600.

However for the people out there that truly need it -- that lost their jobs, that have no insurance, that are struggling to keep up with rent, mortgage, utilities, bills, just putting food on the table for their kids -- this $600 is a pittance. It's a crumb. This stimulus will go right into keeping these families treading water for another 30 days, it does nothing to help the economy, and come next month, these people are going to be in the exact same position they're in now.

For those who like to complain about ""handouts"" -- this is it, when it's handed out to people like me. This is what you should be mad about. If you're mad about the minimum wage-earning retail worker getting more from this stimulus than their paycheck, then your frustrations are misdirected.

For those millions of Americans out there wondering how they're going to pay next month's rent, or when their landlord will evict them, or staring at an empty fridge and pantry, this isn't a handout -- it's a lifeline, and unfortunately one that is far too short."

Although I'm not in Georgia, I guess Mnuchin and McConnell moved quickly to make sure Georgians get their handouts before the election. That $600 gift should be enough to ensure their proper gratitude to the party that grudgingly agreed to let them have it. If it weren't for an election that will determine whether McConnell gets to obstruct everything Biden tries to do, there would have been no $600. Gotta look out for the Deficit! Unless it's a tax cut for wealthy donors and corporations, since we all know that stock buybacks trickle down enormous prosperity!

As for me, the $600 is going right back in the Treasury with my final quarterly estimated tax payment for 2020. Just like first stimulus handout, which helped me pay the balance due on my 2019 1040 and my first quarterly payment for 2020. 

Sending money from the Treasury so that I can send it right back doesn't seem very efficient. Nor does it stimulate the economy in any way I can discern. But we all know that government is inherently inefficient.

Far better to spend the money to provide those without jobs with say 80 percent of their income that they earned pre pandemic . This gives those who have been truly harmed by the pandemic fair and much needed funds .
Those who have kept their jobs and receive the stimulus payments are more likely to save it than spend it. Particularly as many of the opportunities for discretionary spending are denied them due to COVID restrictions.
There are other anomalies creating injustice , example as the payments are based on 2019 income so a person earning $80000 last year now unemployed gets nothing whereas as person earning $75000 last year still employed gets the money.

Biden must get to grips with this now and have legislation available so additional funds yes the full $500 billion can be targeted and paid to those who have been genuinely impacted by COVID."

Now a family of 4 living on $75,000 really needs the money. It would make more sense to me if there were sliding scale inversely proportional to the marginal tax bracket. People in the lower brackets would receive more; people in higher brackets would receive less. In the 24% bracket and above nothing, those in the 10 and 12% brackets a good deal more, those in the 22% bracket something but not as much. But a simple $2000 per head seems a rather blunt approach.

This will include those who are not employed at regular jobs and do not receive unemployment insurance. Stimulus checks are simple to distribute and do not require the development of an elaborate means testing aid application bureaucracy. Remember that the last time we set up one of those, The Affordable Care Act, it took four years.

We also need to note that peoples actual savings, not the rate at which they save money has been depleted. If people use the checks to pay off credit card debt or back rent they are doint just what they should. If some relief is not given we will end the pandemic with seriously impaired consumer demand and even more impoverished working people. But maybe that was the idea."
2020-12-31 01:55:22,"The selfishness exhibited by some of those interviewed for this article is nothing short of appalling. If you don't need it, give it to those who do. Where is their sense of humanity? 

There are so many who are suffering so much. If those stingy, hypocritical politicians responsible for this pittance can't do what's right, at least we can."
2020-12-31 01:58:09,"I wonder if this round of payments will go any better than the last, when some waited months for their payments.  So far things look disorganized again:

Congress is still debating whether to increase payments to $2,000, meanwhile, the Treasury Dept. has already started making $600 payments.

The IRS is still woefully behind. This payment is supposed to be based on 2019 tax returns. I filed my return on the extended July 15 deadline, on paper by mail. The IRS has still not processed my tax return. For the stimulus payments in the spring, they based payments on 2018 or 2019 returns, because 2019 returns were still coming in.  Now, payments are supposed to be based on 2019 returns. That assumes 2019 returns should be complete by now. Mine isn't. I wonder what the IRS will assume for my case?

This isn't funny anymore. In a few days I'll be able to start working on my 2020 tax return, and my 2019 return hasn't even been processed yet."
2020-12-31 01:58:52,"Hi — We’re barely going to make the rent this month. We’ve turned off the heat as much as we can to stretch the oil in the tank as far as we can. There’s three days of food in the fridge but nothing in the checking account once we’ve paid the rent. But there’s no “unemployment” to look to since neither of us are technically “unemployed”: We were starting a business when the pandemic hit but now the savings are gone and since one of us is severely immunocompromised, the short-term “gig” type things—like driving Uber—one might resort to are out-of-the-question.

The situation is such a grind with no relief in sight, I’ve contemplated suicide.

We’re all in this together? Ha."
2020-12-31 01:58:57,"Ohhh, what shall I save my $600 for?

Perhaps the multi-thousand dollar hospital bill I’ll receive when I get the virus from a poor grocery store worker?

Or maybe food for the next 9 months I won’t receive any aid?

Maybe for a rainy day, when my unemployment runs out a couple months from now?

The possibilities are endless!"
2020-12-31 02:00:58,"I can't believe how tone deaf this article is. First, less people are going to qualify for this round of stimulus checks because the income limit was reduced from $99K to $88K. Second, the Boston Lawyer and his ilk will not be getting a check, so why was he even interviewed? There are millions of people who haven't received a paycheck in months. I work on Broadway; this pandemic has been a disaster for the industry & business that are supported by it. Luckily I am still working but my pay was cut 25% last year and we expect further furloughs this year until tickets start being sold again. People like me need this stimulus check. Start interviewing folks in Broadway or in restaurants or hotel workers. Those are the EXPERTS in this."
2020-12-31 02:03:03,"While I don't disagree with the premise of focusing on providing more funds to the unemployed, you chose an attorney and an author/editor as you examples? Can you say tone deaf? 

I work in a rural community with many people who are fast food workers and single parents, and the stimulus money is literally going to food, heat and rent. This money is literally survival money for many people, or avoiding foreclosure funds."
2020-12-31 02:05:29,There does not seem to be any relief for example for 2019 college grads who were listed as dependents on their parents tax returns but who entered the work force pre-pandemic and then lost or were furloughed from their jobs. They don’t get stimulus checks at all- a tax credit does not help them - they need stimulus checks too much more than the people profiled in this article.
2020-12-31 02:07:08,This is insulting on all counts. I should not receive a stimulus because I burned through my savings safety net and would like to have it back! The audacity of these economists!

2020-12-31 02:19:31,"Not a new idea.  But why didn't the people who wrote the stimulus bill think of when they wrote it not just now? If carried out consistently, it amounts to income redistribution which, of course, th Repubs wou clall it ""socialism"", whic is why they didn't think it before.   

In other words, give to the needy, not the greedy,"
2020-12-31 02:19:40,"Articles such as these show how out of touch the NYT is with the general public and is emblematic of the democratic party more generally.  Who are ""most Americans?""  Are you referring to ""most"" upper middle-class Americans making over six figures with one child or no children? You interview a lawyer and an author who are not hurting for money-- do they represent most Americans?  How about interviewing those in the service industry who lost their job or had their hours cut.  How about interviewing those in the food donation lines.   In my world, ""most"" Americans will use the 2000 dollars immediately or within the month on necessities or bills-- bills can be debt too that would still be paid or defaulted on otherwise with or without the stimulus payment.

What's your point with such an article?  The headline supports a blatant republican talking point.  

At least try to be more balanced in your approach.  Yes, unemployment benefits should be boosted as well, but think about all the people not on unemployment, but who have had hours cut.  2000 paltry dollars amounts to a little over 200 dollars a month since the last stimulus direct payment-- it's needed and will be used.  

America left workers out to dry while Europe provided more support for their people that is both rational and moral."

2020-12-31 02:27:04,"Exactly who are the economists anonymously quoted in this article: “Economists on the right and left of the political spectrum said that when otherwise financially secure people receive an unexpected windfall, they almost invariably save it. The free-market economist Milton Friedman highlighted this phenomenon decades ago.”   

The presumed  “windfall” comes as the country suffers the worst pandemic in a century.  As the economy melts. As 30million people are on the verge of eviction.  Goldman Sachs and the Blackstone aground are the biggest landlords in the country.   As democracy melts.  As our institutions melt.   As the most corrupt President in the history of the republic wants to overturn the elections.  All thanks to free-market economics of a free for all.

Milton Friedman, the father of deregulation, first adopted by Reagan and all subsequent Administrations, thanks to meritocratic advisers, caused the elimination and export of the American manufacturing  base to China and destruction of the American middle class.   His doctrine also cause the ascent of the American billionaire oligarchy and historic income inequality.   

The ”free-market economist Milton Friedman”wrote a piece in the times whose free-market ideas are so well encapsulated in its headline:

Money is fungible, what people say they will do with the $600 check doesn't really matter.

2020-12-31 02:39:03,This is a bit off topic but still related. Why does Mitch McConnell - who was only elected by a handful of voters in one small state - get to singlehandedly decide the fate of hundreds of millions of Americans?  I never voted for that idiot and neither did anybody outside of Kentucky.  As a matter of fact not even all of Kentucky voted for him. This is just one more indication of how deeply messed up our system of government has become.  No one person should have that much power.  I think he is actually more dangerous and does more damage than Trump and that’s really saying something.

2020-12-31 02:53:48,"As the debate continues over whether the basic stimulus payment should be $600 or $2000, the treasury department has begun electronically making $600 deposits into recipients bank accounts.
The immediacy of this (praiseworthy) action might be in reaction to the desperation of some unemployed citizens, small business owners, etc.

On the other hand, this rust-to-deposit could be part of a corrupt, calculated swindle.
Will the citizens of Georgia go to the top of the list? Will all their checks be deposited before the special election on January 5th?
Are Mnuchin, Trump and McConnell trying to use public funds to influence two senatorial runoff elections?!?

  By ""saving"", most people who make less than 75k, mean putting this money away to pay the property taxes that will be due in 3 months, or the huge heating bill that will be due in January and February, etc.  
   And most people in this income range aren't writing off huge amounts in deductions so as to reduce their huge income!! 
    The people that I know who are getting this money are truly needy -- because one member of the family has been laid off, or they work in the restaurant or retail industries and their income is now next to nothing, or their second job has disappeared, etc.

2020-12-31 02:59:59,"Its our money. It will be spent, saved, donated, or maybe even given back. This will depend solely on the whim of the recipients. It’s bottom up economics. We have tried trickle down. We know it doesn’t work. 

I often wonder if a direct stimulus in 2008 could have produced a better outcome than the ‘recovery’ we had. Instead, we gave all the money to the people who created the problem, then scapegoated mortgage holders. Oh, and the banks hoarded that money. 

The lawyer mentioned in the story has to be making more than 75k. The argument about each round of stimulus having less effect is ridiculous. We’ve had one round. It can be argued 75k is too high a limit. Fine.

This is just the start of the austerity drumbeat now that the Dems are back in the White House. Good on Bernie for fighting for the American people. Let’s build 3 less fighter jets next year and stop construction on the border wall. That should about cover this."
2020-12-31 03:05:23,"Citing Milton Friedman's belief that people will tend to save (not spend) a boost in income:  is based on a 1957 theory he developed (Permanent Income Hypothesis).  1957!  Before consumer debt, credit cards, student loans, jumbo mortgages, cell phone bills, internet bills, cable bills, the end of company provided pensions, the introductions of social security and medicare and government health care exchanges...  and all the other financial innovations that happened since that simpler time - say it again, 1957.  A truly out of date theory!  This is sixty three years later and in a pandemic induced economic crisis, not still in ""rational man"" territory.

Some will use (= relief) the money.  Some will spend(= stimulus) it.  Some will save it, not a bad thing considering the uncertainty of the near term future of so many jobs as well as government programs.  The giant glaring mistake is calling this a stimulus bill, rather than a relief bill, if you want to poke a hole in it and parse out who below the iincome threshold is in dire need, basic need, or no need.  Which only serves to confuse the American public and engender so many degrees of resentments."

Those of us working in hospitality, fitness or travel aren’t going to see much in the way of reopening until fall, if Fauci is correct in how long this vaccine will take now that ‘operation warp speed’ has basically done a belly flop. We aren’t going to see vaccinations for many months. What we need is a plan - 3,6,12 months - of how we are going to get help. I’m sick and tired of hearing Mitch tell me I don’t need any more Covid relief or Kelly Loffler saying that I shouldn’t be handed a $600 check since I didn’t work for it. A woman who married into $800,000,000 doesn’t get to talk about the worth of my work. 

The nightmare of what we’re about to face once we’ve been vaccinated scares me. Those between 40-60 are in for an age discrimination avalanche because we’re never going to find new jobs like the good ones we lost. Those jobs aren’t coming back. Who’s going back to school at 48 or 53 to go into debt and work for 10-12 good years? Where are we going to work? Are we all going to work at Walmart, Walgreens and McDonalds?

My current fear, knowing these republicans and how vindictive and petty they are, is this is the last financial help we’re going to get. At some point, when people have nothing, they’re going to start doing whatever they must in order to survive.

Inflationary? The progressive economist Dean Baker wrote, “… most people will save most of their money, but it would be great to see the labor market get to the point where we were worried about wages rising too rapidly. …[There are no trade-offs budgeted for this extra $2000…] In short, right now, the $2,000 per person check is the closest thing in politics we will ever see to free money.

He only goes to work, no social like, due to my husband, with serious heart condition! He doesn’t want to take a chance on picking up Covid and passing it on. He now had no health insurance! 
My granddaughters husband has had his wages drastically cut, they are now living living her parents, along with their 2 toddlers, they too no longer have the means to pay rent, medical expenses, even with health insurance.

I understand that specific personal examples are supposed to render the article more meaningful for the reader, but it’s become such a widespread trend in reporting these days that I fear the reading public has lost its ability to distinguish between anecdote and data.  Furthermore, it allows a reporter to promote an opinion under the guise of “reporting”, because it’s easier to elide the omission of potentially confounding evidence.   Shame on you New York Times."

In any event, much that is saved won’t be saved for all that long since those receiving it are not earning all that much right now. If the paltry payment gets saved against the day the car breaks, and then the repair can be paid for with cash and without a title loan, I call it a win.

Why not interview an out of work food service worker, a family just served an eviction notice,  or a small business owner months behind on the rent?

Instead there's the truly bizarre suggestion that many Americans will invest this money or even put it towards buying a house!  In what fantasy world does $600 come anywhere near the amount a person would need to actually invest in the stockmarket or put a down payment on a house?  Even if you are homeless, $600 won't get you a hotel and food for a week in any major city.  To refer to this paltry sum as a windfall is laughable.  It's a band aid on the machete wound COVID-19 has inflicted on the Main Street economy.

Also, much of this article is just sloppy supposition and statements of opinion masquerading as facts.  What are the actual statistics supporting any of the broad generalizations about ""most Americans""?"

2020-12-31 03:40:21,"“Stimulus Money Should Have Gone to the Jobless, Economists Say”

This is a good idea. In some perverted measure it penalizes those who work hard to keep their jobs but that is cold comfort to those who are jobless.

This does illustrate one important point.

Consumers drive the economy. Their spending elevates and sustains companies. Not the other way around as most Republicans would have you believe."
2020-12-31 03:42:55,"As with the previous payment, there is an income threshold for determining who gets a payment. By definition, that means that any payment of any amount is going to those households that need it most. As a senior on a fixed income, I fell below the threshold. There has been no discernible change to that, the upcoming 1.2% SS increase not withstanding.  When it comes to allocation of my income, no matter the source, I determine where it goes. The idea that folks like me should accept a reduction to better fund other worthy programs is an insult. The McConnell Senate should get over its parsimonious attitude and pass a spending bill that will benefit those that need it the most. 

My $600 will go to a charity of my choice, matching the amount I donated from the last stimulus payment. 

I emphasize the “my choice “ element. If an increase comes, then I’ll choose where to give it, and how much."

Can't you see a pattern here?  In spite of all of our technological hubris we can't target stimulus money to the people and businesses that really need it.  We don't have the capability.  It would need doing in conjunction with state and local government to administer.  There aren't enough people working at the state and local labor departments to handle this.  The original PPP program, managed so skillfully by the Small Business Administration has been a disaster.  We're   incapable, so we wastefully shotgun money out to just about everyone.

I also think this is why the COVID vaccine rollout is also underperforming.  I argue that there are not enough qualified people to do the injections.  In order to do a million injections a day we would need 10,000 qualified people to do an injection every 6 minutes for 10 hours a day without a break.  That's not reasonable.  I'd say at ""warp speed"" we'd need at least about 25,000 people just to do the injections.  The healthcare system is overburdened already.  Where do we get these people and the tens of thousands more that are needed to support them?

We could have had them ready but someone was too busy getting out of the rough.  Congress wasn't far behind.

I think I'll buy a new propeller for the boat with my $600.  It won't cover the cost but it will help.  I hate the word ""yacht"".  Pretentious."

As a retiree, with a pension and a 401k I do not need this money and will donate it. But it should not come to me in the first place.

Because she worked for a couple of months for a small photography studio in 2018, she only qualifies for $50/week unemployment. $600 is totally inadequate, especially since her older son, a senior in high school, is 17, and she won’t get a penny for him.

I would rather the $600B go towards any number of other cash injections: people who’ve had hardships this year, multiple $600 cash payments for lower income classes, aid to states, workers in specific industries, housing payments for renters, mortgage payments for those being foreclosed, and so on. Unfortunately the biggest political waves were on across the board payments. But like I said... I’ll gladly accept it."
2020-12-31 04:08:19,"The economists are right on. Sending money to everyone is a waste of resources. The economists aren't making a wild guess on where the large majority of stimulus money will go: it mostly went into bank accounts the first time around, just like it will this time. 

On the other hand, we're not providing enough assistance to those who actually need it: the millions who continue to involuntarily employed because governments forced millions of business to shut down. Not Amazon, FB, or Zoom, but mom and pop restaurants.

Instead of token checks, we need a real plan to fully reopen the economy. Here's a simple proposal: announce publicly that life will be back to normal on  6/1/21. This will give everyone who wants a vaccine plenty time to get one and develop antibodies. For those that choose not to get vaccinated, so be it. 

As of December 11, the CDC estimates that 90 million Americans have already had COVID. That's almost 30% of the population. It's not the best way to get to herd immunity, but it's a strong start. Let the vaccine take us the rest of the way and get back to living."
2020-12-31 04:08:50,"For the millions of retirees like myself who don't work but have steady monthly income (federal or state pension, 401K, Social Security and/or investment income), it is lunacy to hand us $1200 or $600 or $2000.  

Given all the data collected by the federal gov't, could it not have done a better job in targeting the stimulus money to the working class people who need it most ?  

Evidentially not, as the US Treasury department again chose the national helicopter method to dispense the latest round of stimulus money.

P.S. I'm not giving back the $600."

Of course giving money to the “jobless” and to people with very little is the correct move, but the owners and rulers of this country loathe giveaways to the lower caste “untouchables”, in fact, remember in April, the federal government was about to begin putting mandatory work requirements on people receiving food benefits.

They are struggling, need food, have no healthcare, and will be happy to pay their rent if they had money. They could use help and probably won’t be “saving “ their money. 
If you think they willingly would stay home if they could work you are mistaken. We should help those who haven’t been able to work due to the shutdown. Always the wealthy line up to take advantage first. Why do we allow it?"
2020-12-31 04:45:49,"First, means-testing means more red tape, and emergency aid needs to be fast. Second, It’s a lot easier to pass legislation on public benefits if everyone gets it. This is something too many Americans just do not get. From public healthcare to college tuition, our puritanical instincts immediately kick in and people obsess over who to keep the benefits away from. What kind of polyanna thinks there will still be the votes for this if you are just straight-up taking money from the employed and putting it in the pocket of the unemployed? It’s like saying “you can pay for dinner but you can’t eat.” It might fit with America’s puritanical impulses about goodness and virtue, but it’s not human nature. It’s easier to sell these legislations if you say “everybody gets a slice of pizza because we all share.”"
2020-12-31 04:47:29,"If we're going to put a fine point on it, we should at least follow it through.  The distribution is indeed sloppy, in terms of handouts too far up the income scale.  I'd feel better about contributing if it were more focused on folks who are really under pressure.  Last time around, I had friends telling me about their 19-year-olds on the dole while living at home, and golfing daily.  I know of another 20-year-old who used her ""rescue"" check to get in a pre-order on a video game console.  Meanwhile, people are going hungry.  Not cool.  That all said, there's a range, and people shouldn't have to be on the verge of starvation in order to qualify -- including many who might not cash-and-spend the day the deposit hits.

And, I'd be remiss not to say that, if you've voted for any Republicans recently, you really ought to abide by your conservative principles, and prefer to starve rather than accepting any handouts from me and my godless ilk.  Because you've got that newly-rediscovered deficit to be newly re-concerned about, and principles are principles, after all, especially with America not being great again anymore."

They had to meet certain eligibility criteria, but the bar was set pretty low. If more than one person in a family was affected, each could make a claim. BUT you had to make a claim, meaning money wasn't sent out to people whose livelihood was not affected by COVID. I'll bet that Canadian method helped a LOT more people who really needed it, without costing much more than the US method that provides precious little for the people who actually need it."

2020-12-31 04:57:52,"“The business of Government is Business.” President Calvin Coolidge said that back in the Roaring Twenties. I had never before considered just what the Government’s purpose was. And now, again, that phrase echoes as I read this article. 

This pandemic has drained away what little “savings” most Americans had. Most of us are working paycheck-to-paycheck. God forbid should our furnace or our car break down. Heaven help us if we can’t cover an insurance bill. 

I just can’t believe the premise of this argument. Monies given to small businesses may help those businesses keep afloat until the crisis is over. But, the people who work in those businesses have already suffered loss of income from the weeks and months they’ve been sheltered at home. We aren’t going back to the way it had been in the past, certainly not before 2022. And that’s making the assumption that this world-wide crisis will be somehow over without some unforeseen complications: inability to get the vaccines out and into enough people to start “flattening the curve,” for real; coronaviruses whose mutations  defy the available therapies or vaccines we may already have on line; or the prices for food, gas, rent, medical bills...

We need money. A thousand a month until we finally climb out of this would help us get on an even keel for whenever the Sun is shining again, and we can see peoples’ faces and shake their hands. The arrogance of this article would be evident to most of the people I know."
2020-12-31 05:01:34,"If your savings has taken a beating, or if you had none to begin with and use this as a start to saving...terrific! Nobody is beholden to spend it immediately. Those who have not necessarily been effected will hopefully feel inspired to donate to worthy causes, or on neighbors whom are truly struggling. None of this strikes me as being NOT worthwhile. I'm not at all worried about the compassion of everyday people at this point. Trust and guidance can go a long way towards building a culture of ethical, influential leadership. So looking forward to 1/20/21."
2020-12-31 05:14:28,It does seem odd to pay out a stimulus. Why inject a stimulant to someone still recovering from an illness? Save the money for the government to use on something else when the epidemic is over.
2020-12-31 05:17:06,"There's no question people who don't need the money are saving their checks. There's also no question that people who have been adversely affected by the pandemic need more help and that they will spend the checks they receive, giving an immediate boost to the economy.

What there is a big question about is what the first group of people will do with their savings once the vaccines are widely distributed and things to go back towards a more normal life.

It's possible those people will spend like there's no tomorrow on the things they can't do now; taking vacations, eating in restaurants, drinking in bars and going to concerts, shows, and sporting events. They'll need to buy more clothes because mostly they've been wearing sweats. The list goes on and on.

Experts are no better at predicting the future than anyone else. Go back and try to find the experts who warned the CARES Act would help create a 'K' shaped recovery and worsen income inequality. 

America is a nation of consumers. It's over 70% of our economy. When the all clear sounds, consumerism will rise. The people who 'didn't need the money' will find plenty of uses for it."

2020-12-31 05:18:38,"I wonder just who those “most” Americans are who are going to sock their stimulus payments in the bank because they’ve already got all they need to pay their bills. Perhaps there should be a stricter income cutoff for eligibility. I can’t imagine why a family with a $300,000 income needs a $600 or even a $2000 payment, especially if all they are going to do is add it to their already ample savings accounts. Then again, the pandemic has revealed how over-leveraged even allegedly “prosperous” people are as we’ve seen their expensive cars in food lines across the country."
2020-12-31 05:18:40,"I do not believe this is about $2,000 at all.  Isn't it if Georgia sends two Democrats senates and cements the Democrats majority, the $2,000 will be on the table and will likely pass in Senates?

2020-12-31 05:19:11,"The $600 or $2000 payment would stimulate both the supply and demand for labor, since unlike unemployment insurance,

And I think Congress originally considered something like this last spring. However, US has  no centralized employment records and a lot of clunky, outdated state unemployment systems, and it's my understanding it was decided it would be time consuming, if not impossible, to get money to people that way. The only thing we have on national level is taxpayer IDs -- i.e., Social Security numbers."
2020-12-31 03:53:30,The stupidity of the US government in dealing with this economic crisis seems to know no bottom.  Checks for people who don’t need them obtained with money borrowed from my children’s generation.    I’m amazed we can’t pull together something like Europe had in place which cost shares with employers to keep employees on the job at 90% of their regular pay. Sometimes I think we have some sort of special self loathing for our own people in this country.  Maybe we will grow up one day.

2020-12-31 05:35:32,"“Most” Americans would be saving it? Calling this out of touch would be just one of the many understatements of this year.

What happened to the economists earlier this year that said paying people to stay home from work was a great idea? They are still right, whoever and wherever they are. If we give people money, “most” will spend— on rent, on food, on any mode of survival that affords us some dignity and grace in this scary time. This also means that we could feasibly save small businesses in danger of folding because of rent. 

It is also painful to watch other less wealthy countries pay out generous monthly sums to their people. If they can do it, we can do it.

Also, the government can’t keep straight who needs what, and where. I am unemployed, but was denied unemployment. How would they track someone like me, if they were, hypothetically, to switch to paying out only the unemployed? I hope my tax returns would flag me. Then again, those didn’t help with bagging me that first $1,200– it never came. 

The people of this country are in an abusive relationship with its government, and have come to believe that expecting or hoping for something better is foolish, selfish, and silly. Americans, we deserve more, and our anger and sadness are justified."

They should have at least given people the option to refuse and have the amount go towards increasing the share of the financially distressed. It is so weird that neither party insisted on this.  The Democrats want to help the needy and Republicans supposedly want to reign in spending. Nobody making 75k this year would have been outraged if their check went to a family about to get thrown out on the street. So stupid.

And to make my point in the most galling way possible,  I just spent my half my check on a shiny new pair of AirPods Pro and a $130 goose down pillow.

You can’t interview a handful of people for this article and use them as proof that $160 million can’t use the extra funds.

We’re a fractured and petty lot and politically if you wanted to give money only to a group that needs it the most the rest of the populace would whine like babies that they didn’t also get theirs. See the outcry over the student loan forgiveness for another perfect example.
2020-12-31 05:25:46,"Typical of a Plutocracy that is suffering 22% of world covid deaths for 4% of population to tag disaster relief as ""stimulus"". Really? Not necessary relief for starving children but rather as something to stimulate the economy. Leave it to America to prioritize towards humanity..."
2020-12-31 05:37:59,"One growing group of Americans who are suffering are those who experience food insecurity - just look at the lines at food pantries.  So, here a suggestion to add additional relief to the measly $ 600 that Uncle Scrooge McConnell has seemed enough: issue a one-time $ 600 in food stamps (EBT) to everyone, man, woman and child, with a social security number; not instead of existing food assistance, no means testing, no age restriction (we all have to eat to survive, and many families with kids are struggling, so they get more).  That'll help alleviate food insecurity, and also removes the stigma from using food stamps.  And, importantly, McConnell would have to explain why he is against helping people to put food on their tables."
2020-12-31 05:53:54,"It's interesting that the comparison is to the $1,200 people received in the spring -- just months into the pandemic and months before it continued to get worse (which, BTW, it's still doing, vaccine or no). How many of the peole who received that money and saved it (or otherwise didn't infuse it back into the economy) have since spent it because they've either lost sources of income or have had unexpected expenses that are par for the course when you're a human being in this world? How many jobs have been lost since March? How many more people on public assistance or waiting on food lines? I am very much deferential to experts and trust that economists looking at numbers on a piece of paper (albeit numbers that are limited in their ability to express reality) are correct in saying there are better ways to disburse money if time and competency were not limited resources. But, considering they both clearly are, I see no reason to quibble over getting as many people as possible desperately needed funds even if it means some more fortunate people will have additional savings."

2020-12-31 05:59:25,"the difference is that the $600/2000 payment stimulates the demand for labor without  paying people not to work, so it is more stimulative for employment than unemployment insurance. and fairer to workers too."

No one has taken a pay cut but me, so paying my employees making the same they made last year an extra $600, $1200 or $2000 makes no sense.  Money should go to the struggling business owners taking a loss to keep people employed, or the to the actual unemployed.  A random payment to people who don’t need it is a waste.  Plenty of people need it and more and badly!"

2020-12-31 06:16:48,The checks should have been means tested.  But this is baloney considering that billions of dollars that were distributed to the wealthy during the boom in the gloom.  The gov't should have instituted a windfall profits tax that went directly to rapidly provide relief to the stricken sectors of the economy.  The unemployed and the poor primarily.  All this economist talk leaves out the the important factor of runaway economic inequality fed by the remorseless mal distribution of wealth worsened by the pandemic.
2020-12-31 06:19:55,"At least 2 things affect what people do with the money: 1) how hand to mouth they are, and 2) whether they can expect the payments to keep coming for as long as they need them. It's been well known for a long time that those on the lower rungs of the income ladder have a higher marginal propensity to consume - more likely to spend their last dollar as opposed to saving it. However, if they know or worry the payments will not keep coming for as long as necessary, some will spend less to try to stretch what they have received. Both stimulus packages have made the mistake of not focusing on those who need the cash, the unemployed, and making sure they have enough each week for as long as the pandemic is a problem so they can spend as necessary without fear.

The reason the GOP is meaner this time around, however, is likely purely political - the first time, they wanted to give their president and party an economic boost before the election; now, they want to undermine a democratic president."
2020-12-31 06:21:52,"This stand alone bill should have been renamed to something more appropriate to our current situation.  Perhaps the Survival Bill rather than Stimulus.  Where is it written that any help given to suffering Americans must ""stimulate"" the economy?  Even if some are not behind on rent or utiliity bills, food prices, health insurance costs and more continue to rise while wages continue to stagnate for those that can still work.  And if someone can save rather than immediately spend it, a small cushion could provide some peace of mind in this nerve-fraying, uncertain time.  Please get over all the fretting about how people will spend it.  They certainly didn't fret over how the much larger corporate tax cuts or forgivable  PPP money was spent by some and whether they really needed it.  It practically rushed out the door."

2020-12-31 06:23:32,"I am a liberal democrat, but I strongly disagree with $2K across the board checks for people (and their kids) who made less than $75K in 2019.  That was then.  My family is one example.  My son was a resident physician in 2019, and my daughter-in-law, an emergency veterinarian was on maternity leave part of the year.  This year, she's working her regular amount of time, and he is now an attending physician in a private practice making LOTS of money.  They don't need or deserve a stimulus check, and there are plenty of others like them.  Increase the unemployment compensation and rent relief and get it where it needs to go!"
2020-12-31 06:27:25,"“I’ve got more clients than I can handle right now and I’ve made more money than I usually do,” said Mr. Gilbert, a 71-year-old lawyer who lives in a Boston suburb. “So I’m not really suffering financially.” 
If this is true, then he would not be eligible for the $76K threshold. In which case, his opinion is irrelevant. He is unaware of those who have had their incomes highly disrupted by C-19."
2020-12-31 06:37:51,"As I said in my earlier comment, I agree that the focus should be on the unemployed and those having a hard time financially even if still nominally employed. However, focusing on the unemployed would have missed those who have given up, who have dropped out of the labor force and are no longer on the unemployment rolls or numbers. Perhaps part of the problem is our unemployment system and how we keep track of people.

On the political side, once the pandemic is on the wane and jobs are coming back, initially unemployment will rise as some who left the labor force start looking again and show up in the unemployment numbers. The GOP will blame the jump in unemployment on Biden knowing that most of their flock don't understand why this happens, even if the politicians do."
2020-12-31 06:38:28,I think the article is absolutely correct.  My economic situation is unchanged - I don't need more money to continue doing fine.  But people who are or have been out of work are most likely staring down looming shortfalls in meeting their needs or have substantial backlogs they owe from having income interrupted.  Give them more money and leave the rest of us out.  And the various levels of government should be able to use the history of unemployment claims to direct the money.
2020-12-31 06:41:59,"Nothing here matters, truly.  The vast majority of Americans who are taking care of themselves, their own, and lending a hand to a neighbor in need, don't register this article or these comments.  That gives me great hope for this experiment in self-government."
2020-12-31 06:43:33,"Yes, unemployment is the more effective stimulus.  But there are other important factors, like shoring up the precarious finances of millions (e.g., 37 million food-insecure families).  

It's also an insurance policy to make sure consumption can increase when its safe to re-open the leisure sector again.

Bear in mind also that inflation is the true constraint on U.S. government spending, and that is not a present concern.

According to the Fed Survey of Consumer Finances for 2019, here is the median net worth for families by education level, and the % change that $6,000 represents for a typical family of three:

No high school:  $20,500; 29% increase
High school:       $74,000;   8% increase
Some college:    $88,000;  7% increase
College:            $308,000;  2% increase

About a third of Americans have bachelor's degrees or higher, so two thirds of America would get a net worth increase between 7% and 29%. 

That's a worthy goal.  If we can't tax the rich to fund it because of Republican obstruction, we just print the money."
2020-12-31 06:45:13,"These checks are not going to anyone making over $75,000 a year.  While I agree the money is better off going to those out of work, I also don't think the number of people who are not going to spend it is not fairly small."
2020-12-31 07:00:01,"God forbid some logic and a needs test be applied. There are people in desperate need and those who do not. Pretty obvious. Yet we are fighting over too little vs too much and playing politics while people stand in what amounts to soup kitchens.

Of course many of the same people who are hoping for a free bag of groceries, resent their neighbour receiving a free bag of groceries.

The public loathes its politicians and justifiably so, while they themselves act loathsomely.

2020-12-31 07:16:29,"People who lost jobs due to Covid-19 deserve an increase in the safety net. Enhanced unemployment benefits therefore make the most sense, with small business support close behind ( since small business can provide jobs and also were vulnerable often times due to Covid-19). The unemployed will also get the stimulus checks too so that is a good thing. The most in need is pretty clear; the unemployed.  But is the goal need or stimulus? Does paying a utility bill stimulate the economy more than buying a Nintendo Switch?  Probably not.  We live in odd times with questionable motivations at times.  However, our approach this round is far better than the TARP bailout approach."
2020-12-31 07:20:13,"The Senate today  passed a GOP version of the Covid Stimulus -- $2000 per person for persons earning more than $125000  (zero for people earning less than $125000).

This is in accord with the GOP philosophy and empiricle proof time and time again that trickle down has been proven to be the best way to help low-income people.  (Most recently the Trump Tax Reform Act).

Wait, Wait 
They didn't do that.
They didn't even try to do that.

Maybe there is not evidence that it is the best way."

I think Biden can manage this better than has had Trump. However, McConnell will cooperate somewhat with Biden but he is a reactionary and will still obstruct many initiatives backed by the new administration. Trump has considerable support and influence but his physical condition is likely very precarious. He is morbidly obese which in a man his age can lead to precipitous decline.

2020-12-31 08:27:32,"I am not an economist but it did not take one to know, Not EVE5YONE is hurting financially from the virus. A large number of Americans are getting their same salary and benefits they were getting before the virus. Many are working from home (saves gas and wear and tear on you car), wear their gym cloths and work all day. Many are hiring contractors to work on home improvement project. Just try to,get a constructive contractor and get on the waiting list. Save the $600, no they are using that to improve their surroundings. They may not like parts of this but to the unemployed they are privileged.
It is the unemployed that need help now! yes, they have bills, a lot of bills, and yes they MUST put the money BACK in the economy. We are smarter than this! Put the money where it will do the most for all concerned. But make the check big enough to make a difference to the economy. 
Stop giving any of this to the rich, the government has given them the tax cuts that will hurt every income level. Could we just start using the intelligent  people NOW to help with the things they are experts in?"

I also know people who don't quality for unemployment who needed the money last time--they quit dead end jobs to focus on school, only to graduate and find no jobs due to COVID. Isn't better to just get the money out there, instead of spending a lot on red tape to make sure it goes to the right people? That's why some proponents of a minimum basic income propose that everyone get the same amount regardless of need."
2020-12-31 08:56:45,"How can it be that in a crisis, we can't seem to minimize political considerations and govern informed by the advice of experts? Our leaders, including Pelosi, Bernie, and House Dems should be listening to economists (and medical professionals, climate scientists, etc.) and not whatever else is driving this $2000 mess of a relief bill. WaPo's editorial board came out against it yesterday, pointing out how poorly targeted it is. 

Help the jobless, not families making up to $350 million incomes. That's right. In case you didn't know that, the House has everyone up to families making that much included. 

And if politics need enter the mix at all, let it be to show the public that Dems are fiscally responsible, champions of smart government, not the stereotype that Republicans have been pushing for half a century -- wasteful spenders who throw money at problems as a means for pandering for votes. 

Compassionate but SMART government should be the Democratic mantra.  

Come on, man!"

And I would like to see that discussion include illegal immigrants, who like it or not are a significant part of our economy and very many of whom would have little or no choice but to spend the money immediately."

At that time, couldn’t the government tax back the money from the people who turned out jot to have needed it?  Maybe adding this to the tax code would take an extra year, so they can tax it back in 2021 from people who didn’t need it in 2020.  Then there isn’t any need to argue over who needs or deserves it now, and the government can just send the checks out to help people ASAP."
2020-12-31 09:31:46,"Flawed thinking here. Medical, food, taxes, and utilities are all going up which for many means the $600 will be spent now or very soon because budgets are in flux.

This elderly man is yet another example that we  need to employ term limits for our highest offices.

My son and I had just begun operations to start our home improvement business and even though we've gotten a somewhat steady clientele since then it's still not enough to cover our expenses. I can't really work as much as I would like since I had a heart attack the very time the pandemic was declared and I CERTAINLY not getting any younger. The real ""saving grace"" for us is the fact that we do have real skills in what we do, but every penny we get from any stimulus whether it's $600 or $2000 is going directly back into either tools or supplies.

The minute this administration knew what Bob Woodward quoted them as a ""plague"" the response was not there.  A five point plan to operate an immediate lock-down was our only hope.  Mike Pence was put in charge of the response.  He waved around a 15 day period to monitor the virus instead of really acting.  Really implementing a really serious action to combat the virus and that would be people staying home with money sent directly into their accounts that day.  We could have, we should have.

Bernie Sander's words to get it out to the American people making them ""saver and securer"" rings true.  I can hear him saying those 2 words.
If people are going to save it, so bit it, we are not out of the woods, not even close.  Pack it away with light bulbs and toilet paper as the virus morphs into something new our highways and airports continue to transport it into another phase, another wave.  As Peter Fonda said, we blew it."
2020-12-31 10:33:58,"Giving money to everybody leaves income and wealth distribution at best the way they were, and in truth is making the distribution more unequal.  Giving money to the unemployed distributes income downward and might give those on the bottom the idea that this wealthy country could do better by them.  Republicans are not going to go for that -- it is socialism.

Most of the people who are unemployed are that way through no fault of their own, because of a shortage of jobs.  If we gather together during the pandemic, we will run out of hospitals sooner and the death rate will soar.  So the people employed by places where we gather are jobless because their jobs depend on our gathering.  If we dont help them, they will become desperate, and those who can find work will put up with longer hours or less work safety.  The others will live out of their cars, or on the street, or in tents somewhere.  

Seeing people who are unemployed through little or no fault of their own as owed or worthy of a hand, but not pity, is communitarian and therefore socialistic.  If we thought that way, we would look for ways to put the economy temporarily into a hibernation state rather than throwing measly sums at everybody or less measly sums at the unemployed.  But we are focused on our individual selves and above all on our tax rates."
2020-12-31 10:37:10,"It's so easy for a well paid columnist to decry stimulus payments for all. Many working people are doing so at a lower income level without a lowering of basic bills like heat, electricity, water, and rent or mortgage. Also they still need to feed themselves. Others working at big box retailers and grocery stores were already working at subsistence wages so any increase in expenses due to the children being on remote learning puts them into negative territory."

2020-12-31 10:40:23,"These checks are in any case not a stimulus to the economy but rather help so that people who have lost income can survive until the public health crisis is over, and do not lose their property and savings.   Calling them a stimulus, as everybody does, classifies what we are going through as a normal economic downturn to be thought of and treated as normal.  This is admitting that Trump is right and the pandemic is not all that serious, not enough to change how we think about the economy -- basically as a series of markets plus a government that interferes with them. 

If the pandemic is indeed serious, it means that we  have to think of ourselves in terms of ongoing households and communities that are in danger of dying and must be saved.  We must look at ourselves with the categories of anthropology rather than economics.  We have a surplus of people now, and we know how the market deals with surpluses.  We, or at least many of us, want to do better than that."

2020-12-31 11:01:23,"I’m retired and pretty well off. $600 is not really needed. I’d be tempted to buy food with it and donate to a food bank. I don’t donate cash.

$2000? With or without it won’t make a huge difference either. Some home repair maybe. I don’t have a mortgage.

What we should reconsider—and no one is talking about it anymore—is Andrew Yang’s Universal Basic Income proposal of $1000 per month. This would not discourage people from working. No one in America can live solely on that. And many FT jobs do not pay a living wage.

I’d like to work PT but health issues have precluded that. If you’re on Social Security, you can’t apply for disability."
2020-12-31 11:02:33,"A lot of people in the income range who will be receiving that check are living paycheck to paycheck, or close to it.  It’s not going to the rich so the thought that most people will be saving it seems off.  I am saving it personally until May when I bring my son to the orthodontist to get his braces fit and I receive a $6,600 bill.  I bet others that could save it will save it only temporarily and do things they’re not doing now with it, like travel.  Also, how do you discern who is jobless?  Long term unemployed fall off the unemployment counts and many people took pay cuts or less hours and aren’t technically jobless.  Adding the administrative burden of picking winners and losers like this would put a huge delay in getting those checks out too."
2020-12-31 11:04:08,"Many, many people need financial help during this pandemic. The problem - as this article states correctly - is getting it to the right people. Since our country is so backwards in terms of its social safety net we are using a blunt tool to just throw money at the majority of Americans by income level. For instance, how in the world is the government going to track who lost health insurance, or who needs help with childcare expenses, or is underemployed? But giving $4,000 to a couple who made $150K in 2019 and are still employed is not targeting money to those who need it. Individuals making up to 99K and couples making up to 198K would also receive checks under this current bill. And the proposal was to increase this to $2,000 per person. Huh?

Targeting *MORE* money to the actual unemployed (600 per week) plus all individuals making say up to 50K (1,200) makes much more sense to me. This would get real relief to nearly everyone who needs it."
2020-12-31 11:10:18,"On paper it looks like my wife and I (both retired and collecting a pension)  don't need the extra stimulus money, but, if you look closer at our situation, it's a different story. Several members of our family are now living in our home because their child's school in has gone to remote learning primarily and both parents have day jobs. That caused their family to move in with us temporarily to help with school lessons. Having extra people in the house costs more money. We are also lending financial support to another family member who works a full-time job but is always on the edge financially. 

These extra expenses are hidden, so it would appear that the stimulus money would be best used for people who are unemployed or scraping by paycheck to paycheck. We aren't complaining and are grateful we can be of help to our extended family, but I'm pretty sure our situation isn't unusual due to the pandemic."

2020-12-31 11:15:19,"I totally agree with the authors of this article.
2019 was a good year financially for me and my wife.   Unfortunately, she lost her job in April and our income has been cut by 60%.  Since getting the current stimulus is based on 2019 income, we aren't eligible for anything.  
When I checked to see what I could do about getting a stimulus check, I was told to not worry that I could take the amount of the stimulus check I was to receive as a deduction on my 2020 taxes.
What a joke!  We don't have enough deductions to itemize our 2020 income tax, even if we factor in the stimulus checks.  So this option is useless to us.
The government has failed us on all fronts... from testing, to financial support and now the vaccination process is a total mess.  
It'll be years before we can dig ourselves out of this hole."

But with jobless numbers soaring, you can't expect people to go back to jobs that aren't there.  The reason Trump likes the direct payment is because he is having the Treasury to, inappropriately, print his name in the memo section of the check so it appears to be coming from him.  In fact, it comes from the American taxpayer as appropriated by Congress.  The direct payments are all about (as is everything else) feeding Trump's black hole of ego."

The pandemic has wrought havoc on staffing, and workers  all around me are being quarantined with little or no cushion.

I was let go from my job on October 30th. There are folks in my VA Unemployed Facebook group who applied back in May. They system is that backlogged. 

My point is, a stimulus check is the only way that people like us will get any sort of relief.  The Virginia Unemployment system is, I believe, the Nation's worst but I have read of people in other states with similar problems.  The extra $600, or $300, means nothing to us."

2020-12-31 12:05:08,"This is truly something I haven't understood about the stimulus checks.  My wife and I both still have jobs and aren't hurting at all, yet we just received our stimulus checks.  The country would have been better served to increase jobless benefits and provide funding to state and local governments who are experiencing hardships due to reduced tax revenue.  The stimulus checks at the $600 or $2,000 level are not the right approach unless you can specifically target them to those who are truly in need."
2020-12-31 12:05:08,"Agree! Free money needs to be more targeted. You don't want people to take the money to gamble stocks on RobinHood, buy HDTV or stow it in the saving account (rainy day fund is fine).

Stimulus has two goals: help people in need and increase economic activities (monetary velocity).

There is a lot of talks about fairness already; but really, it is not about micro fairness but how to rescue people and the economy longer term.

There are many ways to help without printing checks: 1) food and rent vouchers; 2) income replacement to keep people employed and 3) genuine small biz loans and grants, to name a few.

I did not feel safe and my anxiety became overwhelming. However, I don’t qualify for unemployment benefits and am not included in any unemployment statistics because it was my choice to quit, as my employers wanted to keep their business open (understandable) and there was no government mandated shutdown. I believe there must be many more like me who are draining their savings waiting this out.

By defining “essential workers” so broadly, many of the lowest paid and least protected workers have been forced to keep working in dangerous and hostile environments and have not benefited from the increased unemployment benefits under the previous COVID stimulus package. It’s completely out of touch to use the criteria for receiving traditional unemployment benefits (you must lose employment at no fault of your own) as a proxy for who needs additional economic support right now."
2020-12-31 12:12:15,I would have loved to get a few extra dollars but in reality I don't need it. Many of my friends are planning on saving it or buying a big ticket item they have been yearning for. I received no check last time because of my income was over the cutoff point. The idea that regardless to your need you will still get a check based on income worked the first time because there was little time to sort things out. This time months later I think the money should have given out based on need. If you are working and haven't missed a check during the pandemic you could have missed the 600 dollar gift without missing a meal. The people who have lost their jobs and standing on bread lines need it more. There is no such thing as free money. The amount of suffering we are seeing is unprecedented and one can only see things getting worse. What happens when the bans on evictions run out?

Are all the people you highlighted in the article not Married Filing Jointly, with combined household incomes less than the limits set forth in the new law, for couples in that status?

When the first stimulus check came out in the spring, it was before 2019 income tax forms had been filed. I suppose many people were in the same situation – the qualification was based on 2018 income levels (which were a misty memory in 2020). Although at the time I had already been unemployed for more than six months, my 2018 income was over 100 K. And I did not qualify.

This round, I am now re-employed as of September 2020 but my salary is 45K. However, having filed married jointly for 2019, and my husband’s salary being higher than the limits￼ for this round of stimulus payments, again I will not qualify for the stimulus payment.

I think it’s very important to note the income limits in the program. It is way less than a “universal” stimulus. Apparently some Republican senators are complaining that in the program is not targeted enough. I would certainly argue that actually it is quite targeted.￼"

The fact that savings skyrocketed can be attributed to some people receiving more money from unemployment than they were receiving from their lost jobs and the fear that the unemployment money would run out. In fact, these people were told to save as much as they could.

The stimulus money is needed by the working poor people in America. Yet, Greg Daco concludes that everyone in ""the same financial situation as they were at the end of 2019"" will save any additional income. Because as the writers point out, ""when otherwise financially secure people receive an unexpected windfall, they almost invariably save it."" Well, I have news for Mr. Daco and the writers, just because some people are in the same financial situation does not mean that they are financially secure. My household has been living with financial insecurity since the 2009 recession with a mountain of bills and food insecurity sprinkled on top.

So, let me tell those privileged and financially secure people -- good for you; now open your eyes to the reality that many Americans are suffering or subsistence living without vacations or gifts to share.

Finally, I am disgusted that the writers would use Serena Cooper's generosity to support an argument against stimulus money for employed Americans."
2020-12-31 12:49:37,"Let us focus relief payments on those most in need. It is estimated that about 2.3 million more people were below the poverty line in November than February. These are our fellow Americans. If we were in their shoes, we would hope American would help us. 

Returning the 50% poorest households to their February level of income would take about $15-20 billion a month. We should fund this today and continue it until the pandemic has passed. That is a policy of compassion and benevolence. A one time payment of even $2000 does not alleviate the anxiety of those with ongoing needs. It is a distraction."
2020-12-31 12:50:07,The NY Times ought to give online subscriptions to anyone making under $30k per year during the pandemic. It would cost them nothing as online subscriptions cost nothing ( no printing or distribution) and it would help those most in need. They don't because verifying the potential cheaters is time consuming and costly. That's why the government can't verify either.
2020-12-31 12:56:09,"I am retired but worked part-time to make ends meet before COVID, therefore unable to qualify for unemployment insurance. Now I’m unable to work because of COVID and a check from the government would really help pay the bills.

Given the miles-long lines at food banks, I’m sure I’m not the only one in this situation, it’s time to admit that our government is failing many of its citizens, and not coming close to providing the aid that other wealthy countries are providing."

Now, better to just wait for Biden and construct a more targeted relief bill."

For me it will be food banks in areas serving immigrant populations because it is likely that these families are not even accessing resources being made available to other needy Americans because of the panic the Trump Administration has put in them that they will be deported if they demonstrate need.

The checks are a band-aid solution. The vaccines were a scientific achievement by the private sector driven by the profit motive. If the govt was a company and performing at this level, the competitors would have put them out of business.

If the money was being sent to those who are actually unemployed, the package would be less and the benefits could be extended to the unemployed longer."
2020-12-31 13:18:21,"Could this aid be better targeted to reach those who have suffered actual financial loss due to COVID? Of course it could, but to do that we would have had to learn something from the last time we had a financial crisis. We should have set up a nationwide social safety net and system of unemployment insurance benefits that utilizes current data quarterly reported to the IRS by employers instead of having a hodgepodge system run by 50 states, DC, and the territories like we are individual nations rather than one. 

We aren’t Canada or even the EU, the newest Union on the block. We haven’t set up a functional system to serve our people like they did. We have had 250 years to decide that we are truly one nation with 56 parts and not 56 parts that occasionally act like one nation. 

The federal government abdicated its responsibility to act during this crisis, but there are states and a political party that have steadfastly supported policy positions that weaken the federal government in favor of state independence. Now they complain when the feds shrug and say states are responsible for helping themselves, or distribute aid in a way that is not optimal. Optimal requires advance planning.

There are some programs that should be consistent no matter where one lives. We understand that for Social Security and Medicare, but not unemployment insurance and healthcare in general. Maybe this time we will learn."

2020-12-31 13:23:57,"I do not need the $600 any more than I needed the $1,200 from last spring. I will therefore give it all to charities which help the neediest in my community. I urge others not to save the stimulus money but to use it to help those less fortunate!"
2020-12-31 13:24:22,"In both stimulus programs it has been confusing to me that 2019 income data was used as the basis rather than unemployment data.  In 2019 I was fully employed and therefore don’t qualify for this money but, in 2020 I am unemployed.  But I still won’t get a stimulus check because of what I used to earn.  I am sure I am not the only one to whom this applies. Doesn’t seem like the program is fulfilling its core purpose.  Another frustration to add to the dung heap that is the mismanagement of all things related to Covid, including now the lack of clear, coordinated, and rational distribution of vaccines."
2020-12-31 13:25:35,"This could have been easy. A monthly check, perhaps the $2,000 Sanders suggested, to every man, woman, and child in the US until this is over, designed as an interest-free loan until tax day, when the individual or family AGI determines whether the loan is to be returned in full or in part, or forgiven. Rinse and repeat as the pandemic economic crisis demands. In addition, employers, especially small employers, should have been given payroll protection monthly, again as an interest-free loan to be forgiven or returned, in full or in part, according to their business tax return status. The feds own the printing press, so this is do-able, and with inflation nearly non-existent, the risk of it rising is inconsequential.

Instead, Mitch, and others, found a way to enrich large corporations, share holders, and others ""haves"" at the expense of the ""have-nots."""

If you'd rather that people who really need it should get it, then give it to them.  There are plenty of organizations helping to pay rent, food banks, conservation groups running year-end drives.  This isn't rocket science.  If $600 isn't going to change your lifestyle give it to someone to help keep a roof over their head."
2020-12-31 13:29:22,"What a wildly out of touch take.  As a 27 year old, I can say that at least for me and my peers, that $600 is getting spent. $600 wont cover even one month of rent, let alone all the other bills. Some will put some of it towards credit card debt, or towards other loans, but either way its going to be gone almost the second it hits our bank accounts. Instead of saying “most Americans” will be saving their $600, a more accurate statement would be “most Americans who already have the luxury of having savings” will be saving their $600."

Our checks will go to hire a local contractor."
2020-12-31 13:33:50,"It’s impossible for the government to know who needs the money most. If you get a check you don’t really need, help your family or friends or neighbors. The food banks are in great need right now and would appreciate your donation.

It is patriotic to get the money circulating to help the economy. Spend it at a local business or support your local arts organizations. The economic hit from the pandemic has been very uneven."
2020-12-31 13:34:33,"My husband and I are fortunate to have remained employed throughout the pandemic. Part of the earlier $1,200.00 I received was parceled out to charities and friends who needed help with their rent. I kept $500.00 because my husband and I were suddenly given the opportunity to buy the house we have been renting for seven years and put the money toward the down payment. If they send me $600.00, it will be parceled out to local charities that provide rent assistance. The money will be spent, but not necessarily by me."

Those who are doing fine but are somehow worried about getting this money, please give it away. Find a charity. Give $50 tips on your takeout orders until it's gone. If you're that worried about the federal debt (you shouldn't be), gift it back to the government."

Like most readers, I don't know what most economists think about who should get the money. And even what ""most"" economists think would not be enough.  We really need to know in more detail the distribution of what economists think, perhaps sorted by area and level of expertise and level of education.

This is pandemic reimbursement money. People lost jobs, hours, tips, gigs, and more. The money is to prevent loss of life and skyrocketing homelessness. The money encourages better behavior by not requiring people to make risky decisions about going into public (remember when we shut down over 2000 deaths a day and now that we're very close to 4000 we act like nothing is going on?).

It's not a stimulus. Stop calling it that. Stop scrutinizing it as if that's what this is. It's government helping people get their basic human needs met."

What we should have done is what every other developed country has done: pay people every month. That would allow more people to stay home, keep businesses afloat and slow the spread.

Not to mention the PPP should have been reserved for actual struggling small businesses, not Trump and Ted Cruz's rich friends.  

We're the richest country in the world, right? And somehow we can spend more on defense than the next 10 countries combined without complaint.  But when it comes to helping  people, we fail spectacularly.

That's what I did and I plan to do again. There are real people with real needs - let's try to help them rather than put the money in the bank."
2020-12-31 13:59:19,Give stimulus money to anyone below the median income and it will likely get spent quickly. Remember a portion of that will go directly to people who don't need it and almost all of it will wind-up back in the bank accounts of the ultra-wealthy that got a huge tax cut they didn't need.

If money is only given to the technically unemployed, how does one get needed relief to those who are outside the ranks of the unemployed, for example to those eking by on Social Security with no other retirement savings, who are dependent on assistance, here and there, from community and family members who are now hard-pressed?  The simple fact is that there are a great many Americans in need, due to the pandemic and before the pandemic, who are outside the official economy of recent, regular paychecks. God forbid we expend any money ""inefficiently"" one them.

I've never written to a politician, but felt the need to send an email to my Senator Chuck Schumer explaining my thoughts about the impending $1,200 payments several months ago. I explained that people like my wife and I do not need the $1,200, and would prefer to see it go to others who are out of work or in danger of losing their homes.

In March, Indiana had 40 people working in the unemployment office. They have hired some people since then, but they don't know unemployment. Unfortunately, our government has been hollowed out and incompetent people put in charge to handle the biggest crisis our country has faced in a very long while."
2020-12-31 14:15:02,"One concern expressed by both democrats and republicans was that the unemployment ""bonus"" was making it harder for employers to rehire workers, who were making due with unemployment + bonus payments.

Of course, that was during the Trump recovery.  I don't expect anything like that from Biden, if is his last recovery is any indication.  When I read about those who are leaving the work force, I think about how long they stayed away last time.  It was Trump who got them back to work.  Very different scenario going forward now."

The second time to Maine to place we could afford with savings for a few months. We also have a young child in remote learning. 
Because we had a good year last year we received nothing for the first stimulus and will receive nothing from this one. We can’t be the only ones in this situation... how could we be overlooked so easily. We are spending years of hard earned savings because our industry was shut down and will be for months to come. 
I don’t expect the government to ever make us whole but I do except they understand our situation. There has been so much talk about this $600... It would cover a trip to the grocery store for the family including some nice ice cream."

We also need to stop dumping money into the economy in the form of artificially  low federal fund rates, so that people who save for retirement can survive without risking risker investments.

We are just culturally obsessed with trying to coming up with some means-testing scheme to ensure such legislation is always presented as a form of social warfare. Well, social welfare breeds resentment and that’s why they die in legislatures. 

Look, if somebody is so comfortable they will save away their $600 and never need it, then chances are it’s more of their taxes that’s fueling this thing anyway. Unemployed people sure don’t have money to pay for big congressional spending bills. If the better-off getting a little of their money back is the price of getting these bills passed, then that’s a small price when the opposite will be a dead end."

There are many more who have been scrambling to patch together any form of paid gig to avoid going on unemployment who can also use the money. The logic behind giving more to those who are already receiving some form of income replacement is flawed. If you are worried that recipients don't ""need"" it, lower the income threshold, perhaps adjusted for local cost of living differences."

It's not only lockdowns that have reduced spending on non-essentials. It's the uncomfortable realisation that essentials may be in short supply in the not too distant future, so if you can, you will save to have more cash when prices rise.

And determining who should “best” get the money is not how things work in America. Rich folks got a massive tax cut from trump and the Republics and they certainly didn’t need the money, nor did it stimulate the economy to any significant degree.

Gotta love the people hand-wringing over “undeserving” middle class people, who actually PAY TAXES (unlike trump and Amazon).

“Keep paying your taxes, middle class people, but if there’s a government program, you won’t get anything from it!” Suckers. Means testing is the American way, lately. That’s how people who hate government undermine support for government.

The Democrats should've concentrated on a stimulus bill comprised entirely of larger federal subsidy checks to the unemployed; for example $600 per week instead of $300.

Instead, they thoughtlessly grandstand to waste another $400 billion in the form of an additional $1400 for most people who don't need it... all for political expediency. That's $400 billion that could go into an infrastructure bill that creates jobs and builds roads and bridges that will pay dividends for decades.

I know the Democrats mean well, and I'll side with them over the cold-hearted, calculating, rapacious, two-faced, hypocritical Republicans any day of the week.

I think that small change in our language will help everyone understand that the intent is to provide support (or relief) to those that are struggling through no fault of their own, but rather the mismanagement of the response to the pandemic. It further helps to clarify that so long as we continue to so poorly manage the virus- and yes even the rollout of the vaccines, people need “relief” first. Stimulus can come later- in the Biden administration once we have finally, truly, come to grips with containment of the virus."

As one who has yet to recover from The Great Recession of 08-09, the $600 from Scrooge McConnell will be used to wipe out a lingering credit card bill. No economic stimulus there, unless you're Capital One. On the other hand, if the $2000 payment had gone through, I would have used the money to make some critical replacements and repairs to the household plumbing, which would have tossed a few dollars to a local business and its workers.

Can't believe the amount of shaming displayed toward people who actually put their stimulus check in the bank and were probably drawing it down on an as-needed basis. Gee!

They may be financially ‘ok’ but they’re only working because they have to, and that contributes to the ongoing pandemic, not to mention risking their own death or permanent disability.

Also, even in the recent ‘good times,’ half of American families reportedly couldn’t manage a $400 unexpected expense. Somehow that supposed gap between 20,000,000 unemployed and the rest of the bottom half of the population seems a little too finely drawn. I think the savings of those getting money they supposedly don’t need will mostly be put to good use as the pandemic recedes. 

And since the interest rate on government debt is near zero, we could easily ere on the side of helping more people. It’s certainly far more justified than the trillion dollar giveaway to the rich from the 2017 tax cut (which, by the way, is a good clue where to recoup money for those who are deficit obsessed)."

2020-12-31 13:57:16,"My wife and I were happy to get the two ""checks"" this year.  Yet, in keeping with the authors premise, funneling the funds to folks like us made zero sense.

With the legislation that delayed mandatory retirement account RMDs until age 72, we're in the stimulus money eligible window as we're past the time when we had earned income and we're not yet to have to draw RMDs.

I'd like to put off RMDs for a long, long time, if I only could.  Don't need these $$s and they will only push us into higher tax brackets.  Thus, on paper we have a taxable income level that qualifies for stimulus, but that belies our actual resources.

So, bottom line, of course it didn't make any sense that we qualified for stimulus payments.  What we spend is what we would have spent, whether these ""checks"" showed up or not.  Like many aspects of the rushed stimulus (including the loans to fracking billionaires and sports team owners) many of the decisions here were poor...and all indications are that this program has been very poorly managed.

I'd much rather have seen these funds go to folks like those I helped serve when volunteering 6 hrs/wk at a food bank (pre-covid).  Those folks really need it and should have been better targeted.  Thankfully, better national leadership will be in place soon."

As Sen Bernie Sanders spoke from the floor of the Senate and clarified --- from the Tax Policy Center --- ""less than 1% of the 'direct payments' will go to the top 5% of Americans"".

Please have your reporters very carefully check whether Senator Sanders or Mitch McConnell is closer to being correct.

I'm quite sure that all ""Times"" readers, long time subscribers (and even commenters, like myself) will be very concerned with both the accuracy and the initial (top of article) impression, as to whether ""Galen Gilbert, a 71-year old lawyer who lives in a Boston suburb, plans to deposit his stimulus check into savings"", as he is quoted in the caption as saying.

I was born in Needham, lived in Carlisle during my working life, and have relatives who are lawyers in Boston, and will be questioning Mr. Gilbert as to the accuracy and intent of his providing such potentially biasing information to ""Times"".

Why would people be so surprised and skeptical that the skill and laser focus of the world’s finest scientific minds using the most advanced medical technology and with unlimited private and state funding have now resulted in several highly effective vaccines in record time?

I have read that the RNA messenger technology was developed 17 years ago, once the genetic profile of a similar coronavirus was made known.  Scientists have been waiting for ""the big one,"" a pandemic like Covid that only happens once a century.  Thus vaccine researchers were able to develop the Covid-19 vaccine in record time.

I am very much pro-vaccine, but … I would no more take a vaccine than inject myself with bleach on the word of this president. Yet another reason why he needs to be gone when decisions about administering a vaccine to the public must be made.”

The fact that the announcement of the efficacy of the vaccines came after the election and that the approval process was transparent and fact-based has convinced me that I will take the vaccine at the first opportunity.

As for Trump, as far as I can tell, his role in the process has been akin to the child in the back seat of the car who incessantly asks “Are we there yet?”  The child didn’t plan the trip or drive the car, but may have acted sufficiently insufferably that the driver may have decided to go a little faster or skip or shorten rest stops just to be able to stop listening to the incessant nagging.  So perhaps this is one case in which we all benefitted from Trump’s tendency to act like a petulant child."
2020-12-26 22:46:22,"I got the Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 18 December. I got a call that said I could get the shot and I showed up an hour latter. I felt like I won the lottery.
 The side effects are really mild. I got a sore arm like you get with a flu shot. 
 I feel more protected since I got the vaccines. I still wear a mask, social distance, order my food online. but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
 The CoViD vaccine protects me and protects people I could spread it to."
2020-12-26 22:50:49,"In addition to seeing more and more people in high places getting vaccinated without consequence, there is nothing that awakens the senses more than the heightened awareness of death having come for so many Americans, regardless of who they are or what they look like. These vaccines are truly miraculous for the role they are playing to end the Covid nightmare."
2020-12-26 21:16:00,"Much of the media loves to spread crisis and panic where none exists. If someone doesn't want the vaccine, great!  More for the educated people."
2020-12-26 22:01:33,"We distrusted the vaccine because the Trump administration pushed it and I don’t believe a word that comes out of Trump’s mouth (hydroxychloraquin, anyone).  However, since the beginning we have said that if Dr. Fauci took it then we will.  Looking forward to my turn."
2020-12-26 22:17:54,"When it comes down to life or death in a pandemic, one would hope that vaccine resistence would be abandoned by those who purport to be rational.  However, those gullible enough to have been brainwashed by anti-vaccine advocates may still refuse to the detriment of all.  Paronia runs deep, into your lives it will seep."
2020-12-26 21:30:53,Why are the news articles so infatuated with convincing covid vaccine doubters when there are millions of willing people waiting for the vaccine to become available? Lets get the willing vaccinated first and then worry about convincing the doubters.
2020-12-26 21:46:46,"While many assume the anti-mask, it’s a hoax crowd won’t want the vaccine, remember these aren’t rational actors. They will gladly go to the front of the line to be immunized from the “hoax.” It was never about the masks - it was about their fragile egos."
2020-12-26 22:10:00,"Biden was a doubter, he took it at the first opportunity. Like him, many democrats were doubters due to politics and they didn't want to give Trump any credit."
2020-12-26 20:59:50,"After this long year of outrage after outrage, I'm really OK with the Trumpettears not wanting to get the vaccine. The longer they hold themselves out from getting it the more will be available to those of us that need and want it. I use to think that if you just showed some people the advantages of vaccine, education, peace, and love they would just naturally come around. Not any more. If the rural folks of this country want to be left alone then right on leave them alone, pay for your own roads, schooling policing, and health care. Subsidize your own commodity crops and meat that have no real market. Get your own internet access and cell coverage heck why not get rid of USPS out there you don't want to pay for you should not have to pay for it. All of our taxes would go down. My food prices would go up, but that would be made up for with high-quality organic meat and produce."
2020-12-26 21:29:31,Don’t forget the influential skeptic named Kamala Harris sowing significant doubt in these vaccines earlier this fall and all the highly educated folk who somehow thought that because Trump was president that they didn’t trust vaccines developed by private companies with every reason to try their best to get it right. It’s not as bad as encouraging people not to take the virus seriously like trump did but it’s still terrible and this article conveniently ignores recent history
2020-12-26 22:13:47,"Many of us doubted the Trump-corrupted FDA.  Several state health department have independently vetted the data.  That is what I trust...sadly.  

I'm a doc but not seeing patients (doing research) so I'm in line with everyone else.  Can't get here fast enough."
2020-12-26 22:52:24,"We have had the vaccine from the very beginning. Phase 1 and Phase 11 demonstrated titers of antibodies. The phase 3 was needed to prove effectiveness. The sample size demanded for effectiveness was very large with another two months of safety thereafter. A very slow process.

This was not the fastest vaccine by any means. This was the fastest in the last decade. 

During both the 1957/58 and 1968 flu, vaccines were made available (though limited) within much shorter time. During the 1957 flu, the microbiologist Maurice Hilleman was alarmed by pictures of those affected by the virus in Hong Kong that were published in The New York Times. He obtained samples of the virus from a US Navy doctor in Japan. The number of deaths peaked the week ending 17 October, with 600 reported in England and Wales. The vaccine was available in the same month in the United Kingdom. 

If the scientists of 1950s and 1960s would watch the vaccine skepticism as well as the long trials that make no sense, I think they would be shocked. Vaccine skepticism on one side and too much data demand on the other. 

They would have perhaps released the vaccine much earlier with wider Phase 2 population size, and shorter Phase 3. We could have saved so many more lives. Even now, we are reserving the second shot instead of upfront vaccinating more folks and ramping up manufacturing to catch up later. 

I searched for the Maurice Hilleman of our times in vain. We could have saved so many more lives."
2020-12-26 21:43:44,"it is wise to be skeptical when this administration has provided propaganda rather than science. . . 

even in the best of times (ie: studies fully executed) we've had . . . thalidomide. . . etc.....

but i will get the vaccine to be a guinea pig for my parents and for the nation - - still - - had the government been wise, we would not need to put our most vulnerable (elderly) nor our expensively trained health care workers become part of the experiment (and yes, there's a dark novel in there).   The fact that a movie ('Contagion') out in approx 2012 demonstrates that hollywood knew what could happen - and yet our Leader dismantles the department to deal with such a thing?   unforgivable."
2020-12-26 22:59:47,"I have faith in Pfizer and biontech after doing research on the company and vaccine. If the only vaccines available were apart of warp speed I would have been much more apprehensive. However with the high efficacy of modernas vaccine as well I find myself unable to hold it against the administration, even if I do despise them."
2020-12-26 23:18:04,"at this point I don't care very much whether reluctant people chose not to get vaccinated, as long as the doses aren't wasted. I suspect that for one person who says no, two to three will say yes."
2020-12-26 23:31:17,Apparently a lot of people don't believe the experts. Personally I like to get my information from the guy on the corner or whatever the equivalent is online.
2020-12-26 23:43:10,"I’m concerned at hearing that the AstraZeneca vaccine may be approved soon—with something like a 62% effectiveness, small trials, and some kind of serious glitch in the summer. The Brits seem about ready to go with it now. Will we know which vaccine we get? Will people think they’re safe after having taken it—those with cancer or diabetes or the aged? There’s so much disorganization and lack of central, stable planning and control. Even as hope surges, anxiety bounds."
2020-12-26 23:50:06,"I doubt they’ll care, but the anti-vaxxers of the world should at least be told that so far, the serious reactions to the Pfizer vaccine consist of three (3) cases of anaphylaxis out of more than 1.1 million doses, all in people who carried Epipens because of their severe allergies, all quickly responsive to treatment, and none requiring more than an overnight stay in the hospital for observation.

And anyway, I got my first dose almost two weeks ago, my sweetie says the glowing moose antlers look fab, and I feel sure they will come in handy this spring, if you get my drift."
2020-12-26 23:38:43,I've been saying this for months: Americans hate not being able to have something. The scarcity/exclusivity alone is the vaccine's best PR.

Don't waste it people."
2020-12-26 23:26:20,Black Americans are at the same time most skeptical of the vaccine and most concerned about the inequity of its distribution.    They also voted for Biden.   I guess that all makes sense.
2020-12-26 21:41:32,"The doubters, Covid deniers, and no-mask-wearing people should have to wait at the end of the line for a vaccine."
2020-12-26 22:39:45,"People who refused to wear masks should go to the back of the line. Their behaviors have cranked COVID19 and their public health malfeasant behavior should not be reinforced by rewarding them with a health saving vaccine that maskers have earned. 

That would be capitalism in a nutshell, baby. “You don’t work, you can’t eat” as James Brown (JB) said, linking the bitter pill of poverty and the expectation that begging would be in order since you couldn’t work enough to feed yourself. 

You didn’t mask, you can’t cheat. Those who worked hard should get the first shots. 
 
 Oh, NOW you see the value in wearing a mask. Right."
2020-12-26 23:06:33,Love the lady who said shed take it now because of Biden. The dude isnt even in office yet. Its not like the vaccine will suddenly change now that Biden is going to be president.

No.  These people are ignorant. There is a big difference between ignorant and skepticism.

   Seriously."
2020-12-27 00:04:14,"In most these examples, I understood people's reasoning for wanting, rejecting, or being hesitant re the vaccines.  What surprised me, however, is that there are health care workers who remain resistant to being inoculated.  Frankly, I do not understand that; there seems to be no sound reasoning affecting their decision.  The skepticism, however, of those 30 to 49 years of age almost seems predictable.  This is an age group which is for the most part healthy, perhaps erroneously believing that if they were infected by this virus they ""would be able to fight it off.""   And they may also include parents who are ""anti-vaccers,"" another questionable belief system.  At any rate, I am glad to learn that more and more of us are ready and willing to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.  Frankly, I can't wait.  Something has got to stop these deaths and losses of livelihoods.  Yet, I have to think: Would we be so desperate as we are now if we would have heeded necessary guidelines like social distancing and mask-wearing from the get-go?"
2020-12-26 23:45:28,"My skepticism started to wane when the vaccine's success was announced, just a few days after the election.  The timing was just the tiniest little signal from Pfizer that they didn't work for Trump and maybe hadn't let their process be corrupted by his agenda."
2020-12-26 19:04:00,"For those of you who are hesitant, I ask is this from a place of knowledge or ignorance? The science was not rushed, mRNA vaccine technology has been years in the making. SARS-nCoV-2 is just the first application. I do know something about the vaccine process and I will be happy to receive either approved vaccine as soon as I'm eligible. My partner, a physician, has already received hers. These are safe, effective, and incomparably better than the disease."
2020-12-26 22:41:46,"Doc here. Got Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday. Mild tenderness. Easier than the flu and shingles vaccines. 

Vaccine science has been around for a long time. Yes this is a different virus and yes the methodology is new but the science behind it has been proven.

They keep you in the exam room for 15 minutes with the door open afterwards, in case anything exciting happens; then they invite you to you register on a website where you can report any side effects.

2020-12-27 00:27:14,"Human psychology is a funny thing. 

When we first found out this fall that most people would have to wait months to get vaccinated, I immediately thought that this rationing would paradoxically make more people want it  -- especially those who thought they didn't. 

Now we know how to get people to do anything: Just make it seem like they're not going to be eligible to participate. Then they'll fight for the chance. Mark Twain told us this about 150 years ago when he described Tom Sawyer getting the other kids to whitewash that fence."
2020-12-27 00:29:37,"We were chatting about the vaccine on my unit last Monday morning, and a nurse said he planned to “wait a few months” before getting his dose just to “make sure it was ok.” Later that day, word started to spread that we were (unexpectedly) next up to receive our shots. Nurses and docs began returning from their breaks, excitedly reporting that they had been vaccinated. There was an atmosphere of euphoria, and relief.

By the end of the day, the reluctant nurse had gone to get vaccinated as well.

I have a feeling this will be a common scenario."
2020-12-27 00:36:19,"Right now, I couldn't care less about the vaccine doubters and whether they choose to get vaccinated or not.  Maybe later, but definitely not now.

There are millions of people over age 50 who desperately want vaccination.  For them, infection will likely bring severe suffering and a substantial chance of death, especially for those over age 70.  Whereas, for persons under age 50, infection is almost always a mild illness, sometimes with no symptoms whatsoever.

Nevertheless, the unethical and immoral medical workers at CDC have ordered that tens of millions of young medical workers, young teachers, young cops, and young politicians have first access to vaccines.  Every dose given to those young recipients is a dose denied to older people.

So please, don't waste any effort and money trying to persuade people foolishly avoiding vaccination.  Wait until those of us desperate to protect our very lives are no longer denied vaccine access by an immoral CDC and by the unethical professionals across the nation carrying out the immoral CDC orders."

2020-12-27 00:43:13,"I work in the Emergency Department in a major hospital. I went in for my vaccine last week, only to allow my fear and doubt to sink in at the last minute. I left without it, with lingering feelings of regret throughout the week. I went back in today and received the vaccine. I feel confident that I made the right decision. The news of the variant, more contagious strain of covid is what pushed me to do it today."
2020-12-27 00:46:25,"One big problem with the anti-vaccers is the failure of our educational system to help people think rationally, as opposed to learning facts.  One basic issue is probability.   If a hundred million people get vaccinated, and 3 of them die, that sticks out in people's minds, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands who died already from Covid, which ultimately will kill over a half million.  Which number is bigger?

Also, some people will inevitably die soon after the shot because out of millions, some people die for whatever reason.  It will not be a higher percentage than those who die after not getting a shot, but some will freak out just the same.  People have no sense of a baseline re mortality.  We see this with hysterical conclusions about autism and vaccination.

Once school gets rolling, this is a perfect time to teach such skills to the kids.  But how do we get the parents to think wisely?"
2020-12-27 00:53:28,"Actually, I'm delighted if people change their minds about the vaccine.  The more the merrier for all.  In deciding who should go first, I wonder if those 18 million Americans who've already had COVID-19 should perhaps wait until the rest of us have had our shots.  I know there's a slight chance of reinfection.  But recent studies seem to show that having had the disease does, in fact, provide some protection from future reinfection.  Perhaps COVID-19 survivors should go to the bottom of the list."
2020-12-27 01:03:25,I'm all in as soon as I can get the vaccine. The feeling afterward will be like getting out of jail. And a whole lot less stress in my life.

2020-12-27 01:31:45,"I wonder whether the different groups hesitant about the Covid-19 vaccines have asked themselves what would likely happen to them - individually - if they don't take the vaccine. Say, it turns out by year's end that a significant percentage of people, say, 40%, between the ages of 30-49 have not been vaccinated. Now, one of them goes to a job interview. If I were the interviewer I would wonder whether or not the interviewee has been vaccinated. Legally, I probably wouldn't be permitted to ask the interviewee about it, though I am not sure. So, unless the interviewee volunteers the information, I would probably pass on that person, just to err on the side, and look for someone from a group that has better vaccination stats. 

Would recruiters be crazy for doing so? Maybe so, but that doesn't really matter in terms of who actually gets hired and who doesn't.  It would be even worse for people who fall into several groups with low vaccination stats, say, a 30-year old black Republican woman? 

The same dynamics could also come into play in other, non-professional contexts. People who have been vaccinated in general won't want to socialize with those who haven't. 

My expectation is that once this reality sinks in with the anti-vaxer folks, they will give it a second thought. Covid isn't the measles or the flu. People aren't just going to give anti-vaxers are free pass on this one."

Is this why many people may be afraid to roll up their sleeves?
This is not a political issue. Why do many incorporate politics into a science medical issue? Do they have the answers yet?

mRNA was designed for flu viruses; mRNA is being used for a different virus ... a covid-19 virus. What changes were made if any, for it to work on covid? Does mRNA work on flu viruses and is it currently on the markets for flu vaccinations?"
2020-12-27 01:23:19,"Those folks who are not so sure they want the vaccine, changing their minds, will be a lesson in figuring out the scientific facts. First, seeing other people take the vaccination shot and have no adverse reaction ... then, the scientists will track the process and show the results (how many have an adverse reaction, and what degree of adverse reaction) ... then announcing the results so that everyone can know the results, and know that they are trustworthy aka accurate ... good lesson learned. The result will be to have more people believing facts than believing disinformation (aka the fake news that trump spews).

2020-12-27 02:36:47,Anyone who has already had an opportunity but passed it up because they wanted to “wait and see” needs to be put at the back of the line.  There are too many people willing to take the vaccine immediately for the timid people to get a second chance before the rest of us.
2020-12-27 02:38:53,"When Trump announced that there would be a speedy race for a vaccine I was a little worried about shortcuts that would be taken to get a vaccine before the election.  The CDC and FDA did a good job demonstrating that shortcuts were not taken, As a high risk patient I am ready to recieve the vaccine."
2020-12-27 02:58:57,"I was initially doubtful, due to the rush, and trump's desire to take credit for literally anything. I am more inclined, at this point, after following the news of the initial rollout, and doing the math on the severe reactions. 

Alas, I'm nowhere near the front of the line."
2020-12-27 03:00:06,"My father had polio just as the vaccine came out (although not yet widely available).  For anyone waffling on whether to get a Civid-19 vaccine, I wish my father were around to convince you otherwise."
2020-12-27 03:05:00,Trumpers will not yield to any vaccine or truth of science.
2020-12-27 02:17:29,I think that some people were thinking that the side effects from the vaccine would be cancer or autistic children.
2020-12-27 02:27:58,"Without a president casting doubt, fomenting hatred and spreading mistrust, of course people will welcome remedy to this deadly disease. Folks don't want to die, they want to go back to work, to visit family, and enjoy their friends. COVID crippled our country but the problem was exacerbated by one man who saw an opportunity to make money and increase his power. It wasn't scientists who advocated Clorox or hydroxychloroquine. It wasn't doctors who refused to mask or social distance. It wasn't nurses who refused to fully deploy the Defense Production Act.

Trump and his sycophants need to be held accountable for the thousands who died needlessly, and the millions suffering economic disaster which Trump could have lessened thru compassionate and astute leadership. There were ample examples of ways to mitigate this pandemic, but the biggest problem we confronted was the man in the white house."
2020-12-27 03:11:37,How in the name of sanity could a surgical recovery nurse EVER hesitate to receive a vaccine?
2020-12-27 02:03:51,"While we’re waiting on patented vaccines for profit, perhaps we could use some free, preventive medicine such as producing adecquate amounts of vitamin D3 naturally through the skin from our bodies which creates immune homeostasis and keeps us from suffering the lethal symptoms of cytoklene storm from SARS-cov2:

2020-12-27 03:17:32,"I have taken every vaccine available/applicable to me and will continue to do so.  After ten months of isolating ourselves from people, wearing masks, washing out hands, my husband and I are ready for the vaccine.  He is 69 and I am 70 with coronary artery disease; I do not want to risk getting seriously ill with the coronavirus.  I'm waiting eagerly...

Fresh surveys show attitudes shifting and a clear majority of Americans now eager to get vaccinated.

In polls by Gallup, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Pew Research Center, the portion of people saying they are now likely or certain to take the vaccine has grown from about 50 percent this summer to more than 60 percent, and in one poll 73 percent — a figure that approaches what some public health experts say would be sufficient for herd immunity."
2020-12-27 03:25:59,"As a healthcare worker, I am thankful to have received the vaccine 9 days ago.  Since then, I have urged every patient I have seen in the clinic and the hospital to get a vaccine once it is available to them.  To those who I know are skeptics, I start off with how I haven’t had any side effects to break the tension.  

Though my speciality is not primary care, every medical professional has the chance to change minds."
2020-12-27 03:33:35,Just want to note that at least one person quoted in the article and numerous commenters seem to think that getting the vaccine will enable them to stop wearing masks. But at this point we do not know if getting the shot will mean you can no longer transmit the virus. So by all means get the vaccine when it's your turn but keep using your mask until the scientists say it's safe to go maskless.
2020-12-27 03:46:55,"like flu vaccine, i foresee that we will be asked to take it every year. While the common man's life was destroyed due to COVID, the tech companies and major corps (Working from home means less expenses and more work), Amazon, Politicians and pharma companies have had a field day."
2020-12-27 03:13:01,"This paints a rosy picture. That 60 percent you’re citing from the Pew poll is broken into roughly two halves, one of which “probably will” take the vaccine. “Probably will” is a common answer among people when asked if they’d take the flu vaccine, but similarly only 1/3 get that vaccine each year."
2020-12-27 03:55:45,"We should have had China like restrictions, then we would have been successful in containing COVID spread. Right now, with all our lectures about Democracy, freedom of speech etc. , they are the ones who controlled it, came out of it and are likely to benefit economically to surpass us to become the largest economy.  we will be left with sermons on Democracy while China grows and does business with rest of the world. and we, the poor Americans, we would buy products that American companies make in China while listening to the lies from our politicians."
2020-12-27 03:49:20,"Whatever happened after that Satmar Ultra-Orthodox wedding in Brooklyn attended by 7,000 souls?    Never saw a follow up story on the COVID impact, other than that we were being fined.

It will be interesting to see if the Ultra-Orthodox community accepts this vaccine, or if they maintain an anti-science stance as they did with the measles vaccine."
2020-12-26 23:44:17,Why listen to Dr. Fauci when you can bet on dr. atlas?
2020-12-27 03:55:07,"This is a start. It's an admission the virus is real and deadly.
Next these same people must admit that Trump is a ruthless, anti democratic nihilist and like the virus, they must acknowledge it and now work to ensure his virus dies with Covid19."
2020-12-27 02:36:40,They should be placed at the end of the line for their 'contribution' to our recovery.
2020-12-27 04:00:05,"I was sure that would be the case. Asking people about something in theory, that is not yet here, is one thing. The reality is something different. Too much news copy was wasted on ""will she or won't she; only her hairdresser knows for sure."" As for me, like many, I've always winced when I saw a needle headed toward me. Never even had my ears pierced.  But now ... embrace the needle, baby. I cannot WAIT to see that vaccine headed toward my arm. I might go home and have a glass of champagne after dose two."
2020-12-27 04:09:48,"""... as the vaccine went from a hypothetical to a reality, something happened.""  A similar phenomenon could occur in the political arena when we transition from the current pre-inauguration weeks to January 20, 2021 and beyond."
2020-12-27 05:17:23,"“The lure of the vaccines’ modest quantities also can’t be underestimated as a driver of desire, somewhat like the must-have frenzy generated by a limited-edition Christmas gift, according to public opinion experts.”

I think the author means to say that the lure can’t OVERestimated (i.e., no matter how high your estimate, the real lure is greater still)."
2020-12-27 05:26:06,"On September 16, 2020 the director of the Centers for Disease Control, Robert Redfield, said that wearing a face mask was better protection against the coronavirus than a vaccine. Three months later it seems clear he was dead wrong. Literally. 

Face masks have not stopped the coronavirus epidemic from reaching a new peak in deaths unimagined just three months ago. Vaccines, on the other hand, proved in clinical tests to be very protective. (Though of course they still need to show their protective power in real life.)

As far as I'm concerned, you can keep your face mask. Give me a vaccine. If some don't want it, good. That means more for the rest of us that do. And there are hundreds of millions of Americans who are dying for a shot at avoiding death."
2020-12-27 05:59:24,The safety and efficacy tests of these vaccines were as rigorous as a vaccine that took 10 years to make. Warp speed applies to other areas of their creation but not to them being considered safe. I’m taking it as soon as I can. Thanks scientific community!
2020-12-27 06:47:48,"It’s smart to keep an open mind.
I grew up on a big cattle ranch, 1950s, the DDT truck sprayed the barn regularly, and when we kids were sick, Mom sent us to the barn to get some cow penicillin for ourselves. I was that first school class with the Salk polio vaccine. Made decisions based on our limited knowledge. And you bet those cattle were tested for brucellosis. And the milk was inspected for bacterial loads, and the feed was adjusted for production. We kept learning as science learned. And as we were able to gain access to more knowledge. 
Years later, when I traveled, you bet I was just fine with getting the compulsory yellow fever vaccine. 
This Covid-19 vaccine? A daughter was vaccinated last week. Other medical kids and first responder kids are close behind. 
I do understand a lot of the stuff that people are feeling about all this. And I respect it. It’s as personal as anything can get. 
Think it over.  Actually, if you know a large animal veterinarian, talk it over with him/her.  They’re practical and know a lot about this stuff, and they won’t steer you wrong. And then think it over for yourself, again. Open mind."
2020-12-27 09:58:26,"I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine 3 days ago. I am an emergency physician, and I was among the first in my department to get vaccinated. The majority of the doctors and nurses in my department are planning to wait at least a month or two before they get vaccinated. Some do not intend to get vaccinated at all. 

Personally I am much more afraid of the virus than of any hypothetical vaccine side effects, so I am delighted to get the vaccine early. This is a decision every person has to make for themselves."
2020-12-27 10:18:42,"Trump and the Republican Party bear much of the blame for the suspicion surrounding the coronavirus vaccine. From the very beginning, their failure to take the coronavirus seriously coupled with the mixed messages from the White House, resulted in public confusion. Trump refused to wear a mask or promote social distancing yet touted unproven remedies,e.g., hydroxychloroquine, like the used car salesman he is. It is no  wonder the majority of us would not trust anything Trump was promoting, especially since he promoted the vaccine to help himself get re-elected."
2020-12-27 10:37:52,As a 68 year old Heart Attack survivor my concerns have always been about side effects. Now that we have 2 approved vaccines and possibly 4 by the time I am eligible for the vaccine (February or March) my plan is to ask my Cardiologist if there is a vaccine preferred by the American College of Cardiology. Whatever her answer I do plan on being vaccinated.
2020-12-27 10:42:45,"Information has an increased presence in the daily news cycle while disinformation and the man who peddles much of it are losing their prominence.  The media could have made this switch sooner, instead of assisting Trump as he labored to divide our nation."
2020-12-27 11:04:04,"COVID-19 is extraordinarily contagious, and has killed over 300,000 Americans.  All 50 states have laws requiring vaccinations for schoolchildren, with various specific exceptions.  These laws have never been overturned based on Constitutional law.  There is absolutely nothing to prevent all 50 states from legally mandating COVID-19 vaccination for all residents.  North Dakota and other anti-science states may choose not to do so.  In such instance, the states that do mandate vaccination should just impose strict quarantine rules for travelers from those states, just as they have done with no legal impediments during 2020 pandemic surges."
2020-12-27 11:56:43,"Most of my fellow colleagues (MDs and PhDs) are choosing to wait for more safety and efficacy data.  What most of the public doesn't realize is the 90+ efficacy rate was based on only the first 100 patients who contracted COVID.  Neither company released crucial data on these patients - how many cycles of PCR testing were done, severity, etc.  This is crucial missing data.  For all we know, the 5 in the vaccine group with COVID had severe disease, and the 95 in the control group had symptomless disease.  The point is, we don't know.  So that is why I and others are waiting."
2020-12-26 23:57:20,"Am not afraid of taking the vaccine. I am more afraid of the program that has been developed, at operation of a 'Warped Speed' and ""approved "" for 'emergency use' and we still do not know (even scientists) if it will stave off this virus and if the second shot will prolong it. And due to the lack of vaccines available for all people in the world how can you expect it to produce the results you desire? More companies are looking for cures and now we are allowing them all to enter the 'market'. Remdesivir still has not received FDA approval to cure. And the others... 
Dr. Fauchi is now up to 90% inoculation (if not more) for conquering this virus...Some are 50%-75% efficacy rate and acceptable. We have how many available vaccines and for whom to start and then the next group , and the next and next and June/July 2021 has come with more vaccines.... 
What are the new mutations and why are they now the spreader(s) globally in less than what 10 days? But Britain new of this in the early fall?
Is there a vaccine that works, will work, or the hope is does, or a herd immunity will, or one of the other companies happen to find one that does work effectively before we have to shut down the house again... And still would like to know how China has 3-4 times population and sitting at 87,000 infections 82,000 recoveries 4600 dead ect. Maybe a working vaccine...its been a year now. Not conspiracy, but how. What have they done we have not. 

Take the shot if available and hope for the best?"
2020-12-26 23:10:33,"The current vaccines just lessen the symptoms of Covid, should you get it.  Because it doesn't prevent you from giving or getting the virus--and we will still have to have restricted lives (masks, socially-distancing, etc.), I will pass.  Now come up with a vaccine where we can dump the masks and hug our friends...I will gladly take that one."
2020-12-27 03:40:01,I will not take it. Is there any real evidence for any reason to take this vaccine if you are under 60? I assume not since we don't have any data on that. Who knows if taking the vaccine does anything more than a natural infection in a young person.
2020-12-26 22:45:42,"The average vaccine spends about 10 years in development before it is released for use on the public. Don’t tell me I have nothing to worry about when the normal vaccine development time has been shortened to approximately 1/10 its normal length. COVID-19 is serious. But so is injecting a foreign substance into one's body. Everyone says, ""The doctors/scientists/drug manufacturers know what they're doing."" And they do. But learning about the virus and vaccine takes time, and a lot of it. There are still many unknowns. There is no other substitute for long term observation and clinical trials in vaccine development. I know; I was an enthusiastic participant in a Phase III clinical anthrax vaccine trial 12 years in the making."
2020-12-26 18:40:55,"I'm weighing the possibility of long term effects, (such as auto-immune issues which won't be known for a year or more), social responsibility and a desire to be able to see my kids under normal circumstances.   I also want to see the data on whether it prevents you from spreading the disease.  If I could still transmit the disease, it would significantly reduce my incentive to vaccinate. 
There is also the issue of corona virus's rabid mutation rate on immunization efficacy. 
I believe in vaccination, social responsibility...but this is rushed and complex.  Scientific thinking changes as data changes, which is as it should be."
2020-12-26 21:40:17,"I am not a doubter because I am anti-vaccine.  Quite the contrary.  I am a doubter because the Trump FDA said the two current vaccines are safe and effective, and I've gotten to the point that I can't believe anything the Trump administration says.

It won't matter in the end, of course. I'm so far down the line that by the time I'm eligible I'll have plenty of evidence to go on from what happens to those who get the vaccine before me. But I shouldn't have to accumulate my own empirical data, particularly not at the expense of my fellow citizens.  I should be able to trust what the FDA tells me.  And I just can't."
2020-12-27 12:00:21,"Here’s an idea. Since there is a backlog of demand greater than supply just ignore the anti-vaxxers. They can take a seat while the rest of us line up and take our shots. There’ll be more evidence, more doses and more information for them to change their stubborn minds in late 2021."
2020-12-26 23:09:17,"Logically speaking the long term effects of this vaccine have not been researched, take it at your own risk. I really don't believe in this!"
2020-12-27 00:09:19,"I was more excited before reading about adverse reactions in people with allergies. The last time I had an allergic reaction reaction to shellfish, it involved my Epi-Pen and two hospital trips. Still plan to get the vaccine, but am eager to find out what protocols they will put in place for people like me. I hope people with severe allergies can get it at a hospital, rather than a doctor's office, in case they need emergency care."
2020-12-27 00:21:50,"Why has Pfizer’s CEO refused to be vaccinated?  His “I don’t want to cut the line” does not hold up to scrutiny.  As the public face of Pfizer, it is “his” vaccine and line.  A live television vaccination would go a long way in inspiring public trust.  

In addition, the media and “experts” should be factual and truthful about negative reactions to the vaccine.  For example, gIve us the one reason why the nurse fainted on live television after being vaccinated.  The many conflicting explanations sound like lies.  Stop saying the growing number of severe allergic reactions are “rare” and not a big deal.  Needing to use an Epi-pen is a big deal, especially to the person struggling to breathe."
2020-12-27 02:14:39,"Yes follow the science. It appears to me that it is wishy washy at best. Everyday you can count that the ""great"" Dr. Fauci will tell you something different. Also these scientists aren't really sure about what is causing adverse reactions. It is each individuals choice to choose to take the vaccine or not. If you took it or are going to take it, good for you. That's your choice. If you choose not to, that is your choice and nobody's business."
2020-12-26 21:58:45,"Two data points that I would like to know, if available from experts:

First, among those who have been vaccinated under the rollout (as opposed to those in the trials), what percentage of them experienced the unpleasant side effects about which we heard? There were concerns with people having to stay out of work the day after the shot. I haven't heard anything more about that and wondered how that's going.

Second, what percent of patients who take a flu vaccine have allergic reactions?"
2020-12-26 22:24:56,"Like a baseball player, I prefer to ""look 'em over"" for awhile.
There is a reason for the lack of trust - BigPharma's record has been pretty horrific over time, and its corruption of the F.D.A., via massive campaign contributions across the aisle - has helped cause the massive distrust.  This is only one of two countries in the world that permits the awful Direct-to-Consumer advertising we all suffer.  If the products were so great, why do they need to be endlessly shilled on television and other media?"
2020-12-27 02:51:11,"In the real world I have found the exact opposite sentiment. Then again I have often disagreed with these polls that are often wrong. I  have zero intention of taking this vaccine, as a person with MS it would be deadly. I haven't dealt with MS for decades just to give up the fight to make them rich. 

My soon to be 98 year old mother will also not take it. She has made it to 98 because we ignored the hospital experts who tried to persuade  us to put her in a nursing home several years ago after an operation. After a stay at a so called top hospital she was no longer mobile. We brought her home and she is now mobile and still mentally sharp. We later found out they had a financial interest in the nursing home. We cherish every day she is here and she will go on her own terms, not to line the pockets of big pharma.

I don't trust this vaccine, the politicians who often have hidden interests in the health industry or the third party LLCs partnered in the distribution. These people are not  Salk doing this to help people. It's all about the money and they will lie for a profit."
2020-12-27 10:10:44,"The change of mind in antivaxers bodes well for the countless other conspiracy theories in TrumperLand.   Let’s hope that replacing the relentless torrent of hysterical fictions from the White House with calm, beneficial, reality-based truths can produce similar U-turns in other areas."
2020-12-27 11:28:23,"With over 332,000 dead, is it not unreasonable for people to fear a vaccine promoted by a five year old petty vindictive president?  

Once people look behind the headlines and learn more (such as DJT had NOTHING to do with the Pfizer effort), the more comfortable we become with he vaccines."
2020-12-27 03:56:37,Until supply begins to meet demand I don’t care at all if somebody doesn’t want it. Fine. Let someone else take your place and you better   hope that there’s enough at the very very end of the line if you want it.

2020-12-27 04:11:41,"At the start of 2020, China had COVID and we had the economy. Now we have CoVID and they have the economy! What good is Democracy if it can't protect its own people?"
2020-12-27 05:16:01,"I guess now Trump is on his way out, there is no more hate towards vaccines I assume. That tells volumes about our country."

2020-12-27 04:50:16,"What would you rather get: the vaccine or COVID? The way infections are spreading -- even to people who take all the precautions -- means your turn is coming, and it may not be any fun at all."
2020-12-27 04:08:35,"Instead of building confidence among the people about vaccines, our established Newspapers from Washington and New York were engaged in creating doubts in the minds of people. They wanted to defeat Trump, so saying positive things about Vaccines didn't matter to them."
2020-12-27 04:14:01,"Instinctual behaviors are the enablers of infectivity.  Whether those behaviors are fatal rituals of burial during the Ebola epidemic in Western Africa or the maskless gatherings of the Don’t Tread on Me movement during this COVID-19 pandemic.  Instinctual behaviors can be overridden by autocratic decree, new cultural norms of epidemic survivors or intellectual enlightenment in the abstract.  Taking a vaccine is not instinctual but anything less than swift global eradication through global immunization will allow this virus to lodge itself in the human race and pick off unlucky souls until we vanish from the face of the earth."
2020-12-27 04:15:10,Human psychology: if people think there’s a limited amount of vaccine and they’re at the back of the line...they’ll suddenly want it ASAP.
2020-12-27 10:25:55,"Can we get a factual (not anecdotal) source for this assertion: ""Black people have remained the most resistant to taking a coronavirus vaccine, largely because of the history of abusive research on them by white doctors.""
I don't question the history of abusive history; I question its present-day relevance and saliency."
2020-12-27 04:38:42,"Don't even give vaccine doubters a media platform!!  We have to conquer this virus.  We must take back our lives.  For those who may have a reaction to the shot, it is still worth the risk.  We have hope to return to normal although it will take awhile."
2020-12-27 05:02:43,There is PII (personally identifiable information) visible on one of the vaccination cards in one of the photos. It should have been blurred before publication.

2020-12-27 05:16:10,"Unfortunately, some early vaccine deniers also did not believe in wearing masks or social distancing.  Why did they think that was ok?"
2020-12-27 11:21:11,"When I have to go in the hospital again, it would be nice to know that all employees from the surgeons to the janitorial staff will be inoculated. I will not allow anyone to come near me unless they are. This is a no brainer."
2020-12-27 04:36:35,"This story also gives me faith that Biden might be right—that once Trump and his crazy maunderings are out of the way, bipartisanship may make a comeback. A lot of strange and unexpected things have happened over the last year. We may as well get ready for this possibility, too."
2020-12-27 06:06:51,I always wondered what would happen if the Tragedy of the Commons met anti-intellectualism. Many commenters here have provided the answer.

2020-12-27 12:42:03,"I think that a lot of the difference is that last spring, many people thought COVID would just dissipate in the summer, like flu. Almost a year later, after a morose Christmas, and a long, gray winter ahead, we will do anything that will take us somewhat back to normal. Will I be able to visit my family in Europe  or on the west coast next summer for the first time in almost 2 years? Where do I line up?"
2020-12-27 12:44:33,"I am fine with people not taking the vaccine if they have no underlying conditions what would indicate that it would pose a risk to them...

...as long as they were willing to back up their beliefs and sign that,

A) they will not seek care medical care should they get COVID-19, I see no reason why they should take space in the hospitals from those who have sough to preserve their health and the health of others,

B) if they are able to get care the care will not be paid for by their insurance or the public as they knowingly contributed to their illness,

C) that they agree to contact tracing, and

D) they will be responsible for all the medical and life ending costs for those who become ill after being traced back to them including their family members. 

Personal responsibility. If you want it, take it. But do it for real."
2020-12-27 12:54:31,"It's stunning to think that even educated people like teachers and health care workers are skeptical to the vaccine. If it wasn't for the use of vaccines through the decades, they and their children might not even be alive."
2020-12-27 14:36:58,"seems to me to be both good news and bad news. good in that more people may be vaccinated,  bad in that it pushes those of us who have believed in the vaccine further back in line."
2020-12-27 14:46:33,In Florida so far I have not seen any way to sign up and get the vaccine. And I am looking. Front line medical people and nursing home residents with the home workers are getting their shots now.  The Govenor says seniors will be in the second wave. But getting this set up is going to be a major logistic challenge.
2020-12-27 15:00:29,"Boy oh boy, am I soooo lucky. I'm 74 which makes me elderly, I suffer from heart disease, and in remission from cancer, which puts me at the front of the vaccine line. I'll bet everyone wishes they were old, had heart disease and experienced cancer.

On the other hand, given my life expectancy is measured in months, wouldn't our country be better served if the limited supply of vaccine went to the working folks struggling to put food on the table?

Frankly, wouldn't we all be better served if we had a president who didn't discourage masks, didn't advocate Clorox and didn't make so many deliberate mistakes including NOT ordering enough vaccine? Going a little further, wouldn't we be better off if we had a functional congress that removed this maniac as soon as it realized Trump was an impediment and not a leader?

Sadly, Trump proved incapable of astute leadership and congress failed to remove him so we are forced to choose between who lives and who dies. I'm soooo lucky."

Many of these Hospice hero’s are over the age of 65.  The hospice services have become seriously short-staffed because of all of their employees diagnosed or put on quarantine due to COVID.

2020-12-27 15:39:43,"Since we have to wear masks anyway, no one has a right to tell people they must get a vaccine they aren't comfortable with, especially since there are many questions even the scientific community can't answer yet. I find it appalling readers are being so pushy about forcing the vaccine on everyone. Most skeptics, including myself, are open to receiving it later, have taken all our other vaccines, and wear masks. We aren't anti-vaxxers; we're the opposite, careful and observant. We own our own bodies, not anyone else. I'm even more shocked at the suggestion that people wouldn't deserve treatment for the virus because we chose to take the vaccine later.

This is a total screw up. 
I have contacted my local health department and they don't know anything yet. My doctor knows nothing. Nobody knows anything.

2020-12-27 13:57:11,"I called a relative on Christmas day, a woman with whom I grew up. She lives with her family in Nassau County. Not only was she having the entire family over for Christmas, but when I expressed relief that a vaccine was finally about to become available, she told me she had no intentions of taking the vaccine “for a long time.” She was advising members of her family to do the same and, as far as I know, most of them will follow her advice. This includes our kids, their spouses, and grandkids.

 The only members of the family who will ignore her did not show up for Christmas and have not seen her since the pandemic began. They are well educated and left ethnic Long Island for a city far away

Anyone who thinks that the Trumpers will willingly get vaccinated is naïve. What had been a crusade to avoid masks and social distancing has now become determination to avoid the vaccine. Why? I don’t know. They are not very smart, true. But Trumpism is a kind of tribal, fundamentalist psychosis.

I got off the phone fast. I told her that it was her choice, but that I thought she was making a mistake. She was triumphant, stating proudly, “Yes, that’s right, it’s my choice.“ Apparently, she believes that because her family has thus far escaped the disease, “we are lucky,“ they have no reason to take a vaccine.

The last time I had a flu shot (18 years ago) I got the flu.  I haven't had either the shot or the flu since then.
And why is the same dose given to a 120 pound woman as to a 250 pound man?  Perhaps this accounts for the greater reluctance of women to get the vaccine.

And no, I am definitely not a Trump supporter or a Republican."
2020-12-27 12:14:28,"“The association between vaccine attitudes and political affiliation is worrisome to many behavioral experts, who fear that vaccine uptake will become tied to partisan views, impeding the achievement of a broad immunity.”

So, what does this mean?

Possibly that, when infection rates begin to decline markedly and eventually all but vanish in heavily inoculated areas — cities, deep-blue states — rural, red-state areas will continue to see heavy infection and high death rates because there aren’t enough persuadable people — or Democrats — to bring them up to necessary herd immunity levels.

One would like to think that such a stark divide between the vaccinated and unvaccinated would finally begin to sink in and erode their partisan prejudices, but similar divides have existed for decades, if not a century or more, in income levels, amount and quality of public services, legal protections, access to health care and personal freedoms between what we now refer to as the blue and the red.  

It’s a strange mind that takes more comfort in the preservation and reinforcement of its preconceptions, however specious, than in the hard reality of being tangibly secure, economically and physically.  Would that rationalism might be distilled, drawn into syringes and injected into arms connected to headstrong, but ultimately self-destructive brains."

I’m way down the line but greatly look forward to being vaccinated end enjoying the greater freedom that will come with it. 

As for the naysayers: at this point, there are far more people willing than there are vaccines, so their resistance isn’t important. They can stay at the back of the line. (Attempts to cut in line are going to be the bigger issue; it’s already happening.)

I told her, “if we did not have vaccines, the whole world would be in the Dark Ages, with death & disease rampant everywhere”. 
I therefor decided to divorce her from my world. I blocked her from Facebook, stopped sending Xmas & Birthday gifts. She does not exist in my mind anymore. I could not associate my family with such stupidity.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. She still will refuse to take a vaccine for it, but I feel I have been vindicated that vaccines are a vital part of our world. I was right!"

Instead of promoting the vaccine fairly early on, every one of the news outlets proclaimed it as a Trump fantasy to win an election. Now that the news media accomplished their goal of defeating the President and want to embrace the vaccine which was never a fantasy, their followers are the most suspicious. After all their favorite News media told them for 9 months it is a fantasy cooked up by an evil man. You reap what you sow."

After a certain time when everyone who wants the vaccine can get it, I don't want my tax dollars to subsidize those who refuse.  I don't want insurance premiums to go up because of the refusers.  Employers should have the right to require proof of vaccination.  Same for restaurants, sporting events, etc.  And if they do get sick, don't burden the medical workers.  Stay home and deal with it yourself."
2020-12-27 18:14:47,"We need to teach people that technology is based on science, and technology works. So the science must be at least that much right. Tell them, ""Look at your smartphone. Do you think it works by magic? Do you think there's a little Flintstones animal inside it making it work? No! It works on technology that is based on science."" 

Also, teach the powerful tool of spectroscopy. In brief, you put the light from a star through a prism. You will see the colors red through violet in a band. You will also see a pattern of dark lines. Now take various chemical elements into the lab and heat them and examine their light in the same manner. You get a pattern dark lines (or bright lines, depending)! You find that each element has a unique pattern of lines. So match up the lines from the spectrum of the star with those from the lab and you can identify elements on distant stars and the like! And you also find out that distant objects are made of the same atoms we have here on earth. And there are other things you can learn from the spectra of stars and galaxies and such. Like their speeds, which is how we found out that the universe is expanding!
So if scientists can do all that, they can make vaccines, too -- which, by the way, are an equally impressive feat. 
Never mind the slow-news-day articles about research that is _in progress_. The vaccines are past that point. They are ready to use. And I will get my does ASAP.

2020-12-27 17:28:29,"By the time most of us will have a shot at getting the shot/s...there will either be evidence for actual concern, or not. I'm betting on the not. Simply because I've gobbled up what ever I can read on the development of these vaccines, and even to a layman like myself, the science looks sound. There was no reinventing the wheel here, but rather a deep dive and reliance on established scientific principles, and development strategies. 

I grasp that mistrust in the FDA and other regulating agencies is always high, spiking this year for sure, but at the same time, all the noise around the issues of these vaccines, is that...noise! Noise from a deplorable White House, and its toadies. Noise from fringe conspiracists, and their multipliers. Noise from the just plain belligerent people, in the public eye and next door to all of us. Noise, noise, noise. 

Compounded by 2020 bringing its perfect storm of vectors for the Noisome among us to get a whole lot of attention. People at home and doom scrolling, obsessing over unfounded claims, and random minutia. People still relying on their FB feeds. (Why? Why people, why? Dump the FB!)

Despite what people claim, being skeptical is not what we've seen this year. Skepticism needs to be grounded in knowledge, understanding, a modicum of insight on a subject at hand. Instead we get outright denial claimed as skepticism. We get conspiracies dressed as reason and cause for skepticism.

2020-12-27 18:17:40,"I know what I'm thinking is terrible, but after months of anti-mask anti-distancing republicans driving our numbers far past the obscene, I'm somewhat happy that these same Typhoid Mary types will skip the vaccine as well.
More, a lot more, than one republican lawmaker has said people die every day.  The clown who got 71 million votes for reelection has done his best to ensure people would get infected, through actions both passive and active.
So, yeah, good.  Don't get the shots.  Fine with me.  And when you attend the funeral of a loved one, or they attend yours, we'll call it poetic justice and survival of the (mentally) fittest, and be better positioned to carry on with our own lives, slightly less impeded by those who wear ignorance like a flag."
2020-12-27 18:45:44,"It would be ""nice"" if the NYT style guide required an equal emphasis on identifying Democrats, environmentalists, and others in the NYT camp that are anti-vaccine.  The recent article on ""Misinformation Peddlers"" only identified Robert F Kennedy Jr as an ""anti-vaccination"" activist, rather than a Democrat environmentalist anti-vaccination activist.  The anti-vaccination bias swings on both sides of the spectrum.  The Marin County moms who fought the measles vaccine were rich Democrats.  Ignorance about vaccinations is substantial.

Meanwhile, the NYT could also do us all a favor by always linking to their own article on vaccination effectiveness.  It's certainly more effective messaging if people think they're 95% effective against the virus, but if the NYT has a remote interest in continuing to occasionally publish factual info, they'll keep that link in. 

Finally, without robust data to identify which doctors write a suspiciously high number of vaccination exemptions, we'll find the usual physician suspects who will write the exemption for anyone who asks (or pays?).  We elevate physicians onto pedestals, but physicians wrote millions of prescriptions for opioids for people they knew were abusing them.  And ask any employer about docs that write phony excuses to take people off work (asking ""how  long do you want to be off?"") and who have contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant illnesses due to their overprescribing for anyone who asks."

This shot was administered four years ago and I still suffer from the injury to my shoulder.  I would like to be exempted but how do you go about this as I have no medical records to back up my claim.  I didn't sue and thought the injury would eventually heal.  I feel I'll be forced to get this shot. Airlines probably wouldn't let me fly domestically much less internationally.  Restaurants might bar me from entry.  Employers aren't ""mandating"" the shot but will provide incentives to get a shot and punish those who don't by barring therefrom certain company functions.

But the investors don’t seem to appreciate that McConnell will also block economic recovery, because he wants to ensure that Biden fails as President.  So economic recovery on Main Street will be slow even after COVID has been defeated.

When I lost my job coincided with Bernie Sanders run for the presidency in 2016. It was the intersection of my loss of income combined with his thoughts on the haves and have nots that allowed me to see and understand his vision as truth.

Bernie Sanders thoughts are well ahead of our society’s ability to understand. It’s time to wise up least we unravel  as a nation (happening now)."

As this is about global warming/climate change, also regularly poll policy makers there and here as to whether they have read and understand the IPCC Reports for Po;icy Makers.  It matters, as we have a whole political party here that has been bought off (climate change deniers) by the fossil fuel industry and Petro-States like Russia and Saudi Arabia.

When the Fed lowered the Fed Funds rate from 1% to zero on March 15, it was a shock to the markets.  That move stopped the stock market collapse that seemed to by occurring.

The lower interest rates meant that people who invested in 10-year treasuries would get negative real yield.

That means that such investors lose money to inflation when they invest in such treasuries.

Many investors in bonds, typically old folks who use the markets to fund their retirement, looked at this negative yield and concluded it would be better to invest in high-dividend income stocks, utilities, telephone companies, tobacco companies, REIT's which invest in real estate and so forth.

But the COVID recession was genuine.  The economy was indeed slowing down.  So many of those who invested in income stocks saw their dividends cut, and with the dividend cuts came lower values for income stocks.  Many of those have seen their portfolios come out about even for the year.

Growth stocks on the other hand typically have no profits now, but promises of high profits a decade from now.  Of course, these stocks are more speculative.

It is these speculative stock like Tesla which have exploded in value.

So the result is:  If you're a gambler and invest for fun, you probably made lots of money.

So, when the overall economy is not expanding, when so many of the normal paths for both business and personal money are closed or curtailed because of Covid, where is the existing money going to go? It doesn’t disappear. Not much is socked into cookie jars or hidden in the freezer in case of fire.

But there are a number of factors pumping the market up right now that, so far, show no signs of abating:

(1) Low inflation means that money supply continues to bloat as the federal debt bloats (its just money printing by another name).  Since the wealth of America is concentrated in a smaller and smaller percentage of Americans, much of it winds up flowing into stock and debt markets.  All that stimulus and debt spending just winds up in the hands of the rich a few months later.

(2) Low yields.  Higher risk, higher reward... but low interest rates cause investors to shift into higher risk assets in order to chase higher yields.  The stock market and higher-risk debt markets (junk bonds and prefereds) live on the riskier side of this universe.  The money basically has nowhere else to go, so it flows into these markets.

The equation won't change until something breaks.  And break it will... in one way or another.  But predicting the 'what' and the 'when' is impossible.   One thing for sure, though, you can't goose things forever.  The more we let the distortions build, the harder the fall will be when it happens.

The concentration of wealth is probably the single most dangerous trend, but the average American never seems to actually vote for tax fairness (or even understand what it means).

I'm no Warren Buffett but I'd maintain current investments (Buffett also once said ""Our favorite holding period is forever""), decrease new allocations, raise cash, and then use savings to buy if the market drops or use as an emergency fund if necessary. 

If there's no major drop, your preexisting investment and regular smaller allocations continue to do well and you have cash on hand to help ride out inevitable future storms -- or donate to charities. 

Buffett, who recently donated $37 billion to charity, made some recent purchases but is still sitting on a ton of cash. I wonder why? . . ."

Every transaction includes a buyer and seller.  If you're willing to purchase a stock with a  P/E over 1200, you should know that you're taking a huge risk. Is this a risk that is rational to take? If you run a 10 billion fund it is big, but, thanks to RH, if you're getting a fraction, why not cause am I not risking hat much, am I? Risk a lot, but some have already scored over 500%! The old market models can't grasp what's been happening in the market right now, so small investors are the ones making big bucks percentage wise. The downside is i. they don't know when to leave the table and unless you sell your gains are 'unrealized' and ii. once it begins to go down, as it inevitably will, small investors will panic sell, and make the situation worse."

These are true words. Stock prices today are anticipating renewed and growing profits in some imminent rebound of economic activity. That is, if they are being rationalized by anything at all.

The reality is that we have not yet seen the economic impact of the now widespread pandemic on corporate profits in the 4th quarter. With infections still spreading and many hospitals at or approaching capacity we are certain to see increasing economic impacts well into 2021. Deaths, evictions, foreclosures, and business failures are likely to be leading headlines for the next six months.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (wearing masks, physical distancing, staying home) can greatly reduce the economic impact of the pandemic, just like it always could have if implemented here. That only works if nearly everyone participates though.

Here in the US we chose happy-talk and ignoring the facts of both the economy and the disease. 2021, especially if governmental gridlock continues, will prove to be a very difficult year for both people and markets in the US.

Forward to the present

Yield on the 10 year T-Bill , Dec 24,  0.94%

That is the present yield of the 10 year T Bill is  1/6th (one sixth) of what it was during the Dot Com boom

This has two consequences

1.  Safe alternative investments are blocked to investors
     Adjusted for inflation the real yield is -1.03%

2.  The unprecedented amounts of money that the  Federal
Reserve created, wound up mostly in the hands of the rich, i.e the investor class.   Far more money than in 1998 is chasing stocks .

When people say that extreme stock market valuations are “justified” by interest rates, what they’re actually saying is that it’s “reasonable” for investors to price the stock market for long-term returns of nearly zero, because bonds are also priced for long-term returns of nearly zero. I know that’s not what you hear, but it’s precisely what’s being said.

My sense is that passive investors will end up holding the bag here. Every security that is issued has to be held by someone, at every moment in time, until that security is retired. Every dollar that comes “into” the market in the hands of a buyer gets taken out an instant later in the hands of a seller. It’s impossible, in aggregate, for investors to “get out” of the market.

Rising interest rates will render the deficit an expanding problem, and If policies are put in place to reduce the deficit, that'll also hit stock prices too.

Worse, those suffering the most are made to endure oblivious, mean-spirited, fantasy-based lectures about wise choices, drive, personal responsibility.

The point is, our economists are exposed as blathering fools.

There are two, distinct, only marginally related American economies.  The professionals are concerned, the politicians will address, the courts consider legitimate only the big, sexy, economy of government contracts, corporate intrigue, wealthy individuals.

All this while noting it is financially modest individuals who drive up to 70% of our economy, who create the most jobs, who determine the character of our communities.

All this giddy prancing about and unseemly sashaying in ungodly expensive finery while as many as a third of our people are chronically hungry or, literally, starving.

The rumor was that the Convid-19 relief package passed by both chambers was a slam dunk, and that Donald Trump would sign it in a heartbeat.  The news is that he won't sign the bill, period.  The trailing PE ratio ranges from 30 for the Dow to 39 for the Nasdaq.  The Case/Shiller PE ratio is in the range of 35.  All PE ratios are twice the historical mean of around 15.

The annual borrowing that the federal government does, the deficit, has been larger than our GDP has grown, year over year,  in 10 out of the past 11 years.  This is deficit spending expressed as a percentage of GDP.  All government spending is captured in GDP calculations, either directly or via the consumer spending component (for transfer payments).  Adjust the GDP just for the part of the deficit that exceeds YOY GDP growth and there simply is no growth.  There is debt.

Then we have monetization of that debt.  The Federal Reserve is buying government debt at a current rate of $80 billion treasury and $40 billion agency (mortgage) debt per month or about $1.5 trillion a year.  This is not market demand it's demand created by increasing the monetary base.  

This would be inflationary in a world where economies were functioning but IMO we're living in a world where economies are dead.  They function solely with the assistance of central bank monetary base creation.

Ask yourself:  With all this stimulus how can it be that inflation isn't happening? At least not inflation as we measure it.  The answer?  Because the economy is flat on it's back.

At the same time, real wages haven’t grown at all if it hasn’t decreased, but we are to believe taking on a large amount of debt is a reasonable “investment.” Any attempts to try to avoid being a debt donkey for life by saving are pretty much thwarted because interests rates on savings are nearly zero.

2020-12-27 02:53:28,"Let me rephrase your post.

Seniors and some other people are financing the monetary and fiscal policimakers's partiality for the market.

A transfer of wealth from the neediest to the richest and the youngest,who are still willing to gamble, if they have any means to do so, has been happening for over two decades.

Zero rates may be cheap money to some but expensive money to the rest of us who worked so hard to save and never expected anything more than a modest interest rate and have found for the last 25 yrs that the Fed has mismanaged the economy so badly that our money is worth nothing. That is what that means!

Alan Greenspan is one of the bookends to this debacle with his oracular pontifications of ""irrational exuberance"".

So, when we remove the pandemic from the equation and some measures taken to soften its impact, the Ivy League graduates have done a terrible job over the last couple of decades at keeping a balance in the economy and we, therefore, should view them and their schools as silverplate. ... But, if you happen to be in the top tier, those degrees from Harvard and Yale are ""solid gold"".  

Sorry that my post is not the sharp, concise and pointed one I intended but the anger I feel at this slick conniving or ""incompetence"", if you choose, sends me on a mental ramble that may still be more clear than the one we've been served up for so long."
2020-12-27 03:48:41,"Stay the course and don't let the media and investment bank experts scare you
For ""income"" stage investors, investment in a portfolio / index of ""large cap value"" equities has sustained a ""7%"" inflation adjusted income withdrawal, accompanied by terminal portfolio growth, over seventy one ""rolling"" 20 year periods since 1932. This in spite of a Depressionary episode, WW II, oil shock recessions and inflation, tech bubble and deflation, financial crisis, pandemic? Of course there were a handful of periods of portfolio ""failure"" ( portfolio fell to zero ), however a simple adjustment to the withdrawal rate ( reduce it by 50% to 3.5% ), when portfolio value fell below 90% of initial year's ""starting value"" ( as measured at the end of year ), inclusive of income withdrawal. Withdrawal rate could be restored ( back to 100% ) with movement of portfolio value back above the 90% threshold. 
This is not to say that an investor MUST take a ""7%"" income withdrawal, but demonstrates the robust ability of large cap value stocks to provide a decent income stream over a long history, versus paltry yielding Treasury securities."
2020-12-27 03:53:20,"I like stocks. I invest in stocks what I buy in the market, I. E. stock in my bank, in the tires I ride, the food I eat, the drinks I drink. But I also make sure they are solid companies whether they pay a dividend or not.  I hold these stocks for years and enjoy the math of compound interest plus dividend reinvestment plus growth (another form of capital gain). I have bought losers but for the most part have done very well by not churning my portfolio. I avoid mutuals, bonds, and annuities. Being in for the long term I prefer individual stocks that will be around for the long term as well."
2020-12-27 03:58:43,"The yields available for cash are too low, and/or the investments are too risky, since fixed income securities decline in value when yields go up, and at 0-.25% interest, that's the only place yields are going to go. The $22+ Trillion federal debt will, once economics begin to stabilize, result in a lot of inflation. We may not get to where post WWI Germany was, with wheelbarrows of virtually worthless paper currency, but equity prices will appreciate with inflation while fixed-income securities will decline in value.

Those are the two reasons for the heavy bias favoring stocks over bonds. Even TIPS have become speculative, trading at a 20+% premium.

The Federal Government should have created instruments which allowed low and moderate-income seniors to achieve some yield--perhaps 5%-- on at least $100K in cash, to allow a safe form of liquidity."

2020-12-27 05:08:33,"A few thoughts about this article (in no particular order.)

1. Markets always retrace after a big run up. Sometimes it happens sooner, other times later. This big rally will also correct.

2. I shudder at the phrase ""this time it's different."" Yet let's be clear about financial history. There are always differences and you get into trouble painting with too wide a brush.

3. While I make no pretense to know the very near-term course of markets, I think the combination of an accommodative Fed and fiscal stimulus is a powerful elixir. Add in the extra oomph from delayed spending - once Covid is in our rear-view mirror - and it suggests strengthening economic conditions and higher share prices."
2020-12-27 05:12:20,"As long as (a) the cost of borrowing remains at these extremely low levels there will continue to be (b) sustained increases in asset prices punctuated by corrections of different degrees (large if the stimulant is a pandemic and relatively small if normal profit realization sell off). 

However, point (a) transpires differently, depending on who you are. If you are looking to  become a homeowner then point (b) will erase all benefits of point (a) for you. If you are looking for income-producing assets (whether short term speculative profits or long term income such as rentals) then it would pay to invest now rather than later. 

Effectively, this reality induces a transfer of wealth from the have-less to the have-more, and the pandemic accelerated such process. 

As the above condition is part and parcel of our capitalistic system, whether or not it is right or wrong, there is little anyone or even governments can do to alter the rotation."

And yet it is in their interest to continue to try to justify the extreme valuations (like Tesla) and talk up the market (“there is room to go higher” or “I don’t think this is the top”). They all have strategies in place to sell quickly if or when they decide to get out. Since they talk to each other, these strategies are likely to be based on very similar criteria. So when the herd turns it could be a stampede (think of wildebeests). The little investor won’t see it in time and will be crushed.

Full disclosure, I am a PhD in Physics whose major hobby is macroeconomics, an extremely lucrative hobby if you get it right.  In any event, let me mention the basics.  First thing is to understand money is like water, pour it in to the system, it flows to many other places.  Second thing to understand, money is paper, and paper is transitory and  is not an 'asset' like a building, or a well run corporation, or an education.  Third thing to understand is that any creature in a modern society needs a certain, finite,  amount of money to live.  Fourth thing to understand is that, at a gut level, everyone knows what I just said is true.  If you have a real, non emotional, understanding of the implications these four thoughts, you can understand completely why what happens happens."
2020-12-27 10:27:58,"Of course, if this year has taught us anything it should be that the future is unpredictable. We never know what societal or world event will upend everything.

The S&P 500 represents proven companies who do a bit better than GDP + Inflation. The old cliche remains true:  It's time in the market, not timing the market.

Pretty much like the amount of money banks can give back to costumers exceeds by a large factor what they have immediate access to.

2020-12-27 14:46:52,"This article omits that our current fiscal policy apparently is based on modern monetary Theory (MMT).  Our federal government has a $27 trillion debt and growing.  (and this is before paying for overdue infrastructure, expanding health care for all, filling the social security and medicare spending gaps).  There is zero sign of repayment - ever.  Combined with the Fed's very loose monetary policy, we are awash in cash.  Eventually the debt will come due.  Many States are in arrears on pensions.  Student and corporate debt are also sky high.   

Climate change is not our existential threat - it's our debt. 

The stock and bond markets will not ""foresee"" the collapse caused by hyper inflation, a collapsing US dollar nor the loss of US standing in the world financial markets.    This will not end well.

Just like our government, the stock market is kicking the can down the road.  We should all be asking ourselves only one question: when will the collapse happen?  Since it's impossible to answer that, the only response is to be conservative with investments and flexible on your annual spending.  DON'T sign anything requiring long term obligation without a matching long term secure income stream.

One of the comments below by Esteban Madera has  a great quote:  ""Hope is a ladder placed against a cloud.""  Don't hope for stocks to continue to go up.  Don't hope for better interest rates on bonds.  Don't hope for the US government to become fiscally responsible."

Since the market is now being drive by cheap money and the lack of returns in low risk investments like bonds, CDs and money markets, stock market speculation is the only place to invest to get any return by default.

But it is a house of cards. Sure it may run another year but when it crashes it is going to be very very ugly. You can't have the S&P and Dow at 37 or 40 times forward earnings forever when the historic average is in the mid teens.

And politically this is very dangerous.  All of those loyal Trump supporters who saw their 401(k) and IRAs explode will get a rude awakening.

The converse is applying now. Having been thwarted at the polls, he is trying to manipulate the market to show that only Trump’s magic was good for the record Dow.

If you still blindly follow that scam of trickle down either you don’t do your homework or you rake in too much off the free ride capital gains (and especially carried interest) enjoy off the backs of those who actually pay their share of taxes (ie membership fees in the American community) not to promote the scam yourself.

What an awful, awful people we are to celebrate this, to even show such a narcissistic and flippant cartoon, as morgues and ICUs are breaking at the seems.

The title should be “how is this possible?? And what can we do to fix this so the market isn’t the parasite it appears to be”"

2020-12-27 15:40:58,"Just reading these few “Times” quotes, envisions a vacuum krytron: 

“There are reasons for investors to feel upbeat. The Electoral College voted on Dec. 14 to formalize the victory of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., bringing an end to a contentious presidential election that had weighed on markets.”  

But Biden can't even envision, let alone cure, this Disguised Global Crony Capitalist Empire. 

“Perhaps the clearest example of unbridled investor enthusiasm comes from the market for I.P.O.s. With more than 447 new share offerings and more than $165 billion raised this year, 2020 is the best year for the I.P.O. market in 21 years, according to data from Dealogic. (In 1999, 547 I.P.O.s raised roughly $167 billion in today’s dollars.)”  

The NYT notes for comparison, that:

“For companies that went public in December, shares on the first day of trading jumped roughly 87 percent, on average, as of the week that ended Dec. 18. That’s the highest since early 2000, when the tech bubble began to burst.”

But, many of these tech high-flyers, as with Facebook and Google, may be exposed as 'negative externality cost' dumpers, creating faux-profits vs. 'Positive Externality Profits'.

“Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently cited “frothy prices, greedy positioning” as the reason for huge inflows into equity market mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the past six weeks.”

ETF 'baskets' will not likely be re-filled as fast as 'food baskets' into California cars."

2020-12-29 14:52:32,"Yes. I was born in the late Spring of 1949. My father was an adventurer and amateur photographer who filled albums documenting my childhood out in the world. Yet my earliest pictures show life in a bubble with my mother and nanna - almost all in a Brooklyn studio apartment or the building's empty backyard. Families were told to keep isolated, took turns sitting outside, and still, in school there were children with withered arms or legs, the survivors of that year's polio epidemic. And later we all lined up for shots, and, oh happy day, a pink sugar cube. 

My nanna, mother, and I all went to NYC public schools. Health an hygiene were standards of the curriculum. There was a nurse on duty and hearing and vision testing was routine. This was all before Gov. Ronald Reagan and the Republicans made small government and science denial the law of the land."
2020-12-29 15:06:09,"I have a vivid memory as a child of checking the front page of the Akron Beacon Journal every day to see how many new cases of polio were listed for the past 24 hours.It was frightening to hear of classmates who had become ill and very sad to have to stay away from swimming pools and large gatherings during the long, hot summer.By the time I got to college the vaccine was being developed but not before my high school chemistry teacher died in 1954.When the Salk vaccine became available I was thrilled.I knew that the scourge of polio was over and that the children I would someday have would not live in fear of illness and becoming crippled.For me, this was a bigger event than landing on the moon!"
2020-12-29 15:08:04,"Receiving the Salk polio vaccine is one of my earliest memories.  I was just 4 years old, living in Washington DC with my military dad and family.  We were herded into a large room, I’ve always imagined it was a gymnasium or similar location.  Long lines with lots of children.  My big brother holding my hand.  And then it was over and parents could breathe a sigh of relief and let us run rampant during the summer, as children are wont (and should be able) to do.  Sixty-five years later I’m happy to wait my turn for this vaccine.  I trust science.  It may have saved my life before, I want it to save my children and grandchildren now."
2020-12-29 15:15:52,"New York City played a big part in the testing of the Salk vaccine and I was one of the 40,000 first, second and third grade school children given the vaccine or the placebo in 1954.

Each of us received a ""Polio Pioneer"" card and I still have it!"
2020-12-29 15:31:04,"I remember being in the orchestra at my junior high school.  We all loved Mr. Canfield, the music teacher.  When the polio epidemic came to Cleveland Heights, Mr. Canfield battled the disease and one of his children died. As I and my cohorts came of age after WWII we had not experienced death so closely.  I think of that time and that family when I hear people pooh pooh vaccines and mask wearing.  So glad that my (extended) family is smart and careful-and, so far, uninfected."
2020-12-29 15:46:35,"I'm 66 and remember getting the sugar cube form of the polio vaccine in first grade at age 6 in 1960 at my Catholic grammar school in Queens.  No one was against vaccinations then because people lived the devastation caused by polio and other childhood diseases (measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), and chicken pox). Vaccination has been so successful in eradicating disease that it has unfortunately led to anti-vaccination attitudes because people no longer see these diseases."
2020-12-29 15:50:16,"I was born at the end of 1948 and I grew up in Brooklyn NY -- attended the local Catholic school.  When the vaccine arrived we were lined up, through the halls, up the stairs and then once we reached the nurses -- were vaccinated by injection.  No ifs, ands or buts -- and I don't remember getting a permission slip signed.  Visions of newsreels featuring children in iron lungs were enough incentive.  Remember the film about Sister Kenney?  The oral doses for young children came later.  It was a scary time but I don't remember the schools closing."
2020-12-29 15:51:31,"I am 70. I was about 5 or 6 years old when I stood in a line two blocks long to get my polio shot. I have a relative who caught polio while pregnant. She recovered and the baby was unaffected, but she suffers greatly now from post-polio syndrome. It was a scary time."
2020-12-29 15:56:55,"My brothers and I received the vaccine at our pediatrician’s office. A few years later, I met a boy my age who was paralyzed from the neck down. He lived on a farm and caught it swimming in the farm pond. That boy lived for 79 years, married twice, became an artist who sold his work, all while paralyzed. It took a village, and a special man who loved life and managed to live it well. It wasn’t unusual to know someone with polio; I watered the lawn of a vacant home; the young wife and mother died of polio. In high school, I drove a classmate whose arms were paralyzed to and from school our junior year. She died of the effects of polio a few years later. Everyone should welcome vaccines. They save millions of lives every year."
2020-12-29 16:10:29,"In the late 1940s, we lived in the town of Manchester, Georgia just a few miles from Warm Springs where President Roosevelt periodically came for treatment for his polio and stayed at the Little White House.   We lived in fear of getting polio and frequently would be warned not to sit around in a wet bathing suit like Roosevelt did because that was why he got polio.  When I was about 8 or 9, I developed swollen glands and the doctor was called.  He came to the house as doctors did in those days and examined me.   We were all scared to death.  He palpated my swollen glands and tested my reflexes and announced, ""it's not polio.""   I still remember the palpable relief sighs coming from my parents.
Later, while I was in high school, I remember lining up with a great crowd of people in the school gym to get our sugar cube covered in pink liquid that immunized us against polio and our gratitude to Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin who developed the oral vaccine."
2020-12-29 16:16:13,"I remember receiving the polio vaccine in a pink sugar cube in a local high school.  I was so young at the time I don’t think I appreciated why I was getting it, except I remember my parents being happy and relieved.

One thing that I wish would be more widely publicized in this era of for-profit medicine and big pharma is that neither Dr. Salk nor Dr. Sabin ever filed for a patent on their life-saving vaccines. They felt that the vaccines belonged to the people."
2020-12-29 16:41:35,"I’m 78 and I have vivid memories of polio and of a number of other serious childhood illnesses that have now been pretty much eradicated because of the development of vaccines.  I find it ironic that we were so successful more recent generations have actually come to question the importance of vaccinations.  A friend, not too many years younger than I said she thought all these vaccination were depriving people’s bodies of their ability to fight off diseases on their own.  I replied that I didn’t see much historical evidence that people’s bodies had been very successful in that regard. Instead, a lot of people died or suffered life long physical disabilities.  I don’t understand the logic that would result in resisting an effective vaccine that has the slimmest chance of causing a non life threatening reaction versus relying on ones natural bodily defenses against an illness that has already killed almost 400,000 people in this country alone.  I’m lining up as soon as I’m allowed to."
2020-12-29 16:45:25,"The Salk polio vaccine came to us in the form of a sugar cube. The DPT vaccine was a shot. The TB test was scratched onto our biceps. The smallpox vaccine was shot into my arm four times. Every time we left the country, we were vaccinated against smallpox. After Katrina, we were vaccinated again for DPT. My generation (boomer) is the most vaccinated in the world. I'll never forget getting a call from my son, who asked, ""Mom, should we get our daughter vaccinated?"" And, what do you think I said?"

2020-12-29 17:07:39,"Like Lynne Seymour, I was 8 when I was shepherded by my mother through a winding line of children in a school gymnasium to receive the polio vaccine, administered by a no-nonsense nurse in the traditional white hat and starched uniform.  I knew about polio, having read about the frequent outbreaks across the country, been disappointed at the closure of the municipal pool in a hot summer, and seen the film and magazine stories of children living in iron lungs.  Later, I would take the Sabin vaccine in its pink tinged sugar cube, wondering why I had to take 2 vaccines for the same disease.

To me it is ironic that vaccines against a horrible killer disease come at ages 8 and 73 for me, bookending my life in a way that highlights the lifesaving meaning of scientific research for my generation.  I am puzzled and saddened that so many people just don't believe in the value of science.  In some way my generation has not transmitted this to them.  It is a great failure of education, for which we are responsible.  While I hope we are not judged harshly by history, I fear we will be."
2020-12-29 17:15:13,"My mother died of polio in 1950, a young mother in her thirties. I was a one-year old and my sister was two. The consequences of her passing slow-rolled across all of our lives. Later when I directed a childcare center, occasionally there would be a family choosing not to get their child vaccinated. I always took the time to talk about my experience and clarify the risks and the science behind vaccines. I, like others who have commented here, remember the elation of finally getting vaccinated—popping a sugar cube in my mouth in a gym. Even as a child the delight of that moment was worthy of remembering. The Covid vaccine should illicite a similar response. If a child could understand the importance of a vaccine, surely all adults are capable of understanding its significance."
2020-12-29 17:18:49,"I remember receiving the polio vaccine at the age of 6. I did not understand why the shot was needed, and I was afraid of having a needle stuck in me. It took three people to hold me down to get the shot. I'm still grateful that they got that vital protection into my arm."
2020-12-29 17:27:00,"Most of my older siblings received the polio vaccine from Jonas Salk himself when my family was living in Pittsburgh and Salk was working there. Unfortunately it was too late for my brother Steve, who contracted polio in 1952 and was crippled in one leg for life.  I received the Sabin vaccine in the late 1950s or early 60s, I forget the exact date."
2020-12-29 17:36:17,"When polio and other vaccines became available I was in kindergarten at a rural K-8 one room school. We lined up every time the county public health nurse in her lovely grey uniform came with a new vaccination. Gary Knowland, terrified of needles, always tried to do a runner. He made it about a quarter mile down the road once before being rounded up by his older brother.

On Memorial Day, families gathered at the cemetery to tend graves and leave flowers. Every family I knew had lost children to communicable disease. While these losses were painful, they were expected.  If you asked someone how many children they had they would tell you the number, then the names of the ones who died and the ones living.

Vaccines were embraced as the miracle they were. The sense of wonder, the relief from worry, and the greatfullness  were shared by young parents. We were all taught the process of innocculation and thus introduced to biology.

Above all was the sense of we, of community, of public health. Community is still here. It is resilient and part of our nature. It is necessary to our survival and only requires us to celebrate it, value it, for its magic to work."
2020-12-29 17:38:44,"I'm 75-years-old and I can remembers with great relief, getting a ""vaccine"" for polio in liquid form, on a sugar cube, in school. That, we didn't mind at all. I also remember one summer day right after school let out for the summer, before the vaccine, when my sister and I went in for dinner and complained about our legs being sore. My mother panicked and called the doctor. He came to our house to examine us (with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth—just saying.) He asked us what we had been doing that day with a furtive glance at my mother. We told him we were jumping rope all day. So, no, we did not have polio."
2020-12-29 17:41:02,"No trips to swimming pools. No shopping in crowded places. No Playland amusement park. Rare trips to the beach. Then my sister and brother and I were in the vaccine trials for the Salk vaccine - we were 5, 6 and 7 years old. When the vaccine was approved, my mother was walking on air. Polio was terrifying, for both parents and children. My father was a doctor, my mother a nurse.
Dr. Salk was a hero in our household."
2020-12-29 17:43:25,"I remember.  1950s. All of us first graders, lined up, watching our classmates get the shot. 
Then rode the bus home to our big dairy ranch, where the DDT sprayed the barn regularly and where, if we kids got sick, Mom sent us to the barn to get some cow penicillin. 
We made decisions based on limited knowledge and our limited access to knowledge. 
The cows were tested for brucellosis, the milk was tested for bacterial loads, the feed was adjusted for production. The veterinarian came daily. 
“Follow the science “ — current practices and assumptions must always be subject to review.  Then and now.  That’s a good thing."
2020-12-29 17:47:12,"I was six when the vaccine was rolled out. My mother did not hesitate for a second to have my brothers and I inoculated as we had a next door neighbor girl who contracted polio and had died. About 7 years ago my best friend died of cancer with complications from her post polio syndrome that had left her chronically fatigued. I fear for any long term repercussions for survivors of Covid as we have no history as to any long term or lingering effects. Dr. Fauci recently was vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, that was good enough for me and I can't wait to get my shot."
2020-12-29 17:48:31,"I remember getting the Polio shot well. I had to be 5 or 6 and the nurse pulled out a syringe that looked twice as long as the diameter of my arm. I freaked out and ran into the parking lot. I also remember the Sabin sugar cubes, which were a lot less traumatic."
2020-12-29 17:49:54,My mother had polio when she was about 6 years old which resulted in her left arm being paralyzed at a 90 degree angle.  I though nothing of it because it was always that way and it didn't hinder her from doing what others did.  This article helped me see what the atmosphere was like regarding polio and all I can say is wow.
2020-12-29 17:08:39,"I was born in 1941 in Newark, NJ and  well remember the polio epidemics and the fear of getting polio. Movie theater newsreels showed pictures of children trapped in iron lungs and that was terrifying.  Mothers thought being in a wet swimsuit might cause the disease so at the Jersey shore children were wrapped in towels as soon as they emerged from the ocean and stripped of the wet suit and put in a dry one. My cousin got polio and his mother followed a  painful physical treatment plan developed by an Australian nun, Sister Kenny, and he was able to walk again with just a slight limp. President FD Roosevelt, launched an organization in 1938 to raise money to fight the disease known as The March of Dimes.  Philip Roth's book Nemesis is a personal account of growing up in the time of polio. Jonah Salk saved us!"
2020-12-29 17:07:18,"In '64 I worked on the ""Sabin Oral Sunday"" project in NJ. It was a wonderful effort, part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs, administered by the US Public Heath Service, through state health departments and with the cooperation of medical societies and the drug company Pfizer. On three Sundays,  a month apart, about 72 % of a states population turned out to get the free pink OPV sugar cube. (you could donate a quarter if you wished, which went to to medical scholarships}. Not only did the program essentially eliminate polio in the US, but the USPHS sent many of us involved to school for a masters in public health."
2020-12-29 17:52:11,"I rarely spoke about my experience when I contracted polio at age 6￼ in 1955. I was in an iron lung for awhile and eventually through Sister Kenney treatments, gained back considerable strength. That did not, however, stop the muscle weakness from progressing to scoliosis as I grew into adolescence. I had a spinal fusion when I￼ was 16. 
My reticence to talk about my experience changed a number of years ago with the anti-vaxxer movement. I have shared my experiences with local health department staff and have spoken to Rotary Clubs as part of their campaign to eradicate polio worldwide. 
Covid19 called me back to speaking out again about polio as it brought to mind a lot of the fear and trauma of the polio epidemic. I again told about my experience with polio with the addition of my attending high school via intercom for my freshman, sophomore and part of my junior year- I was a “virtual” student in the ‘60’s. 
With knowledge of how to prevent the spread of Covid19 and vaccines now becoming available, we can save lives and ensure the health of our communities."
2020-12-29 18:00:53,"Before the polio vaccine came out, my dear mother was more scared of polio, than she was of death. When the vaccine came out, I remember how she rushed me to get vaccinated at the first opportunity, and how relieved she was afterwards. I also remember seeing little kids and some adults walking around with leg braces and crutches, and the despair in the voices of adults looking at them, and just saying :""Look, polio."""
2020-12-29 18:12:56,"The story of polio vaccine has within it an important lesson about the need for great care in vaccine development. It was only after millions of people had bee vaccinated with the Salk  vaccine that it was discovered that the monkey kidney cells grown in tissue culture to produce the virus  were contaminated with active SV-40 viruses. SV-40 is a monkey cancer virus. As it happily turned out SV-40 does not affect human cells, but the ending of this story could have been very different."
2020-12-29 18:12:58,"I was in elementary school when the polio vaccine rolled out. Los Angeles USD was efficient at administering it, and none of us questioned its efficacy. We were grateful as, classroom by classroom, we were shepherded into the school auditorium and waited in line for our shot.  We did not fear it; we welcomed it.  We all knew of someone who had contracted the disease and recovered, but was now partially paralyzed for the rest of their lives.  Trust science."
2020-12-29 17:49:37,"In this sad capitalist age, the Salk family would have a fortune of billions and trillions, and millions of people and their families would still be sick and suffering and permanently crippled, because they couldn't afford the shot."
2020-12-29 18:11:37,"I'm a 73 yo physician who has intelligent friends who are vaccine deniers.  They say they want evidence that vaccines are safe and effective.  I tell them my memories of the polio epidemic and how eager we were to get vaccinated.  I also remember having measles.  I tell them I saw children die of measles and whooping cough, most physicians now have seen neither.  Their response is ""meh"" follow by ridiculous conspiracy theories.  The rampant stupidity of today is astounding."
2020-12-29 18:17:53,I was born in 1954 and had two older brothers. I remember getting the vaccine on a sugar cube in 4 or 5 year old kindergarten at St. Mary's Episcopal School in Tampa. There were several kids I grew up with who had gotten the virus and either wore leg braces or walked with crutches or had some other lifelong debilitation. It was all very sad and I feel lucky to this day that my brothers and I were inoculated.
2020-12-29 18:25:13,One of my first memories is being carried by my dad to the local high school gymnasium where the whole family got the sugar cubes impregnated with the vaccine.  I’ll get the COVID vaccine as soon as my age cohort is allowed.
2020-12-29 18:27:18,"Our community nurses were comprised of nurses from the Victorian Order of Nurses. They, and parents who were in the medical world, taught us the value of vaccines. I remember a new kid in our class being called out to be vaccinated almost on her first day in class. Trust was imbued  in my country by a well organised and non-political health system. 

Alas, I am dumbfounded at the ""democratisation"" of facts and science in the USA, a country once thought to be exceptional but now seen around the world as being let down by its own leaders. 

Had those leaders proclaimed science from the beginning, tailoring the message as scientific knowledge grew about covid19, the world would be a safer place today and vaccine hesitancy would have been significantly reduced. 

All it takes is to follow the mantra by Dr Corey Hébert  “Wash up, mask up, separate and vaccinate”."
2020-12-29 18:40:24,"My mother had polio at age 2, fortunately a mild case. I suspect this was why she had dance lessons as a kid, and also why she hated them. When the two vaccines became available, we all got them. I clearly remember standing in line at the local Catholic high school to get the sugar cube. The Jersey shore was hit hard by polio, and people were desperate for this vaccine. 

The other mass inoculation event I was in was when I was in college, and one of the schools we sent practice teachers to had an outbreak of meningitis. Rather than take a chance, since the disease spreads easily, the college administration decided to have the entire campus vaccinated. So we all lined up in the college gym for the shot.

My husband and I are in one of the groups that probably won't get the COVID shot until late Spring, but when it becomes available, we will get it. I am baffled by the anti-vaccination people. I am not fond of shots, either, but I'd rather get stuck with a nasty sharp needle than end up in an ICU on a ventilator, or worse."
2020-12-29 18:49:40,"I was 2-1/2 in 1936 when I contracted polio.  My father carried me when I would not walk because he thought I was reacting to the birth of my younger sister.  After diagnosis I spent three months in an isolation ward with my left leg in a cast.  My only memory of that time was that the girl in the next bed was “spinach” - most likely Spanish.  Then, a brace and a series of unsuccessful surgeries until at age 11 Dr. Leo Mayer, a renown orthopedic surgeon, reshaped my foot, transplanted ligaments and gave me a more “normal” looking foot.  When after my cast was removed and I walked down the long corridor in his Park Avenue office he spoke, saying “The angels were on my side.”

All those intervening years and even beyond that miracle I was shunned as a cripple - in school by my teachers - always at the end of the line; by strangers - Hey what’s the matter cripple?  And of course by my classmates.  In high school my sister was told she was excluded from a clique because I was a cripple.  

When I got to college (Smith ‘56) the PE department segregated me, putting me into a remedial program.  The exercises enervated me and I had to get medical exemption.  Through it all, I never thought of myself as a cripple but the world did.

Polio changed my life and shattered my self confidence.  Today at 86 I’m back to wearing a brace because of post polio syndrome.

My message to all:  Get vaccinated, don’t take chances with your life or your child’s health.  I had no choice."
2020-12-29 19:33:17,"My wife was a young child and ""Polio Pioneer"" in upstate New York in the early days of Salk vaccine testing.  She received either the live vaccine (being tested at that time) or the placebo.  A short while later her father, who would be 97 were he alive now, contracted polio, was admitted to hospital care, and lived in an iron lung for a while.  He eventually recovered, returned to work, and lived to just over ninety years old. 

My guess is that my wife received the live virus.  I'm five years older than she is, and had a few different polio vaccinations, first by injection then by sugar cube.  

I'm waiting patiently for my Covid-19 vaccination, but being in Nova Scotia, which had one new case of the pandemic yesterday in the entire province, I'm pretty confident."
2020-12-29 19:41:22,"I too was a Polio Pioneer and I too have my card (and button)! I recall no swimming in pools and my mother, the WWII Army dietician who had been stationed in Germany, showing me pictures of children in iron lungs who had contracted polio. She and I talked about the importance of the vaccine. I truly didn't understand the impact of being a Polio Pioneer but I was confident that that shot would allow me back in the pool.

I recall that my inoculation was in school in Levittown NY where children abounded. There were long lines into the gym and some children were howling as the nurse inoculated them behind the white curtain. That was the first time I'd ever seen anyone react so strongly to an inoculation. I remember thinking if the child only knew he/she could swim safely that summer, the child wouldn't be crying.   Sigh, children have odd priorities."
2020-12-29 19:51:14,"My mother was born in 1915 and had polio when she was sixteen. I don't know how badly she had it, or how much she lost and regained. I was born in 1953, and I have no memories at all of her being able to move easily. (Whether it was post-polio syndrome beginning, or whether it was the beginnings of multiple sclerosis, we'll never know.) When the Salk vaccine came out, I do know my parents got me vaccinated, and when the Sabin oral vaccine came out, I got that too. Eventually, my mother developed multiple sclerosis as well, but it took years for it to be diagnosed.

Now, one of my nephews-in-law has revealed himself to be an antivaxxer, and his and my niece's teenage children are all unvaccinated. Not cool."
2020-12-29 19:51:30,"It was 1952, I was 10, the boy next door, my age, had just had his physical for school and he woke up the next day with tremendous pains and unable to move. He was rushed to the dr's and then the hospital. Yes, Polio....
His mother was a widow with 2 young sons... she became a pariah, the neighborhood avoided her and the younger son at a time when she needed support the most. 
His cousin, my best friend, lived across the street...we were not allowed contact.
All of my pets, my dog, my bunny...and all the pets in the neighborhood, had to be put down. No one knew the source.
No more swimming, Could it be transmitted by sharing the water?
 No one allowed outside...could mosquitos be the carrier?
While adults did get it...my uncle, a doctor, was one of them, it hit children the hardest.
The memories stay with you for life.
It is beyond comprehension the reaction to the present day threat, maybe a dose of reality from those of us who have seen life threatening pandemics might help? Really, is the risk to your life, and those around worth that beer at the pub or whatever else you need to do. At least this time we know how it is transmitted and can take proper precautions. Then we were living in fear of everything."
2020-12-29 21:41:49,"I contracted polio in the LA area around 1950. My dad was getting his doctorate at UCLA. My memories are of being taken from my dad while I was reaching out for him while standing upright in my crib. Then memories of ambulances, large hospital wards filled with cribs and many nightmarish memories of being alone and crying that still have the power to bring tears to my eyes now some 70 years later."
2020-12-29 21:53:57,"Thank you all for sharing your stories. I think these stories about the pre-vaccination era should be shared more widely. Many people today are ignorant about diseases like polio, diphtheria and whooping cough, spoilt by never having had to fear them. Also the knowledge that vaccination is an old principle would maybe help some people over the treshold, if they feel the COVID-vaccine is some new and unproven thing."
2020-12-29 22:20:07,"i remember.  i remember we couldn't go to the beach, we couldn't go to parties.  our parents were afraid and so were we, my brother and i.  i guess i was in 2nd grade when i got my polio vaccine my memory is that it was the sabin sugar cube.  we stood in line at school and got our vaccine then.  how times have changed.  i think that people born after the time of polio don't know how awful it was.  they think that they don't have to worry because they have gotten the vaccines that they needed as children.  but had they experienced our fear they wouldn't be so fast to declare that they won't get a covid vaccine.  heaven help them"
2020-12-29 22:20:11,"I was seven years old in 1949 and was attending a day camp during the Summer.  When word circulated that there had been a case of polio in our village, my parents immediately pulled me out of the camp.  I wasn't really old enough to understand why.

Years later, my younger sister was a ""Polio Pioneer"" and received the Salk vaccine as part of the initial rollout to check the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.

I have an acquaintance of over 50 years who is still wheelchair bound by virtue of being one of the last people to get polio.  I think of him whenever I read or hear  the ""anti-vaccine zealots"" bleating their nonsense.  Perhaps if the ""anti-vaccine zealots"" could spend a day walking in his shoes -- or rather pushing themselves about in his wheelchair -- they would realize the error of their beliefs.  But only if they were capable of empathy for others."
2020-12-29 22:38:56,"I can still remember the widespread fear of polio in the early 50's. The local public swimming pool was closed and parents were terrified that the kids would be infected, paralyzed, and crippled for life, or even die. In '55 my mother dragged us kids to the clinic where we got vaccinated, with some tears. And then a few years later we got the sugar cubes with the Sabin vaccine. The March of Dimes was one of the biggest fundraisers at the time as it was focused on polio research and raised a lot of money."
2020-12-29 22:43:23,"Born in 1953, I got the classic Salk vaccine multiple times. Later when the Sabin oral vaccine came out I got that one too. 
When the Sabin vaccine came out, it was regarded as superior because it used a live virus and had the additional benefit of even propagating from a vaccinated person to an unvaccinated person thus helping to promote herd immunity. 
Later, there was was concerns about possible negative reactions to the live Sabin virus and that seemed favor the Salk vaccine as the relatively low risk choice, given that herd immunity was already sufficient. However, now with anti-vaxers Polio is spreading again. Maybe we should reconsider that Sabin should now be the default."
2020-12-29 22:53:21,"I’m not sure why the story that FDR hid his disability is still in circulation. There were numerous newspaper accounts at the time which described his battle with polio, and his recovery became a big part of his appeal to voters during his early campaigns for public office. I mean, his wife started the March of Dimes to fund polio research for heaven’s sake! If wanted to keep his disability a secret, he sure did a lousy job.

Like most folks, he probably just avoided showing off his less appealing characteristics out of a sense of pride or vanity, and the general public seemed to go along with it out of sense of respect for him, and for everyone else they knew who dealt with the disabilities and other challenges that life has a tendency to throw at us."
2020-12-29 23:59:57,"These memories shared in the article and by the Readers are very heart rendering. I too remember lining up at the local high school to get my ""sugar cube"". I also remember going to my doctor to get my smallpox vaccine. The doc let me keep the box it came in. I just hope in 2020 we use the lessons learned from those days and can apply them to the administration of the Covid vaccine as quickly and effectively as possible. I am not feeling too confident about that at this point."
2020-12-30 00:29:04,"These comments are like being inside a time capsule - pink sugar cubes, classmates in braces, the shock of seeing same-age children in  an iron lung. My mother suffered progressive deafness likely from a variety of childhood diseases - measles, mumps, whooping cough, scarlet fever. As a military family, there was never a question about the value of vaccines. This is a new time capsule - even more deadly than the polio outbreaks. Let’s make sure it becomes a memory very quickly. Mask, distance, vaccinate - common sense and confidence in science developed over many years - it’s not that hard."
2020-12-30 00:40:08,"I was maybe 4 or 5 and not yet in school when my mother took me to my older sisters’ elementary school where the Sabin vaccine was being given.  That sugar cube was delicious, and since I didn’t understand what it’s purpose was, I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t have more."
2020-12-30 00:58:18,"Barring an exception like a history of allergic reactions, I feel it's my duty to get a vaccine that has been thoroughly vetted and tested by scientists. It's part of being in the human family. 

To refuse to be vaccinated is to be, in a small way, less human."
2020-12-30 01:22:30,"I'm a graduate of Jonas E. Salk Middle School in Levittown, NY. His sons sound rightfully proud of the great contribution their father made to the world. I will have to wait a few months  for my COVID-19 vaccination, but I am looking forward to receiving it!"
2020-12-30 01:25:35,"I still have my immunization records showing I received the Salk vaccine when I was 5, 6, and 14 months old in 1957. I have each of the three cards showing when I received the oral vaccine in March, April, and October of 1963. I still remember the sugar cubes being handed out at my high school in Coventry, RI."
2020-12-29 19:18:18,"Reading this story has me in tears. My aunt, who had polio at age 3 in 1953, is now fighting COVID-19 and pneumonia. The vaccine has been too late for her twice! 

The thing about polio that strikes me as similar to COVID-19 is how varied its effects are from person to person. The 11-year old girl who gave it to my aunt died. My aunt had it badly - while she didn't need to stay in an iron lung, polio affected her walking and she had to relearn how to walk and wear special braces. After her months and years of initial hell, she had no post-polio issues until 2 years ago, when she started having a lot of problems with her ""polio leg"" and other post-polio syndrome symptoms. My aunt's cousin (who was also 3) basically had a mild flu and then no other issues...and then got a rare form of lung cancer and passed away within months in 2015. She never smoked, but it was suspected that her cancer was linked to her having polio. Why did her post-polio syndrome cause lung cancer? She donated her body to science, so maybe it provided a clue after she passed.

Another thing in common - the great mystery behind how it really spreads. It be a relief to discover with COVID why some sites become super-spreaders and why some families are affected worse than others, as it was with polio to understand that it spread through food and water contaminated with fecal matter."
2020-12-29 20:12:27,"I was one in 1948, and the family was returning from a vacation in the Poconos to Philly where my father was doing his ophthalmological residency under Adler.  My mother felt a pain in her back; twelve hours later she was fighting for her life in an iron lung and experiencing pain like having a tooth pulled all over her body.  My 4 years older brother and I were shuffled off to her mother and sister; we didn't see her again for a year or more.  She was almost totally paralyzed: she could crawl her hands, but not lift them and move her head.  I grew up taking care of her: lifting her in and out of bed, dressing her, taking care of her bodily needs.
BUT: she was a towering flare of love and spirit, the heart of our family and beloved Molldoll of my father's heart.  You can see and read more of them here:
<a href=""http://www.sdean.net/myfamily.htm#GoneBefore"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sdean.net/myfamily.htm#GoneBefore</a>
So I grew up with the sure and certain daily knowledge of how contagion can smash a family's life like a dropped bowl of eggs....and how love and spirit can triumph.
AND: I see red at the purblind fools that think that contagion is something that is past and gone, that any restrictions of the personal freedoms is unconscionable.
Franklin: Experience is a dear school, but fools will learn at no other.  You will not like the lessoning."
2020-12-30 01:17:36,"My twin sister and I received the sugar cube in school, lined up by the nuns. A few years earlier, I had put up a battle royal against getting a Whooping cough vaccine, and wouldn’t you know it, I caught it in third grade: another girl in our building had it and I suspect we infected each other. I can still remember trying to catch my breath in the middle of the night and my mother coming to my aid. The heard immunity crowd hasn’t seemed to realize that heard immunity comes thru vaccinations, not infecting the population at large. They are silly, ignorant people; when one thinks of all the horrible scourges that have taken lives too young, medical science, though not perfect, is indeed amazing."
2020-12-30 00:08:38,"Dr. Salk did not patent his discovery/invention and made no money off the vaccine named for him. That is a scientist.
 Us kids at the time and doctors vaccinating babies were quite glad when Dr. Sabin made a polio vaccine we could give by mouth, initially on a sugar cube and soon in a squeeze tube from which we could squeeze a drop straight into the baby's mouth. 
Anti vaxx folks are mostly ignorant and respond well to education about vaccination. They have never seen the miseries of polio, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, chickenpox, mumps, much less tetanus, typhoid fever, or small pox. If my parents denied me vaccination because of THEIR belief system, I would never forgive them. Some anti vaxx people have their ignorance embedded in a belief system that must be cracked on the rock of reality, NOT granted Constitutional protection as freedom of religion or speech."
2020-12-29 19:14:45,"I remember getting the polio shot in my elementary school in Brooklyn (either PS 241 or PS 139).  It was definitely a shot though, not a sugar cube. We stood in line, one nurse swabbed your arm, a doctor gave you the injection, and a nurse put a lollipop in your mouth.  As an adult, I know this was a wonderful thing, but honestly,as a kid whose father was a doctor, I was fit to be tied that he didn’t give me the shot.  I am a teacher and when I share this story (of life in the dark ages...for them anyway) with my students they can hardly believe it."
2020-12-29 19:12:09,"It was September 1955. The Dodgers were on their way to win the series. The Salk vaccine was being given in the schools. 
I went to a Yeshiva that went from k to 8th grade. 
They had the student body waiting in the auditorium while a doctor and nurse were on the stage with a small table,alcohol lamp and a pot of boiling water. Those were the days of reusable needles and syringes
They started with the oldest students working their way through the classes. I was in first grade toward the end of the queue. 
When my turn came, I climbed the stairs and looked at the glass syringes and needles that had probably given 50 injection by that point. 
In my future I would be in selling medical equipment and supplies and had a feeling that all the needles that been used were DULL!  As the doctor approached me with the injection I turned around and ran home to hide. 
My parents got word that I had not been vaccinated, but I had an uncle that was a physician that would visit on a regular basis to see my immediate family. Always a pot of boiling water on the stove ready for him. I knew that he would be having a cup of tea(most likely) or I was in line to get an injection. My Uncle Ben gave me the vaccine and several years later when the Sabin vaccine was available I received the sugar cube with the vaccine. 
To all readers of this comment, please take the vaccine. It’s not only your life you’re protecting but mine too!"
2020-12-29 21:17:44,"I received the polio vaccine inoculation at PS 92 in Brooklyn while in kindergarten.  No fuss, no controversy.  I, too, am baffled and disappointed by resistance voiced by doubters and antivaxxers who rely on social media for their ""facts."""
2020-12-30 01:45:15,"I was born in January 1955 and as soon as she could, my mother, a polio survivor, got me vaccinated. In her later years she suffered through post polio syndrome and basically lost the use of her right arm. But she said she was going to make sure none of her children went through what she did. God bless doctors Salk and Sabin. And god bless my mother, who did not have to go through this pandemic."
2020-12-30 02:30:24,"My mom had polio when she was 9, and she talks about a whole floor of the hospital filled just with kids with polio. That was just in one small city. She was lucky and survived, and instilled such a gratitude for Salk and vaccines. The anti-vaccine movement has been painful for her to see. In my opinion, the anti-vaxxers spit in the face of all the people who didn't have the option of vaccines and didn't survive polio, measles, tetanus, and so many other diseases."
2020-12-30 02:49:06,"As a child I had both the oral vaccine on a sugar cube and the shot.  I vividly remember my parents' fears and the ban on swimming pools.  I think many anti-vaxxers are too young to remember children dying of the diseases for which there are vaccines.
When I lived in Kingston,Ontario in the 70s, there was a small polio outbreak brought from Europe by a group of anti-vaxxers(for religious reasons I think, but the virus didn't care ."
2020-12-30 03:26:00,"I think one of the reasons for vaccine denial has to do with not seeing the horror of what the diseases are.

When I was a child, my family was friends with another local family in the rural area where we lived. There was an elderly cousin who lived with them. He walked with crutches and his legs didn't really work. I asked him why once and he explained about polio. Several of his friends and one of his siblings died in the outbreak that disabled him.

Another adult friend was deaf from Measles at age 12. He told me that he was the lucky one. His mother and all three of his siblings died. 

My mother had Shingles when I was a teenager. I remember how debilitated she was and how painful it was. 

I never forgot. 

I have been challenging vaccine denial at every turn. Recently, I had the Shingles vaccine and the side effects were *awful,* but I told my friends ""still not worse than Shingles!""

People these days don't know anyone who is deaf from Measles or died. They don't know anyone who had Polio. It makes a difference."
2020-12-30 03:59:28,"The state I grew up in required smallpox and polio vaccinations for all children entering first grade.  I got both on the same visit to a pediatrician.  My father said about the polio vaccine, that it was a ""miracle"" and assured me that I really, really wanted it.  Years later, I found out his brother had had polio.  A ""mild case"" that still kept my uncle in bed for a year while the family was struggling through the Depression."
2020-12-30 03:04:25,"Dateline August 27, 1955 Millinocket, Maine
41 year old engineer on a fishing trip is carried out and rushed to Bangor's Eastern Maine General Hospital:  polio.  He could move only two fingers while breathing was maintained by an iron lung.  His wife stayed with him while his 14 year-old daughter cared for his nine year old son and six year-old daughter for two-weeks' quarantine.  He was on a rocking bed by Christmas and discharged in May with crutches and a cane which allowed him to return to work.

The Salk vaccine was administered later that year in Millinocket.  There was no question abput vaccination of that six year-old, and at 71 she is participating in a Covid-19 vaccine trial."
2020-12-30 03:55:35,"When I and my siblings received the vaccine in the mid-1950s in Peoria, Illinois, mass vaccinations were given in sugar cubes to all the children.  The families were stood in lines with all their children en masse.  There was not doubt, a dispute or a federal denial of the necessity for all to receive the vaccine.  'Everyone' was united in this effort to expunge this terrible disease.  The Republican administration at the time was a shining light.  Unlike the horrid example of the ""so-called"" shameful Republican federal response of 2020."
2020-12-30 04:19:50,"Such interesting stories from earlier epidemics, especially polio!  I am young enough to have benefited from the polio (and smallpox) vaccines (I remember those school cafeterias), but too old to have benefited from vaccines for other childhood diseases.  My sister and I went through measles, mumps (her) and rubella (me), chickenpox, and probably whooping cough.  Fortunately with no lasting side effects we were aware of.  Our kids were all vaccinated promptly on schedule!  I've also used later-in-life vaccines for pneumonia and shingles. 
    I admit to a bit of concern about the rapid development of these Covid vaccines, so don't mind waiting in line for awhile as I maintain precautions.  However, compared to the consequences for me (and others) of COVID, I will be in line when my number comes up.  
   It is really important that everyone understands that we must have accurate records of who got what vaccine, when, from what lot, etc. so that we can evaluate the effects when 300MM in the US get vaccinated vs. 15K.  Don't avoid the anti-vax conspiracies to get wrapped up in the privacy invasion conspiracies.  We just need to keep a close watch and control the data for public health use only."
2020-12-30 02:16:49,"When I was 4 or so in the early 1950's, I was in Bryn Mawr Hospital in Pennsylvania due to recurring ear problems and tonsils. My best friend in the ward was Roger, a polio victim. His legs were in castes. When all was quiet I would find a wheel chair and get Roger into it and push him up and down the hall. We'd be real quiet at the end where the maternity ward was so we would not wake the babies. When they took Roger out of the room I followed. They took into a room. I watched them cut off his castes.
   At home in Wayne, PA. there was a small stream in the Colman's yard across the street. The game was to jump over the stream and not hit the water. If you did you got polio and had to limp for the rest of the day.   
  When it was time to get our Polio SHOTS!!! mother herded her 4 screaming kids into our 1949 Ford Woody station wagon and off we went to doctor's office. Fritz Colman had his and he said it REALLY HURT!!! We were being taken to our deaths!!
   Some how we all survived the shot. Some time later news spread around the neighborhood that we HAD TO GET A BOOSTER SHOT!!! No-one knew what a booster shot was but it sounded a lot more painful than a vaccine shot. 
   But the image that really sticks with me is a picture of kids in iron lungs in Life Magazine. 
    My grandson is 4, the same age I was back then. I wonder what his memories of this time will be when he is 70."
2020-12-30 02:35:24,"In the early 1950s our parents were afraid of summers because that was when the polio virus supposedly spread the fastest. I knew kids in my grammar school classes who had had polio and lost much of the use of one leg or otherwise had neurological damage. Almost everyone I knew got the measles, mumps, and chickenpox. I had relatives who died because of those diseases.

It is disgusting to listen to the nonsense that is so readily believed by the willfully ignorant today.￼￼ It is infuriating that vulnerable people needlessly die because of this blatant irresponsibility. ￼"

2020-12-24 22:38:34,"This is a very bad time for Nancy Pelosi to indulge in political theater. Democrats control the House. This just and reasonable proposal failed in the House. Now the story is that Donald Trump sided with American workers, and Democrats failed them."
2020-12-24 22:53:09,"This action by Trump was nothing but a stunt to show he is still in charge.  If he didn't know previously that $600 was the payment amount supported by his own party, that speaks volumes of his lack of interest in doing his job the past 6 weeks.
Spending his time touting conspiracy theories, pardoning crooks,  and inviting crackpots into the White House obviously did not serve him well.  The rest of the country pays the price while once again he is off golfing."
2020-12-24 22:49:05,"I can’t believe America’s politicians are doing this to its people. An utter disgrace, particularly after the year people have had."
2020-12-24 23:03:58,"I'm seeing a silver lining here. My friends who had little idea how bills become passed and signed into law are asking questions: Why does this relief bill give money to other countries and other places that are not related to Covid, like the Kentucky race horse industry? Why do the GOP want to give only $600 directly to most Americans and the DEMS want to give more when we were told the GOP cared more about the working class? Why would the president just leave us like this? These questions, when answered, can only make voters smarter. Right?"
2020-12-24 23:00:53,"Donald Trump doesn't really want to approve any Pandemic relief for the American people, otherwise he would have approved the $600 put forth by congress.

All he wants is the attention, the focus on him, the talk about him... while he pretends to care by saying he wants $2000 for the American people. 

That is how he manages to deceive people while giving them hope for something greater, and takes away the little they have available. That is what he did with the Affordable Care Act, that is what he did with the trade war, that is what he does to his followers, and that is what he is now doing with the relief overwhelmingly agreed to by both houses of congress.

Donald Trump is just one individual compared to all the members of congress, yet he alone has decided to block the relief proposal and let Americans suffer using a flimsy excuse.

It is surprising that he remains so blind to see this kind of conduct as part of the reason his presidency is now living on Sunset lane."
2020-12-24 23:05:59,"In my humble opinion I feel like both the Democrats and the GOP were once again played by Trump. It seems one of his core strategies is to divide and conquer. Yet again this would have been a great opportunity for both parties to recognize this sick game for what it is- yet another tactic to further Trump’s self-serving agenda- at the expense of keeping so many American lives in the balance. Yet again both parties fell for it when the American people would benefit from enough people in both parties, especially the GOP or the Democrats depending upon one’s political orientation, working together versus letting the bully keep dominating the sandbox. I seriously doubt Trump cares about the well-being of the American people nor ever has."

2020-12-24 22:49:58,"This has been Trump's mo for the past 4 years. Pander to the publics fear, sink to the lowest common denominator. He only cares about how the outcome will affect him politically. If he really truly cares about the American people. He should put his $ where his mouth is. And  put up his own $ to distribute $2000 to everyone. He could use it as a tax write off. And it'll buy him a lot of votes in 2024 if he decides to run again. It's win win."
2020-12-24 23:01:35,"This reporting makes me very mad!  The whole piece seems to point to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the villain in this episode of the derailment of the CORVID19 relief package.

To quote one of Trump's most callous comments, when he was asked by a reporter on the number of deaths from the covid virus, ""It is what it is.""  But I can't help myself.  I agree with gg below that the move by Pelosi, Hoyer, et al, is pathetic, contemptible political theater, no better than Trump's version of theater.  And, if as Hoyer says, Democrats agreed to the $600 checks only because the Republicans asked for it, what did the Democrats get in return?  Hoyer doesn't say.  The evident weakness of the Democratic ""leaders"" in the House is breathtaking.  It's time for a change."

Definitely a mistake. 

Trump never honored an agreement in his life, so after 4 years you'd think Congressional Republicans, more than Democrats, knew Trump was lying about the relief package, and that any commitment he and Mnuchin made was worthless. Trump always lies and never negotiates in good faith. 

This was inevitable. Trump has been throwing nonstop fits for the last 2 months. Trump does nothing but try to overthrow the government to remain in power after losing to Joe Biden by over 7 million votes. 

Republicans know Trump refuses to even pretend to govern, forever increases the massive death toll from Covid, and wrecks the economy, yet they stick with him as he increases the suffering of Americans, burns the country to the ground, and personally enriches himself and pardons all of his criminal cohorts.

Trump is worthless; he's the worst president in American history.

Tomorrow in a gesture of good will and omnipotent power, Trump signs the bill afterall with a ""Merry Christmas to all"" flourish of his sharpie, followed by a big ""you're welcome!"" Thus gaining credit with his followers for his compassion and largesse, though having done nothing except sow chaos and fear in the hearts of millions of vulnerable Americans. That sounds familiar.

He knows that the Democrats tried to get this money for us for months and that the Republicans had to be dragged into upping their miserable $300 offer to $600.

I don’t think her agreement with the increase  meant that she was no longer on board with the original compromise bill worked out with mnunchen. One could speculate that Trump threw a wrench into the negotiated bill for relief (the details of which he was aware of) so he would look like he was in favor of a bigger relief amount than was negotiated, likely because he knew when the new administration took over they would try to do that. The result is that there will be no relief bill until after Dec if that. And it would seem that Trump is certainly to be the cause"

Given the current surge of this deadly virus and the reality that the vaccination process has just started, Americans will need much more financial aid from the federal government. Democrats want to help needy Americans by giving them enough money to survive this pandemic and restore their financial stability. It was great to hear outgoing President Trump, a Republican, agree with Democrats that the $600 stimulus payment was insufficient to meet the needs of suffering Americans. But you are likely not going to get a sufficient amount of financial aid from the federal government next year if the Republican Senators, Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler, win the upcoming Senate runoff election because the same Republican Senate majority that happily supported the $600 second stimulus payment will remain in control of the Senate.

He is apparently ready to allow critical relief for Americans to lapse. In other circumstances the 25th Amendment could be invoked. No one sees that he can gain anything but money from this behavior. His support from Republicans, independents and some Democrats has evaporated and for good. Somehow this will work out but it will stain him forever.

And it was so simple: he encouraged them in their usual meanness, and then jumped to the generous side, which happens to be the Democrats' side. And asking for more money will only please his base; indeed, here he is trying to use taxpayers' money to invest in his own political future. Pretty smart.

Georgians, millions of Americans, including Georgians, are hurting in this historic crisis, the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020. They desperately need serious financial assistance from the federal government.

I think Trump knew dang well that his GOP pals would NOT cave in and agree to what Trump proposed a few days ago.  It's as if he is playing both ends against the middle and the true losers in this entire debacle are the American people who desperately need this relief aid NOWa, if not months ago.

For crying out loud.  After months of haggling the Congress finally hammered out and passed an acceptable, if far from ideal, stimulus bill.

What Pelosi should have done is simply dare Trump to veto it.  Not take the bait of putting the already passed bill at risk.

Politics is ultimately the art of compromise.  Pelosi had achieved compromise and should have stuck with it rather than play games trying to show up the opposition.

But this way he was able to make, not only the poor, but also the Democrats and a whole lot of Republicans feel pain and shame at having been made fools of.   

A careful review of the past 4 years will show that he takes particular joy in torturing the down and out -- for example trying to block the Dreamers from being able to stay in the US and have many consideration even though they have been model workers and family people.  Why?  Just because it makes him feel powerful.  

The refusal to sign a bill he had asked for on Christmas Eve gives him some sort of sick pleasure that most people would not feel.    

I am sure this last demonstration of meanness derives from the fact that the country fired him as President.  So of course, he has to hit back even harder as he so often brags.

Pelosi blew it back in September by agreeing to a short term continuing resolution.  The only negotiating leverage that the Democrats had was prior to the election.  That was the time to stop pork barrel politics and put together a clean budget bill along with the necessary fiscal stimulus, infrastructure and COVID relief package.

It's sad that the whole country has to suffer while inept negotiators on both sides continue to exacerbate long term fiscal problems that have lead to a skyrocketing debt.  No wonder the dollar has dropped by 10% in value during the past 3 months while tens of millions of Americans suffer from food insecurity.

So what number did the oldster Democrats insist on?  No number at all - they just went along with their buddies, the Republicans.

Democrat Moderates would not insist on $1200, for example - because ""the Republicans would not go for it.""  These losers assume they'll lose before they lose.  The Democrats chose followers for leadership positions because they were entitled; ""It was their turn.""  

Now Trump says $2000.  The Democrats should have enlisted Trump months ago.  Only incompetent newbie negotiators would not have lined up allies to support their position.  

Billions at stake and these so-called Democrat leaders don't have the mental capacity to use the obvious pressure point.  These ossified oldsters lack imagination and flexibility.  They do not learn.  All they have is the same tired script from the past millennium. 

They don't care if they lose because none of this affects them directly."

Nero was a cruel individual who had his mother killed; yet despite that fact and his tyrannical rule he was favoured by Roman commoners and remained so well after his death.  Trump, like Nero, has carried out numerous heinous acts throughout his life and is now cold-bloodedly holding up aid to desperate people – yet he remains popular with far too many. He callously failed to act on the pandemic itself, and there will be a lot more suffering yet to come; this is also due to his unwillingness to do what was right. It is time for his followers to realize that he craved the Presidency not because out of an altruistic desire to do good for America or Americans, but because of what was in it for him – obvious from the very beginning.

He lost bigly.  And he just can't stand it.
And so now he's taking his ball and jacks back to Mar-a-lago and to heck with the rest of the country.

2020-12-25 03:13:23,"Over some 7 months, some 435 members of Congress had time to generate over 5000 pages of legislation, much of which will have to be further interpreted and turned into regulations.

Yet, much of it was presented to most Congressmembers at the last minute, larded with such deductions as (for just one egregious example) making tax-free for businesses those expenses which were paid for by Paycheck Protection Act money, which is already tax-free.

Congress has had time to debate the removal of Confederate statues and the renaming of military bases named after Confederate traitors to the US. Yet Congress didn't have enough time to ensure that people reeling from pandemic-related job loss and having no income would have at least some money with which to pay bills and would not get kicked out of their homes.

Congress members who recently were elected certainly had time to dial for dollars and blather to their bases, yet they couldn't put together a stimulus bill that had enough votes to override a Presidential veto.

And no, this is not a symmetric ""it's both Republicans and Democrats"". On the contrary, this is Democrats with political principles and ideals vs. Republicans who have sacrificed any beliefs they once may have had, any principles that they once may have held, to various mixtures of abject fear of and disgusting, craven syncophancy to an ignorant, illiterate, thin-skinned, vindictive President.

They should be ashamed of themselves."

Your headline makes it sound like the Democrats messed up...and they usually do...but I feel your headline should have made it more clear that Dems were trying to deliver the $2,000 payments demanded by Trump and the Republican members of Congress Rejected/Blocked the attempt.

Rather than give Rush Limbaugh and other Trump supporters the soundbite that ""Democrats Try and Fail,"" why not state what actually happened -- ""Republicans Block the Democrat's Attempt to Deliver the $2,000"" requested by Trump?

And it was not the Democrats who wanted ""to Jam $2,000 Payments Through"" ...it was Trump who issued this surprise 11th hour demand for the $2,000 payments.  If anyone is ""Jamming"" and riffing at the last minute, it is Trump.  

The Dems did what they could to deliver to the American people.   They did not ""Fail"" -- they were blocked.  They tried to deliver $600 to needy Americans and were blocked by Trump.  Then they tried to deliver $2,000 and were blocked by the Republican members of Congress.  Now, the American people get $0 -- definitely not good, but I do not believe it is fair or accurate to say that the Democrats tried and failed in this case."

This is a low state we are in -- some sort of Dante-an ring -- but the US Congress has been dysfunctional for forty years with steady net worsening.  
I thought Ronald Reagan was a horrible aberration. Who knew how really bad it could get.  
Donald Trump is loathsome, but forty years past the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the United States still does not have decent universal healthcare and still does have a wildly expensive broken system.   
I suppose I can find examples, but it is hard to recall any other nation in history -- even the Nazis -- that deliberately set out to destroy itself, although Britain sure looks suicidal.

Trump knows that the last thing McConnell wants is to trade places with Schumer and become the minority leader of the Senate. Solution- after having your Treasury Secretary negotiate a deal with the Democrats with Mnuchin announcing that checks would be going out shortly and McConnell's triumphant announcement of the deal-pull the rug out from under the deal by demanding a payout of more than 3 times the Bill's stimulus check amount, knowing the Republicans 'can't' do that after attacking the Democrats for their relief bill spending way too much money and make McConnell and Mnuchin look foolish.

The failure of a relief bill is likely to place the Georgia Senate races into more jeopardy than they were for Republicans. A pocket veto prevents an override before the Georgia Election and McConnell is very anxious to have a stimulus signed asap as time is running out. 

It is awful that so many lives and livelihoods are at stake. Otherwise, this would be fascinating political theater with two of the nastiest and morality-free people in U.S. politics going at each other's throat.

He knows the Republican   congresspersons and senators would never go for this.   Except for those two Georgia senate seats, they are already elected anyway.  Who will remember two years from now what they did after Trump made this request. We have all been trained to have short memories. 

The time to make the request was before the vote, not after it and only a couple of days before Christmas.  Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Josh Hawley made a similar request at the right time and the press ignored them.

My guess is that Trump is going to offer them a ""solution"" that is ""so easy"" - just overturn the November election, make Trump and his heirs presidents for life with broad powers not defined in that pesky ""constitution.""

Treat others the way you would want to be treated, can they ever grasp this concept?"
2020-12-25 09:37:24,"It’s incredible how out of touch Congress is.  Do they really think $600, or even $2000 is adequate for those who need it? As a family of 7 in the $90-149k range we don’t need either sum.   I’d argue the top limits need to be severely reduced and the amount being given severely increased.  How about $5000 checks for singles making 35k or less and couple making 75k or less?! Or some graduated amount that increases as your agi goes down."
2020-12-25 11:02:27,"When I was eighteen I had already had several jobs including a paper route and selling TV Guide door to door.

By then I had been exposed to American corporate values and the race for the almighty dollar.

It was clear that my own developing values which centered on helping others were considered to be in direct opposition to capitalism. Later on, some politicians taught Americans that liberal values were socialism.

Despite having a 32 year career in psychology and career counseling with disabled people, by the time I was 55 I knew that America was always going to embrace aggressive capitalism.

That’s when I decided to become an expatriate in a country that took for granted providing services like health care to all residents.

The strong acceptance of Trumpism in America may be the crowning blow to humanitarianism."
2020-12-25 07:08:53,"The Democrats wanted more and so Trump’s refusal to sign until more was offered fit with their preferences. But they are not in a my way or the highway mood, they want assistance even if it’s not all that they wanted."
2020-12-25 13:42:49,"Nancy Pelosi was once again maneuvering.  She called for unanimous consent to the $2000 checks instead of a vote, setting it up for a loss. Honestly, if you watch the manipulation and the cruelty on both sides, you realize we need either a serious third party presence in Congress or a serious influx of Independents confident in their constituents' belief in them and without allegiances to any single Party. I follow Mark Charles, who was an independent candidate for President, on social media. He is Native and brings new ways of thinking. Yesterday he suggested his strategy had he been Pelosi: publicly tell McConnel and McCarthy you do not trust Trump but if they can get their members to agree with the President, you have the votes in both the House and Senate to pass the $2000 checks. Otherwise we will agree to vote to override Trump's veto. I'm not saying that would do it, but there are approaches to problem solving that may work if you are not hobbled by conventional thought, including fearing being punished for thinking and speaking out."
2020-12-25 05:49:51,"The problem is both democrats and republicans first loaded up the bill with tons of “pork” and the amount left was the $600 going to each citizen. Money to study the succession to the Dali Lama when he passes on, money to the Palestinians, more millions to the Kennedy Center, two new museums in Washington DC, money to Afghanistan for women’s rights, hundreds of millions to the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority etc etc  and $600 to each American."

2020-12-25 14:00:42,The headline and framing of this article are misleading. The writers’ impressions are beside the point. It’s more important that readers know what actually happened before we learn that a reporter thought of it as “a bit of theater”.

Those in dire need of financial aid, due in large part to the abandonment of compassion and response to the pandemic by those listed above: Financially bankrupt. 
On this day that should be the most joyous of the year, in most of the northeast we are in a day long rainstorm. 
The sky weeps. Our white Christmas has melted into mud. 
How far we have fallen from “Yes we can!” optimism to “No you can’t!!!” pessimism.

2020-12-25 11:17:16,The blatant in your face gamesmanship involved in this theatrical stunt was guaranteed to slow down the process.  Pelosi tried to call Trump’s bluff knowing full well it would require a negative response from Trump simply because she has been unable to beat him at his own game.  Americans are suffering as a result.  And the Times has the temerity to call it a “bit of theater” feeling the need to use the qualifying word “bit”.  Call it what it is.  A theatrical stunt pure and simple.  Not a “bit” of Theater.  This undermines Biden’s down payment strategy.  She threw them both under the bus.  Time for a new leader who isn’t nursing a personal grudge.

Or, maybe I'm wrong and this is his way of punishing all Americans because not enough of them voted for him.

It is all about the show for Trump. He is grasping at any opportunity to remind people that he is still here, and can still do a lot of damage. 

Sure, he can do it by throwing toxic pardons around like confetti at a wedding, but I wonder why he wouldn't want to be perceived (he is all about perception) as a good guy.

His enablers kinda look like fools at the moment."

His continued grift of his supporters is not surprising, but sad and ruthless nevertheless.  He does not even care that they are in need.

His pipe dream of remaining in office is the delusional thinking of someone completely obsessed with himself and greedy enough to use that grift to grub money.  There is no bottom for the world's biggest loser. 

Unfortunately,  the country has to bear the brunt of his callous delusion. 

While people die,  go hungry and are afraid,  he golf's.

2020-12-25 15:29:26,"Trump's interest in the size of the relief check has nothing to do with suffering Americans. He wants his name on the check and a $600 check would make him look tawdry. For his own ego, he wants his name on a $2000 check."

He is still furious he lost the elections and Republicans didn’t side with him on his bogus claims to over turn the results. He can’t stand to loose and this is his way of punishing Americans also that didn’t re-elect him. Also, he lacks basic understanding that two separate bills were bundled together: the pandemic relief bill and the Government spending bill."
2020-12-25 14:26:51,"Put yourself into the mindset of a mob-boss who is cornered and threatened with extinction. What do you do to come out on top? You leverage whatever power you have to hold those who can help you over a barrel until they cave and play your game. This is obviously what's going on now. Trump wants the Republicans in Congress to over-turn the Electoral College vote on January 6th. They aren't biting. So he sticks it to them by refusing to sign their legislation, knowing they won't agree to $2000 even though that is most likely what's needed. The Republicans either play his game or face the opprobrium of the voting public. This is a deadly battle for survival in which the national interest calls for the GOP to pass the $2000 but not budge on the Electoral College issue; let us see whether in their infinite calumny they will do the reverse."

Selling cars or they are getting repossessed. 
Needed prescriptions are not getting filled. 
Insurance policies are not being paid and kids are being told no about everything. 
Poverty has followed the virus, sinking into neighborhoods and wrecking lives as jobs are lost. 
Trump and the GOP congress simply don't get it. 
Have they not seen the endless lines of cars for food? Do they think people would be there if there was any other solution? 
This is the visible proof of real need.

2020-12-25 15:10:03,"This analysis from Jacobin was correct I’m afraid.  Pelosi didn’t really want the $2k for struggling Americans.

“Pelosi’s statement of support includes a bit of a hedge. She says she wants to bring it up by unanimous consent — a process that gives any single member of the House the ability to raise an objection and block it. That could let her pretend she tried to force a vote, but was thwarted by a Republican dissenter. But she is House speaker — there are ways for her to truly force a vote.

As the American Prospect’s David Dayen notes, Pelosi could, for instance, do it under a separate process of suspending the rules which would mean that to stop it, “140 Republicans have to buck Trump and deny a cash lump-sum payout to the American people.”"
2020-12-25 13:31:20,"This offer by Trump of $2,000 would make Machiavelli proud.  By offering more at the last minute, Trump appears as the white knight riding fearlessly to the aid of his base while he simultaneously accomplishes his hidden agenda - weakening the Republican establishment.  If the Republicans lose the forthcoming Georgian Senatorial elections then Trump will quickly become the unchallenged leader of the Republican party as McConnell would no longer control the Senate; whereas, if the Republicans win these forthcoming close elections then Trump can still claim that it was his extra $1400 that made the difference.  Either way, Trump cynically remains a major force in American politics in his forthcoming interregnum until 2024. Machiavelli would have applauded Trump for this clever manipulation and much of America will undoubtedly buy in too."

2020-12-25 14:38:42,"Nancy Pelosi decided to call Trump’s bluff and support his request for $2000 stimulus payments. It was good optics for the Democrats because they showed the American people that they want to pay them more, while they created division between Trump and his Republican allies.

But Pelosi, like everyone else, knew that Trump was just grandstanding. In insisting on $2000 stimulus checks at the last minute, Trump was just drawing attention to himself four weeks before he fades away.

So Pelosi made a token gesture to a token request. Well done. The optics favor the Democrats by exposing the indifference of the Republicans."

Second, Trump demanding $2000 payments for everyone, including people who haven’t been adversely impacted, makes no sense and is fiscally dumb; only people impacted should receive $2000. 

Trump’s last minute $2K demand reminds me of a scenario where your friend pretends that they were going to pick up the restaurant tab only after you’ve already paid the bill.

I have read countless comments in these pages from Republicans who deny covid has anything to do with unemployment, and that the unemployed are just lazy bums who want the government to support them. I have also read lots of comments from people who claim that they don't need any stimulus money and will just stick it in a savings account, because their 401Ks are doing so well. Let's face it-- the majority of Trump supporters don't want any money from the government and they think Trump is right no matter what he does. Some Trump supporters will starve before they ever admit he could be wrong. His meddling in this bill at the final hour is something Trump Republicans expect and admire.

“Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophetic utterances. Test everything; retain what is good. Refrain from every kind of evil.""  1 Thessalonians 5:19-22

As a Christmas present to all legislators consider a rule that gives each legislator the right to schedule a digital vote on up to three bills with at lest some bipartisan sponsorship each term. Call it ""Three Wishes"".

The current top-down structure where all votes are scheduled by the leadership keeps legislators in line and polite in the hope that they might accomplish something more important than renaming a local post office. The current law writing system is outdated and unable to keep up with the complexity of society.

Digital comments and exhibits might be accepted beginning one week in advance of the vote with no need to take up precious live floor time. Even the public and lobbyists should be able to post public comments in a legislative database. Voters and the news media would be able to judge individual legislators by the three bills they sponsor, the bipartisan support they get, when they schedule the bill for a vote, and the comments received before the vote. 

The new Congress will vote on their leaders in a couple of weeks. The legislators need to demand Three Wishes and President Biden should support the change."
2020-12-25 15:56:38,"All the wholly unrelated pork in that bill that has nothing to do with relief for the American people is just shocking.  For Pakistan it has $15,000,000 for democracy programs and  $10,000,000 for gender programs. Yes. $10 million. For gender programs. In Pakistan. The bill also creates a Women's History Museum and an American Latino Museum as part of the Smithsonian, overall $1 billion for the Smithsonian. And on and on. And this is “emergency relief” for the American
People?   Imagine if it weren’t an emergency.  

A mere $600 in relief for Americans, which in most cases will not even cover a month’s rent. 

This is the reason so many Americans are thoroughly disgusted with politicians on both sides of the isle.  We can howl and blame Trump all we want, but this sort of spending nonsense is the reason around 75 million Americans voted for Trump in the first place. I am for Congressional term limits, but there is no guarantee newly-elected legislators will be any better than the ones we toss out."
2020-12-25 15:57:27,the only thing missing from Trumps most recent tantrum is an explicit  indication that he will not veto IF  the Republicans vow loyalty and willingness to overturn the election  when Congress convenues on 1/6 to  ratify the Electoral College results .Motive is  as clear as day....

It is in support of educational and economic gains for Pakistani women, almost at the bottom of all countries in the world. The fastest way to lift a country’s quality of life is to improve the condition of its women. The fastest way to change minds about the US is for them to see us helping improve their lives in a fundamental way. Russia and China are getting involved in Pakistan in very big ways. This program was requested by the Trump administration, which he would know if he ever attended his briefings, or read, just a little."
2020-12-25 16:39:12,"Astoundingly, Trump called for $2,000 in relief money be given to Americans, a significant amount over what his own Party agreed to. And it’s to ask why this sudden burst of generosity on the part of Trump that’s so out of character? It’s really a no brainer. Trump proposed this to make himself look good. He’s now advertising himself as the humanitarian President, the one and ONLY ONE who cares about the American people. Americans better not be fooled by this con man tactic. This is strictly a political move, a combative element calculated to inject further dissension in Congress. And what’s Trump done in the midst of this but retreat to the luxury of his Florida home effectively casting him out of the battleground arena. Messaging the American people I wanted to give you more money and it’s Congress that won’t give it to you. Remember it’s ME, your President Donald Trump that’s THE man for you! Again, attempting to pull over a major deception. We all know too well by now that Trump only cares about one individual. Himself."

And the Republicans STILL didn't rise to the occasion because the way was led by Democrats. 

Yeah, Merry Christmas, Republican Scrooges. May you find a huge lump of your benefactors' coal in your Christmas stockings."
2020-12-25 17:17:46,"“Political theater”?  Jamming?  Why is this language reserved for the Democrats?  Was the President’s last-minute “request for larger checks” not theatrical?  Has his whole presidency not been theatrical?  He removed himself from the process until the eleventh hour to say that the checks weren’t enough. Was he not meeting with his Treasury Secretary all this time and kept apprised of the negotiations?  All of a sudden, he woke up and decided $600 isn’t enough.  The House majority leader did the right thing - called their bluff.  And, this too, was calculated by Trump - takes a little heat off the pardons...and whatever else."
2020-12-25 17:13:47,"Trump is playing this $2000 payment as a weapon against Senate and House Republicans, whom he feels did not stand up for him after the election.  I doubt this late play by Trump will endear him to any of his political opponents or voters who did not vote for him. It'll probably increase the number of Americans who dislike (substitute a stronger word if you like)  McConnel and Co.

If Trump looked back on Washington as he leaves he will see:

Over half of the US electorate dislikes  him.

Most of the US electorate dislikes the McConnel & Co.

Maybe 30% or so of the electorate will feel Trump won re-election.

A large portion of the electorate will dislike the bills that were passed by the Congress and Senate because of all the so-called pork they supposedly contained.   Their disdain for the two Houses has been increased. 

The emergence of at least two vocal camps emerging in the COVID-19 vaccination effort.  One is shouting don't take the vaccine, it's too dangerous and we're afraid of it.  The other is shouting: look, folks in power are getting it first!

Increasing polarization of social media platforms with insults even  being hurled at folks on one platform for using one of the other platforms.

Not all of these issues are directly caused by Trump's actions.    But man, is this a mess."

2020-12-25 16:50:00,It’s amazing that so many members of Congress are millionaires who probably lose $600 in pocket change each year or through buying useless stuff are sitting around arguing whether to give a helping hand to do many individuals and families who are essentially in the worst socio-economic crises since the 1930s. And things are still aiming for getting worse before they get better.
2020-12-25 17:05:15,"Some people need to be reminded that from the get-go the Democrats, especially in the House, wanted more payments to the American people.  But the Republicans, most especially in the Senate, would not budge.  After all, why help those victimized the most by this pandemic?  The GOP's ever-present goal is to line the pockets of their already wealthy donors.  We do not count.  In a way, we are lucky that a stimulus bill of sorts was passed to begin with.  Yet, let us keep in mind that McConnell's decision to provide assistance to a literally ailing nation had nothing to do with compassion or nobility.  Rather it was all about Georgia and holding onto two Republican seats.

And Trump?  Oh, please, he does not truly want $2000 payments given to the American people.  It is a ruse, a game, that he knows will never fly in Congress.  He must get the last word in to manifest his ego-driven power.  Our suffering means nothing to him."
2020-12-25 17:12:51,"Let's be clear: The House and Senate negotiations involved Trump's Treasury Secretary.

2020-12-25 16:49:52,"Donald Trump is perfectly happy to have Americans suffer if it means the media will continue to pay attention to what he does and says. It would behoove the media to keep this in mind as he thrashed on his way out and in the coming months of the Biden Administration. Trump’s leverage over the American people will continue if the mainstream media, social media companies and congressional Republicans allow it."
2020-12-25 16:46:20,"The trouble with being a lifetime “disruptor” while also narcissist and serial liar is nobody can trust that what you’re saying or doing is honest or not. In this case, I believe Trump is just being Trump. He’s always been one of the “my house is bigger than your house” or my “fortune is larger than yours” type of guys. So my sense is this disruption is simply all about him wanting to steal the attention and “one up” both the Dems and Republicans before his shameful exit from power. It’s textbook Trump.

It's over 5,000 pages long; Members had two days to read it before voting on it. You read that right. Some members publicly stated what everyone knows: no one read more than the Executive Summary and section headings. How could they? That this accurately reflects the nature of American governance is the darkest truth, especially when we all know the devil lies in the details.  

No one disagrees we're in drastic need of government reform.  Do we enroll members of Congress in speed-reading courses (admittedly one idiotic solution)  or, much better, do we demand orderly processes that permit our representatives the time they need to represent us responsibly and with intellectual integrity."

My business doubled, which was almost impossible to deal with because my greenhouse space is limited and I couldn't have anyone come in and help. I was running out of seeds and pots and scrambled to keep up. I ended up making a few mistakes and overlooking some orders, but my customers were gracious and understanding.

It is mentally and physically exhausting but that said I am enjoying seeing patients more now than at any time in my 40 years of practice. I feel we are more helpful to patients than normal. We are seeing patients in demoralized and depressed states on top of their physical pain. Each visit is a combination of physical medicine and psychotherapy.

From the first weeks of trying to run a retail business when we couldn’t find masks or hand sanitizer to protect employees (finally I found a small convenience store who was hitting the warehouses at 4am everyday), navigating ever-changing “guidelines” from the state, dealing with massive slowdowns in freight, material scarcity due to tariffs/covid, and insane surges of demand coupled with eerie silence during the election uncertainty... it feels like I’ve aged ten years since March.

My businesses just did ok, not great, but we survived. It’s inspiring to hear about the people who were able to stay focused and hold it together enough to catch the surges at the right time.

People who are sitting safe in their apartments while others have been shipping, delivering, and dealing with the public can’t really understand what the rest of us have been going through.

republican chickens are coming home to roost.

Interesting to note, trump has turned on almost everyone. He certainly has a lot to say about his domestic ""enemies"".  He rails on his cabinet, he rails on his party. You know who he doesn't complain about? Russia. Ever. Not one time.

The $600 stimulus payment to struggling Americans in this historic coronavirus pandemic, one that has claimed the lives of over 300,000 Americans and destroyed the financial security of many more, is the biggest middle finger the elites can give the majority of Americans who inhabit the middle and lower socioeconomic classes. America desperately needs a new economy that is fueled by a more socially responsible stakeholder capitalism. The managers of our economy within the federal government must let supply-side economics go. We must eliminate all financial incentives that compromise the integrity of our politicians. Hopefully, the incoming Biden administration will see this comment and act accordingly."

Keep in mind the last set of stimulus checks cost $300B~ It was a fraction of the first stimulus bill's total cost and was twice as much. The increase in unemployment benefits was 

This proposal has its cost going up every time I read about it - from $1.9T, to 2T, and finally 2.3T in this one. The actual stimulus will likely be less than 10%~ of its total cost. It's the epitome of waste and will go down in history as a textbook definition of pork barreling in its current form.

Trump could have pushed for the $2000 checks months ago, but he was absent from the negotiations. Didn't so much as utter a peep. Now, in the eleventh hour, he pulls this. And now those who need money - even McConnell's measly $600 - might not get anything. This should also show working-class folk how little the Republicans care for them - tax cuts for the rich but a skimpy $600 check for struggling Americans. How much more proof do we need that Republicans have nothing but contempt for ""the little people""?"
2020-12-24 14:41:41,"The wedge strategy followed by Trump is designed to leave him as the sole center of power in the GOP, even if it means  the Republican senate candidates lose in Georgia and McConnell is in the minority.  Trump is not an ideologue, as should be clear by now.  He is in this for self-preservation for he and his family as they face a mountain of legal action, civil and criminal, in the future.  He is pursuing a political strategy to resist the threats that await.  Trump wants to pull together forces that will back him up, not just GOP officials, but a rock-hard base, including potentially violent supporters he has cultivated.  In this setting, the future of Republican politicians will be on the line if they oppose Trump.  And, if Trump can stall for time while he promotes social and political chaos, he hopes to sap the energy of those behind the legal threats, both federal and state, also using the vast store of money he is accumulating as a settlement slush fund when necessary.  It is too soon to see how this turns out, for Trump and for American democracy."
2020-12-24 14:52:29,"This is not a stimulus bill. At best it is a short term effort toward mitigation, not recovery.

For example, the eviction moratorium has only been extended one month. The assumption behind that is that the 25 billion allocated for rent relief will solve the problem. But it won't.

That amount averages out to about $2,500 per unemployed household. And there are at least 10 million affected families.

It also assumes that people who may have been out of work for 6-8 months are only behind one or two months in rent. The data tells a very different story.

The CARES Act added $600 to existing unemployment insurance payments. This bill cuts that in half, adding only $300.

Congress is acting as if the economy was strong before Covid and will quickly rebound with this woefully inadequate level of support.

The economy was already on the verge of a downturn before Covid. This was mainly because of the debt crisis. Every sector of the economy is over leveraged. The virus has simply pushed the economic bus over the cliff.

The Democrats at least started in the right place asking for 1.9 trillion, which would have been a real stimulus. Instead they made a deal for 900 billion, which based on their own figures is totally inadequate.

We know the GOP believes everyone should simply go back to work, even if your job no longer exists.

And some of his base will find out the hard way that there are consequences for their choices.

It didn’t have to be this way."

In addition to everything else about this mess, note that in typical dysfunctional Trump fashion he is failing to do his job. He's said he doesn't like the bill. Well, he whines about a lot of things, no surprise there. Then Don, either veto the bill, or hold your nose and sign it! Either way, Congress can then get back to work on the next step.

But to complain and then jet off to Florida to continue to pout is the worst thing he could do. But no surprise there, I guess. Twenty seven more days."
2020-12-24 15:36:40,"There is some speculation that Trump will just stay in Florida, preferring to stay there and continue not doing the job of a real  President. Shouldn't this latest round of criminal, deadly petulance finally be enough to trigger the implementation of the 25th Amendment?"
2020-12-24 15:29:45,"Perhaps instead of filing lawsuits to contest the election results, doing ""stop the steal"" rallies, golfing, Tweeting, and other non-job related activities, Trump should have rolled up his sleeves and pressed his ""party"" to provide Americans with a $20000 stimulus check.
I suspect the majority (self included) could that larger check as SW stated that ""$600 is in sufficient....""  Shameful that those who are Congressional GOPers who haven't been adversely financially affected by the pandemic can not seem to grasp this or refuse to.  And if they are ""suddenly"" concerned about the deficit, why didn't they show the same ""concern"" with the tax breaks that primarily benefited the wealthy and corporate?"
2020-12-24 15:37:34,"You know, I slept on this last night, and when I woke up, I suddenly saw the logic in President Trump's offer of $2,000 to every man, woman and child.   (Not that $2,000 in itself is such a wild offer, but to try and fly with it into the face of his own Republican party doesn't exactly smack of the clearest possible reasoning.)

The way I see it is this: everything in Trump's mind at the moment is tied up to his conviction that the Presidential election was rigged, and that he is truly destined to stay on in the White House after January 20.  Hence his belief runs something like this, ""If I offer every man, woman and child $2000, they will all  say what a nice, kind,wonderful man Mr. Trump is, and we should ignore the election and nominate him by acclaim to stay on as President!""

In other words, he is offering to buy our votes, just as the Republicans in the Senate tried to buy votes in  the Rocky Mountain states by approving legislation protecting the National Parks, and votes in the Plains States by funneling aid to farmers.

Put it that way, and it doesn't sound so unreasonable.... though it would take a lot more than $2000 to get me to believe  this election was rigged!"
2020-12-24 15:26:37,"Michael Steele is right: Republicans thought that they were safe, that their loyalty would protect them from Trump. “I alone,” Trump said at the convention in 2016, and he means exactly that. Of course he’s going to throw Republicans under the bus—they’re in his way."
2020-12-24 15:36:55,"As stingy as the Republicans are with Covid relief, you'd think the money for it was coming right from their own pockets. But, it's not. It is money from the federal treasury and it was put there by the taxpayers. It is the American peoples' money, and we now need some of it back to keep afloat. American families are hurting, but Republicans have decided we should just keep hurting. I hope voters will remember this, but I doubt they will. Republican voters are notorious for voting against their own self interest. No doubt they will continue to vote for the very same politicians that refused them help when they needed it."

Nothing more.
Of course people need the money, and by demanding more money for the “stimulus” he makes republicans look bad, while he seems kind and sympathetic to his followers.
The republicans are dead set against this and won’t change their stance and trump knows ultimately it won’t matter to him if they win on that... all he had to do was block them and in the eyes of his idiot followers, he succeeded.
This was just a demonstration of things to come for the republicans... trump intends to stay powerful and prominent long after he’s gone from office.
I hope they enjoy the fruits of their labor, they created this monster to make their game easier, now it rules them."
2020-12-24 15:43:38,"This sentence from another piece here today infuriated me (nothing unusual from this ""president,"" but he just took it up a notch, just in time for Christmas): ""He has since gone silent, leaving both parties to wonder if he really would veto long-delayed coronavirus relief that is attached to a larger bill to keep the government funded past Monday.""
This is not a GAME. That Congress needs to (finally) work out something so crucial, for so many desperate people, while having at the same time to figure out what Trump's next senseless, clueless, heartless little whim will be, in this country, is just embarrassing, among other things.
I don't believe for a moment that Trump's heart suddenly grew, Grinch-like, as he contemplated the plight of out-of-work, hungry, verge-of-homelessness people. As usual, he's just grasping for a bone of attention.
But, again, we have no time for childish games. You are, Me. Trump, the leader for the time being. Freaking act like one, just ONCE."

2020-12-24 14:40:52,"Once again I find myself trying to parse just what Trump is up to. Certainly, none of this has anything to do with stimulus or relief or whatever you want to call it; none of it has anything to do with Covid-19, or Republicans running for office in Georgia, or foreign aid. None of it has anything to do with deficits, or the border wall, or funding the Pentagon or surprise medical bills.

So what, exactly, is Trump up to? What happens if he refuses to sign this bill?

People lose their unemployment benefits, meager as they are; evictions and foreclosures escalate; 5 million people are catapulted into poverty the day after Christmas; the economy takes a serious hit; the stock markets tank; there is a whole new level of chaos introduced on top of the Covid pandemic.

And all of this takes place just before Joe Biden takes office. It's classic Trump --- if he can't be president he's going to make sure the next guy is left with the biggest possible mess to clean up. Concern for what this does to people already suffering and on the brink of disaster doesn't enter into the picture. The fact that he's now thrown the entire Republican Party into disarray matters not. Christmas? The Grinch himself couldn't have come up with a better plan.

Vengeance is mine, sayeth Trump."

If these people had an ounce of integrity they would simply tell him to sign the bills or watch as he is humiliated by an override vote.

There is way too much waste in this package. We can try and split hairs and call this an omnibus bill that includes the CARES Act but that is misleading.  When we spend $10 million in aid to Pakistan for gender programs when restaurant owners and other small businesses throughout the country are losing their businesses, we are way out of line. There are all sorts of items in the spending this year that need to be placed on hold and that funding redirected to struggling Americans.  There is no defense of this point of view by the Times. The real argument is; should the U.S. curtail some of its spending and redirect it to the American people. That's the argument this article fails to rally have. 

It's time for the U.S. to lick its own wounds first before offering some of the aid"
2020-12-24 15:46:12,"This is Trump's Christmas gift to Americans, many of them his supporters: hunger, eviction, lack of medical insurance, slowing of vaccine delivery and treatment for COVID-19, and possibly a second recession. All this while he repairs to his luxurious golf resort, untouched by the consequences of his actions. Thank you, Ebenezer Trump.

He's given all of this to us to test GOP legislators' loyalty and in revenge for not winning a second term. Because he knows that Congress will never pass $2000 in relief: that's all just ghastly theater. Petulance doesn't describe this well enough; spite does. 

Will Trump use a pocket veto to allow this bill simply to expire and require a new Congress to take it up for approval by Joe Biden late in January? That's the worrisome possibility. That outcome would spite Joe Biden and present him and the American people with a very considerable recession, also out of revenge for the election.

""Democratic leadership, who have faced criticism for accepting a $900 billion relief package with $600 direct payments after months of pushing multiple multitrillion-dollar proposals that would have set the payments to twice that amount"".

Instead, Pelosi punted until after the election because, *as she said*, she didn't want Donald Trump's name on the checks.  This guaranteed a worse deal under crunch time conditions, and that is what we got.

Otherwise, thanks to Trump, Team Blue can revel in the contradictions of the snake pit called the Republican Party.  The post-election antics, and now the moves on the two bills, indicate Trump intends to keep his alt-reality show on the road for 2024.  He has already threatened Sen. Thune.

Once someone is evicted their life becomes complicated. Once you miss food for Christmas you are not getting it back. Trump sent his team of people to negotiate and they came up with $600 as a one time payment.

2020-12-24 16:02:16,"The timing is suspicious when you take into account that the President's ire was not confined to demanding $2000 payments to the citizenry  but included an out for Republicans, a demand familiar to students of McCarthyism, to cut the puny State Department budget.  

Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (Tail Gunner Joe's spiritual heir) an unprincipled sort who signed the Republican Attorney Generals' petition to get the Supreme Court to oust a duly elected Biden administration ousted before Inauguration, grabbed on to the lifeline and blocked today's House attempt to expand the individual payments.

Curiously, the President delayed his tirade until yesterday, which made the rescue package and the major appropriations bill into which it was folded (bad idea?) sitting ducks for a pocket veto, explained in your article.  I doubt the President understood the weapon until some enabler (Stephen Miller?) explained it.  But a pocket veto would, in effect, delay any assistance until after Biden is inaugurated January 20 and prompt at least a brief government shutdown.  

The effects on a depressed economy of delaying a rescue package until after January 20 would be enormous, a spike in unemployment, mass foreclosures and evictions, a slowdown in vaccinations, firing of first responders and teachers and a general misery which could drop us to Great Depression levels.   The stock market would tank.

Meanwhile, the 116th Congress concludes the next day, on January 3.

So it seems to me that if Trump sits on this until January 2, the Congress would have to override the veto the very same day, or the bill would die...?  Would the 117th Congress would have to pass it again (assuming they would), send it to Trump for signature, wait 10 days, etc.?"

Most members of congress are paid--by us--$669 every workday, and Mitch McConnell accepts $743 from us all for one day on the job.  Let that sink in.  

And while many college students and recent graduates are still dependent on their parents (even living with them), they will not be getting a single penny of this ""relief.""  I know a single parent with two young adult kids at home (one in college remotely, the other just graduated and working his first job).  Those three adults would be getting a single $600 check.  If April's $1200 check didn't go very far for them, this paltry sum is insulting.  But ""small"" businesses are to get yet more massive forgivable loans, and tax deductions for spending them.

Just wait what will happen on January 6th with the ""wild"" demonstrations in DC he has invited all his hyper-aggressive, armed-to-the-teeth fanatic followers to. MSNBC is reporting that there is already chatter on how to smuggle weapons into the capitol city. And since anybody just showing off such weapon could be arrested on sight they will be there to be used, not just seen...

Anyway, with an army of 40+ million suicide-warriors, what does he has to fear? Not the DC police, the military won't take sides and the DHS is firmly in the grip of Dear Leader too, as witnessed during the Lafayette square mini-massacre. ""Where we go one we go all"" (QAnon motto) could make the 6th REALLY interesting!

Did I mention that the Covid-19 relief bill - and the budget - are probably toast? Rachel Maddow pointed out yesterday that a ""pocket veto"" (10 days excluding Sundays neither signing nor vetoing the bills) would end at January 4th, one day after the new Congress is sworn in. That new Congress can't override a pocket veto on a bill from the last Congress, so they have to start ""from scratch"". Also a shutdown on the 4th would be great for the start of the Second Civil War on the 6th. Trump is not that clever, this sounds like Bannon...

There is no good in any of this. The bill is too little, way too late, a sham of a bill. $600 is indeed chump change and unless you are very rich or moderate-to-very poor this bill holds not a lot for people like me - a tad over the line to receive aid and way under the line to have investments and tax shelters.

2020-12-24 16:42:59,"This is a tired old Trump play. This cannot surprise anyone.

There really needs to be some serious discussions about the deficit in general and just how catastrophic this debt is becoming. I distinctly remember when the Fed deficit passed the one trillion mark in ‘84. That milestone was a big big deal in the news. And if that wasn’t bad enough you had Reagan spouting off about the evil Russian Empire and the absurd amount of money we were throwing  at a Star Wars program to take them down. More money piled on the national debt to take out our enemy once and for all.

It’s quite possible that the Covid crisis will add ten trillion dollars to the debt and that is a catastrophic amount to burden future generations with, but it will be forgiven because we had no choice faced with such a financial catastrophe and hardship the pandemic created. (Special
Shout out to Mitch to not let us forget how vital horse racing is to the National interest. That was very thoughtful of you.)

This monstrous debt is going to absolutely kill off  the leisure time industry once and for all. Covid might have set this disaster up, but it will be the crushing debt that will smote its ruin. Future generations will have to pay for this and leisure activities will suffer. 

All I can say is it’s  a good thing Reagan broke up the Soviet Union once and for all. I hate to think what the world would be like if we had two foes to deal with at the same time and the debt we would pass on to others as a result."

Trump, of course, can pocket veto the bill and let the clock run down on any possibility of passage. He is entirely capable of doing so out of pure spite toward a nation that has spurned him personally at the ballot box.

Democrats should not abet this president in any way. Let whatever damage is done by his veto or failure to act show up in his account. Democrats can push for additional measures in good time. Now is not the time to threaten this current bill and the lives of innocent, suffering Americans with it."

I have seen death wishes before, but never to this extent. There is no rhyme reason, just the infantile rage of an over-the-hill, off the rails narcissistic sociopath rogue president - the worst person in the worst place on earth to have put him. He plays golf while Americans die and obstructs everything because he can - zero concept of what is ""right"" for Americans or anyone else.

Trump is a TRAITOR in every sense of the word. He's flailing spasmodically to avoid discovery of his unholy association with Putin - one he his supported since before the 2016 election. The Mueller investigation did not go far enough - it should have indicted Trump as the traitor he is and forced his Republican toadies to grow pines and be Americans instead off Trumplicans. Trump is doing everything he can to erase it - but why if it had to truth, which of course it did. Years of repeated lies have brainwashed his base, who read nothing and believe this grifter.

2020-12-24 17:09:29,"This is in and of itself disgusting and disheartening, on every angle the only thing I see is that trump is acting out again, demanding changes to a bill that should have been fully administered by July. The disruption he caused with a demand for a $2000 relief check, instead of the $600 that would not only begin the recovery we desperately need, but also keep unemployment programs afloat, set a moratorium on evictions and fund the government itself. This is nothing but another attack on the election results and Republicans in Congress who have acknowledged the true choice of the people, Joseph Biden, a petty and pathetic strike indeed. Joseph Biden faces an even harsher landscape than even expected if all of this carries into his first 100 days.

Trump is wielding a flailing blade against the very neediest and sickest of America whom desperately need relief. Ranting in a 4 minute video, instead of facing the nation or even the press corp, to explain and expand on his desire to ruin Christmas for millions of people and guaranteeing anything but a Happy New Year.

Mr. Michael Steele is quoted here as saying of those most in need of the money, as needing the money to put presents under the tree; they are not, they need the money to put food on their tables, buy medicine and stay in their homes in the middle of a harsh winter, gifts are the last thing on their minds!!

Merry Christmas and may God save us all!"

Keep in mind, Trump is looking down the barrel  of unpardonable law suits, with the probability of a lifetime in prison for perjury for his NYS taxes.  

His only hope is to create more chaos,  an insane distribution of federal funds to include those with family wealth who earn well over 100 grand a year.  This, while there are millions who are actually facing starvation, for whom even 2 grand won't last long. 

Pelosi and Schumer were so eager to support Trump, that they abandoned their own party members who had cobbled together this stopgap bill. 

Kamala Harris was quick with her support of Trump's ploy, while there was no public assertion of the authority of the President Elect.  Trump is on the track to create such chaos that the day Congress counts the electoral votes the first week of January could default to the 12th amendment, where a choice would be either utter chaos, or another term for President Trump."

Where was he when Democrats had been haggling for more money weeks ago? Oh, right, busy overturning an election. This very strategic and sudden concern is a show to hold up an already overdue relief bill."

Moreover, while nobody expected this but they knew his mindset, growing darker and more emboldened by the day as he tries to burn down the house he'll be leaving in four weeks.

Democrats are right to call Trump's bluff, because it not only aligns with their original numbers they know struggling Americans need, but it also highlights the cynicism and depraved indifference  of the Republican party in general.

Ordinary Americans are being held hostage by a food fight of monumental proportions, facing evictions and hunger in the richest nation on earth.  It's both tragedy and travesty at the same time."

And just now some of the R legislators are fuming at the betrayal. The only way I can understand these people is through giving up a lifetime belief that people were better and smarter on balance than otherwise. And that America was something better than most other places. Gone. Just another of the little destructions that have come from this mentally ill, morally defective sociopath.

2020-12-24 17:31:05,"What really riles Trump besides losing the election is Mitch McConnell who managed to craft a relief bill that was far more what Republicans wanted and a lot less than what Democrats had originally proposed.  Trump resents and is envious that McConnell is viewed often as the most powerful man in Washington. While Trump acts from his gut, McConnell is strategic. Trump never understood the three branches of government snd believes he should be able to operate as a unrestrained monarch. Going forward we should focus a lot more on a presudentisl candidate's mental state than their policy positions. We had strong indicators of Trump's devisnt personality but not fully aware of his unhinged mental condition. Trump we now know is a sociopath as evidenced by his total failure to feel any remorse or empathy for the hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by his utter failure to keep us safe."
2020-12-24 17:51:01,"To quote from this article,

""But given how late it is in the 116th Congress, even refusing to sign it could ensure that the bill dies with the Congress on Jan. 3 and must be taken up all over again next year.""

That's right.  Congress waited so long to act that now the Coronavirus Relief Bill will fail to be in place on January 1, when many who have lost their job due to COVID face eviction.

Did Congress not realize there was some urgency to this bill?  Why the gridlock?  Why the delay to the last moment, when Trump can scuttle the bill simply by not signing it?

The NY Times is filled with essays decrying the 545 ""children in cages"" which are a symptom of our nations broken immigration system.  We could have a partisan argument on WHY those children are in cages.  But we cannot have such an argument because the far left simply characterizes the right as consisting of bigots and racists.  Such a charge makesrational argument impossible.

Now we are treated with a worse spectacle.  As Congress dithers, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans will be put on the street as the moratorium on eviction expires.

To get away from my self-imposed COVID quarantine in the outskirts of Seattle a couple of days ago, I drove along Capitol Lake in Olympia, WA.

There in view of the State Capitol I saw our local homeless encampment.  Perhaps a couple hundred people live in tents in the rain and sometimes snow.

The dysfunction of Congress may have just made such encampments far larger."

The Democrats might add two Georgia Senators to their caucus and end SenatorMcConnell’s term as Majority Leader.Since his veo would harm the American people and especially  his most loyal base, can Trump possibly conger some personal fantasy that his veto benefits him? The operative term is “personal fantasy”.
As the authors accurately report, his veto may well ignite a civil war within the Republican Party that might well destroy it in its current historical iteration. 
So who then wins if President Trump, the Republican party architect of our current crises,  vetoes the defense bill and Covid legislation and Congress fails to over ride his veto?  The only potential victor is, the Democratic Party. That surely  is evidence of Trump’s insanity."
2020-12-24 14:27:20,I hope Trump's supporters are taking a hard look at their president as I'm sure there's a good portion of the 74 million that can use that relief money along with the rest of the country. Speaker Pelosi is calling his bluff by pushing for passage of the $2000/person stimulus check which is great as this will show the public who the Republicans really care for when they fail to pass it and the country ends up with nothing. Hopefully I'm wrong and they do pass the bill as the country needs the stimulus money as soon as possible.
2020-12-24 15:40:33,"Really obvious what’s going on, at least to this cynic. The GOP wants to give nothing. So does Trump. But it’s his own bill, cry the Dems. Yes, but who’s listening? The Republican voter base would believe that day is night and night is day if they are told to, that the sun is a hoax and the moon is part of some secret plan they have to just “trust.” They won’t know or care that the “pork” Trump is talking about is money he requested for projects he specified. Way too complicated. Trump good; Dems bad. That’s the level they’re at. 

No one is getting a check, folks."
2020-12-24 15:09:56,"Trump may not have done a lot of things right during his presidency, but I do agree with him on this point: the need to put more cash directly in the hands of the people. $600 is insufficient to pay even one month’s worth of rent at most places. $2,000 could mean the difference between eviction and homeless, being fed and starvation. We live in an ecosystem. When will the government realize that putting money in the hands of the people will not only help them survive, but will also help the communities and businesses around them? Republicans’ unwillingness to budge on this issue may mark the beginning of the end of their party."

In the next few weeks, we should expect more Trump pardons, and more disruptive surprises intended to distract from them.

I expect that Trump will resign the Presidency on Jan. 19th and announce a “Trump 2024” kickoff campaign event to compete directly with Biden’s inauguration.  

Pence will be inaugurated on Jan. 19th, and immediately announce a “full, free, and absolute pardon” of Trump for anything he might have done in his entire life prior to Jan. 19th.

How does that help the guy who works in Peoria, Il?

When it comes to giving up their special-interests, congressional Democrats and RINOs have told the American people if they don't have enough money to buy bread during this holiday season, they should eat cake."

However he was much too busy filing lawsuits, holding ""stop the steal"" rallies, Tweeting, golfing and neglecting his job to bother.  Shameful
Myself and many others could use that $2,000 at this moment.  Equally shameful is that Congress, especially the McConnell and the GOP, fail to understand how hard the impact of this virus has been on most Americans.  They have yet to feel the financial impact as so many others have felt.

Also no one can say that this new $2000 proposal is not just a disruptive figment of imagination. It certainly doesn't appear as a concerted thought out policy action. Otherwise, Steven Mnuchin would not have drawn a blank when repatedly queried about the President's position on direct payments.

My NY- based family just ended its heated debate last night when my mom decided not to attend my sister’s party and keep herself safe until getting a vaccine. It was a tough decision for her. On one hand her three sons and their wives were encouraging her not to attend our sisters party. We are not doing so because we feel it’s irresponsible to potentially expose our mother and others to COVID.  On the other hand, her two daughters and son-in-laws— the Republicans and Trump supporters of our family— have been pressuring my mom to attend a party at my sister’s house on Christmas Eve. They believe the pandemic is “exaggerated” and “overblown,” as well as a Democrat dirty trick to embarrass Trump. 

So what is an 88-year old Italian American mom supposed to do in such a situation? Well, only what wisdom would dictate. She came up with a reason we all could understand.: mom called her daughters and said she would not attend because if she happened to catch COVID she did not want her daughters to have to live thinking their party is what killed her.

The country now is at war, and the enemy is a virus that kills with impunity.  We must make sacrifices until the enemy is vanquished.

Better to miss Christmas this year, keep family members safe, and plan a mega-celebration next year.  The alternative could be planning a funeral in January."

But, it was a year that showed us how strong we are, and how loving and creative we can be. We banged pots and pans to honor doctors and nurses. We held concerts on balconies. We had drive by parties.
And we provided food for people in need. We stayed connected through technology. And many of us wore masks, not to protect ourselves, but to protect strangers in grocery stores and pharmacies.
And we were all a part of history in this crazy mixed-up year. And we will never, ever forget 2020."

We plan for the weather. We don't walk into freezing cold air with summer clothes. Our for-profit system which send us into wars also didn't let us prepare for natural events. There is no profit in preparing for public health. In fact, the sicker the public, the more profit for the private sick-care system.

Corporations stole 2020, in follow up to 2019, 2018, 2017,...

Hopefully this will open eyes to what real measures of happiness is. Our system has created a few who are running out joys, so they seek space flights, a few tens of millions for a few hours. There are also a few tens of million who can't afford education, let alone meaningful holiday joys.

Corporate greed corners society with patent and copyright monopolies has left 99.9% of this society devoid of happiness.

The virus didn't steal anything, it brought a gift, a shiny mirror that we will look into and wonder why we let greed steal society's foundation of civility, which is a prerequisite for happiness.

Our corporate greed has decimated habitats of other species. That freed the virus to come in ours and hold a mirror to our species."

At work people always got nicer during Christmas ...The period from Thanksgiving to New Years meant my various bad bosses were occupied being something other than their true selves. That was always refreshing. In the neighborhood, gift buying, wrapping, exchanging and returning marked different parts of the period. It all seemed so frantic. This year is different for sure. It's quiet, shopping is being done on line and party invitation number exactly zero. Hate to say it but it's peaceful. It must be a nice break. Pressures off.

Wise men from the East came to pay him homage and wise people should still seek him.  Sounds sappy, but THIS IS Christmas, not the commercialization that the world has come to know."

For those who are suffering due to self-isolating because we ARE in a pandemic - stay strong. It is a real thing to feel sad about the death around you - to feel sad not to see your loved ones - to feel confused that you are making sacrifices while others are doing everything and cutting back on nothing.  Stay focused on what you need to do and reflect on Jesus’ birth - no one can stop you from that.

Just to know that hundreds of thousands more will die as a result of the selfish political actions of my fellow Americans is heartbreaking.

Just to know that this tragedy could have been mitigated is heartbreaking.

My heart aches for all those that lost friends and family. 
My heart aches for all those that have lost their livelihoods.

What makes matters worse is these same moppets beliefs that their civil rights are more important than their responsibility to humanity as a whole.  

Many of us were under instructions by our NHS to stay home under the shielding programme and did to protect our health & health services are extremely angry at the utterly incompetent morons who broke the laws.  

So Christmas is now cancelled for millions. Our children and grandchildren are gobsmacked to not get to spend time with their loved ones.  Therefore we pray the anti-vax morons evident in the USA doesn’t replicate here so we have a decent chance of inoculating our country.

I have been to Rome in the underground catacombs where the skulls and bones of the millions of martyrs are still visible, at least they were in 1966, they are likely still there. Catholicism has not changed at all, it is Protestants that have changed, so much so that the pope or the ""man of sin"" as the Bible calls him in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 addressed a joint session of Congress and spoke in front of Independence Hall in 2015, using the same stand that Abraham Lincoln used to give his Gettysburg address in 1863. Our greatest president Abraham Lincoln said this about the Roman church ""I see a very dark cloud on our horizon and that dark cloud is coming from Rome."" The cloud arrived full force with COVID-19, in 2020. As for Christmas that also is an invention of the Roman church.

It sounds like some members are tired of this approach.  Both houses of Congress need to begin pressuring their leadership for the opportunity to review items and discuss them openly.  

There have been too many instances in the last few years where everything included the proverbial golden toilet seat is tossed into a last minute multi-agency appropriation bill. I mean we give businesses a loan and now they get to take the loan off of their taxes, this is totally ludicrous.  It's astonishing that members of Congress buy the argument that something like this is intended to help small businesses when time and time again the public discovers that only large, extremely wealthy businesses can take advantage of the provision.

Isn't the whole point of having a legislative chamber that it scrutinizes proposed legislation, ideally before approving it?  And doesn't scrutiny imply awareness?  Which in turn implies, well, reading it...

Now, I do understand that not everyone reads every last letter of every piece of proposed legislation, but that should only apply to very narrow topics.

Pretty much nothing happened for the entire term. Then, on the last night, at midnight, the Senate President appeared, to put two stacks of bills on the lectern. 

Pointing to one stack, he said, ""These are the bill that are going to pass.""

Pointing to the other stack, he said, ""These are the bills that are not going to pass.""

""All those in favor of the bills which are going to pass, say Aye!""

It becomes a take it or leave it proposition, something that does not serve the ideals for which the legislature was created.

Then add in the modern penchant for this absurd omnibus bills, with every plus the kitchen sink thrown in for good measure, usually at the last minute.

Congress sets its own rules, and they are the only ones who can change it. Change is desperately needed and only with the angry voices of enough Americans could that even begin to happen, though recent history, sadly, makes me feel pretty pessimistic about the chances of success."

If the gov provides money that goes on one side and 25% of it is recovered through various taxes on the other side, then the business will not spend the full amount on employee retention or any other purpose.  

Of course, these programs have the possibility of abuse and the arrow doesn't shoot that straight.  There will be instances of business abuse just as there will be people who take the monthly benefit who don't need it.

This bill did not create the giveaway to wealthy companies, PPP was the original failure. It was rolled out such that companies who didn't need it were able to get lots of free money. 

This bill rectifies a major problem with the PPP funds, some of which went to smaller businesses that needed the money desperately. Because of this change, your local pub or pizza parlor – that is barely making ends meet – won't have to pay income tax on the value of 10 weeks of payroll, which could be tens of thousands of dollars. 

There is no way to post-mortem ID the businesses that needed PPP vs the ones who didn't, and to allow the deduction for those who did need PPP. So Congress threw the struggling small businesses a lifeline. There is nothing wrong with this."

2. Testing, tracing and isolating the positives.
3. Quarantine everyone for 60-90 days. 
4. Provide for those who will need outside support for medical or other needs.

Those that specialize in deliveries to orders from home---e.g. ,  Amazon --have -prospered more than usual.  My local food store, which takes and packs orders over the phone and has its own trucks to deliver--no contact shopping---has done amazingly well and has purchased a neighboring store for expansion. (I do not begrudge them this increase in business; they are performing a needed service).  But the fact remains that this pandemic can either kill, impoverish---or enable some to become extraordinarily wealthy.  Many investors have found in the investment  world an abundance of plenty, as those corporations that  sell  products that do well in pandemics (e.g. toilet paper) do very well.  Alongside these very rich are the very poor---so many millions who lost their jobs and cannot find new ones.  This latter group should be the only ones targeted for help, and they need the large sums that the Democrats want and Mr.- Come - Lately (who seemingly just woke up) also now wants.

The proceeds of the PPP loans were required to be used for expenses that are normally deducted from revenues to arrive at taxable income.  So let's do some simple math.  A company makes $100 in revenue, obtains $10 in PPP money and has expenses of $90 ($10 of which were funded by PPP money).  If the PPP money were taxable, this company would have taxable income = $100-90+10 = $20.  Under the prior Treasury interpretation where the PPP was not taxed but the expense not deductible, the taxable income would still be $20 (100 - 80).  Congress' intent was that there should be a tax benefit otherwise why make the PPP money explicitly tax free if the same taxable income results if it were taxable. While there may be some variances for companies with more complex tax structures, the one illustrated is pretty basic."

This should reduce the ""free money"" giveaway.  Our revenue in April-June dropped by 65% and we definitely needed that last round just to keep from laying off the entire staff. Other businesses who didn't need the money and had no drop in revenue just got a handout. Hopefully restrictions are tighter this time around and businesses such as ours can get the funds needed to stay afloat (and boy do we need them-otherwise we will have to lay off most people again and operate on a highly reduced service offering.  Most businesses with any sort of overhead can't see a revenue drop of 30-40% over a year and have any hope of making money, as overhead is typically 30-50% of revenue and breaking a lease is not easy)."
2020-12-23 15:40:12,"This is a revisionist tale. The original PPP was supposed to offer this benefit, but the IRS disallowed it. It was so that companies who had no practical need for the workforce would continue to pay staff, and receive a benefit for it in the end. The original program was rushed, poorly planned, modified multiple times... but the intent was clearly to maintain payrolls and limit unemployment which would create a long term shock to the economy.

They could use the PPP money to pay their employees, while pocketing the money they would have otherwise used to pay their employees. Some of the PPP loans were legitimate and saved small business. Many others were a handout to the wealthy. It's sad to hear of some small business owners not applying for the money because they didn't have the connections or were legitimately worried about having to pay it back, while many others with strong businesses took advantage of the system, and are now sitting with an extra million dollars or two in their bank accounts."

2020-12-23 15:47:52,"If I could make one change in our American system of governance, I think it would to require that all bills (at all levels of government) be “compact”. That is, they should address a single topic and be barred from being an omnibus mish-mash of disjoint topics.

It's a Covid-9 relief bill providing Covid-19 relief to America? Then its topics must all RELATE DIRECTLY to Covid relief. Half a billion dollars in foreign aid for one particular weapons system would be ruled non-germane and excluded from the bill. Write a separate bill for that and debate it on its own merits. Further incremental tax relief for the wealthy would be ruled non-germane. Same thing: debate it on its merits instead of burying it in “must-pass” legislation.

A Covid bill probably shouldn't even get down to the minutiae of which cultural institutions get bailed out, but I can see where that would be hard to resist. So as a second guideline, I think I'd try to insist that all bills be of reasonable length. Perhaps we should simply require that all bills be read aloud in their entirety in any government chamber that is going to act on the bill. That way, if someone submits a six thousand page bill, well, the progress of that chamber will be stalled for a while. Eventually, the legislators might even get out of the habit of submitting unmitigated times of pork and boondoggles.

I think this one change would make our government much, much better than it is today."
2020-12-23 15:42:38,"It is frightening to think the Bill wasn’t reviewed. No wonder it’s really not really about helping the most needy Americans.,"
2020-12-23 15:46:35,Wow another example of how our “representatives” work for the lobbyists and have nothing to do with representing the citizens who give them their job.  This is appalling and shame on all of them. We should vote for the non-incumbents next time around.  My representatives will hear from me on this one.
2020-12-23 15:37:30,"A 5,593 page spending bill.  This was supposed to be a bill that provided assistance for struggling Americans.  Instead, it is a bill that includes a provision allowing ""businesses [to] get free money from the government, then get to deduct that largess from their taxes.""  Wrong.  Big business sought this this provision. A mere 1% of those who received money under the PPP received more than a quarter of those monies. That ""included high-priced law firms like Boies Schiller Flexner and the operator of New York’s biggest horse tracks, which received the maximum loan amount of $10 million.""  (Supportung horse racing is Mitchy's pet provision in the bill...never mind starving, homeless Americans).
Why is there anything in this bill, that both Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell and other of his Republican disciples ""came to a consensus"" on.  
We did not need 5,593 pages.  We needed probably a few hundred pages to provide disaster relief assistance, not stimulus money, to the masses of Americans who really need it to survive.  
This bill is a joke and highlights just what a greedy, power hungry lot the majority of elected officials are - both Democrats and Republicans."
2020-12-23 15:41:36,Pigs at the trough.   Where is the accountability?  There should be a publicly accessible database which provides a reconciliation of the congressional sponsors for each line item in passed legislation.
2020-12-23 15:46:26,"This never-ending mixing of legislative goals has got to stop. Lobbyists and special interest groups continue to blatantly hijack the power of Congress.

Each clearly defined goal should have its own bill.￼ Nothing more.

With simpler legislation, every member of congress should have no excuse to read and honestly debate everything they intend to pass."
2020-12-23 15:47:08,"This is what you get when money is allowed to corrupt democracy.  It's nearly impossible to get things done without giving the republican mafia their cut.  No wealthy person or corporation gives away money pro bono.  They want payback and they get it at about 10 to 1 and even 100 to 1.  

Dislodging the vice grip that money has on government will not be easy but there is one thing that will get the ball rolling.  Pay for the election campaigns with public money.  Give politicians the option of taking the pledge to accept only small donations from individuals, supplemented by sufficient funds to mount a competitive campaign.  

There are many politicians who would jump at the chance to not spend 60% of their time grubbing for donations, especially from the big money donors that expect payback.  What could they do with all that time?  Maybe they could devote that extra time to serving their constituency."
2020-12-23 15:43:48,It seems that the only agenda of the republican party is to move wealth from the middle class to the rich. They want our houses so they can rent them back to us. The democrats are only slightly better.
2020-12-23 15:40:23,"What else did you expect from America which swears by Winner-Take-All Politics?

Political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson bared the truth behind how “the very top of the economic ladder have developed and used political muscle to dramatically cut their taxes, deregulate the financial industry and keep corporate governance lax and labor unions hamstrung”.

No matter of the political divide, the inconvenient fact as pointed out by Hacker and Pierson that instead of a rising tide lifting all boats,  ""yachts are rising, but dinghies are largely staying put"" in America, and ""there is reason to suspect that the dinghies are staying put in part because the yachts are rising.""

In the story of a winner-take-all America would not have been possible but for stranglehold the top 1% has on both the political parties, clearly evidenced by the bipartisan approval of the relief legislation. 

It’s obviously not easy to undo the winner-take-all transformation of America. Even shrewd leaders will find that changing policy will be extremely complex, given the fact that the rich are highly motivated, focused, organized and entrenched in governance ladder.

The general voter's ignorance of most basic facts of government hardly helps"
2020-12-23 15:42:15,"The rich always seem to find ways to get richer. During this pandemic, the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, American billionaires’ wealth has grown by a third. Why would anybody think that McConnell would do anything to stem that tide?"
2020-12-23 15:36:46,"Of course, McConnell wants a commission.  That translates to high status jobs for his buddies who may be grateful enough to do nice things for him in return. If McConnell is truly concerned for the racing industry in Ky couldn’t he support the type of tax relief afforded to cattle & other livestock farmers?  He should support breeder incentives at Kentucky racetracks as is the practice in all other states having thoroughbred racing. Kentucky cannot compète with states such as Pennsylvania that give extra money to the winning horses bred in Pennsylvania. Casinos should be permitted at racetracks for their ability to contribute financially to horse racing. From breeding the potential racehorse to actually racing the horse is very expensive every day. Regrettably the small horse operations are being priced out of business. The many people employed are losing their jobs, a way of life, a good life."
2020-12-23 15:37:53,"AOC's remarks are on the mark. The leaders of both parties prefer it this way, keep all under wraps until the last minute.

As a Democrat I am suspicious of McConnell's intent and what he has managed to push through, one of the items having to do with horse racing.

It is equally important that we find out what Pelosi-Schumer have snuck in. Remember that these two are millionaires, used to looking after their kind of people, no matter their political affiliation.

The progressive Democrat caucus should demand that each provision is explained in a simple language so we know what these legislators who represent us have agreed to.

Yes, the information will be too late to change any outcome. But we will at least know what politicians, mine and yours, have got up to."

And it's just plain wrong to call it or part of it a Coronavirus Stimulus Bill (Covid 19 does not need a stimulus...its a Pandemic...it doesn't get any more stimulated than that!) or refer to it as a $900 Billion stimulus/package...the ONLY words that should be used and associated with Bill/Package/Legislation etc are the words Support ,Relief, Rescue or (Economic ) Mitigation. The word ""Stimulus "" is not the appropriate nor correct word to use. 

Except perhaps in regards to how it affects the Rich, Wealthy and Connected who least of all are those that need the help and support it should ideally be going to.

Rule 1. The law should only contain what is relevant to its title.
Rule 2. The law should not exceed a certain number of pages - a one hour normal read.
Rule 3: The Plain Language Act of 2010 should also apply to legislation Congress passes - so that the public can know at a glance what their elected reps voted for.

We all seem very smart in hind sight, but we must remember that in the darkest days of last spring it was very difficult to determine what the future held - for any business. I would definitely have had to lay off most of my employees and close without that government money. It turned out that my business ended up thriving during the pandemic - but that was unknowable.

And the idea that they might veto his will is outrageous. So he has set up this loyalty test. Cross him and he will wreck your career. He openly says this to them right now. (It seems extortionate to me and should be illegal.) So he has this whip to snap. See how veto-proof this is, he says. A kind of obedience exercise for the demands he means to make of them in January."

2020-12-23 16:14:50,"Now we know why McConnell and the GOP held out for so long in approving a stimulus bill: it was to ram advantages to the rich down the throats of the poor. Even Trump is appalled by this, although more for the foreign aid aspects. I agree with him that $2000 cheques are far more meaningful than $600. This is why he still has his base and the Democrats will continue to be deeply distrusted."

Many of these earners have seen in their income drop significantly or be eliminated in 2020 because of COVID. These people need a stimulus check also."

He is just trying to play Republicans against Democrats and vice versa and thereby creating chaos on his way out. While it would obviously be better for people to get $2000 in pandemic relief, rather than the measly $600 in this bill (in other countries,  governments are  paying their workers 80-100% of their salaries EVERY month, not pittances every nine months), don't think Trump actually wants to help people. He just enjoys adding to the flames and/or thinks this will help his attempt to ""overturn"" the election and stay in office.

Congress has never shown more how insulated it is from the general misery in the population.  No lessons have been learned from the surprise election of President Trump in 2016.  Like Congresswoman Ocasio Cortez, I see how Congress, up to its usual tricks, held hostage the average Joe by waiting to the last minute to give him (and her) a handout.  The amount may be meager, maybe even insulting, but it would be catastrophic if the great majority of Americans did not receive it.  Congress of course favors omnibus bills passed at the last minute precisely because they can hide all kinds of ""give-me's"" therein.  It is almost beside the point to separate the spending bill from the relief bill because Congress, I would argue, intentionally conflated the two."
2020-12-23 16:04:18,"The people who did put the provisions in the bill knew exactly what they were doing.  There is no excuse for the congresspeople not to know, they sat on the bill for months and months. The Democrats must have known the price they paid for the crumbs that are left for the millions of people in need.

A couple, making $150K per year with no change, doesn’t need $600.  Same for an individual making $75K.  Stimulus checks should be for low income and unemployed only, especially long term unemployed, and those people should be getting $4-6K to help cover rent debt and keep them housed.  Plus, the unemployment bump should be high enough to cover average rent with other basic expenses.  My wife and I have no change in income, don’t eat out because of Covid, won’t shop until vaccinated, and will probably donate the money to the local Rescue Mission.  This relief package will just increase new clients at that Rescue Mission.  What a lost opportunity."

For a very long time special interests have had their wishlists inserted into legislation unrelated to theirs.  While legislators innocently claim they don’t know what they’re voting for, but had to, they really don’t have to vote blindly.

Reps are in favor of hand outs that go exclusively to them. Otherwise not.  Democrats think the hand out should go equally to everyone (and to those who vote republican). Every democrat constituency is asking: what have you done for me lately?  There is zero sense of 'we are one country-where we are here to serve the common good, and not demand special treatment.'

The asymmetry is startling.  No one would send Hillary a penny if she said: ""I wus robbed, I need money.""  Trump has raked in $300 million with an identical appeal.  I imagine people have sent letters to Hillary asking her to fund them.

Wonder when democrats will get clued in that the moral and intellectual failings of republicans are their strengths; it attracts their constituencies.

The injustice will persist because Biden talks earnestly about bipartisanship. I can hear everyone on the right chortling over this.  He speaks of making nice with Mitch. Rs and Mitch; these sinewy street fighters with arsenal ready to stab and blow up everything, and Ds and Biden, a dainty infant giggling, begging, crying and asking for others to play nice.

Like the infant ever wins?

How I wish while describing democrats, instead of words like weak and callow, I could use words such as strong, uncompromising, and resolute."

Instead, our tax $$ is used to fund ludicrous ideas such as horse racing in Kentucky because a senator must deliver for his campaign donors. A senator is nothing more than a ""return on investment"". Corporations fund their campaigns, and corporations get to reap the spoils.

By returning the same power mad incompetents year after year, decade after decade you get the worst possible collection of people running the country. They live to get elected, not to govern. 

In corporate life and in most other social settings, calling someone a politician is one of the worst insults that you can give out. That alone should make people realize that electing ""politicians"" over and over again is a terrible idea.

You know, the one that had absolutely no oversight, and was worth more than all the $1200 checks sent out to the 300,000,000+ Americans who were actually suffering from all this, combined.

Obviously, Mitch McConnell and his fellow Republicans - all those ""representatives"" who bought up pharma stocks based their insider information while lying through their teeth to the American people about how everything was going to be ""just fine"" - feel that a $600 check is more than good enough for you, but a $500,000,000,000 check is more appropriate for self-serving career criminal Donald Trump.

2020-12-23 16:28:09,"Urgently wanting in the post-Trump legislative landscape is a word limit on legislation.

Pick a bill, any bill, and force yourself to read it cover-to-cover.  You will be shocked to find sections, and subsections, and sub-subsections unrelated to anything suggested by the bill's title. A word limit would force authors to break policy into bite-sized chunks that even voters (and their representatives) could read. It would make special-interest handouts stick out like sore thumbs - exactly why those special interests have fiercely guarded Bible-sized legislation.

Most importantly, specificities would be pared down to generalities. It would force interpretation by disinterested third parties, who would decide not only what the authors' likely purpose was, but what their purpose should have been. Those third parties, of course, are judges.

The next challenge would be choosing a number. Maybe 10,000 words, or 20,000, or another round number? I nominate a very specific number, 4,543, not because it holds any personal significance. The length of the U.S. Constitution just seems like a good container for any law that should fit inside it - measured both in words, and ideas. Doesn't it?"

This combined $2.3 trillion Covid relief and omnibus spending bill is a disgrace and the $200÷ billion tax giveaway for the rich is a crime at a time when our national debt is approaching $30 trillion.
2020-12-23 16:35:53,"The facts on PPP are that government said the funds would be tax free. Small business later learned the the expenses those funds were used for would be disallowed, in effect making the funds taxable. That's simply not fair. In the absence of the PPP, companies would have laid off staff. The PPP was inducement to keep those people off unemployment. So taxing the proceeds is essentially privatizing unemployment insurance payouts - how is that fair to struggling small business? And since the funds are also taxable to workers as income, the government is hitting its own stimulus payments with 2 taxes. Stupid and contrary to intent. To the ideological bloviators here... math is math, facts are facts, and the PPP saved my small business."

No money to large corporations (law firms, manufacturers, etc.) who have funds to pay their way. Let them suffer like the many until they deplete their coffers until they are empty. Let them feel the pain that so many small business owners (and their employees) feel.
How this system of McConnels is still how things 'work' is ludicrous. Wait until the clock is going to strike 12 and place a 5000 page document in front of the congress and ask for a vote hours later. He is the poison that infects the system politic and he wields more power than even the president.

I am ashamed of our country's 'business as usual' where only the powerful and wealthy seem to not suffer as the vast majority of the people do."

But hopefully most of those expenditures will help the machinery of business grind along, and that is the silver lining I choose to find in all this extraneous stuff.  It's the price of getting the bill passed.  Hold your nose, Trump, and sign it into law."
2020-12-23 16:37:27,"Why is anyone surprised by this end result? 

It takes two sides to negotiate this kind of monstrosity. 

McConnell did not operate in a vacuum.

They find $200 billion to further pad the gilded cage of those who do not need it, yet do not even provide the bare minimum to those who are still living in a state of chronic worry and in danger of losing their homes in the middle of a pandemic?

$25 billion in rental assistance is not nearly enough to prevent millions of evictions. 

One month extension of a ban on evictions? To what end?

What will $600 achieve? 

This reminds me of our response to the Great Recession. We bail out the banks who created the conditions, yet allow them to foreclose on millions of homes, thus worsening the crisis.

Pelosi and Schumer were well aware of these poison pills and to pretend otherwise is simply not living in the real world. 

The sickness that is Washington, DC does not begin and end with just Trump and McConnell. It permeates our entire political system.

Shame on them all!"
2020-12-23 16:43:36,"Congratulations to the NY Times staff for reading the entire 5000 pages of this bill. I wonder what's the average number of pages of any legislation passed by Congress and which ones are totally clean.  The ACA and its accompanying regulations is also about 20,000 pages, Could Congress come up with one that's only a page or two long, and If this bill is scuttled, will we end up with nothing?"
2020-12-23 16:35:59,"There's nothing new about this. That's the poison pill Republicans won't pass anything without.

Thanks for digging in and reporting it; the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

Privatizing profit and socializing loss."
2020-12-23 16:45:55,"I have never been a fan of term limits, possibly thinking that we should be free to vote for however stupidly we wish. But the mendacity of this bill and some of the bills over the decades has really changed my mind. People are dying. People are standing on food lines. The country has changed in ways that we may not even realize for years to come. The waste, the lack of preparation, and the crushing of individuals and families is staggering. And yet in the middle of this, as it has done before, Congress includes so many sweetheart deals, embedded in a tome that no one could possibly read. The shiftiness is overwhelming. Trump is doing it for the wrong reasons, but the amount given to individuals should be much higher. We only call it socialism when it helps individuals. The debt forgiveness and outright gifted to sweetheart industries is staggering."
2020-12-23 16:38:29,"I, along with every non-American who is observing the USA from afar, cannot understand the mentality that drives the members of Congress and Senate. Your constituents, the people who voted you in to the cushy job with amazing benefits in the hope that you would represent their interests, have been abandoned for months while the action needed to relieve their suffering is included in an omnibus bill that includes totally unrelated proposals. Do these politicians operate in such a pervasive miasma of corruption and self interest that they are incapable of understanding the urgent need of millions of Americans who are on the brink of starvation and homelessness. Are they unable to set aside, in this humanitarian crisis, their partisanship, their servile obedience to their lobbyists, their greed and ambition, and pass a single bill that simply addresses the greatest crisis since 9/11. If there is any upside to the Covid virus it is that it has exposed an even deadlier sickness, the stench of which pervades the the Federal government from the White House to the halls of government."
2020-12-23 16:45:42,"For the first time ever, I find myself agreeing with Trump and Cruz. The funds going to big business (which they now want to be tax deductible) are a boondoggle. $2000 is much more effective than $600. People need the money far more than businesses need tax deductible windfalls. 

Even in the depths of this pandemic, our government can’t focus on the issue and has to include pork. What a disappointment. For once, I’d love to see a bill pass that is tightly written and FOR the people."
2020-12-23 16:40:17,"No surprise here! Most of the money goes to the top 1 percent, next to pork barrel projects and the least to ordinary working folk. Most of Congress cares not for everyday Americans who are suffering and dying in huge numbers. We may be getting rid of Trump, but Congress will continue to behave like this absent a voter revolution.  As the late Walter Cronkite would end his newscast, “And that’s the way it is…”"
2020-12-23 16:41:21,"We desperately need real changes to our Republic if we expect to remain a superpower. 

I’d start with term limits for Congress as most of these so called Representatives and Senators are desperately out of touch with their constituents.  While we may lose some good people the benefit is we can limit the damage done to our Republic from the likes of McConnell, Graham, Cruz and Jordan to name a few. 

The packaging of other items not related to COVID-19 relief should have never been included but this is how Congress has operated for far too long.  

A presidential library for Teddy Roosevelt in North Dakota? Horse racing commission in Kentucky?   Seriously?  These two states, like most other red states, take more money from the federal government than they contribute. 

Perhaps a little more time in session with less campaigning and vacation time for members of Congress will allow them to actually work on individual items as opposed to the 50,000 page package deals Congress has been doing. 

This is Jack Abramoff all over again but more deadly."
2020-12-23 16:45:54,"One need not look any further than this bill to find the reason the American public has lost faith in their government. It is filled with examples of back-room deals, cronyism, special interest legislation. And all wrapped in an (relatively) inexpensive wrapping of direct payments to the people. 

Members of this entrenched Congress probably count among their blessings the lack of there being a provision for citizen initiative in our Constitution. For if there were, a citizen based law would be overwhelmingly forced upon them to openly disclose and openly debate each and every spending issue before voting on them. Then, Pandemic Aid bills could only deal with issues related to the pandemic and not horse racing or other unrelated nonsense."
2020-12-23 16:33:43,"Once again there is no stimulus money for adult dependents. These are actually people too! They require food, shelter, etc just like everyone else. I would even venture to say that it costs a lot more to provide these things to a child in college or an elderly parent than it does for an elementary aged child. Yet these dependents are virtually non-existent with regard to direct stimulus payments. I know the democrats wanted to include them in the second round of payments and am curious as to what the Republicans argument was against such action."
2020-12-23 16:54:06,"I'd like to know why this is considered a gift for the rich as the title of this article says: ""Not only should the forgiven loans not be taxed as income, but the expenditures used with those loans should be tax deductible.""

PPP  was intended primarily for small businesses who in fact need these breaks."
2020-12-23 16:54:18,"More of the same from Congress: The rich get richer, special interests get to stuff their provisions in a bill too lengthy for members of Congress or staff to read and evaluate, and the poor and struggling working class get very little. 

The tax provisions, in particular, demonstrate there is no fairness when it comes to legislating in Washington, DC these days. The rich sometimes get richer through hard work and ingenuity, but far too often they simply have Congress redo the tax code to boost their fortunes. 

If this continues, and the wealth gap in this nation continues to grow, there will be a revolt from those being left behind and disadvantaged. I, for one, wouldn't blame them."
2020-12-23 16:48:37,"Who will lobby for the middle and lower classes?

2020-12-23 16:49:22,"No surprise here with the possible exception of Trump’s last minute call out. No inclination by Trump to actually get engaged — the last place he wants to be is slogging in the mud and blood when the golf course beckons.

Make no mistake, McConnell engineered this with artless foot dragging until the very last minute.

This is strikingly emblematic of the scope and intensity of the kinds of shenanigans that bring millions of Americans to the conclusion that the game is hopelessly rigged in favor of the fat cats while the rest of us get the table scraps.

Biden should have been on top of this with a vengeance!"

""It authorizes 93 acres of federal lands to be used for the construction of the Teddy Roosevelt Presidential Library in North Dakota"".

So what happened to our concern for the environment? 

Similar example happening with the Obama Presidential Center takeover of public parkland in Chicago. 

The massive construction project of the OPC 235' tower could easily be re-located nearby outside of our beautiful public urban parkland. But no, it's full speed ahead with a foolish plan.

The Obama Foundation's wealthy donors receive tax write-offs for contributing to an environmental injustice including destroying 800-1000 old growth trees in Jackson Park. Destroying a  tree canopy that not only protects air quality for surrounding urban communities but is on a major international migratory bird pathway.

Again may we ask - Good intentions? Unintended consequences? More tax write-offs for the ultra-wealthy?"
2020-12-23 16:56:46,"As the (still) president voices his disdain and threatens veto, perhaps (in the light of day and having actually read some of this very-belatedly but hastily-stuffed ""sausage"" of a bill) the ~$200B of ludicrous gifts to the wealthy (e.g., tax deductions for expenses made by the government rather than by the disproportionately-large businesses in the PPP) could be eliminated and that sum repurposed to additional payments to individuals or to further extensions of unemployment (since the Republican members will not devote it to the nearly-bankrupt states and localities where it is probably needed most)"
2020-12-23 16:48:52,"""No break is bigger, however, than the deductions that will soon be permitted under the Paycheck Protection Program.""
 My understanding of this is that businesses given loans will now be able to deduct money spent from the loans from their taxes. According to analysis from the Brookings Institution cited in the article ""...the change would help far more wealthy than mom-and-pop business owners."" This generosity is courtesy of ""...the heads of the tax-writing committees — Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts..."" Bipartisanship in action, I guess"
2020-12-23 16:52:39,"Washington drafts bad legislation because all power is vested in the leadership. The majority leaders of the Senate and House control when and if a bill is put to a vote and dominate the details and pork added at the last minute. A strong president and the White House staff may work behind the scenes as the final arbiter under the threat of veto. Committee chairman are little more than drill sergeants making sure that most legislators don't have a place at the table. 

The top down structure keeps legislators in line and polite in the hope that they might accomplish something more important than renaming a local post office. The Washington normal is outdated and unable to keep up with the complexity of society. 

Consider a rule that gives each legislator the right to schedule a digital vote on up to three bills with bipartisan sponsorship each term. Call it ""Three Wishes"". Digital comments and exhibits would be accepted beginning one week in advance of the vote with no need to take up precious (and slow moving) live floor time. Even the public should be able to post public comments in the Special Congressional database. 

Voters and the news media would be able to judge legislators by the three bills they sponsor, the bipartisan support they get, when they schedule the bill for a vote, and the comments received before the vote.

Legislators need to take back their power by voting for leaders that will respect them more than party affiliation."
2020-12-23 16:55:05,"By April, 500,000 Americans will likely be dead, and tens of millions will be out of work, out of their homes, and living on the street.

And knowing this, Mitch McConnell and his fellow Republicans dragged their collective feet for 6 months before reluctantly agreeing to doling out a single $600 check to those who haven't died already.

Meanwhile, these same ""representatives"" took less than a day back in March to secure a $500,000,000,000 personal slush fund for Donald Trump. All without any government oversight what-so-ever. An amount which was greater than every $1200 check sent out - combined.

Fewer, and exponentially richer have's. More, and exponentially poorer have not's. This massive expansion of inequality is the primary motivation which drives all modern GOP fiscal and social policy."
2020-12-23 16:47:51,My wife and I are fortunate enough to have not been affected financially by the pandemic. Why in the world would this bill have checks sent to people like us instead of using those funds for the many people in desperate need? Same for the last stimulus bill.
2020-12-23 17:10:53,"I've said it once and I'll say it again.  The average Americans who received stimulus checks are not the main beneficiaries.  These checks only provide them with temporary relief for a week or a month.  The people who will benefit from the stimulus for the rest of their lives are the Rich.  If you don't believe this then please look at the stock market which is at a high for the year even while 20 or more million Americans are unemployed with no long term means of support.  Even at the depths of the Pandemic Shutdown the Rich were mostly quite comfortable compared to average Americans.  
     The shutdowns were designed by the Rich and for the Rich with no long term support for average Americans.  If you don't believe me please consider how many those talking heads who planned and announced the shutdowns will ever have to worry about where their next check is coming from, how they will be able to feed and house their families, and how they can afford to send their kids to college.  These are problems that average Americans have but not rich Americans.  
     This economic division of America began with the Reagan Administration and continues today with the Trump Administration and both Parties are to blame.  If we want to make the United States whole again we will  have figure out how to fix the distibution of wealth and opportunity in America.  Our destination right now is towards a Third World society with a small number of elites and lots of have nots."

The same can be asked of $1.3B to the continuing failure of Trump’s border wall. But this is the M. O. of Mitch McConnell and DC corporatists. It would be rediculous I expect anything else."

That sums it up in one word and if you don't agree, you're just not paying attention...which seems to be the point in keeping much of what passed under wraps until the votes were lined up .

Shame on Congress. It's stuff like this which causes people to give up on voting  - possibly the real goal here for Republicans, as the fewer people voting is how they get elected in many places. The Dems may have voted out of desperation to get any relief to working (and currently non-working) people after months of R foot-dragging, but I'm not sure this bill is in anyone's interest except for the chump change that was found on the floor after the wealthy looted the store.

So if the wealthy can deduct what they were already gifted to by the government, does this mean that millions of Social Security, Food Stamp and Section 8  recipients (among others) will be able to do the same when they file their taxes in a few months?

No?

Yeah, that's even more obscene."

The PPP program was much too small, too short (and for many too convoluted) for small businesses to survive on.  Many who took the leans have not seen business come back to pre-pandemic levels (the virus is still raging. restrictions are still needed).

This is all done in CR's even though the President, by law, has to provide a budget proposal every year. They don't care about the debt, the deficit and the people.

3. Spending bills should include CBO estimates of the benefit to specific segments of the population."
2020-12-23 17:23:26,"“But for some businesses and their high-paid accountants, that was not enough. They went to Congress with another request: Not only should the forgiven loans not be taxed as income, but the expenditures used with those loans should be tax deductible.”

While other concerns mentioned are indeed concerning, this issue is not an issue and gets the accounting wrong.

The taxation forgiveness makes sense on the loan, of course. Otherwise, the loan was only 80 cents on the dollar, which wasn’t the intended purpose. If, however, you don’t also allow the use (for example, employee salary or wages) to also be deducted, you are effectively taxing the loan as if you hadn’t forgiven it. Again, the government gave the money, so taxing it and taking it back nets out to the government having given less, with extra steps required.

An illustration of the wage point where 20 of wages came through PPP:

Revenue: 30
(-) Wages: 20
= Pre-tax income: 10
(-) Taxes of 20%: 2
= After tax income: 8

That is typical and how wages work in the normal course. It is also what this Bill proposes.

If wages were not tax-deductible, the effect would be:

Revenue: 30
(-) Wages: 20 (non deductible)
= Pre-tax income: 10 / Taxable income 30
(-) Taxes of 20%: 6
= After-tax income: 4

Astute readers will note the difference between the two outcomes is 4, which is exactly how much would be paid in taxes if you just taxed the loan (20 x 20%)."
2020-12-23 17:33:05,"The analysis of the tax consequences of PPP forgiveness that forms the bulk of this article is nonsensical.

The original CARES Act stated that the income that results from PPP forgiveness would be forgiven.  The IRS subsequently ruled that the expenses to which the income was applied would not be deductible.  This defied the clear intent of the original CARES Act.

Why?  Because, in broad strokes (I am sure there are odd exceptions), for a business, it is net income that is taxed: income minus expenses.  This is what it means to say expenses are deductible.  In the case of PPP forgiveness, in almost every case, the impact of not permitting deductions is EXACTLY the same as taxing the income in the first place.  The original intent was no doubt deliberate, to maximize the impact of the program.  The IRS decision to deny the deductions logically defied the intent of the CARES Act.

It is patently false to claim that declaring the the income non-taxable and then to allow the deductions is ""double dipping,"" as if the recipient is getting a double tax benefit.

That is not what's happening here; unless the expenses are deductible, there is zero tax benefit, which was not the intent of the original CARES Act.  It is not that something is being snuck into the new act, it's simply clarifying what was originally intended all along."

But instead of getting to work early, and just 'doing their jobs' to pass the government funding bill, the Congress postured, grandstanded, blustered and blathered, and failed to even start real action until just short weeks ago.

But little actual action, while the lobbyists assembled a bill from wish lists, and buried Billions in giveaways, perks, pork and handouts. Then the whole thing was pasted together, rushed to the floor, and a vote (a 'must pass' last-minute vote, of course) was required.

In other words, Congress doing ""business as usual"" - while failing utterly to protect and represents the interests of We the People first, instead of the lobbyists."

Regarding the bill, no member of congress should be commended for this bill that took 7 months to produce.  Clearly, the trump should not be commended for his absence at best and obstruction at worst.  The PPP did its job by keeping people employed.  I know I kept on employees when things were very tough. Without PPP, they would have been unemployed in early spring.  Why should other businesses be punished at all for the same.

I could be wrong about this, but if I am right the article is misleading.  Not paying payroll taxes would be totally fair as the businesses are paying their employees to not work.  If they had to pay for payroll taxes why wouldn't they just lay them off instead of keeping them on on payroll?  This would strain the unemployment system even more, not just financially but with even larger volumes.  I write this as both a very small business owner and an employee.  I endured both systems and I can tell you it is much better to continue to be paid by your former employer than it is to try and navigate unemployment.  I was just paid last week for money I had applied for in April and May from unemployment.  The PPP money was hard to apply for but once it went through the money came almost immediately.

2020-12-23 19:27:02,"Putting aside the policy merits of how the PPP program was originally designed and how it was taken advantage of by large firms, it is not factually accurate for this article to characterize the tax deduction change as ""businesses wanting more"" or some kind of ""double dip"".  The IRS position, that expenses paid with PPP funds cannot be deducted as business expenses, would yield the same mathematical result as if Congress had said PPP loan proceeds were taxable.  But the PPP act said the proceeds were not supposed to be taxable, presumably to enhance the size and effect of the program.  So there is a very good argument that this clarification simply reaffirms the original intent."

2020-12-23 19:41:43,"This article isn't quite accurate in its wording.  It's not really a ""double"" tax benefit in terms of being a tax exempt AND getting a deduction.  The PPP loan forgiveness is either tax exempt or it's not.  Congress's intention was to make it tax exempt when the CARES Act was passed--and that's why they stated in the law that the forgiveness would be ""tax exempt"".  But then that ""tax exempt"" characterization was effectively nullified by the IRS's position that they would deny any deductions for expenses associated with the loan forgiveness.  The loan forgiveness is either tax exempt or it will be fully taxed (on the IRS's position).  If you deny the deductions, then it's fully taxed.  It's not a ""doubling up"" of the tax benefit.  It's just one benefit.  One can argue whether or not the loan forgiveness should've been tax exempt.  But that was how the forgiveness was characterized when the CARES Act was passed, and thousands of small businesses have managed their businesses on that assumption.  The new stimulus bill merely clarified what was the original stated intention in the CARES Act, which was what thousands of businesses assumed from the beginning and what the Government also assumed itself (when they quantified the cost of the initial CARES Act)."

Well, that is probably not what most of America wanted to see in what is supposed to be a covid relief bill for those suffering from economic hardships not of their doing. At the very least we could say OK that money is given to Americans. I know that the Times narrative is always based on bias against Donald Trump and the Republicans. I get that. The Times though should be even more outraged and concerned about  some of what else is in the rest of the 5593-page bill. Two new museums for the Smithsonian, 500 million for a border wall in Jordan, 33 million for Venezuela, money for the Sudan, 10 million for gender programs in Pakistan, millions to retain women in the Afghanistan army, 70 million for Cambodia, etc,etc. So my question for the Times is simple, Where are you? Why aren't you concerned by this. This is supposed to be financial relief for Americans. Perhaps a little more than $600 given what is included in this bill. 
       The main st. media is so tied up with political bias that they are failing to do their job and hold congress to their responsibilities to the American people. This is a disgrace. All your concerned about is a few rich people. So what. You should be ashamed for not calling out this total waste of tax payers money."

I am certain it is  stuffed with provisions  snug into these bills, literally in the dark of night, without any announcement, without any discussion, by lowly paid staffers to key Congress Members, on the input of lobbyist,
being “paid back” for their donation to campaigns

Politics is a dirty business, but to present a bill with more than  5000 pages a few hours before the vote, is  too much"""

- Public Funding of elections
- Drastic reduction to number and influence of lobbyists
- Congressional districts redrawn by independent committee
- Term limits for all members of congress and federal judges
- Electoral college votes in proportion to popular vote

The obvious problem:  Many of these changes lessen the power and increase the accountability of congress and the president, while they are the people who must make the changes. 

But until we make these changes, and more, we are tinkering, so expect more stories like this one, during election years, in between, about presidents or senators or congress members or judges ... On and on and on.

I find it especially troublesome that:
""In passing the law in the spring, Congress explicitly said that the Paycheck Protection Program funds should not be included as taxable income — unlike, say, unemployment benefits."" This is not right.

Another issue I have would be concerning is the stimulus check is based on taxable income. For people who has sizable assets but do not report high taxable income, they would be the stimulus check recipient as well.

But the IRS issued a rule that made it so expenses paid with PPP funds would not be deductible, essentially making the non taxable revenue provision meaningless.

2020-12-23 20:35:30,"Why do you call it the Pandemic Relief Bill when it is an overdue spending bill/ authorization that contains many items, some good some not so good?   Why don't you call it the Three Martini Lunch bill, which would be as much spin as your offering up already."

It’s a big bill, okay — that’s why excellent journalism relies on knowledgeable sources for information. Someone knew these provisions were in there. Shouldn’t it be standard, by now, for Washington reporters to actively look for what’s hidden in these bills and publish that? Now look who gets to be the hero...."

I get physically ill thinking of the level of waste, fraud and abuse by those associated with our governments.   How our tax dollars are reallocated in darkness to corporations and wealthy insiders hidden within 5,000 page tombs.   

BTW, these tactics drove the frustration that created DJT.  We must address the systemic issues of our governance and increase the transparency associated with the wealthy “takers” in our society."

The employees received their paychecks and my Landlord received his rent, all because of the program and I am thankful for this.

2020-12-23 20:28:57,"Unregulated capitalism is socialism for the rich. In this context the term socialism appears to be acceptable. But if you apply it to giving health care for all or funding relief to the needy suffering from the pandemic all of a sudden it is a no no. May be we have to redefine it to mean giving everyone adequate safety nets such as occurs in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

I like his 2,000 a person offer though that would help us out for awhile than the tiny 600 a month the GOP cry babied their way into getting for America."
2020-12-23 21:14:10,"The Covid legislation was combined with the annual appropriations bill.  I believe the Covid relief is in Sections M and N.  Those sections do not contain these provisions.  They’re just part of the larger appropriations bill.  But of course Trump and our increasingly unhinged Senator Johnson are grandstanding against the bill calling it a 5000 page disaster and so forth, conveniently ignoring the fact that the Covid relief was a part of this regular, appropriations act."
2020-12-23 20:52:52,"The more your social olfactory senses become sensitive to how this nations system works, the more pungent the insult.

It is utter insult to the intelligence and value of every citizen when the system allows this type of robbery to happen. The salt on the wound is the smiles on the faces of our representatives, D's and R's.

The problem is not the individuals. The problem is clearly the system. It looks like it is built to allow for this.

Is it the political or the financial aspects of the government allows by the system (a.k.a. The Constitution). We keep putting bandaids and tourniquets every few months and our pockets keep bleeding, the blood trickling upward in defiance to rationality.

I suppose we are just as natural as insect colonies. No matter how much we try, the leaching Queens keep tilting the playing field, if you'd excuse my mixing of the metaphors.

The constitution seems to not be written with human dignity in mind, but a financial herd mentality where we the slaves are not the people in ""we the people"".

This is has gone on for XII generations. You wonder how much longer before the pressure exceeds the seams that hold this society together. We have to seriously question why we hold up this constitution above all else? Has if provided happiness to the population it invites to these shores? How does it compare to foundation of happier societies?

For simplicity, take Stiglitz happiness metrics, or even UN's This raises historical concerns about the future."
2020-12-23 20:50:46,"This was supposed to be a bill providing relief for the needy. But it turned out to be 5000 plus pages of something else.
I really don't understand how congress can pass bills legally without reading them. 
But in the United States a corporation is a person so I guess that explains everything.
Don't see how we can call this shameful bill bipartisan or a relief bill. 
This is socialism for big business disguised as relief for Americans."

Later, when urgency will be gone, I'm Sure Biden will be able to easily correct mistakes, like raising new taxes, propose new measure and so on. Nothing is written in stone and time will come, everything can be changed.

So let's play like this"
2020-12-23 21:04:24,"This sentence in the article is misleading, and undermines the whole thesis of the article:  

""In passing the law in the spring, Congress explicitly said that the Paycheck Protection Program funds should not be included as taxable income — unlike, say, unemployment benefits.  Despite that largess, businesses wanted more. In May, the heads of the tax-writing committees...wrote Mr. Mnuchin urging him to reconsider his opposition [to allowing the business expenses to be deducted].""

If you deny those deductions (associated with the loan forgiveness), then the loan forgiveness is effectively fully taxable.  It is not ""extra"" to clarify the treatment of the expense deductions.  You either maintain the original position that the loan forgiveness will be tax exempt or you change it to make it fully taxable.  The new stimulus bill just keeps it tax exempt.  There's nothing ""extra"" at all."

I think a show where ordinary people discussed and debated the merits of a bill would be very interesting."
2020-12-23 21:20:25,"I think the thing that upsets me the most about this is that the politicians have forced me to agree with Trump.  I guess it wasn't enough for those who inserted the provision for free money to rich companies to take five weeks of enhanced unemployment benefits away from those with NO jobs in order to give stimulus checks to people who are still working and making a healthy income.  No, they need to make sure that their wealthy buddies (and themselves, if they own any of these companies) continue to benefit at an insane and immoral level from this pandemic."

But now, you are upset that I don't have to pay taxes on this money. The PPP loan was not a profit grant. It was a grant to keep my business open. Rebecca, If I have to pay 102K in taxes for the grant, that will put me out of business. Making the expenses tax deductible is the right thing to do.  You are totally wrong about this."
2020-12-23 21:16:58,"I'm not saying that I endorse the sausage-making form of legislation that Congress has adopted, which is really just ""earmarks"" under a different name, but how do you think they got the Covid relief bill passed?  Do you really think they did it out of the goodness of their heart?  McConnell probably thinks he deserves that horse racing commission as his reward for even bringing the bill to the floor."

Why can't these hand puppets ""tuck away"" legislation to make it easier for workers to unionize so that they can finally catch up and make good wages and have solid working conditions instead of  just callin' them ""heroes."" ""Heroes"" doesn't put food on the table or a roof over one's head. Howz 'bout ""tuckin' away"" stuff that will even things out between those with too much and those that put all those profits in the pockets of the rich.
Merry Christmas anyway."
2020-12-23 21:02:44,Congress should take advantage of the veto Trump offered to fix the bill and have it reflect what 90% of us thought it would be; a hand up to desperate American families and not  well connected individuals and their families.  This is a disgrace.  McConnell and Pelosi should both go on record verbally supporting the bill.  Give the money to needy families and small businesses and start OVER.

While Mitch McConnell is defunding state first responders and frontline workers, he's found federal funding for the essential business of horse racing. So horse's eat pork now?"
2020-12-23 23:00:55,"As a few others have pointed out, the reversal on the deductibility of the expenses used to back up the PPP loans is not a ""double-dip"".  Before the change, a business who got a 100K PPP loan forgiven did not have to count the forgiveness in their income;  however they also did not get to deduct 100K of business expenses that would normally reduce income.  End result is still a 100K increase in taxable income.   This change makes the forgiveness of the loan tax neutral, which seems to be what Congress intended."
2020-12-23 23:03:47,Allowing businesses that received PPP funds to deduct expenses paid with those funds is not necessarily a boondoggle for the wealthy.  Many small businesses used those funds to stay afloat. To then be hit with an effective 40% tax bill (state and federal) for those funds would be un unbearable expense that would sink many of those businesses that the program intended to save.  Nuance matters.
2020-12-23 22:22:45,"Reminds me of the Affordable Care Act when Pelosi said ""you'll have to pass it to find out what it says or includes"".  Standard political bias and bait & switch.  The Democrats are better at bait and switch than the Republicans."

Senator Manchin, hear,hear.   Is there any wonder people are so disgusted - after repeat plays like this - many didn't see the point in voting?  But perhaps the successful get-out-the-vote campaigns may end up in eventually getting rid of our pro-oligarchy Senate. I'm suffering a bad case of non-Covid rage over all of December's outrages."

2020-12-23 22:46:25,"Maybe there is math going on.  $600 dollars for each of the 330,000,000 million in the US is 198 trillion.  So if you give everyone in the US 600 you need to give the 1% the same."
2020-12-23 23:02:06,"Our government is by the rich, of the rich and FOR THE RICH. America is not good for rich and lower middle class. The income gap and assets gap in our country is obnoxious. It is criminally inhuman. In this pandemic period  when people are suffering so much , the billionaires got richer and richer. America has no money and deficit is increasing when it comes to help the poor. We have no problem with corporate welfare. It is so unfair and cruel. No wonder people hate politicians and have no trust on government."
2020-12-23 22:40:29,"Interesting how the ""NYT Picks"" all support the notion that allowing deduction of expenses paid with the PPP money is wrong and buried because it supports the richest.  There is another side.

1) As with other congressional packages, this thing is 100's of pages, so everything is buried.
2) How would individuals react if they learn that the stimulus checks they received would be considered taxable income?  This is in effect what would happen to small business if the expenses paid with PPP money cannot be deducted as business expenses.
3) Most small company owners are not ""the richest"".  They run there businesses like many run their households.  The don't spend money that they don't have.  These companies used the PPP money to keep people employed and stay in business.  Most of these companies either lost money or managed so that they broke even in 2020.  But if you in effect tax the PPP by eliminating the deduction of expenses paid with that money, these companies will all have to pay taxes and won't have the money to do it.  They will likely go out of business because they cannot print money.
4) It's about time we stop the class warfare.  This has been a difficult year for everyone.  NYT, do you think you can take the first steps towards united our country?"

I'm confused; if so many legislators were left in the dark until the last minute, who actually wrote the bill? Whose idea was it to give tax breaks to the people and businesses who need it the least?

There were times during his career when if planned far enough in advance his bonus could be deferred. Help you save for your retirement. After Enron it was a little risky so we didn’t do it too often. Non Qualified Deferred compensation could not be rolled over into an IRA at retirement. When we signed up payout was supposed to be over no more than 10 years. Six months after retiring my partners company payed it out as a taxable lump sum of nearly $500k. 

This amount was equal to 3 years worth of salary and 6 years worth of retirement income. Taxes through us into the too tax bracket with no deductions other than the standard deduction. It also through both of us into the top tier Medicare bracket increasing both of our premiums to nearly 4X normal for Part B and D. 

We were never informed of any change in the plan nor that the payout schedule could be discretionary. We appealed to his company but were denied with no explanation. I feel that we must have the highest effective tax rate in the country. Higher than the corporations, higher that millionaires and certainly higher than billionaires Bezos and Buffet.

Mitch has also blathered a lot of spin about this – trying to blame Democratic leaders for refusing to negotiate while Mitch publicly stated on multiple occasions that there was little support for more aid among Republicans and even suggested that maybe states and municipalities should declare bankruptcy (shamefully there is no aid for states and local governments in this $900 billion package which means there will be layoffs and delayed hiring among  first responders, teachers, and city workers.)

Abstract 

Contributions by investor-owned companies play major roles in financing the campaigns of candidates for elective office in the United States. We look at the presidential level and analyze contributions by companies before an election and their stock market performance following US presidential elections from 1992 to 2004. We find that companies experienced abnormal positive post-election returns with (i) a higher percentage of contributions given to the eventual winner and (ii) with a higher total contribution given. Hypothetical portfolios of the 30 largest corporate contributors formed according to (i) the percentage of contributions given to the winner in a presidential election and (ii) the total contribution (divided by market capitalization) would have earned significant abnormal returns in the two years after an election.

Folks, our Congress isn't serious because our politics isn't serious.  And those at the controls work very hard keeping it that way.

2020-12-22 22:31:03,"Thank you for the excellent reporting. It sheds light on the administration's puzzling decision to not acquire more of the Pfizer vaccine when it had the opportunity in the summer.

Curious that the administration did an about face on using the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer only after Biden announced he would invoke the act to speed up production of the vaccine.

Now let's see what the administration can do about getting more of the Pfizer vaccine out the door and into arms. Better late than never."
2020-12-22 22:31:36,"Do I trust anyone in this administration to handle the rollout of vaccines in any competent way? No. All the decisions about vaccine developers and their ability to manufacture the needed doses leads backs to Trump. Lets not forget how difficult it was to convince Trump to use the war powers act to make masks, ventilators, or any PPE related to this crisis. The vaccine manufacture and delivery is just his latest strategy to inject himself in a process that will only be made worse by his presence. Can't he just stay busy trying to overturn the long-past election? The bottom of the barrel has risen up to meet Trump and I cheer them on to spend the next 28 days whipping each other into a frenzy over this fools errand."

Now if the Trump administration wasn't giving Pfizer favored status to secure these because Pfizer didn't receive federal money, that is definitely a shame, and just one more example of the rampant cronyism in this administration.  But the Defense Production Act invokes some pretty serious powers to compel manufacturers to do things in a rather anti-capitalistic way, so if the additional supply was not 100% going to benefit Americans by getting us doses faster, and maybe some of the manufactured vaccine was being sold to other countries and further pad Pfizer's bottom line, that is a valid concern as well..."

2020-12-22 22:53:02,"A couple of weeks ago, Alex Azar was interviewed by Judy Woodruff on the PBS NewsHour. He was combative, obnoxious and misleading. 

But on one key topic he was completely correct: by announcing that the federal government “neglected” to buy doses that eventually were purchased by other countries, Pfizer was negotiating a new contract via the press.  The company was playing hardball. 

While the vaccine has emerged out of hard work, diligence and ambition, I have the felling that we are going to be reading stories a year from now about vaccine profiteering, especially by Pfizer."

2020-12-22 22:23:49,Perhaps the reason Americans won't have enough COVID-19 vaccines is because of Jared Kushner who seems to have a hand in everything without the education or knowledge to produce results.  He also supports the herd immunity idea which is ignorant.
2020-12-22 23:24:45,"Trump is trying pressure Pfizer to make more of the BioNTech vaccine, but he doesn’t have the same leverage he has over several other companies, including Moderna. The didn’t take our R&D money. They entered into other contracts after we turned down their offers to increase the USA allotment. Meanwhile, unsurprising distribution problems for Pfizer and production questions about Moderna’s outsourced manufacturing are coming to light. 

It’s common for big programs to have growing pains. Operation Warp Speed made some very big investments that transferred the risks of vaccine development off the vaccine companies and onto the shoulders of American taxpayers. That was a great decision. It will cost far less than the damage our national health and economy would have suffered had a slower vaccine development time course occurred. So we should hope for best with all of vaccines, including those still in trials or still in R&D. We should hope that Pfizer can produce more vaccine if some of their supply chain problems can be reduced. But most of all, we should continue to behave intelligently and with concern for others as we all wait to be immunized. And when this pandemic is behind us, our government needs to learn these awful lessons and improve our response for the next pandemic, because there will be a next time and more times after that."
2020-12-22 23:15:58,"I don't necessarily blame the government for not buying additional Pfizer doses in August of last year, when it was unclear if the mRNA technology would work, when the government had already locked in 200 million doses with Pfizer and Moderna using this technology, and hundreds of millions of others from Johnson and Johnson, Astra Zenca, etc. 

Pfizer is the one playing hardball, negotiating with press releases, and acting like an un-American company by charging the US government more than EU and supplying other countries with 75% of its vaccines. In contrast, Serum Institute of India--the world's largest vaccine maker--has voluntarily decided that half of its production would go to its home country."
2020-12-22 23:16:24,"""Pfizer executives have been frustrated because, according to people familiar with the negotiations, they repeatedly urged the federal government this summer and fall to lock in more doses early, before other nations snapped them up.""

""(Trump) Administration officials declined, later saying that Pfizer refused to commit to specific dates when it would deliver them.""

So Trump didn't lock in enough vaccine supply because they couldn't deliver a ""cure"" in time for Donald's November 3 election date.

It was all for personal....petty.....partisan gain, as always for Individual #1.

American Carnage: The Trump Presidency in a nutshell."
2020-12-22 23:10:52,"Trump thought he could just sign an Executive Order forcing Pfizer to produce more vaccine.  That shows how much he understood about the law of contracts in the U.S.

The Defense Production Act should have been used immediately once it became apparent this year that there were going to be manufacturing and supply chain issues with respect to the production of PPEs like ventilators, N95 masks, etc. -- and now vaccine components.  

The reason the DPA was not invoked was simple:  Republicans do not want the federal government to look like it is anything other than ""the problem.""  This has been their mantra since Ronald Reagan was president.  Tragically, we can now draw a straight line from Trump's the refusal to invoke the DPA and thousands of American deaths.

Our country has almost literally been leaderless with respect to the pandemic.  And what little ""leadership"" there was has often been deeply counterproductive.  The sins are legion: Trump touting Clorox and hydroxychloroquine quack cures, refusing to wear a mask, falsley claiming the coronavirus would simply disappear, firing and/or undercutting the government's own scientists, and encouraging superspreader events.

You can bet the ranch that Biden will invoke the DPA the day he takes office, because he and Democratic leaders understand that the federal government, when run capably and with sufficient funding, truly can work miracles, as it did in WWII."

For those with that belief, it will be hard to take sides in this conflict especially if they are Democrats.

Now top level government officials I get, but come on, there are hundreds of House representatives much less senators and many of them are not more important that doctors and nurses risking their lives valiantly. Sure the politicians claim they want to demonstrate the vaccines safety, well I would agree with that for Dr. Fauci. Then they say they have a lot of followers on Instagram but so does Kim Kardashian. Look, this is nothing more than being scared of the virus and cutting the line. When the Titanic went down there were not enough life boats and many men who were found in those boats while children were thrown off had plenty of reasons for their behavior but in the end it was selfishness and lets call this the same in the name of trying to restore media integrity. If they have to explain why they did something then they are by default wrong.......not taking the vaccine until all the elderly and nursing home patients in their district get it would not require an explanation....people would see the honor and integrity in that."
2020-12-22 23:29:45,"The art of losing has been mastered by Trump. It is almost treasonous to say no to an offer of 100 million shots of Pfizer vaccines offered to Trump by Pfizer Director Scott Gllieb in November, after Astra Zeneca failed in their Phase 3 trial. Another $2 billion would have save 60,000 Americans who will die due to a traitor in the White house. We are doing trillion dollar packages every few months. $2 Billion would have allowed our vulnerable Americans to be vaccinated 2 months earlier. Sanofi-GSK vaccine flopped and Astra Zeneca is months away.  Our only remaining horse is J&J. Should we have any issues, it will be September before all Americans are able to get vaccinated. Even Japan and EU ordered more than the US from Pfizer. All the people who called Covid-19 a hoax are in the front line of being vaccinated."

Like when trump  is claiming that he has done a good job with the vaccine distribution and that we will get the vaccine shot immediately.  (Almost like it is a done deal when only 617K shots have been administered in 1.5 weeks.)

Or the mask less parties and rallies the admin has  during this pandemic; an affront to health advisories who we are expected to follow.
 
And now we have the trump Pfizer stink while people are  slowly suffocating and being alone while dying. 

This mismanagement has to be intentional.  And that might mean our government is not interested in our welfare.

That is scary!  We really do need help and direction in this pandemic and we needed it in January.

Not all the st responders are employed by hospitals, fire departments. Some are solo practitioners such as myself. 

In that my renter, an engineer “working for the government” has an appointment in Jan for the vax, and Congress gets the vax—- wheres my vax?"
2020-12-22 23:49:58,"In the long term, supplies of the vaccine will not be the bottleneck for the US to achieve herd immunity, but demand is. When will the President set an example for his supporters and take the plunge? It may really save some lives."
2020-12-22 23:52:29,"""Initially, Germany’s health minister has announced, there will probably only be 400,000 vaccine doses for Germany, with another 11 to 13 million to follow by March -- a fraction of the amount the Americans are getting""-Der Spiegel.
Trump's and current administration response to Covid-19 pandemic is appalling, with one exception though-we managed to secure the largest amount of vaccine per population size than any other country.
Surely, we could have had much less fatalities if we acted accordingly and promptly, but one cannot deny that as far as vaccine supply, we managed to be on top of other countries."
2020-12-23 00:04:56,"As others have said, why are younger members of our federal government like AOC getting precious vaccine doses before many even high risk people working in health care? 

If they need people in government publicly getting their shot to prove the vaccine is safe okay but it’s not like there’s a shortage of elderly folks in Congress to fill that role."
2020-12-22 23:43:09,"We are in a race with the a always mutating virus. The faster we can get everyone vaccinated, the better chance we have at beating it.   Help Pfizer get those ingredients and lock in the supply. Even if the virus has mutated and current vaccine does not work anymore, the mRNA manufacturer will be able to come up with a new version of vaccine faster."
2020-12-23 00:29:08,"The population of the U.S. is approximately 330,000,000.  My back-of-the-envelope calculation of the number of people who will not get the vaccine for one reason or another (anti-vaxxers, children under the age of 16 (because they were not part of any of the vaccine trials), people without easy access to vaccination sites, undocumented immigrants afraid to be vaccinated for fear of deportation, etc.) suggests that as much as one-third of the people in the U.S. will not be vaccinated in 2021.  So despite the Administration's utterly bungled response to contracting for Pfizer's vaccine, the U.S. may have just enough doses (from Pfizer, Moderna, and possibly Johnson & Johnson) to cover those who do want to be vaccinated as early as possible."
2020-12-23 00:50:23,"we don't need to inoculate 75% to achieve heard immunity as unfortunately 15-20% (or more) of the US has already had covid! 

vaccine immunity rarely (but sometimes) is a strong as natural immunity but let's just say they're equivalent. Then we're going to be in good shape by April. In fact I would be very surprised if we see much spread of covid after April or May."
2020-12-23 01:07:04,"I read an article today that we said we could have released the Moderna vaccine in March, and be out of the woods already.

Well, hindsight is wonderful!   Yes, if we had know that the Moderna vaccine was safe and effective 9 months ago, we could have produced huge amounts and immunized everyone by now - but we didn't know that.   

So back in the summer, before the trials, nobody had any idea whether the Pfizer vaccine, or the Moderna vaccine, or some other vaccine would be effective.   The government may well have hesitated to order too much for fear they wouldn't work out as expected.   So they order some of each and waited.

OK, now we do know.   So fixing bottlenecks and increasing production is now a priority, and Pfizer will make as much as they can.   They actually moved forward more aggressively than the government, and can make more if they can get supplies."
2020-12-23 00:42:01,"According to this article,

<a href=""https://consortiumnews.com/2020/12/17/covid-19-intellectual-property-monopolies-block-vaccine-access"" target=""_blank"">https://consortiumnews.com/2020/12/17/covid-19-intellectual-property-monopolies-block-vaccine-access</a>/

about 100 countries signed a letter to the WTO (World Trade Organization) asking that intellectual property rights for vaccines be temporarily suspended so that poorer countries could have the technology to provide a vaccine for their citizens more quickly. The initiative was welcomed by the director-general of the WHO. Eight countries declined to sign on to the initiative: the United States, Canada, the EU, Finland and some others.

Sigh.

Are we really saying that profits and patents are more important than people's lives, so long as those lives are not within 'our' borders or other rich country borders? Kind of interesting that it's the countries that have managed to secure vaccines for their citizens (to the tune of 3x to 5x as much as we need) that think this prioritizing of intellectual property over human rights is Ok.

It is relevant to note I think that it appears that China and Russia (those great evil empires) are planning to make their vaccine technology widely available to everybody, whereas the rich capitalist countries are hoarding it.

I wonder why this is not being covered more in the media, because it seems like a really important issue."
2020-12-22 23:57:34,So they didn't order enough vaccines for COVID-19 which they though was a hoax.  Seems about right.
2020-12-23 00:32:14,"In addition to the many other incompetent decisions of your administration, these Republican clowns have done everything they can to make Corona faster and faster. Misconduct should be extensively investigated and punished, but we will all see how such a thing is handled in today's America.

2020-12-22 23:47:51,wait. i thought the threat of the virus was a 'hoax'. why now champion a vaccine?
2020-12-22 23:50:48,Trump probably waited to execute the deal until Kelly Loeffler and David Purdue bought more Pfizer stock based on insider information.
2020-12-23 00:26:47,"What's to understand here? Trump's been playing the same game he did with Ukraine (withhold appropriated funds until Ukraine does him a personal favor, though). Which is the same game he played for years on The Apprentice--gather some randos (who kowtow to him, literally), tell them to find the money to build a whatever, and judge their frantic, inept efforts by a metric nobody can guess (surprise! you won!). 

Nothing new here, except our very lives are at stake. Trump and his wacky team should not be trusted to negotiate with Pfizer or any other part of this vaccine project. He's blown it badly enough to be removed from office asap. How? Ask a few of his minions, I guess. To Biden: Next! And hurry, please!"
2020-12-22 23:46:41,Why do you think we don’t have enough doses? Because Pfizer didn’t take Trump’s bribes from the phony baloney Operation Warp Payoff. So Pfizer wasn’t indebted to them. So Trump and the Republicans didn’t  get their kickback. That’s why we don’t have the doses. Duh.
2020-12-23 00:21:21,"The shortage of the vaccine component chemicals (and those used for testing) should have been key issues anticipated by a COMPETENT Federal administration MANY MOTHS AGO. The key word is ""competent"" and it is present nowhere in Trump or his feckless political minions.

This is not a new issue, but it may severely hamper our Covid response which is already the WORST IN THE WORLD. Does Trump care? Not a bit - only about HIM and his treasonous, seditious attempt to stage a coup against all evidence.  The unnecessary dead will haunt him all of his miserable life. He abandoned them an d this nation and took it for a ride."
2020-12-22 23:49:05,"Ugh! Trump is going to try and squeeze every drop out of the vaccine coming to market story until he leaves office. His bid to overthrow the election, has all but failed.

2020-12-23 00:05:30,"We can already see the big effort by Trump and his cronies to shift the blame from themselves to Pfizer for not having enough vaccine for the U.S.  Anyone who believes anything the ""Administration"" is saying over what Pfizer is saying needs to have their head examined.

Once again, Trump snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.  I'm sure he's blown his stack over the fact that he couldn't simply sign an Executive Order diverting all of the Pfizer vaccines from other countries to ours."
2020-12-23 00:24:40,"The trump administration could have order millions more of the vaccine doses in the summer if they could reach an agreement that benefited trump. But no agreement, so fewer doses, so America loses yet again.

Over 300,000 American citizens have died since February because of trumps ""transactional"" relationship with everything. People's lives were just a commodity to be traded in yet another self severing scheme.

From 2016 to today, the country has suffered under trump and his sycophant republican enablers. This story is just one more reason to rejoice for the coming of January 20th."
2020-12-23 00:28:42,"A simple question:  Why aren't the vaccine formulas developed by Pfizer and Moderna being shared with all the other pharmaceutical companies so that they can produce the vaccines too?  Capitalism?  Not fair to Pfizer and Moderna?  Fair? How about ""the people?""  78 million(!) cases of Covid 19 and 1.7 million(!) dead people as a result.  

Is there nothing, nothing at all, that supersedes the bottom line?"
2020-12-23 00:24:02,"Trump usually appoints people with no knowledge of an area to oversee that area. If they do have some background, then it’s usually because they gained it from the private sector and/or they have a particular ax to grind. Alex Azar came from Eli Lilly and I wonder if he had some issues with Pfizer in the past and is thus not necessarily willing to be accommodating in any negotiations with that company. Maybe that’s just my suspicious little mind at work."
2020-12-22 23:57:55,"No idea where the figures on the shortfall of vaccines as against the number of those eligible to receive it are coming from. I'd love an in-depth article on that. Also. there is zero info from the DC government on when ordinary folks with comorbidities can hope to be vaccinated here in DC.  We got less than 7000 doses for a city of more than 700,000. I get that I need to wait, but how long?"
2020-12-23 00:28:51,The Trump administration playing games ruled by personal grievances as if this was a private business dealing. The American public paying the price yet again. What else is new.
2020-12-23 00:19:19,"With this deal and the economic deal made by the Congress supported by Trump ( the previous deal offered by Trump was double better), Trump has put in motion American economic recovery and vanquishing of the pandemic. The system is in place to distribute the vaccine and vaccinate the people. Hope Biden will not ruin these measures by his mandates and imposing too many regulations to control perceived climate changes."
2020-12-23 01:14:47,"One major unknown factor is how long the vaccine will protect you.  So it’s vital to have as many people vaccinated in a short amount of time, before those vaccinated early lose immunity, get exposed and start another wave.  This is independent of any future mutation not targeted by the vaccine - all the more reason to get infections under control around the world as rapidly as possible to reduce the likelihood this starts all over again."
2020-12-23 01:40:57,Trump says $600 is a disgrace. He says $2000 is closer to being correct. Pelosi is celebrating. Who would you rather have as a leader representing you?

2020-12-23 01:10:18,"In a rapidly evolving situation like this it's better not to focus too far on the future. The federal government would do best to focus on getting shots off of shelves and into shoulders. And in speeding up the phase III trials going on. 

We need more vaccines. That we waited three weeks to approve the BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was wrong. And there are plenty of volunteers for both normal trials and challenge trials--why aren't those trials being pushed up? 

There's plenty to be done to increase the size of the pie that the world can partake of. Do that, and quit fighting over the size of our own slice."
2020-12-23 01:00:47,"Healthcare worker here...I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday, December 21st. Thanks to everyone who made this possible!"
2020-12-23 01:58:29,"Look Pfizer did not take operation warp speed funds for research because they did not want to have to be loyal to trump instead of science.  Trump demonizes anyone not loyal.

And when is trump going to realize no Americans give him credit for the vaccine. It was the scientist and employees that gave up their summers and weekends to develop this vaccine.  The more trump made the vaccine about him the more hatred for trump. 

Pfizer has a proven record and the plant in Michigan has an excellent FDA ranking. 

Moderna has been in existence only since 2010.  
The late Dr. Salk probably wouldn’t have lasted a week at one of today’s go-go investor-driver pharmaceutical research firms like U.S.-based Moderna, which may or may not be leading the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine but is definitely the world leader in blowing its own horn — and cashing in.

Moderna has never successfully marketed a product since it launched in 2010, but that hasn’t stopped the high-flying public company from winning the ear of President Trump, who pledged them $483 million in taxpayer dollars after a “Shark Tank”-like pitch from its CEO, or Wall Street traders who sent the Dow nearly 1,000 points higher on a press release that actual medical experts called “premature.” Even as new investors raced in, two Moderna executives – its CFO and chief medical officer – dumped shares, netting $30 million."

This is what happens when your president is by far the greatest self-proclaimed dealmaker in history. Well done, Donald."

2020-12-23 01:21:56,"How much is the price tag on this lot of vaccines for April-June 2021? (the first lot was $1.9 Billion for 100mil or for 50 mil people)

So now it looks like will give you 70 million if you give us  access to make more. Sounds like a fair exchange , but at what price?

As of Today America has 18.6 million infected, 10.9 million recovered, 7.4 million active cases and 330,384 deaths related to the pandemic; population is 331.6 million people.

China: 86,867 infected, 81909 recovered, 324 active cases (my former state is getting this everyday now +/- at 1.3 mil residents), 4,634 deaths, 1.439 billion population, three/four times that of the US.

Just feel we have to begin question what is going on here...this just makes absolutely no sense any longer especially while the rest of the globe appears to rising in all aspects of this pandemic and new variants are popping up throughout the globe. At this stage also an investigation into possible 'chemical leak' in Wuhan...is it going to help find or stop this? How 'infected' has this area remained or been 'cleaned'?"
2020-12-23 01:40:11,Are you kidding me? Posturing about getting the vaccine produced? Invoke the defense production act NOW. Step up and do your job and save lives and stop acting like immature toddlers !

2020-12-23 03:16:27,"The reasons for our country being in the position we are is very simple.
1). Donald Trump did nothing to try to control the pandemic.
2). Because 99% of Republicans are so scared of him, but don't have the guts to call him out, he has acted like a 2-year old throwing a tantrum for almost four years.
3). He is one of the most flawed humans that has ever lived, as evidenced by his refusal to concede the election among other actions that a normal person would never do.

Lastly, he is a walking time bomb waiting to go off. He no longer has a sense of reality, which is a very bad trait to have. Once he is gone from the White House he will become even more dangerous than he already is. There are several world leaders who are sitting on the sidelines right now just waiting for him to go over the cliff. When that happens they will be fighting each other in order to take over this country. 

Every person who stood by and didn't say or do anything to bring him under control, needs to be arrested and charged with dereliction of duty, malfeasance, and sent to prison for the rest of their lives. The government also needs to punish all of the alt-right and other groups that are trying to take over the country by force. 

Quite honestly, too many people and countries want to take over our country, and with the state that we are in, it won't be hard for them to do it."
2020-12-23 03:03:04,"The media is trying deter any skepticism for this vaccine and quash any concerns about it. There are more people afraid to get the vaccine than they believe. I work in eyecare and come in direct patient contact, and myself and many ophthalmic technicians in my FB groups are afraid of it. It has not been tested enough and there have been more allergic reactions to it than with most vaccines. Why? The manufacturers don't know. Why don't they know? Because there hasn't been enough testing. Why not? Because there hasn't been enough time to test it properly. 

""Just hold out your arm and trust us,"" they say. Sorry, can't do that. Injecting smiling celebrities on camera does not change the facts. No one knows for sure that it is safe. Not even many healthcare people want to take it yet. Science takes time. It can't be rushed no matter how serious the disease. If other people want to take it, that's their decision, but enough of the empty reassurances."
2020-12-23 03:00:04,"It is 1912 and Captain Trump, the best captain ever, and you know this because everyone says it, is getting ready to sail the SS COVID on its maiden voyage from South Hampton to NYC.  It is March and the experts tell him that the trip will probably encounter several hundred deadly icebergs, many that will be invisible or difficult to detect.

There are no icebergs at Mar-A-Lago and besides, who wants fake news that could tarnish his command?  So, given the chance to purchase additional lifeboats at a cost that is a mere fraction of the lives of his passengers, he declines and sets sail, full speed ahead because after all, how can he be the center of attention sitting at the dock while the orchestra plays?

Sadly, while the captain is tweeting during his executive time, the SS COVID hits one of those icebergs.  His primary duty was the safety of his passengers, but many sadly die, the ship is lost and countless lives affected forever.

Some say the captain proceeded ahead blindly only concerned about his image.  

Others say many more lives could have saved had the captain simply ordered enough lifeboats.

Most others say both of the above reasons are correct, but the one thing everyone can be certain of, as the ship disappears into the icy cold waters of the Atlantic, is that Captain Trump will swear to his dying day that he was the best captain ever and it wasn't his fault.  After all, his uncle was a brilliant captain at Harvard.

China?  Certainly not Russia."
2020-12-23 03:32:43,"Let me get this straight. We've had a for-profit healthcare ""system"" since the dawn of time and readers are blaming Trump that Pfizer and Moderna are charging the US more for them than the EU? Some critical thinking skills are in order here, and for once it's not on Trump's part. America runs on money, and nowhere is it more blatant than in medicine."
2020-12-23 03:15:10,"Pfizer gave the Trump Administration first dibs in August over every other country and the Trump Administration passed, because they didn’t want to put in an order for vaccines that had not yet been been proven effective.  The extra doses to vaccinate 100 million more Americans (dose plus booster dose) would have been a $3 billion gamble, tops. Think about it - the Trump Administration would have saved just a measly $3 billion if Pfizer vaccine had been a bust.  Instead, it will cost us months more to get people vaccinated, which will cost lives and 100s of billions in lost economic activity, and we ultimately end of paying Pfizer anyway for the vaccines.

This may be the dumbest thing I’ve seen since invading Iraq."

After the Russian hack it would be ludicrous to put a dime into Russian pockets and aside from that, who could ever trust the data? 
No way, no how. 
Astra Zeneca were nuts to throw in with the Sputnik vaccine. Most Russians refuse it. Are fearful of taking it. 
Of course, Trump authorized billions to be paid to AZ for their vaccine because it was considered a ""good buy"" but now it's junk.

So it would only be logical if any government did what the governments of Europe and China are doing, making sure that the vaccine producers have all the resources they need to produce a weapon against this pandemic.

Save the people not make a profit.

Not so the US, and this is not just the Cult of Trump gang, the US ""relies"" on the forces or the market to get things done.
Which only shows that while the rest of the world understands the meaning of the word ""pandemic"", the US still acts based on the potential profit of this situation.
Not just with the vaccine but also with all other medical issues related to Covid.
Or how else would you argue the cost of a Covid treatment for the patient in the US as compared to what EU patients are charged?

So we see here a market driven approach by the US government, ignoring the greater good for public health.

Grow up. Moderna’s vaccine is much easier to distribute, they DID work with the government, and both vaccines were equally effective in the trials. All in all, Trump’s people should be congratulated. Much more troubling is the report that once again, the US is paying more than equally wealthy Europe. Let’s end if Biden will do anything about drug prices. Obama did nothing. Trump at least may a few moves in the right direction. I’m not expecting much from Biden."

2020-12-23 20:28:09,Can't believe neither of these vaccines is approved for kids. It's going to be a LONG road to get everyone vaccinated for this.
2020-12-23 22:23:32,"“A senior Trump administration official said the government was unwilling to intervene because Pfizer refused to promise that it would use those materials to produce vaccines solely for Americans.”

The German BioNtech developed this vaccine in a partnership with it’s logistics partner Pfizer (a different partner exists for China), and the vaccine is enabled by BioNtech’s proprietary technology. As the Germany’s government said, it supported BioNTech financially (375bn Euro) in order to support the development of a medicine that shall help the world. A further German company, which also refused to implement an “America First” approach, when they were approached by Trump’s administration (see public information from around March, 2020) is named CureVac. It is also supported by the German state in order to develop a global vaccine.

1) Strange to me that the Trump administration seems to still believe that it’s “America First” doctrine might have any relevance in their relation to BioNTech/ Pfizer. 

2) Under the guidance of the WHO, all countries joined forces in order to fight Covid globally. With my European eyes it is interesting to see that the Trump administration obviously only focused on its “America first” strategy, while it stopped to support the WHO, but is now more than keen to get hold on a vaccine that is only available because other countries joined forces."

I’m a teacher and the house I pay too much to rent has no insulation and a mold problem. I’m all for taxes, but what I’m not for is continuing to pander to billionaires whose personal spending is in no way affected if they were asked to pitch in their fair share. Bezos does nothing for Washington."
2020-12-22 18:28:02,Public schools are largely funded through local real estate property taxes and state cost sharing with cities.  Real estate is booming while state tax receipts may be down.  I see there may be a small shortfall but I don't see the disaster predicted.
2020-12-22 19:05:20,"School funding was done too much by approximation and rule of thumb.

Costs are relatively fixed, as for buildings and utilities and long term staff. The buildings have usually been there for decades, and each one requires a Principal and office staff. They are divided into the same classrooms for all those decades, and each one requires a teacher whether for 15 students or 30.

Funding is just the opposite. It is allocated per student present in the building on a specific day specified in law, or worse, on real estate values rather than anything to do with education. Some is sent from the state as an estimate of per student supplement needed on top of local funding, and some is local funding authorized as a millage on real estate appraisals.

This was made to work when numbers on both sides were steady. It was a jury rigged system, just made to work, not cause and effect. There was a lot of estimating based on what worked last year.

Now a hard wind blows through all the assumptions, through the whole systems of state's funding, or real estate values, and of students even able to attend in the buildings.

The whole jury rigged wobbling mass falls apart."
2020-12-22 19:05:30,"In Oregon, schools are not likely to lose funding because of high property tax recovery by the State.  There is some declining enrollment at the kindergarten level though.  On the other side, there is a lot of tension because kids have not had a day of in-person public school since March and Oregon ranks 49th in per capita virus figures.  We need school to be back in person.  It is hard to justify talking about increasing school funding without some guarantee that also means kids are actually going to get school."
2020-12-22 18:28:32,"Children are our intellectual seed corn.  If we ""consume"" them by not funding proper education, we will have meager intellectual harvests in the future.

The best answer lies with the states and localities, which must increase taxes to fund education.   But it is difficult to raise taxes without robust support from those who pay the taxes.  Public educators need to ask themselves what parents see in home schooling and private schools, that is not available in public schools.  Until they do, and make the changes demanded by parents, we will remain in this death spiral."
2020-12-22 18:36:17,"If enrollment is dropping, then it seems to me the solution would be to maintain fewer schools."
2020-12-22 18:53:20,"I get that tax revenues are down. What is not clear, is why public school enrollment would have an effect on district funding during a pandemic. If state governments are financially starving their school districts over an acute blip in enrollment, they are short-sightedly making things worse. But what should one expect in this segment? Career administrators in Education are ironically ill-equipped for critical thinking when it comes to management or policy."
2020-12-22 18:17:40,Perhaps we need to rethink public schools.  Online education for the upper grades might free up resources (e.g. classrooms) that could then be used to provide safe teaching for the lower grades.
2020-12-22 18:37:30,"It may not be typical of public school systems generally, but the NY City response to the pandemic has been erratic and poorly planned, with flip-flops between in-person and virtual teaching so that neither can be properly executed. And now the City is eliminating the admissions criteria that defined its more academically rigorous intermediate schools.

Is it surprising that parents who can afford to remove their children from the public schools will do so."
2020-12-22 18:48:57,"In my city (Boise) public school is all online while private schools are in-person.

This is misleading. McConnell made it clear he is willing to pass aid to states as long as liability protection for businesses is also included. That means he is not sincerely against it, but is just using it as a bargaining chip.

Or if you prefer, he is willing to encourage irresponsibility in states as long as he can also encourage irresponsibility in businesses."

2020-12-22 18:37:41,"I can’t speak for the rest of the country, but there are many of us who would cheer a reduction in any support for the overfunded public schools here in the NewYork suburbs.  Maybe school boards and administrators would learn to live within their means.  What usually happens, however, is that our property taxes are raised unjustly to make up the difference, or educational and sports programs must be cut because school boards are too weak and afraid to challenge the rich salaries, benefits and retirement packages negotiated by administrators’ and teachers’ unions."

While a bailout seems like the most immediate plan for relief, it would be a huge mistake not to take this opportunity to fix the problems caused by locally funded, tax-based school budgets. 

The public education system is broken, as evidenced by the droves of parents who fled to find better solutions. With them went not just per-pupil state funding, but also  the resources often attached to families who have the ability to obtain private solutions. The kids left to manage with the scraps offered by the public school system (without the support of private tutors and pods to keep things afloat) include the least resourced and already-at risk kids. Simply bailing out schools financially, using the same flawed mathematics and short-sighted solutions, is not going to work."
2020-12-22 18:52:54,"We pay way too much property taxes already, it’s not sustainable for us to continue living in our current town if the trend continues. Funding for PreK-12 education should come mostly from the federal government by way of taxing corporations that reap immense benefits from the education of their future workers. This also eliminates rich vs poor neighborhoods since all schools will be getting money from the same source rather than from families."
2020-12-22 18:52:05,"There are two trends occurring in the hyper-competitive New York suburbs. In districts where students can elect to learn remotely, parents have simply relocated the children to states where sports training is still permitted. It is the best of both worlds for the wealthy: the kids are enrolled in a 'name' public school district, while still practicing and competing in the sports that pad the college applications well. In CT, almost all youth sports are forbidden, but not if you are living in FL while logging into your CT classroom every day! The other trend is a flight from the 'name' districts by selling to panicked Manhattanites and Brooklynites fleeing NYC's taxes and urban decline. The 'name' district teachers are simply not living up to the ""frontline"" and ""irreplaceable"" status that they demand during shakedown contract negotiations. While public school teachers think of every reason NOT to open, private schools had it figured out last fall with barely a ripple of academic interruption. Families can now fully see how much value a school district's staff truly brings to the table versus living in a cheaper district and sending the kids to a private school where the teacher's union does not hold sway over every thought and action. The learning gap between public and private students over the next five years is going to explode, which may finally shed light on the 'value' public school teachers add to any child's intellectual baseline."
2020-12-22 19:43:49,"Many, including most in the public school establishment, will see this as a disaster. But some will see it as an opportunity. It has been obvious for some time that our schools are failing both the taxpayers who fund them and the students that they serve. if you live in a poor and disadvantaged community, schools should be the tool, the ladder, that helps you to better yourself. That is how it worked in “the good old days”. But today it is rare to see this happen. Pouring more money in has not worked because of the way that money gets spent. We need to seriously look at how successful education systems in other countries work and adapt our schools accordingly. If they can educate their children, we should be able to do the same."

When the owner of overstock.com wanted to defund public schools in Utah, he was successful  despite having no connection with the state's public school system. The reason public schools there were not defunded is because voters resisted. There is a rumor that the Utah Legislature has not recovered from the sting of voters making their desires known and they're waiting for another try. 
Everything about this Covid experience with respect to public schools argues for the need students have to gather and learn.

2020-12-22 19:26:36,"The disastrous performance of public schools in our major metros during the pandemic shows the need for major reform. Teachers unions need to be reined in, as they have demonstrated that they care more about their members than the mission they are supposed to be serving. Private schools all over the country and public schools outside the major metros figured out how to move forward and did so without gigantic infusions of federal dollars. The public schools in the major metros need to figure out how to do likewise."
2020-12-22 19:34:16,"Trying to understand the mechanics of mass movement to private schools.

The private schools in our area fill up every year.  They didn't add extra seats because of the pandemic.  So the percentage of kids going to private school did not change at all.

Schools that have rolling admissions, perhaps because they were not very good compared to the local public schools, might have filled up sooner this year, but how many students is that really?

I want to see numbers to back up this story.  The data should be pretty plain, right?

On a related note, if top universities were as committed to equal opportunity and as opposed to wealth inequality as their largely liberal admissions committees professed to be, then they would, for example, discount any activity on an application that someone in the bottom 20% of the income distribution could not afford. They would limit legacy admissions to 5% of the class, athletes to 5%, and private school admits to 5%.  That would really move the needle on gaining a commitment to public school education.  Who would try to funnel their kid through such a low private school admit rate?"

Health insurance is forcing schools to cut back programs, possibly teachers, and it was a huge problem before COVID, and will continue to be a problem unless we address it on a nationwide basis. 

Medicare for all is the only solution. If people can get past the ""socialist"" name tag, though I doubt most Americans can define socialist well enough to pass a NY state Regents exam, they will see that it makes economic sense. 

I'm paying for health care at work, plus I'm paying co-pays and deductibles. THEN, I am also paying school taxes that include the outrageous cost of decent coverage, which increases almost exponentially. Why are we the only developed country in the world without a national single payer health care system?"

In New York state there are wide disparities in the quality of education students receive based on the ability to fund learning through imposition of property taxes. Take, for example a comparison between Bedford Hills, one of the wealthiest school districts in the nation, and the South Bronx, less than an hour's drive away. Students in the Bedford Hills school district enjoy a broad array of academic and extracurricular opportunities, while students in the South Bronx often are forced to share textbooks and endure daily problems with internet connectivity. There is only one answer to even slightly level the playing field: Massive increase of federal funding to poverty stricken public schools."

Firefighters, utility workers, and so many others have continued to work during this pandemic, and yet teacher's unions have caused this tragedy for our children. Unless the schools in my area make a concerted effort to re-open, count me as a parent who will be enrolling my kid in private school."
2020-12-22 19:20:24,"For places like New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, this has been mostly self-inflicted as a result of placating the teachers unions.  By forcing remote and hybrid options above and beyond what is reasonable, all while private schools have largely managed full-time in-school learning with comparable or less funding, they are bankrupting school districts while squandering the education of millions of children.  Unfortunately, the same charade will continue with the 2021/2022 school year.  Even when the nation is vaccinated and herd immunity has been achieved, these same teachers unions will be clamoring for continued masking, distancing, and closing schools whenever there is community transmission, which is inevitable.  The refrain will be, ""the vaccine is only 95% effective, less than 100%, so it is still risky for teachers!"".  And that will be their undoing."
2020-12-22 20:02:05,"Maybe we should examine why some public schools work well instead of only examining failure. Growing up, I attended public schools in CA, MA, FL, and TX. My daughter attends a public middle school in CA. 

I received a top notch public education, which enabled me to attend great universities (one public and one private). Now a successful professional, I've paid back more than the cost of my education in income and property taxes as well as donations, and am happy to do so. This is how the system is supposed to work.

My daughter is now receiving a top notch public education in the midst of the pandemic because the administration and teachers managed the pivot to distance learning remarkably well and she is a very dedicated student.

Maybe if we investigate which public school systems are working well, we will find that we can't blame everything on teachers/unions/funding and the NYT's favorite villain (white parents) and instead need to insist on more responsibility from all students and all parents. 

Finally, from my perspective as a parent, the primary role of the school should be to educate, not to provide food, medical care, and every social service imaginable. I would only switch my daughter to private school if the public school stopped educating her (which so far has not happened)."

If there were no required minimum of hours per school day or days per year, and breaks in session followed the extended models of colleges to facilitate deeper learning, enrichment, or travel? What if there were no transportation services? What if we didn't feed students at school or charged them full price for their meals? What if back-talking students could be expelled? What if the teachers needed no special license or training beyond a bachelor's degree, and could be hired for a little more than minimum wage, had no rights or benefits, and could easily be let go? Oh, wait! That sounds like a private school, those places that supposedly just stay open during pandemic, no questions asked. I guess we could just save so much money by just giving up on public education for the poor and working classes and just keep making every family pay and pay and pay.

The learning. The childcare. The front line against abuse and hunger. The childcare. And how we take the bedrock of our economy and decimate its funding? This makes absolutely no sense. But it does lay bare the fact that many Americans care about public schools only for the childcare that they provide. 

If our schools were treated with the importance that people give them in lip service, our nation would be an unstoppable force of positive change. Two decades of funding cuts and you can see where we are and understand how someone like DT could be elected to office in the first place."

They fail to explain how the cities and states they reference in the article fund their education systems. They fail to research how all the state and federal monies given for covid relief has been used or misused. They point out that public schools will be getting an extra $54 billion dollars but somehow with no investigation on their part they assume it is not enough. This is just more PR for the special interest education lobby group that argue that all the money in the world is not enough for public school teachers, staff, and leaders. In many parts of the nation you have too many school districts, underused school buildings and declining enrollment that has nothing to do with covid 19 but with long term declines in student populations due to economic displacement & out migration. These writers also fail to state that in most states like NY charter schools are funded by the state and are not the same as private schools. Has enrollment gone up at private schools? They offer no numbers. They state that 6% of public school students are not in class--meaning even remote classes and how does this number compare to pre covid numbers? Bad reporting all around.

Our taxes were already raised once this year.  And private schools within a 3 hour drive have been advertising - trying to attract local students - not a bad idea given the poor quality of the local systems - luring students away with a promise of a very good remote learning program.  If remote learning becomes more mainstream then these poorly run local systems have much to fear and that's not a bad thing."

However, we're about to give up on public school.  We're not angry, we're not trying to punish anyone.  The situation just isn't working.

We both work outside the home and needed childcare, so have joined a nanny share.  What we spend on that is more than private school tuition, and we're using savings to pay for it so that we can keep our jobs long-term.  But the message we're hearing from the school is that we might be hybrid--not full time--at the start of next year!  It's an untenable situation for us.

The school is rightly prioritizing the needs of more vulnerable students.  I don't disagree with that decision.  But it's clear that that means my kiddo is going to get a sub-par education.  

They are cutting teacher aids, extra curriculars, gifted and talented programs, etc. so that they can increase counseling, providing more internet/chrome books to people who need, and do better meal service for needy students.  I'd probably make the same decisions, to protect the most vulnerable students.  But it shouldn't be a shock when other families give up on the school then.

It's a shame it's such a zero-sum game.  To give one student a better education, you have to give another student a worse education.  Wish I knew what the solution was."

2020-12-22 20:54:12,"You know what just slays me about some of these comments is the hypocrisy. Many Americans claim we need to bring unions back so people can earn good wages and have good benefits. People also want to bring back pensions for more secure retirements. Social Security was never meant to be the sole income for retirees. It was to augment savings and pensions. Anyway, teachers, because SOME of them have unions and SOME of them receive decent pay and pensions, are villains, responsible for every ill in the nation. Maybe they should just walk away and let minimum wage, high school graduates take over. It would be cheaper. It’s only childcare anyway."
2020-12-22 20:45:41,"Although the relief package passed Monday includes direct aid for education, it does not provide money to state and local governments to help make up for Covid-related budget losses, which could prevent them from further helping schools. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, insisted on excluding such aid, saying it would be a bailout for fiscally irresponsible states.

That part is the part that people who voted for Moscow Mitch never hear. MM seems to think that he can hurt the Democrats who lead fiscally responsible states but not hurt his own state which is a welfare state. His voters are so ill-informed, that they seem to think the problem is with Democrats when it's the GOP who's looking out for their donors and not workers. 

Why would the ""back the blue"" right refuse state and local gov't's? The Dems wanted funding for schools, cops and firefighters but the GOP didn't. They wanted immunity for businesses who treat their workers poorly. This is the perfect example of voting against your own interests. 

Shame on the GOP for refusing money to local and state gov't's. I hope the media will be ready to point out all of the hypocrisy that the GOP will dish out over the next four years about fiscal responsibility, unqualified cabinet picks, stacking the courts and more."

Texas just wants to keep the athletic complex & personnel growing.  I repeat... not one sports program will have a decrease in coaches or funding."

2020-12-22 22:13:30,Public education in the US has long been in decline. I do not believe funding is the only issue. The quality of the public school student on average has declined as people flee.  Public schools struggle  to compete. They take all comers. Children from single parent homes and very poor homes where there is little reading material in the home and less time to read to the kids so the children watch TV. These kids are behind the day they show up. Perhaps we should spend money trying to help single Moms and poor Moms with preschool education and less on the teachers unions.

Furthering their plan to destroy it completely and replace it with private schools without oversight nor accountability. Schools that don't serve all students. Schools of low quality that fill the pipeline of voters who lack critical thinking skills. Schools that ensure an undereducated, underpaid work force. A system that will enlarge the wealth gap and hand even more power to the plutocracy."
2020-12-22 22:54:57,"The problem with Austin Schools isn't new to this year. They have had declining enrollment for years due in part to gentrification and hipsterfication (hipsters don't have kids generally) but also how they manage spending between schools. Like it or not, too many equity initiatives are good on one hand (I support equity), but drive out enrollment from other groups as they look for better performing schools. The quality is declining as people pull their kids out and send them to better schools districts that are still in the city or in the burbs (there are 7 school districts within the Austin city limits, only the Austin district is suffering major enrollment losses).  Austin gets pinched too because of its high tax base without the corresponding demand because of less kids living in the city. I'm sure the school board would love everyone to believe that its coronavirus that is driving down enrollment, but in-fact its been going down on their watch for a long time now."

It's time to implement some long overdue measures to protect the taxpayers (many of whom, if not most) do NOT have children in the public school districts. School employees' salaries/pensions/benefits take up the lion's share of every district's budget. The pension payments, courtesy of the overburdened taxpayers, can be phased out by implementing a 401K style retirement account for every district employee. Let each retiree be the master of his/her own financial destiny. That's the way it works in private industry."
2020-12-22 22:34:49,"COVID just worsened an already bad problem. Here is Boston, city taxes are absurdly low, much lower than any of the surrounding towns.

The rich save a little money (not enough to meaningfully impact any aspect of their lives) at the expense of public schools, infrastructure, social security... Tax money makes America great by investing it in our children's education, the roads we drive on, the scientific discoveries we make.

Education is one of the very few engines of social mobility in our rigged economy. As it gets  decimated, the rich tighten their hold on elite institutions that are the pipeline to well paid professional jobs. Money can buy educational attainment. SAT and ACT test performance correlates with income bracket."
2020-12-22 22:19:40,"As the son of a retired teacher, I can more than verify that teachers are not overpaid. No one goes into teaching to get rich. Many teachers have to carry second jobs to make end’s meat. Blaming unions is just a cop out. And for those who clamor about in-person schooling, perhaps the children are in a low risk age group, but their teachers are not. Many are older with health issues. Teachers are under appreciated and, in my opinion, underpaid."

If our federal government had done likewise, we might not be headed toward financial disaster for tens of millions of working class and middle class families, hundreds of thousands of small businesses permanently bankrupted, and half a million dead by early next year.

The LAUSD bureaucracy has gotten a lot right in responding to this crisis.  The problem is, in normal times, the bureaucracy gets so much more wrong, starting with much needed reform.  Education is a three-legged stool: teachers, students, parents.  When it comes to reform, LAUSD, like most public education in large cities, seeks to address only one of those legs.  The bureaucracy, politicians, press and much of the public fail, or refuse, to understand that you can't fix a broken stool by focusing on only one leg."

This will make defeating COVID difficult, and will make any economic recovery very slow.

In the majority of countries around the world, teaching is a respected profession. In America we are treated like dogs while we educate you and your children.

And those of you so happy to be using the private schools? They pick and choose students. They kick children out at will. Many don’t provide special education services. 

And yet you wonder why public schools are struggling right now? We are responsible for teaching everyone - not just the lucky few that can afford to grace our corridors.

And it shows in the numbers.

Heck, why not just keep schools closed forever? Then the teachers unions members will be happy - they don't have to be ""terrified"" of going to work, no more concerns about classroom management when you can simply teach to a laptop, and they can work from the comfort of their sofas.

It was used to pay down the federal loan we took out to cover benefits paid  from the unemployment benefit system.  Normally the loan would be paid back by a tax rate increase on employers.  So, a tax cut for Indiana businesses (and that really is for those employers that were going to survive the economic crisis anyway) while Hoosiers wonder how they will eat."

This is exactly what is happening in Hawaii....and it's not just the affluent families leaving and moving their children from public to private schools.   We've watched as the private schools have largely and safely made in person learning work since the start of the fall, with still no final word on when our elementary kids will return to school in the spring - despite being within the health and safety metrics.  Some of our friends' kids have effectively checked out of the educational system completely, unfortunately. We are pushing to get teachers to the head of the essential workers line for the vaccines, but fear that many will refuse to take it or the union will demand that all the children have to get it before in class learning resumes (it's currently not approved for younger children).   And we've been so devastated by the pandemic effect on our tourist economy that our governor just announced furloughs (including teachers) in  January.

Because it's impossible to get elected with public school destruction as a platform, they've starved public schools of necessary funding, channeled it to private, charter schools. 

The current far right Republican Party wants to destroy or privatize for their personal gain (see: Post Office) every government function that interferes with their ability to make money or requires them to pay taxes for the benefit of all Americans. Thanks to Trump (whom they say has done more for them in 4 yrs than they accomplished in 40 yrs) they are very close to returning the country to a time when children didn't get an education if their parents couldn't afford private school and; where there's no Medicare, Social Security (Trump had already said he'd eliminate payroll tax that funds it, bankrupting it by 2023), workers' compensation, or Obamacare (see: GOP case before Supreme Court). Property is supreme and human value is based on wealth, a convenient measure for the billionaires funding the Republican Party.

That paltry sum is going to result in many families living in their cars or on the streets. What if we gave the same amount of money given to the pentagon, to public schools. Instead of giving tax cuts to wealthy every 4 years, take that money and hand it off to the schools. And by the way, the decision to go remote is not just to save teachers lives.

On top of that Elizalde is entitled to a $15,000 yearly payment into a retirement account established for her benefit.

The contract begins September 1, 2021 and ends August 31, 2023.

Of course there are less students in school, ergo simply temporarily change the rules of how schools are funded. Part of this is our inability to govern and effectively pivot quickly that is driving this funding crisis on paper. 

We are also lumping other social welfare programs under 'education'. Free meals and laptops are great but the vast income inequalities are being laid bare by Covid and lumping this type of relief under 'education' only fuels more negative politics.

Consequently, if we want an educated, productive society we MUST support public education.  The Covid pandemic has shined a light on the many aspects of our educational system that, while longstanding, have been allowed to fester.  It has given those who do not like public education (for any reason) and do not support teachers (for any reason) an excuse to vent their anger, and has given those who blindly support public education and teachers (esp. unions) cover to double-down n this support. While many of the public concerns in public education are exacerbated by inflexible union positions, unreasonable societal demands have painted teachers into corners that are untenable.  In today's public schools teachers are asked to educate our children and in addition to be social workers, health workers, and peacekeepers and are then criticized (or worse) when they try and fail in these disparate goals. As with other difficult issues in America, we need both  (all) sides to come together to address solutions; those who come to the table must come not as opponents but understanding that all are allies with the common goal of improving the system to better educate our children.  No whining, no vilification, just focus on the goal."

And poor Austin ISD lost its incredible CFO last year.  She navigated treacherous waters for them to keep the district financially intact, was a highly influential finance officer when the state was looking for input, but was ignored by the school board when promotional opportunities arose. They may be down 25 million but it is even worse having lost the high caliber financial leadership they had previously.  I have been watching district superintendent after district superintendent ""resign"" this year,  with boards more than happy to buy them out.  Parents complaining about masks appears to be some of the root cause.   Boards react to complaining parents, even if the complaints are not educationally related.

Educators with their format of power and control failed to listen and so here we are. Sal Khan of the Khan Academy also addressed the need for change in his book in 2012, ""The One World School House, Education Reimagined""."

Educated folks are much more democratic, and they see through the politics gaming systems. The right-wing folks do not like educated citizens, because they will lose.
America is suffering much from the uneducated people, especially those who refuse to trust science. (Right-Wingers)
Fund education or suffer."
2020-12-23 17:01:49,"The article fails to note that Los Angeles Unified School District has received over $500 million thus far in state and federal aid specifically directed to Covid-19 relief.  If, as the district's superintendent claims, their costs are $400 million, then are they posting a $100 million Covid-19 ""profit?""  In addition, all of the district's costs for distributing food likely will be reimbursed by the federal meal programs whose rules remain relaxed to allow school districts to offer meals to both students and the larger community.  Hundreds of millions, and perhaps in excess of a billion dollars in additional federal aid will come to the district from the most recent round of federal aid.  

While the Los Angeles school district has done an admirable job of offering free meals to needy communities during the pandemic, its track record on providing education is simply awful.  Its powerful teacher unions forced the district to close all of its schools and have thwarted all reasonable efforts to reopen and to provide more than bare-bones online instruction."
2020-12-23 16:59:46,"Reading all the attacks on teachers and teachers unions here (in an article not about teachers, but school funding) makes me immensely glad I left the profession a year and a half ago. I loved to teach, but the lack of respect by the general public for teachers encouraged abusive behavior by both parents and students towards teachers and after 27 years, I’d had enough.

I feel for my colleagues and teachers everywhere doing their best in this difficult time. There’s a teacher shortage, so all those thinking it’s a cakewalk: Why don’t you become a teacher?"
