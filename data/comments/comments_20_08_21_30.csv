2020-08-22 14:49,"I am appalled! There’s a distinct difference between personal privacy and public endangerment. The schools notify parents when there’s head lice. And we are quibbling about letting parents, students,, and teachers know if there’s a case of potentially lethal virus? Ignorance is not bliss!"
2020-08-22 14:49,"Any time a government or institution won't let the light shine in,  wants to operate behind closed doors, we should all be concerned.  We want an open society, not a secret one.  These people work for us.  When someone tells me ""trust me"", I want verification. I have learned to verify instead of trusting."
2020-08-22 14:51,Unbelievable that those words are coming from the superintendent.  How could someone come to the conclusion that this strategy is a good idea?
2020-08-22 14:52,"This is not only a problem in the K-12 world. For example, the University of Georgia reports bits and pieces such as the number of daily tests (a measly number) but precious little else. My university reports the number of positive cases and tests administered but not the number of students and staff in quarantine (which by now must be significant given the growing number of infections) or the number who have been hospitalized. 

The house of cards will collapse soon enough, and we will need to return to on-line instruction. But this assumes Governor Kemp and the University System of Georgia admit their mistake in re-opening - an assumption that many of us believe will not happen. Instead many of us are fatalistic - we will never close despite the growing body count. Kemp and the USG will ruin many lives before this is over, and their short-sighted insistence on ignoring the problem staring them in the face may very well get some people killed."
2020-08-22 15:01,"You can be transparent without giving away personal information. In the case of a public school, it is difficult to maintain complete privacy due to student and staff interactions throughout the school as well as rumor mills. Anyone who tests positive is going to be absent for two weeks, which is a red flag. And, speaking as a retired teacher, I would think most caring teachers would not be opposed to the school informing others of a positive case among their ranks. It gets more complicated for students, though.

Schools that are opaque regarding their pandemic response are going to find that the rumor mill will inevitably make things worse. What happens when (not if) a teacher or student has some other health emergency that requires a two week absence from school?"
2020-08-22 15:02,In most jurisdictions intentionally exposing some one to harm is against the law.  Charges of child endangerment are frequently leveled against care takers for far less egregious lapses.  Purposely hiding the COVID exposure of children would surely be covered by such laws.  These policies are just law suits waiting to happen.
2020-08-22 15:08,"I teach here in GA. 

This morning, I found out that we are deemed ""Essential,"" and if we have COVID and do not present with symptoms, we are expected to go to to work. 

We were compared to ""fast food workers."" What people do NOT understand is that, unfortunately, we have a large population of people who rely on ""dollar menus"" to feed families (I know of people who do this.) Providing food IS a vital service. 

I CAN do my job remotely; in fact, my district is poised to do this when our students return, and every county around mine is already teaching students virtually. 

We CAN teach remotely. We have been trained, adapted lessons--and unlike the last shut down, we are PREPARED. 

Going to work COVID positive but asymptomatic means I can spread it to my coworkers. I could potentially infect a coworker; I can potentially be infected (and I am ""high risk."") Sick is sick-symptoms or not. We have learned that being asymptomatic does NOT mean you don't spread it.

Someone--please explain this to me...because I am LOST."
2020-08-22 15:32,"Schools have long been addicted to citing privacy regulations as a way to keep parents at arms length. We can be sure that this same strategy will be regularly employed in the pandemic. My kids will be doing online school until we have a vaccine or reliable, regular testing and contact tracing (we're not even close)."
2020-08-22 16:01,"I’ve been so glad that our school board and superintendent have been open and honest from Day 1. It can be a two-edged sword because it has opened us up to criticism about opening but it’s also reassuring to know that when they have decided to close a school that they have done so out of concern for the rest of the students, faculty, staff and public health. There are no black and white decisions about schools opening for in-person instruction or remote learning. There are risks and benefits for both. We made different decisions for each of our children based on their individual needs and weighed the risk as best as we could for each of them. Knowing the number of cases at our school has been helpful and it gives me more confidence in the decisions our superintendent, Dr. Hightower, is making. That is a good measure of integrity: knowing he and the board have studied the risks, trying to do as much as they can to protect our kids and teachers (though I still wish we had a mask mandate), and being honest about the result. Having that trust in him and our board was actually a big factor in my decision to send a couple of my children back to school because I’ve watched them make hard choices for our kids in the past and I appreciate their attempts at transparency. I hope more districts will follow that example."
2020-08-22 15:14,"My school/district is doing the same thing. They will not let us know the numbers for students and teachers. They also claim privacy concerns. The non transparency  has caused extreme stress on all of the teachers and staff. 
When the union leaders try to take their concerns to the superintendent she claims she has executive power under this crisis. It is easy for her to say its safe to be back since she hasn't been in a classroom for decades.
 I personally quit this week because I couldn't handle it anymore. I had chest pains everyday from my anxiety (I never experienced anxiety before this.) Many teachers want to quit too but are unable to do it because they wouldn't be able to afford it. 
Politicians have never cared about schools or teachers. The education department has always been the first one to be cut. But now we matter. Us teachers were chosen as the sacrificial lamb to ""reopen"" the economy. The sacrificial lamb to show the virus is just like the ""flu."" And we will be the sacrificial lamb that will die in vain."
2020-08-22 15:27,Disease control is only complicated by mass hysteria control.  One  reported case run continuously on 24 hour news’ crawls gives people the impression everyone is the world Is bleeding from the eyes.  All we fear is fear itself.
2020-08-22 15:34,"Concealing from people that they have been exposed to COVID-19 is such a callous and dangerous thing to do. 

If we have learned anything about the disease it’s that it is highly transmissible and very deadly to certain sub-populations.  Such a policy will certainly be the cause of death for people in Georgia.  If you care about the children in your schools then you care about the people that care for them and they love and depend on."
2020-08-22 15:42,Charge the administrators with attempted murder or neglegent homicide. That will give them something to think about.
2020-08-22 14:53,"Wikipedia informs us: Examples of criminally negligent crimes are criminally negligent homicide and negligent endangerment of a child. Usually the punishment for criminal negligence, criminal recklessness, criminal endangerment, willful blindness and other related crimes is imprisonment, unless the criminal is insane (and then in some cases the sentence is indeterminate)."
2020-08-22 15:11,"""Doesn't look good politically""....What it""LOOKS"" like seems to be the main criteria upon which the most dreadful and destructive decisions are made (or not made) by the entire administration of the country. Are people really so afraid of or devoted to this monstrosity and his fellow orcs that they would endanger the lives of their own families? They should be sued for attempted murder."
2020-08-22 15:26,"Keeping news about infected school personnel from other personnel, kids and their parents is akin to negligent homicide, or worse.

Shut the schools until we have a cure and a vaccination. Otherwise, it is a certainty that people will spread the virus, that people will get sick, that people will die. 

Make up the lost school time later, when this is over, whenever that is, by running summer sessions, eliminating holidays, and by instituting longer school days."
2020-08-22 15:33,At some point someone will die because of this secrecy. At some point a child will die. They are playing with fire and peoples lives.
2020-08-22 15:40,"This is downright evil. Instead of contact tracing and notifying people that they may have been exposed so that they can take steps to protect their family and community, these schools are willfully denying people that information.  I hope the voters notice and get rid of any school board member and state governor or legislator that requires this deadly sectecy."
2020-08-22 15:46,"Georgia. You will pay for your for short sighted narrow thinking based on politics and keeping political con men in office. The People pay your salaries and need to know how many are sick and where to make choices that you should be making for them as leaders--closing classrooms or schools based on those numbers. Keeping these outbreaks secret is no secret, people talk, rumors spread, and they can be deadlier than any virus. Georgia will rue the day that it elected these leaders and these leaders will pay a heavy price if they do."
2020-08-22 14:56,"This is starkly reminiscent of Trump withholding his tax returns, firing anyone with a discouraging, “disloyal,” word and generally covering up anything that would benefit from a free and open airing appropriate to a democratic society. In other words, if they act like they’ve got something to hide, it’s a sure bet they do."
2020-08-22 15:14,"The real dangers in a pandemic (aside from the disease itself) are leaders who value their hold on power more than public safety.  

We have seen our President and now a variety of local administrators insist that COVID infections not be tested for or announced when positive.  

Just as Mayor Vaughn of Amity in the movie Jaws ordered Chief Brody and the Coroner to blame a death on a motor boat propeller accident rather than what it was,  a shark attack, we have a country with too many Mayor Vaughns protecting their jobs as they risk lives in their communities. 

It's criminally immoral behavior and deserving of impeachment and removal from office.  This will be remembered in November.   And history books will record these shameful and selfish ""leaders""."
2020-08-22 15:31,"i don't want to sound litigious, but parents should SUE school districts refusing to notify of any positive cases in their schools, if children and family members, especially the elders, teachers, custodians, and other school personnel, people with preexisting conditions are infected . these bureaucrats use ""privacy law"" as shield, disregarding public health in their community.   they will only feel others' ""pain"" if they are held accountable for their actions."
2020-08-22 15:53,"Georgia Law O.C.G.A. §16-5-60: Reckless Endangerment.
 The counsel for the school district in Georgia should inform their client and all others who withhold notification and withhold tracing information are open to a directed verdict, at trial, for personal injury damages.
  The defense of ""Anyone could have transmitted the virus"" will be answered by the fact of specific individuals employed by such districts tested positive and then were directly ordered by said district to inform no one!
  A student or fellow staff who dies due to Covid-19 will have recourse to massive damages for negligence and other 'endangerment'."
2020-08-22 15:27,"First of all, shame on the school officials and anyone else who is withholding Covid-19 related information from parents of schoolchildren. This is certainly unethical and may be unlawful.

Second, these same school officials seem to be ignorant of the fact that schoolchildren can carry the virus asymptomatically and unknowingly transfer it to family, friends and others they contact.

Finally, in the most comprehensive study to date of Covid-19 pediatric patients, Harvard/Massachusetts General Hospital researchers have shown that children can carry higher viral loads than seriously-ill, hospitalized Covid-19 patients, and thus may be super-spreaders of the disease. (Source: The Journal of Pediatrics, “Pediatric SARS-CoV-2: Clinical Presentation, Infectivity, and Immune Reponses,” August, 2020.

I certainly hope school officials and politicians begin use science as the basis for deciding how and whether to open schools."
2020-08-22 15:45,"Funny, states and school districts seem to have no concern about privacy when it comes to sharing student data with for-profit third-party vendors like Pearson."
2020-08-22 15:52,"The schools who hide the fact that their students have coronavirus are risking the health of every student, teacher, school employee and the community as a whole. It is no coincident that most of those schools and distrusts that hide the amount of Coronavirus in their schools are in Trump Country."
2020-08-22 15:35,"I teach in Texas. I am now considered an ""essential"" worker because suddenly it's important for kids to be in schools, regardless of the fact that for several years, the first program cut in state budgets was education. My first question was, ""Will they increase my pay now that I am working in a potentially dangerous environment?"" My second question was, ""Will they pay for any covid related health expenses since my insurance doesn't kick in until I have paid my $5000 deductible?"" My district is taking this situation seriously and is planning for a hybrid teaching situation, with students learning remotely or in person. Not telling the public that pays our salaries, as they like to remind us, is at best irresponsible and at worst criminal, knowing that the silence will lead to more infections and possibly death. Everything hidden will be exposed at some point."
2020-08-22 15:00,"Elementary & middle schools send notices to parents to anonymously disclose when a kid at the school contracts the flu or lice, . . . but not COVID?"
2020-08-22 15:22,"I was exposed to pertussis in my public school classroom in California at least half a dozen times several years ago when anit-vax idiocy in our area resulted in unvaccinated kids in our school and there was an outbreak. Each time I was *officially* notified by my county health authority, which is, I believe, legally bound to provide that notification of exposure to infectious disease in the classroom setting. Nothing about this notification revealed the identity of the individual who was infected - the entire process adhered rigidly to HIPPA and FERPA. Every family of every kid in all of my classes received the same official notification. I am not a lawyer, and perhaps this works differently depending on the state, but the action and words of this so-called ""superintendent"" strike me as blatantly illegal, not to mention unethical and just plain stupid. It clearly endangers the health of *everyone* in the community to suppress information in this manner."
2020-08-22 15:23,"170,000+ dead so far; countless others struggling to recover, or will have diminished health going forward. To know this, and to endanger the health of and demand silence from teachers about Covid-19 infections, to endanger the health of, and keep this knowledge from families who may have vulnerable people under their roof, to expose kids to a possible case of MSIS; well that is unconscionable, criminal and Orwellian."
2020-08-22 15:37,"Welcome to Russia and China.

trump’s reign has pushed administrators towards suppression of information, lies and coverups.

Not surprising at all....."
2020-08-22 15:57,"There are over 13000 superintendents making an average of 250K per year in this nation.  Many hire their friends.  School boards are overwhelmingly Republican.  Public school is a BUSINESS where mostly white people are in control of the resources.  

School districts will lie.  Children and families will die.  This nation abandoned it's people long ago.  You cannot crowdsource basic resources of housing, food, health care, a minimum income, public safety, or transparency of data, yet Americans still try. 

Wake up.  Demand change. It starts with your local schools and community.  If you haven't told your school board that you demand to know when there are positive COVID cases, if you haven't demanded effective PPE, if you haven't demanded a nurse in every school, then what have you been asking for?

After those demands, VOTE."
2020-08-22 16:08,"When you tell staff  they cannot discuss their own diagnosis, that  isn't a concern over privacy.  It is a suppression of the right of free speech.  It's ok to tell the person next to you there is a fire if there really is a fire.  NOPE, these Georgia officials are just afraid to tell the truth because it makes them look irresponsible.  Which they do by being even more irresponsible.  I thank God every day that I don't live in a state as poorly governed as Georgia."
2020-08-22 15:59,"This is why there should be a unified, federal response that includes policies on notifying the public. Without one, corporations and institutions make self-serving decisions that harm (and kill) people and destroy the trusting bonds our society depends on."
2020-08-22 16:04,"'Essential workers'= cannon fodder.

And what are the students but the next crop of 'essential workers'?

Organize for power, organize for the well-being of yourselves and your students (which depends on your own well-being)--and then exert that power."
2020-08-22 16:06,"In Georgia, this is about stirring up as much discord as possible because Georgia is now a purple state. It’s about firing up the rural QAnon folks against the urban progressives. But it’s also about football. All over the South, this is primarily about football. Schools can’t operate without the revenue from football games, and people can’t fathom a fall without football.

Yesterday afternoon, I had to drive into town, and I watched the line of school buses loaded down with football players, cheerleaders and band members descend upon my little nothing-town. Parents followed behind them, then poured into the stadium, where later on social media, I saw pictures of people not social distancing, few wearing masks, tailgating under tents, going about life as if nothing has changed — a horrifying but unsurprising sight.

Then I looked at pictures of other counties. It happened everywhere. Some of the worst behavior was in Baldwin County (the beach). Kids crammed into the student section, no masks, when this county is already on fire due to beachgoers.

Please understand that the main reason these schools decided to go back in-person is because of football. They are withholding case information to ensure that they can keep playing football. 

We are crazy down here, and not just about SEC football. In fact, the Friday night lights will end up killing more people than college games. Watch for cases to explode all over the South in the next two weeks. Schools know this will happen."
2020-08-22 16:07,Schools must report to at least those that came in contact with a teacher or student that tests positive.  How can one quarantine?
2020-08-22 16:13,"How is that even legal, to withhold such vital information. Should someone come to harm because of it, that school be held liable."
2020-08-22 16:08,"Reading this article, what rings through is the need for a coordinated National COVID response based on science and data. This virus will continue to spread widely and the mayhem from chaotic responses is causing broader exposure than is necessary with untimely deaths, and for some, debilitating illness, to say nothing about horrendous health care costs as well as protracted economic peril. Maybe all schools should take a  “gap” year from in-person instruction unless you have documented low transmission rates in your community and system of contact tracing that’s effective. For sure, there will be a need for remedial catch-up once we can resume in-person instruction for all children, but I suspect that will be a much smoother and safer transition for children and families then what’s about to transpire."
2020-08-22 16:31,"Non-disclosure in this case is willful concealment, the school district can and should be sued"
2020-08-22 17:03,"So it is too risky for Republicans to hold a convention, but it's required to send our kids, and teachers into crowded indoor classrooms?

The idea that schools would not notify parents about Covid outbreaks is simply evil."
2020-08-22 16:27,"Hold those officials who refuse to release Covid-19 data and information to the public criminally and civilly liable. 

Information can be released without violating individual privacy laws and concerns. It is imperative that the press, the public, and advocates for public health and safety threaten to take to court, to their state governor's office and legislature their demands to ensure that the public at large receive immediate, timely, and essential information regarding Covid-19 cases within their towns, cities, counties, and states. Any oppositional and recalcitrant politicians must be firmly continually confronted.

Those public officials who refuse to provide accurate, timely, and essential life-saving statistics must be exposed and be sued with unrelenting pressure.

It is clear that those states whose Governors and State Legislatures are controlled by Conservatives and Republicans are the ones which are making every attempt to conceal from the public the necessary information regarding public health and safety that is their legal duty to provide. 

We say unto those Conservatives and Republicans:  you will continue be scrutinized closely. You words and actions, if they deny the public the health and safety information they need, will be considered criminal actions on your part."
2020-08-22 16:56,"It is worth noting that the Camden County School district serves the military children who have parents stationed at Naval Submarine Base Kingsbay. Military families don’t have much of a choice in duty station or the schools their children attend. In this current situation, schools not providing information about COVID directly affects the health and safety of service members in both the Navy and Marine Corps."
2020-08-22 16:53,"Shades of central China, when local officials hid Coronavirus data from national officials. Parents should demand accountability for the safety of their children. Elected local school boards need to learn that parents will hold them responsible for craven concealment by (tenured) Superintendents. And the Superintendents need to know that they will not be reappointed when their contracts conclude."
2020-08-22 16:46,"The Republician party is willing to kill your children.

2020-08-22 17:00,"Nothing says radical right American wing like denying reality, common sense, and the common good.

Nice GOPeople.

November 3 2020"
2020-08-22 16:22,I sure would like to know if I had come into contact with an infected person. Are these communities even contact tracing?  How many people are gonna sicken and even die because Republican politicians are rolling the dice on their well-being?
2020-08-22 17:13,"If this is the policy for public schools, then what is the policy for private and charter schools?  Oh, that's right, they don't have to answer to the public, to teacher's unions, or to anybody.  I feel for the teachers whose concerns about their health are so casually and constantly dismissed.  It's almost as if the people in charge are doing everything possible to spread COVID."

2020-08-22 17:30,"“'Staff who test positive are not to notify any other staff members, parents of their students or any other person/entity that they may have exposed them,' Jon Miller, the district’s deputy superintendent, wrote in a confidential email on Aug. 5.""

Seriously?   This happened in the United States of America?  SERIOUSLY?  I'm speechless.  And very, very angry."
2020-08-22 16:07,"Another reason to kick these anti-American Republicans out of office, and actually jail some of them for purposely endangering the lives of their citizens.  Why isn't anyone talking about this? Trump is guilty of manslaughter, but putatively protected by ""executive privilege""."

2020-08-22 16:28,"With the gagging of people re: sharing information about infections in schools, I can only imagine that the plantiffs bar is salivating, hoping to get their hands on a case/cases ASAP."
2020-08-22 17:52,"While I feel some compassion for the predicament that these parents and teachers find themselves in, they all should be reminded of some rather salient facts.  Specifically, with these despicable people in charge, the people living (and dying) in these districts must necessarily share the blame.  They are, after all, the ones who elected these (generally right-leaning and conservative) school board members, who in turn hired these superintendents.  Maybe something other than a knee-jerk ""I'll never vote for a Democrat"" perspective is due some reconsideration?"
2020-08-22 17:48,"My district is the same. They send out emails with phony pronouncements that the safety of the faculty and students is their number one priority. On Friday, they just denied every accommodation requested by teachers in poor or questionable health with legitimate notes from their doctors as well as hardship requests. No explanations, no alternatives, no plans to work with faculty. Multiple teachers and parents with their lawyer on “speed dial” have indicated to me and others I know in the district that they intend to get very litigious very quickly. Don’t believe the safety performance art by schools, as it’s all PR. “Thoughts and prayers” will be the next lip-service PR we hear from them when their toilet-paper thin “plans” fail."
2020-08-22 18:07,"Not disclosing cases is the definition of insanity in the midst of a highly contagious pandemic. We all understand the reason for and value of medical privacy laws, but there are obvious circumstances where disclosure is essential to public health. However vigilant a school's staff, it would be impossible to identify every single person who came in contact with an infected individual and it is ludicrous to demand that people keep secret something of such consequence.

Back in March, well after school had shut down, about a teacher who had tested positive stating the dates that the teacher worked and the length of time, had I been in the school during those dates, I should quarantine. By then I was ten days into self quarantine based on the assumption that I might have been exposed as I went in and out of certain public places, including schools. The notice also failed to name the person stating privacy concerns, but inevitably I found out through the grapevine who it was. 

This was early on in the pandemic and understandably clumsily executed. At this point, with the country suffering from the worst statistics in the world, it would be unconscionable."
2020-08-22 18:01,"This piece has reminded me that I began exploring how state laws affect this.

2020-08-22 18:41,Teachers are being asked to be a canary in a coal mine while districts get to hide behind opacity and gag orders? I really hope that young people considering a career in public education first pay close attention to how today’s current events reflect just how America will think about their potential lifelong service and contributions.
2020-08-22 19:09,"The official Trump policy is to ignore the pandemic and hope it goes away.  Schools and educators are using the excuse of privacy to carry out this policy.  But fighting the pandemic effectively is only possible when privacy rights are curtailed.  

If I am carrying the virus, I have a right to know and so do people I have been in contact with.  They need to know not just that they have been in contact with a person who might have been carrying the disease, but also who that person was.  Otherwise they will spend time and mental energy trying to spot the people they used to be in contact with who are no longer in contact with them, and wondering for each person whether it is coincidence or that that person is self-quarantining.  

Similarly, the pandemic is much more easily and quickly controlled if wearing a mask is not an individual choice but rather a public mandate.  Areas that do not limit individual rights and privacy will have more pandemic and have it longer, and individuals living in those areas who want the pandemic contained can fight with their neighbors, hide in their houses, or temporarily leave the area (perhaps moving in with a city-dwelling relative).  

Ultimately the pandemic will be controlled in some areas and not in others.  These areas will be tempted to conceal the extent to which it is not under control, which will be revealed when hospitals become swamped and are unavailable for other medical emergencies."
2020-08-22 18:15,"If I lived in a school district where the superintendent told staff to purposely hide Covid-19 exposure information I would be petitioning the school board to remove that superintendent.

Also, health privacy laws don’t prevent a infected teacher from telling people she came in contact with that she has tested positive for Covid if she chooses to do so.  Nor do they prevent schools from notifying parents if their students were in contact with someone who tested positive as long as they don’t identify that person in any way.  Schools send home letters to parents to tell them their child has been exposed to lice, but for some reason they can’t do the same for Covid-19?"
2020-08-22 18:23,"“Keep teachers quiet?”

Somehow it was worthy of all the blame for the pandemic when Wuhan officials failed to publicly identify a handful of cases, but now it's admirable for Republicans in America to do the same with thousands????"
2020-08-22 19:16,This is not going to end well. Vulnerable people will become infected when it could have been avoided. Some administrators will wind up with blood on their hands.

2020-08-22 18:28,"It is obvious that when schools do not disclose information when teachers and kids have tested positive for COVID, they are protecting the politicians who are trying to force kids into schools that are probably not safe. They are trying to reinforce a fiction, that COVID isn’t real or it isn’t a health and safety concern. The scariest thing for anyone to be called is “essential worker”. What they really mean is, nonessential human. And the kids who inevitably get exposed and get sick, and their families are just collateral damage."
2020-08-22 19:05,"Not surprising from Republican Denialists. But, in addition to being suppression of information, it may be criminal; doesn't it abet the spread of infection and disease? Any different from hiding a defect in an overpass?
 I don't understand how a population (that can sue the hairdresser for cutting hair 2"" too short) can't muster a lawsuit against the killer-menace Trump. 
Or, what's quicker, a credible social-media site that puts out the suppressed news, but without names. If the Trumpers lie about it, their liability is magnified (no pun intended)."
2020-08-22 18:23,"Just inside the Canadian border, about 800 miles from me, returning to school is not concerning teachers, parents, grandparents and citizens like they are in the United States. Why? Because Canada is, and has been for about 2 months, living with almost no virus. If there is an outbreak, it is detected and stopped immediately. Yesterday in Minnesota, 850  positive cases, 15 cases (one in the hospital) from those who attended Sturgis, S.D. School openings are data driven. Right now it looks like many in Metro area may need to be On-line only if this keeps up. The Republican Senate will not be happy. If only they would promote our Governor's mandate to wear masks indoor, then maybe our schools could open!"
2020-08-22 18:24,"This is unconscionable. Unethical.  Just wrong.  Reporting communicable diseases is a public health requirement that became less common because of the stigma of HIV.  But there is a reason why such reporting and tracking has been part of public health practice since John Snow located the public water pump infected with cholera in London in the 1850s. 

My mother died of COVID in May.  She was in a nursing home.  As she did not leave the facility, the virus came to her in the form of a staff member who was likely asymptomatic and didn't know they had the virus.  Widespread testing of staff was still a struggle due to lack of resources and coordination with local labs.  So an infected teacher 1) goes home to a household where someone works in health care, and that person infects others, or 2) infects a child who is asymptomatic but infects a family member."
2020-08-22 20:25,"At the height of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Italy there were 100 new cases per day per million people and the country goes full lockdown.  Texas today has 300 new cases per day per million people and we are opening universities, daycares, high schools, etc.  Why is that?
The individual American thinks (s)he knows everything that is best for him, the opposite of actuality: he knows nothing, especially science, math, statistics.  The Italians listened to and followed epidemiology rules and emerged today to semi-normalcy.  Here, American will go the way of the 1918 pandemic, i.e., the country acts as if we learned nothing of virology this past century, and just let the virus course through the population pretty much unchecked.

We are living in the 21st century. Parents and students have the right to ask information that is related to their child endangerment. Intentionally exposing someone into harm situation is against the law, and that is what the counties hiding information about the COVID-19 cases are doing. Counties should provide any sort of information about COVID-19 cases in the school and should report the data. Counties often say that the most important thing is the safety of the children and that they are working their best to keep the students safe. Well, certainly what they are doing is not the case."

Or how about this: New York City, another decidedly blue area, forbids its tracers from asking whether a person who tests positive took part in a mass protest. And then they said there was no evidence that the protests were linked to Covid. How would they know?"

Way back when, my son showed up to 9th grade and got the swine flu in 3 days! Then he had pneumonia. Then the virus attacked his leg muscle. Then I got sick...and got pneumonia. Then my other son got sick and got pneumonia too. It was ugly.

The two most populous states decided against strictness & rules for a while, then one gave in leaving the other open and we went from less than 100 dead to 550 in a very short time. The state of Victoria accounts for 462 out of 550 deaths & 18,600 confirmed cases.  Masks are now compulsory in city areas & on public transport throughout our country.

My state has been  extremely careful, not lock-downs but severe restrictions and for all this year we've had just 6 deaths.  Now all states have the rule that anyone entering has to go into quarantine for 14 days at their own expense.

China has the world's largest population and it would be impossible to control a pandemic without lock-downs.  That said I agree that Xinjiang is being treated harshly.

Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies.

Between the two, it shows there is a clear majority of parents of both parties who want to see their children back in school and it's unequivocal.  At least 55% did not even consider keeping their children home, and that's among those who disapprove of Trump. Throw in those who approve of Trump and probably 70% did not consider keeping their kids home and 90%+ wouldn't keep their kids home if the schools were open (a better question, BTW, ""would you send your kids to school if the schools are open?"")

When I politely mentioned that they should wear masks if they were going to be near people, the mother said ""I'm in healthcare"" and the father said ""I'm in law enforcement,"" as if that meant anything.  It was astounding.  When I called campus police, they thanked me and sent someone out.

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html</a>

If the US as a whole does not meet the standard for 'Substantial Uncontrolled Transmission' then that level of transmission is meaningless.

Take a look at Table 3 for the reference source above.  Does your child seem like they will scrupulously adhere to the mitigation guidelines?  If you have a young child (or an immature adult child) do they have the knowledge and discipline necessary to execute these actions?  Do you have confidence that the behavior of the other students and faculty will be safe?  If your answer is no, to any of these questions, then you have all of the information you need to guide your actions.  Do not unnecessarily expose your child to possible sickness, permanent disability, or death."
2020-08-25 18:33,"Knowing that the possibility of community COVID-19 Coronavirus spread could be high, several colleges and universities encouraged the full return of their on campus students, accepting full payment of tuition and on campus dorm fees. As students face 'no second chances' for engaging in social behavior that has long been heralded as a central part of the higher education experience -- College and university administrators need to also be held to the same standard they are exacting upon these students."
2020-08-25 19:51,"The problem with this discussion is that the private schools are opening here up to second grade and the public schools are not. The department of health approved the private schools to open but not the public. Same data, different person paying the bill. So for 8-20k/year per child, schools are safe to open. Public schools here are opening “camps” that are socially distanced, parents pay, babysitting which take place in the same building as the public education. Apparently, when you pay 20/year, all of a sudden schools are safe to open."
2020-08-25 18:58,"If schools really want to have students understand the severity of violating the rules, and threatening the health of others, they should put out a written set of rules and at the bottom make a simple declaration:

""If we have to suspend you for violating these rules, you will immediately get an F in (and be dropped from) the course with the largest number of credits on your schedule.  If we have to suspend you a second time, you will get an F in (and be dropped from) the course with the second highest number of credits, and so on.  No excuses. No do-overs. No refunds.""

I am going to bet that the incidence of ""violations' will drop like a rock, especially after a few students get hit with the stated penalty for violation of the rules.  It isn't just the financial penalty that will hurt.  Getting dumped from courses, especially basic courses that other build on, will really sting, because that will mess up one's academic schedule for a long time.

(Truth in advertising:  at one point in my life, I was a faculty member in Engineering at a local state university.)"
2020-08-25 18:29,"Like everything else in our country right now, this is posited as an either/or, all or nothing scenario with no middle ground. I am a liberal independent who would have liked to see much better management of the pandemic, including a drive to make in person school work. If we weren’t so busy arguing we could have actual solutions, like in-person small outdoor classes, or outdoor masked school meetings combined with zoom or asynchronous instruction. But we’re too busy embracing our new can’t do spirit to come up with a reasonable plan. It’s either pretend everything’s fine and we can do normal school, or zoom as far as the eye can see. Both terrible options."
2020-08-25 20:10,"Our age is burdened with wall to wall news that spends more time cooking up view interest than in researching facts to present good information. The consistent reporting since this novel virus started was founded on biased information, the obvious but not the full story. It was hitting older people and those with pre-existing conditions and only a tenth of them and even less significant a proportion of the younger people. But no context to understand what that all meant, just opinions about how serious it might get and all the exciting stuff. Meanwhile, young people understand that they are not going to be sick in the proportions of older people but the lack of immunity in everyone meant that the human race was an expressway for the spread of the virus. The amount if illness and the impact was likely to be enormous and would disrupt everyone's lives a lot.

So even today, one sees young people, across all groupings whether it's race or family incomes are not being safe and they are spreading the virus, super spreading it, and endangering everyone."
2020-08-25 20:13,Not sure why NYC public schools are not fully reopening with such low positive rates.  I doubt it will get much better than this.
2020-08-25 20:18,"Colleges knew it is more likely than not that some students are going to engage in risky behavior. 

If their intention is to keep students and faculty safe, then the best way to do so would be to utilize online learning and send students home. 

Let’s not forget that their ability to charge full tuition and fees is looming in the background, and colleges should not be absolved of responsibility for this situation."
2020-08-25 20:27,"I think it’s very important that schools, colleges, and universities are open for vulnerable students: students with disabilities, those who are low income, without access to technology at home, or live with vulnerable family members, etc. Unfortunately it’s really hard/impossible to develop a set of criteria that assesses vulnerabilities equitably. Most faculty I know are torn between knowing their schools should close and knowing how our most vulnerable students will lose on top of all of their hardships."
2020-08-25 20:35,"This is a win win for college administrations. I suspect suspended students forfeit any refunds on tuition and housing. By opening in-person classes and then ejecting rule breakers, the colleges protect their revenue stream both ways."
2020-08-25 20:41,"My daughter is leaving NYC and returning to Portland, OR in a couple of days for her sophomore year at a small liberal arts college with a mix of online and in-person classes. Everyone living on campus has a single room even if the room was formerly a double or triple. It was a hard decision whether to return, but gap year options such as a job or travel are limited, and she wanted to maintain her academic momentum. She’s prepared to follow the mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines, but is worried about feeling lonely. They are not supposed to visit one another’s dorm rooms or gather, even with masks, in common areas of the dorms. Meals will be eaten alone in their rooms.

College administrators have no business blaming young people for acting like youths in a situation that has been grossly mismanaged by the federal government. Students are being taken advantage of by colleges looking at their bottom lines: yes higher education is grossly expensive, but the government has also not helped colleges and universities weather the pandemic. 

Students see that they are at low-risk for Covid symptoms and at high risk for depression and anxiety due to social isolation. Rather than draconian restrictions against socializing, colleges should sanction small social bubbles. Otherwise we WILL see large parties and gatherings, more expulsions, and more school closures. Putting all the blame on students is the wrong approach."
2020-08-25 20:55,"566 cases among students, faculty and staff at the University of Alabama where classes resumed last week. Astonishing. If universities are serious about keeping students and faculty safe, they will move to online only teaching ASAP."
2020-08-25 20:59,There is absolutely no reason why classes and seminars at university level cannot be conducted via Zoom. My Advanced Greek class meets online and it’s very effective.
2020-08-25 21:12,"Love how these universities in their rush to collect tuition are ""suprised"" by the actions of the student body. If they truly cared for the well being they would not have reopened on- campus learning. Just look in the mirror administrators to find the real culprit here."
2020-08-25 21:16,"I thought the idea was to flatten the curve, not shut down society completely?!  Or is the new standard, no positive tests whatsoever?"
2020-08-25 20:23,"What did these schools think would happen? 

The University of Alabama, for example, told these kids to sign apartment leases. They opened the dorms. They said it would be safe to pile them into classrooms. To eat at the restaurants. To frequent the bars. And now they’re SHOCKED that in just one week of being on campus, cases have exploded to nearly 600? Faux outrage, anybody?

The University of Alabama is my 2x alma mater and I can’t stand to hear anyone make fun of it, but I’m beyond done with the godless, money-grubbing ignorance. Because what’s going to happen is that the classes will all go online, but here these kids are, stuck in leases, stuck in dorms, when they could’ve saved money, could’ve been safer, by staying home. 

These universities are not stupid. They knew this would happen. They simply needed the room and board money. They needed to justify the football season. They just generally didn’t care when they made this decision — and still don’t.  And we should ALL be outraged that this university and others have played the pandemic this way."
2020-08-25 20:33,"Kidz will be Kidz - College Presidents and Boards are not. In most instances their motivation to re open was greed $$$$. This includes continuing the lucrative D 1 football season. Are you listening Syracuse? As an added bonus these schools put their faculty, employees and the neighboring community at increased risk. 

As the universities are motivated by money, the remedy should be money: massive tort suits against the universities, their presidents and their boards. This is necessitated by Trump’s lack of action consistent with his statement that he accepts no responsibility for the pandemic"
2020-08-25 20:44,"Most college students are in the 18-22 age group, so what did colleges expect? Their hormones are raging, so the urge to party and be with friends and the opposite sex is overwhelming.

As you'd expect, fraternities are among the worst offenders and this is the time of year for ""rush."" This should have been foreseen by all universities, and it's hard to believe they allowed the Greek houses to remain open. Didn't they see Animal House?"
2020-08-25 20:50,"Hey. Half of America voted for Trump who says masks are optional, no surprise here. The next new president has to concentrate on educating Americans. It’s kind of the foundation."
2020-08-25 21:02,"I have taught for decades remotely. There’s no excuse other than amoral leadership* that only cares about money and not human lives why we can’t make this world safely and effectively.

2020-08-25 19:48,"The first to outsiders to Hawaii, whalers in the 1840s, brought smallpox that almost wiped them out. But the whalers didn’t have smallpox; they just carried the smallpox virus. We all have pathogenic micro-organisms like pneumococcus in us all the time, but we don’t have pneumonia. Testing for covid has found 5.4 million “cases” but millions who had it and stayed healthy will never be counted. Counting is meaningless.

Those pushing covid testing know. No US President has ever lost re-election in a good economy. Trump’s economy was excellent. He was a shoo-in. This lockdown is a catastrophe they are not wasting; forget the destruction and deaths the lock-down is causing. 

We can count deaths; death rates matter. The US death rate is lowest of any modern country; Germany is half again higher; Sweden, Spain, are triple; Italy; UK are 4 times+; France, Belgium are 5.  

The lock-downers don't care. They want power. They want the next election. You don't matter."
2020-08-25 20:25,"Trump has made this a war of all against all, totally denaturing trust up and down the line, and we have all collaborated in that -- well, most of us -- because Americans want what they want and don't care about anyone else.

Slight exaggeration. But only slight. It's just sickening -- and exactly what was gamed out in all the tabletop exercises. 

It's repulsive: before Trump, precious little preparation was made for something all of us knew or should have known (Contagion film, anyone? High school biology class? Common sense?), and certainly those in power at any level. Trump destroyed what little preparation there was, then ignored it. Made it far worse: 90% of deaths attributable to his sociopathic ignorance. Then, the government, meaning mostly but not entirely the Republicans, made it ""your money or your life,"" as if ""economy"" and ""public health"" were at odds with each other. We chose to allow mass unemployment, rather than paying salaries through companies, as Germany did -- some large chunk: 100% for the poorest up to nothing for those who live off of equities. (Those, of course, were taken care of: infinite and endless support through the Fed.)

And here we are. Mask wars. Etc. 

We failed. All of us; some a lot more than others. And miserably.

My guess is, Trump will be rewarded with another term, whether by winning outright or just bluffing a loss till everyone gives up. 

Yeah, no Belarus for us. We can't be bothered. Not with what's coming soon to Netflix."
2020-08-25 19:54,"It is amazing at this far into a pandemic that we have to read that going or not going to school is divided along political lines. Politics should not a play any role in these types of decisions. The COVID virus does not discriminate between Republicans and Democrats when it infects and kills. All decisions need to be made made good science and available data.
This is what is wrong with America in a nutshell. Republicans put too much faith in ""conservative"" ideology although I am having a harder and harder time understanding what ""conservative ideology"" is for or against. Some things are obvious like abortion but who is not for clean air and water? Who is not for racial justice? Who is not for providing assistance to the poor? Who is for bigotry? Who is not for equal opportunity for men, women, people of color and the disabled?
I could go on but it seems that if ""conservatives"" are against or do not support any of the above then they have lost their moral center and their empathy towards their fellow Americans. Their ignorance and indifference is astounding."
2020-08-25 20:02,"The truth is we could have saved a lot of jobs if America had ramped up testing; people were willing to socialize in smaller groups, in their homes or apartments or -- God forbid, outside sitting apart from each other.  But we are a selfish country, more selfish than any other in the world. Yes, our economy is great and our freedoms are broad, but when push comes to shove, we haven't been all for one and one for all since WW II."
2020-08-25 20:16,"The problem with colleges is that young people have gotten the message they are unlikely to die from covid (reinforced by our boneheaded president), but they haven't gotten the other message, that they have a very real risk of severe illness, hospitalization and possibly permanent organ damage. They are never going to hear that from any agency that reports to Trump, nor from Fox News.

In my area, young adults are a tiny fraction of our deaths but something like 40% of hospitalizations."
2020-08-25 21:11,"The central role of administrative malfeasance and conservative defiance of social distancing measures has ensured that, in the future, this will be referred to as the Republican pandemic."
2020-08-25 20:06,"So far, we haven't heard about a single death as a result of Universities reopening. But 2 weeks from now chances are that we will. And these deaths will more likely be from faculty or staff, those who have been forced to remain indoors at the pleasure of the bloated university administration. 
They think they are saving hundreds of millions of dollars by doing this, but the moral consequences of their actions will just precipitate their downfall. No future prospective student will apply to a university that doesn't hesitate to put the lives of their employees on the line for money."
2020-08-25 20:34,"American college kids will be kids, with their parent's blessings, which means that their priorities are ;
1. Partying first
2. Learning something, maybe"
2020-08-25 21:13,"Reopening so soon in the midst of a pandemic is reckless and yet more evidence of Trump era mismanagement and lethal negligence.  Universities and schools should take a stand and refuse to operate except online, where it is safest.

Children should not be allowed back at school while there is risk of Covid contagion (or risk of gun violence, one problem at a time).

Why the USA is refusing to completely lockdown to get a grip on the crisis makes no sense.  A complete lockdown has been the only thing that has worked, why?  Because the virus is invisible and our testing systems are simply not advanced enough yet to trace everyone (unless you live somewhere like South Korea).

In Spain we are facing similar backlash, people protesting, complaining of anxiety and depression from the previous lockdown; and refusing to wear masks because its too restricting; bad for the economy etc.  None of these feelings of depression and anxiety over lockdowns, fear for the economy etc., will exist if you succumb to Covid. 

There are broader issues to consider, e.g. if  we are to tackle global warming, a shift to online work is necessary...so we might as well get used to it now.  If there is one thing humanity is known for its our ability to adapt (see Darwin), we can get used to working online, those with weaker immune systems should be grateful, and so will our over-polluted planet."
2020-08-25 20:16,"Instead of ""The *powerful* teachers’ union has *demanded* that the city update ventilation systems..."" why not write ""The teachers' union has urged the city to update ventilation systems...""?
When other groups voice their concerns, they are not automatically characterized as ""powerful"" and ""demanding,"" so I wonder why the teachers union typically is. The language used here seems like unnecessary demonizing in this context."

2020-08-25 20:47,I am really hoping for a Nick Saban rant blaming this on Trump when football season is cancelled. He’s the one and only man with the power to turn Alabama blue. Really.
2020-08-25 21:55,"Regarding the colleges penalizing students who break the COVID-19 rules. I  guess I have to question the wisdom of opening the colleges in the first place. Evidently the administrators haven't learned that until there is a vaccine, the virus sets the rules, not the administrators.

 I have to wonder....if the administrators were in a different position, say liquor manufacturers or distributors, would they be hiring alcoholics and then penalizing them for sampling the product? 

College students socialize.  Period."
2020-08-25 22:17,"I find it alarming that when questioned about the new testing protocols, the CDC deferred to HHS. Not testing people who have had close contacts with COVID  people is a recipe for disaster. We know that asymptomatic people can spread the virus, so why wouldn’t we want to test and trace to contain the spread? All signs point to one of two things- either there aren’t enough tests to sustain the current rate of tests being performed, or the Trump administration is attempting to “improve” the numbers by testing less people. Either way, this does not bode well for things to come. 
This should raise a lot of alarms, but unfortunately it won’t because this administration has mastered the art of distraction."
2020-08-25 23:08,"Clearly the CDC walk back is in support of Trump’s ‘if you test less there will be less cases’, so that numbers fall as the election approaches."
2020-08-25 23:20,The irony of this change is that the percent of positive cases (a much more important statistic) will inevitably climb dramatically
2020-08-25 22:14,"the fda and cdc have both given in to trump. they have failed their original duties. the cdc blew it from the get go especially regarding testing and they, and now the fda, have floundered ever since."
2020-08-25 23:00,"Given the fact that it’s been proven that asymptomatic individuals are just as capable of transmitting the virus as symptomatic ones, this seems like a particularly foolhardy move.  But then again it’s perfectly in keeping with public health policy in the time of Trump."
2020-08-25 21:43,"'Syracuse University suspended 23 students last week after a gathering on the campus quad that the dean of students decried as “incredibly reckless.”'

2020-08-25 21:53,"This article reminds me the times article “When the World Shut Down, They Saw it Open” that online access to education, conferences, and working with teams, etc. is one of the best things to have happened for people with disabilities in a long time. Must we keep assigning divisive blame to groups for school or no school? It is all a risk to everyone it seems without BOTH an effective vaccine approved by a nonpartisan F.D.A. and responsively responsible C.D.C. Why is the blame on parents while the trumpian economy still being valued over people’s YPLL and our Planet? Competent leadership would be a more equitable priority."
2020-08-25 21:58,"We are not paying attention to the Science. The US is continuing to fail in the fight against this Virus and it will continue to do this until there is a change in this administration as trump say's continually that it will just go away.The FDA is has become  Political, following trump to the detriment of the citizens. The FDA is not following it's own protocols for safety. It is nearing the end of summer and the numbers are not flatting as it has in Europe. The US will not have a robust economy until the Virus is under control. 
Vote Biden to help the US recover."
2020-08-25 22:34,"Obviously a political attempt at using a ‘medical’ reason to lower infection numbers, when it appears more and more evident that it is the asymptomatic people who keep on transmitting the virus without realizing it! 

How are the most conscientious people able to keep their more vulnerable loved ones safe, or is the administration purposely aiming to get everyone sick once and for all to achieve ‘herd immunity’, like cattle driven to slaughter ?

I doubt this is the strategy currently employed by professional sports leagues to keep any hotspot contained, for good reason!

I hope the People will insist on being tested, symptoms or not, and that the medical communities will disregard these new guidelines."
2020-08-25 23:08,"In Hong Kong, where there were 19 cases on Tuesday out of a city approximately the same size as Manhattan, they are about to offer free voluntary testing to everyone. After this we will know what can be safely reopened fully. Rather than hiding the data, use the data to beat the virus."
2020-08-25 22:28,"Well, if you don't do the testing, you won't have as many reported cases.  Who might think that would be a good thing?"
2020-08-25 22:53,"How unfortunate that every time the CDC or the FDA, come out with a new proclamation despite withering criticism by the real experts, it seems that these formerly independent agencies have been pressured by the White House.  This is no exception; obviously limiting testing to symptomatic patients will greatly reduce the reported number of cases, since up to 40% of infected  people have NO symptoms.  Then the president can claim that cases are on the decline, right before the election.  Similarly, he wants to claim success in using Plasma therapy, before the results are verified. Even more dangerously, he wants to begin using an unproven vaccine before the election.   

We all want effective therapeutics and vaccines as soon as possible. But too many products are rushed to market with inadequate testing,  and later prove either ineffective or actually harmful.  Remember Hydroxychloroquine!

A normal president would care more about the health of his constituents than his own election."
2020-08-26 0:03,"Good old CDC. Their guidelines are based on economics and not science. Not enough masks tell people they don’t need them. Don’t want to purchase German covid tests wait months to create your own ,that fail. Not enough tests to go around or maybe under pressure from the administration to make the country “look good”, make the guidelines more restrictive. Wow to think they had so many years since the 1918 flu to get a plan and this is it."
2020-08-26 0:11,"First the FDA approves for Emergency Use a drug that only is effective (if at all) in a subset of patients in very early stages of disease. Only a few days later, the CDC dissuades people who don't have symptoms (but may be pre-symptomatic) from being tested.  All of this takes place in the context of Americans waiting days, and sometimes up to a week, to get test results.  I doubt I need to spell it out, but here it goes: How will convalescent plasma get to the patients in time if those who are pre-symptomatic are systematically dissuaded from being tested?"
2020-08-25 22:14,"Regarding the new CDC guideline today for no tests on asymptomatic persons -

One of the few therapeutic options we have found to help people so far, is to diagnose their COVID within the first 3 days, and give them convalescent plasma 

This is a small subset of all COVID patients, admittedly, and it showed a relative improvement in persons less than 80 years old, in other words around 65% of patients did well with the low-titre IV plasma treatment vs around 74% of patients with high-titre antibody plasma treatment who did well.  These are small portions of everyone who gets COVID, but at least the treatment seems helpful in this sub-group.  [And it is NOT a ""35% improvement in COVID patients as a group"", which was spread around by Mr. Trump and the head of the FDA.] 

How the heck are doctors supposed to help communities get ahead of this pandemic if government agencies limit testing ? 

Studies show that people are infected and infectious for about 7 days before symptoms show up.   

So I don't agree that it makes sense to not test ""asymptomatic"" people.   The people you are refusing to test may well be spreading COVID at your gatherings this week.   

Explain all this to your grandmother and see what she says about this plan not to test people, such as the nursing assistants coming into her nursing home room 30 times a day.  See what she says.  And Listen.  Tell her the government doesn't want people tested.  

A Medical Doctor"
2020-08-25 23:20,"The critique of excluding, from testing, persons exposed to covid 19 patients but still without symptoms, was expressed well by Cait in NY. I'll just add that this sounded like the ruse in an earlier CDC announcement that masks were not necessary for non medical workers. It turned out this advisory was to steer us away from competing for masks with health workers. But, CDC referring questions on the new testing guidelines to HHS tells me CDC is just a mouthpiece for the WH. 

I am also outraged that hospitals not reporting their covid 19 data directly to HHS are threatened with losing their funding. Earlier announcements were that the CDC may/may not have direct access to covid 19 data reported to HHS. All of this makes me very uncertain of any government reports on covid 19. 

Marsha Geeson, Amercan/Russian journalist, said in a recent interview the US reminds her of post Soviet Russia in its incompetence and lies. If so, that is very sobering and unfortunate.

Staying away from the RNC convention, I still can't escape how disgusting it is. And now, with the news on testing and threatening hospitals, I am motivated to return to getting out the vote. The Biden/Harris team left this progressive too demoralized to continue work on the election. But Trump et al. gave me the kick in the rear needed to get back to work. I hope all sentient Americans will join me in working against Trump. Biden has to be your only choice."

In addition to that, I read that they’re making kids move from one dorm to others in anticipation of more cases in that dorm. They phrased it “due to the high vacancy rate within the building.” Welp.

May 26 ""We have availed ourselves of the best medical advice and scientific information...."" In June, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told members of the U.S. Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Without adequate testing, universities “can’t function at all,” he said. (CNBC June 4) 

Then Father Jenkins goes on to say that ""...science can inform our deliberations, but it cannot provide the answer."" Spider sense tingling. Two more paragraphs about football. Uh-oh.

When a vaccine is announced to be safe and effective, who can believe that with 100% certainty? Trump supporters may wish to drink the Kool-Aid, but I and many others will be circumspect. I am definitely not an anti-vaxxer, but I will not trust anyone who has buckled under Trump's pressure.

Republicans have largely lived dangerously at other people's expenses; start a war and send southern rural cannon fodder to fight them.  Let toxins seep into water and air in neighborhoods in which they do not live anywhere near.  Encourage every rural to have a fracking well in thier back yard, but not allow anyone in their gated communities.  Speak of individual responsibility but have government subsidize their lives fully and absorb the losses they make (while keeping profits).  Speak of inclusion but only if blacks, browns, immigrants are willing to supplicate, do the menial work (like Rick Scott).  Be against immigrants, but employ them in agriculture, construction, hospitality and underpay them to enrich themselves.

That they are willing now to call Covid a hoax, and send their kids into what will certainly emerge as cauldrons of covid infection - is brave indeed.  That they will get the virus and bring it home to you - seems to concern you not a whit.  This is indeed brave.

As cult members are brave, and are ready to immolate themselves to further the glory of his royal rotundness.

While at it, stop wearing the seat belt, ride your bikes without helmets, don't vaccinate, and ingest the disinfectants that your cult leader has promoted. The god of all things republican - is with you."

At my old LA school half of it was closed for over a year when the AC was upgraded.

2020-08-25 20:02,"Although I can understand and agree with the suspension of college students who violate Covid-related restrictions -- I doubt it will actually prove effective.

Regardless of what we might like to believe -- we are dealing with children.  Children who have a new sense of independence while still lacking any understanding of responsibility.

Adding to the inability to control their behavior -- we are often dealing with children who's own parents have little sense of their own personal responsibility.

Today, while driving on both the Hutch Parkway and then I-684 I was faced with a young driver speeding and weaving through traffic.  After first disappearing from view a few miles later she'd slowed down such that I passed her.

Yes, she had slowed down to send a text!

My first reaction was that she was an ""idiot kid"" who should know better.  I wondered what her parents might think of such behavior.

Then I realized that when she was a child it was as likely as not that she watched her parents ""text and drive"" too.

It's that bad.  We have at least one generation of young ""adults"" now at maturity who are the offspring of parents who themselves never learned adult responsibility.

This perpetual childhood is one reason why the Covid virus runs rampant due to immature and irresponsible behavior.  We're a society with millions of people living in perpetual childhood.  People who simply don't understand what it is to act responsibly.

It's not going to get better."

The FDA is politicized and doing Trump’s bidding: ex: saying that plasma could have saved 35 out of 100 people who would otherwise have died from Covid, an egregious and irresponsible statement.  CMS is politicized and doing Trump’s bidding: ex: threatening hospitals with the withdrawal of funding if they don’t report Covid data the way this administration wants...and the only reason they could be demanding this in the middle of the pandemic is so that the administration can manipulate the numbers for its own end.  This unconscionable politicization of the world’s premier govt health organizations on the part of a pathological liar and sociopath has led to over 178,000 deaths in the US (one of the highest death rates in the world), but, where, incredibly, the US has still not flattened the curve and where our economy and schools are in a most difficult positioning to try and reopen and get back some semblance of normality.

Now we have the CDC issuing new guidelines that will effectively reduce testing so the #of infections comes down while leaving scientists and medical professionals in the dark without the necessary data to protect us.

Now he encourages everyone to go back to schools and share the virus even more, all the while his son stays home and learns remotely.

Fox News echos trump and calls the virus a hoax and encourages transmission by asymptomatic super spreaders.

Republicans agree the virus is a democratic hoax and many get ill and many die. But not to worry, it is no more deadly than the flu!

The virus would love the US if it had feelings. No easier killing fields can be found in the world.

Specifically, they are telling us to no longer test people without symptoms? Even though folks are most infections during the day or two before they develop symptos, even though a large number of transmissions happen under precisely that scenario? That doesn't pass the duck test. It looks and sounds far too much like what's-his-name saying, do less testing so we have fewer cases. Not testing asymptomatic people would make it look like we have fewer cases but actually cause things to explode because we would lose track of who has it and where they are. I'm extra skeptical because (a) the CDC itself isn't even trying to explain the justification for the change (we're being forwarded to HHS and political appointee Alex Azar) and (b) only a day or two ago the FDA under White House pressure used wildly untrue (and also outlandishly amateurish) statistics to justify their approval of the emergency use of blood plasma treatments. 

Do they even care about how many of us get sick or die, so long as His Highness is re-elected? Do they even care if this stuff works or is safe to use, so long as he is re-elected?"

Sooner a person is positively diagnosed with the infection the better it is to begin treatment without delay especially the vulnerable groups. COVID-19 is a CURABLE infection in over 97% of those confirmed positive. BUT many that survive could have lasting lung damage or progress to the hyper inflammation chronic stage.

Remember the British prime minister Boris Johnson who was confirmed positive, hospitalized received a ton of oxygen and was discharged and found to be negative for the virus. Now we know he is having some issues with recovery of all his bodily functions. Avoiding COVID-19 like a plagues has a new meaning because even if one does survive the infection there is no guarantee of a full and complete recovery and that depends entirely on the individual and the care that is received. 

As far as elective testing those without any symptoms, there are more and more testing sites mushrooming across the country and more and more people are being tested. Every work place now require their employees or staff to be tested. I submitted a swab for testing for the viral presence, last week not because I had symptoms but because I wanted to get myself tested and my insurance will cover at least part of the testing. I was already tested for the antibody 3 months ago but a negative test only meant I had no past infection"
2020-08-26 5:03,"The CDC guidance is simply beyond stupid and reeks of political interference. Of course people without symptoms that have good reason to have been exposed should be tested.

The walkback about people w.o symptoms getting a test does mean insurance will likely stop covering for it --in fact the generally do not cover it if not ordered by a doctor.

Trump and his administration are the most corrupt and incompetent ever, but I don’t think that any administration could have made this work. These attempts at putting bandaids on the health care needs of Americans as if health can be sorted into neat silos —COVID-19 here, renal failure, veterans, old people, the disabled have failed in terms of patient care and cost. 
Only a single payer, which would cover illness and illness prevention irrespective of type or etiology, could effectively deal with these patients’ needs and do so without the huge  costs involved in the administration of a program like this COVID plan. Most industrialized countries have figured this out and can’t comprehend how we haven’t.

Then there is the lack of transparency with medical costs. Patients are expected to be “consumers”, however they are kept in the dark as to how much medical treatments really cost. Many times, the insurance decides that a patient must pay up to their deductible, regardless of the actual cost of the procedure. A few years ago, I went into an urgent care center because my doctor was out of town. I had a persistent cough and was concerned that it was pneumonia. I paid $75 for the visit, which would have been free under my health insurance had I been able to see my doctor, saw a nurse practitioner for 5 minutes, no tests performed and received a ha do it on staying hydrated and taking Robitussin. I subsequently received a bill for $230 (in addition to the $75 I paid for the visit) and was brusquely told that my exchange plan needed me to pay this much for a visit with a nurse and no tests. People pay a lot of money for “coverage” and have to pay additional for actual health care. Americans have no concept of socialist medicine either. “Socialist” medicine is paid for by citizens and employers. It’s not “free.” Here, we think socialist medicine is free but to provide free care for people who genuinely cannot afford care, it requires majority participation of both employers and citizens."

Trump’s failures during the coronavirus pandemic have been monumental.  With 4% of the world's population, because of Trump we have 25% of the world's Covid-19 deaths.  It is predicted that under the Trump presidency, in 2020, we will have over 300,000 fatalities from coronavirus.  This is more dead than the USA had in fighting WWII over a four year period!

We have come to expect verbal imprecision and outright lies from this president, rather than purposeful action.   Presidential leadership requires anticipating major problems and coming up with plans to mitigate them.  Trump's administration can't plan its way out of a paper bag.  

Trump has failed to fill top government positions with competent staff.  Most of his cadre today come from the ""Tea Party"" and the ""House Freedom Caucus"".  All of these men are known for being conspiracy theorists., disrupters and destroyers.  All were failures when in the public sector.

2020-08-29 16:20,"Once it became clear to the Trump Administration that the majority of the people becoming stricken and/or dying from COVID were people of color, they checked out. It wasn't difficult to do this. They had no plan; they had no idea how to create a plan; and they had such little regard for Americans of color that it was an easy decision to just let them fend for themselves.

But facts are like boomerangs: they always come back. We're learning more and more that surviving COVID often means permanent or semi-permanent conditions, many of which are expensive and complicated to treat. Many survivors will be unable to work again. They will have no health insurance. Even in red states, they will become eligible for Medicaid. While it's a huge relief to me that at least this option will be available to survivors, it is also a testament to the fact that the Trump Administration's refusal to deal with the problem at the source means that it will inevitably wash up on a number of other beaches, not least of which includes public programs like Medicaid. And the costs are going to be staggering.

Again, I'm glad that at least Medicaid is there for the COVID survivors. What I'm not glad about is that so many Americans are still blind to the fact that this is a big, red, screaming indicator of a failing nation. 

No advanced country in the world fails its own citizens in such a manner. The U.S. is not an advanced country. And it will never become one for as long as Trump remains in power."

It is so devastating to me, as a healthcare provider to have seen pictures of the hundreds of attendees at the White House Thursday night, maskless, paying homage to Donald Trump, and  sending off thousands of dollars of fireworks in celebration, paid by us taxpayers.  

Our taxpayer money was supposed to go to people who had no means to pay for their COVID expenses!  Those people were not supposed to be straddled with bills, hospital tax collectors, worries about how they were to accomplish payment of hundreds and thousands of dollars.

Many of us realize it is impossible to believe a word that comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth.  But wouldn’t you think, this man would scrape up the minute decency he may hold to make his promise good?  We would hope those who may have been infested because of his national neglect of COVID, who may have suffered with being straddled to a ventilator, and recovered slowly, those who could not and possibly still can not work, could hold the President true to his promise - that their hospitalization costs would be covered!  

Azar, Hahn, Redfield, but most of all, Donald Trump, birds of a feather, will never be held accountable for their treason to the American people - not until Donald Trump is voted out of the White House, maybe not even then.

This in turn provides lots of bands and news reporters quoting every word that escapes his mouth, but it does include the responsibility of all who suffer from his missteps and errors.

That is the difficult part of being president. After he consciously ignored the best experts, and substituted chrony, hacks and unqualified flunkies in the Department of Health and CDC, he directly bears all responsibility for COVID-19 spreading like a spider from Italy to New York. Rather than ask the South Koreans or Germans for accurate test kits, Trump pampered CEO's who supported his presidency, but had flawed tests kits, which let the genie out of the bottle.

All health care bills fall on the shoulders of the Trump family. They departed from every established pandemic norm and protocols, and appointed incompetent hacks to key health care positions.

2020-08-29 16:08,"The Health and Resource & Services Administration (HRSA) states something impossible today for USA Health Care Providers and Facilities: 

""All claims submitted must be complete and final. Interim bills, corrected claims, late charges, voided claim transactions and appeals will not be accepted.""

The billing activity and iterations for a planned hospital stay is complex, and often confused, if not contentious. To think billing for urgent COVID care being wrapped up as complete and final bill is highly unrealistic. This must be delaying and preventing promised funding, as was well reported. It's time for a change!"
2020-08-29 16:25,"So, what happens if Trump is re-elected (or simply grabs power) and the next killer virus is an even worse, ebola-like pathogen?

Will the lack of personal consequences from Covid-19 be as much of a ""learning lesson"" as last year's impeachment?  Rather than do anything to help American citizens, will he remain sealed off and keep constantly testing his own family and personal staff, while letting the rest of us fend for ourselves?  

If 180,000 American deaths is an acceptable number for Republicans, why not several million, or more?

This is why Donald Trump must not be re-elected: he does not really care about our country, or its citizens.  

He has brought America to the edge of ruin, and would gladly push us all over the cliff if he thought it would give him more money, or  good ratings. The man cannot be trusted."

The pandemic may have been unavoidable, but the experience of every other developed country — and many less developed but better organized— confirms the fact that it didn’t have to be this bad either financially or in terms of human loss.

The failure to provide healthcare to the people in this country is a catastrophic failure of both parties.  Even should Biden win, we’ll still be fighting for this most basic and necessary human right.

But the dystopian America where government fails to function altogether and where unidentifiable militarized units in unmarked vehicles are kidnapping people off the streets?  

That falls solely on the ugly state of the corrupt and complicit Republican Party, which is now simply the Party of Trump, having no other platform."

2020-08-29 17:12,"Want to know a double whammy? If the Trump administration manages to remove protections for pre-existing conditions, a positive COVID diagnosis, paired with the growing evidence for a class of patients with long-term aftereffects of infection, will make having had COVID itself a pre-existing condition, leading insurance actuaries to jack up premiums (or deny coverage). Furthermore, given the push for widespread testing and the logging of test results with state agencies, it will be impossible to hide the diagnosis to protect yourself from being extorted under the ""free market"" dynamics the GOP so roundly applauds."
2020-08-29 17:16,"Get universal health care implemented already. I see in these comments that anyone who's lived outside the US recognizes this is a better system.

I'm from Canada and have lived in the US for the last 10 yrs and strongly believe that Americans are as deserving of universal health care as Canadians. If we can afford it in Canada, surely America can. 

This one issue motivated me to campaign for Bernie sanders in both election cycles. I noticed during the Democratic Convention role call, wherein sanders and bidens' primary votes were counted,  Sanders received virtually all the votes from Americans abroad. I wonder if experiencing universal healthcare had something to do with this. 

 It's sad that there are so many instrumental and psychological barriers within the American cultural/political system that makes something so basic as universal health care a controversial issue. It's particularly necessary when trying to get a public health crisis as this pandemic under control. Yet, sadly, the DNC wouldn't even it include it in their platform and the NY Times continues to write articles like this."

They tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation,” he continued. “This is their new hoax,” he said, referring to the coronavirus.

You design a 2% interest rate with 40yr term that would have given the military heroes a $550 total PITIA payment in most cases as the average loan balance was $125,000 yet not a single Dept of VA borrower was underwritten for the relief.

Ask the VA why you were not underwritten when the program like today's forbearance program is ordered by the President who places the requirement for a forbearance of up to 1yr and the VA is responsible for ensuring this instruction is done. It's not saying that the lender cannot foreclose, but it is saying that the forbearance must be observed.

During the Harvard Law grad order, it said that the lender/servicer ""must"" underwrite the loan first before a foreclosure could be considered yet Obama allowed this to take place and all 20,000 qualified in 2010 simply were foreclosed with the banks observing this requirement. The VA is at fault because it requires to ensure the banks follow 38 CFR!

Obama was reelected and quickly changed the ""No Standing"" option ot the Independent Foreclosure Review Board reneging on his promise.

Trump showed his word is good but under the same condition of foreclosing on military families Obama ran!"

Most of the victims of Covid end up in the ICU and just laying there costs $10,000 a day.  Who is going to pay for all of these uncovered costs?  The system is such a mess that if the right sequence of insurance codes are not submitted, the patient is stuck with the bill.

Who can afford $100,000 plus hospital bills?  This is insane!

It would be almost comic if it wasn't so tragic.

The unnecessary competitive and ill-conceived Trump Program led to predictable confusion and breakdowns in existing hospital and health care systems, including billing at a time that cried out for stability.  It added to peoples suffering and increased corporations options to bill multiple sources as it suits them or opt out.  

The legacy of the Trump government may be Grover Norquist's  (remember him?) greatest delight, as he stated in an interview this Spring.  He doesn't care whether Trump is deceitful or not,  So long as the U.S. federal government  shrinks  to put in a bathtub and then drown it will suit him (Teddy Roosevelt era before social security and medicare).  

To that end Mr. Trump is undermining faith in our federal system of governing.  Many of our elected representatives stand by, or worse, stand by him.  

We have to get past this fear we have when he and his cohort lob the word ""socialism"" at us, as if we were in jr high and someone was throwing a stink bomb our way.  For crying out loud, we are not adopting Marxism when we support social programs.  Trump was using federal dollars for his Trump Program.  He didn't call that socialism, did he?"

Narcissists keenly feel the lack, the core humanity that can give & receive love. Many are not only sex addicts, but love addicts as well.   For narcissists, love is a form of masturbation, an auto-erotic experience, created entirely of himself. There is no flowing back and forth, thus, no real love.

Now I've been a physician almost 40 years, and the advantages of universal health care are still obvious. Why so many ""programs"" but no actual care? Because the ""programs"" exist for politicians to take credit for them, not for anyone to get the care they need.

This is unacceptable. Healthcare is a basic human right, one that every individual should have access to. Without proper healthcare, people will suffer- and as this article depicts, this suffering will be due to not only medical issues, but also the financial stress that comes with pursuing treatment for such issues. 
President Trump and his administration need to uphold the promise they made to their citizens. The president's lack of encouragement to expand Medicaid, failure to provide funds to pay off the medical bills of the uninsured, and the inability to properly lead the United States to health and prosperity during a global pandemic further proves his incapability to rightfully protect the citizens of this country.

That's what it had already become before Trump, and why it was so easy for Trump to brush aside all the party's supposed principles. The modern GOP is interested only in tax cuts for the rich and corporations; deregulation in the service of profits at the expense of workers and our common environment; and lining the pockets of cronies with government contracts. Putin-admiring Trump is the epitome of the autocratic kleptocracy toward which the GOP inevitably inclines, unable to gain and hold national power except through racist rabble rousing, concerted disinformation, voter suppression, gerrymandering and the electoral college."

And when the House Democrats pass anything to try to help those ordinary Americans who are struggling to get through this pandemic, there is the inevitable talk about the “undeserving” who just want to “mooch” from the taxpayers’ trough—while apparently every single health care provider, is, by definition, “deserving” of taxpayer largess.     

Why is it that when it comes to getting taxpayer money, those ordinary Americans at the lower end of the economic spectrum are the ones who have to prove they are “worthy”?   And who have to move heaven and earth to prove they are eligible to get a COVID hospital bill paid?  When meanwhile the president blithely gives a get-out-of-jail-free card to a Medicare fraudster convicted of bilking our government out of $200 million? 

If the Party of Trump party really wants to protect the federal coffers, maybe they should require those getting the big money to prove they deserve it."

This national in scope, consolidating reform would erase the artificial lines separating employer risk pools from the individual market, while also reducing the myriad number of coverage-gap-filled  BAD CHOICE health plans all private health insurers sell to ALL US residents.

Squabbling over who should be covered for Covid treatment -  a matter of  national safety -  is utterly insane.  

Hospitals should be focused on treatment and care, not on gaming billing requirements  for federal or state payments. Patients  and their families should be free of anxiety over hospital bills when they are trying to recuperate, rather than being hit with bills so high they could never pay them.

Separately: noting that New York received  substantially  less out of this fund than New Jersey, etc, automatically makes me suspicious!

The gaps in coverage and variances in different state and hospital policies is a ridiculous quagmire that drives everyone crazy – especially doctors and nurses– and is just plain cruel. In the US healthcare is available if you can afford it. If not tough luck. The fact that Trump's coverage for the unisured required covid19 to be the primary diagnosis means that whoever wrote that policy knew that would be the disqualifying kicker for many patients. I'm surprised Ms. Cortez didn't have a heart attack when her $76,000 bill arrived. Goodness knows this article didn't truly reflect the hours spent in communication with the hospital's draconian billing system that is a hallmark of healthcare in this country: the left hand never knows what the right hand is doing and oh, hospital A covers that cost but hospital B doesn't. Caveat emptor as Mr. Fernandez found out. For profit healthcare in the US is a cruel and unsustainable system. No other advanced country treats its citizens so callously. Wendell Potter, a former top insurance executive blew the whistle in an oped in WAPO called,""The Health Care Scare"" where he confessed his job was to lie about the Canadian health system to scare Americans away from supporting universal care.

Also, we the article seems to indicate that the reinfection was caused by a different strain (not clear, but it seems the original was the China strain; reinfection was from the EU strain). We now have to be concerned with the vaccine as I cannot see how the normal vaccination approach, combined with the reluctance of many Americans to take a COVID vaccine, will produce the desired outcome."

2020-08-24 15:08,"Trump's dangerous desperation to secure success in the November election is alarming.  What isn’t he willing to do and say to color his “success” in red, white and blue so his base will believe he has been triumphant in securing “powerful” remedies in the fight against COVID-19?

So what is “only some patients” benefited from the antibody-rich blood plasma which “cannot be manufactured in millions of doses” and is only available “by blood donations”.  It’s Trump’s spin which exaggerates the real results that make his statements highly suspect.

Yet again, Trump’s desire to cut “red tape and speed approval of treatments and vaccines as a necessary response to a public health emergency” is his justification, but the hidden reason in plain sight is a response to HIS emergency to low polling numbers and doing whatever it takes to get re-elected.

This is the flip side of Trump’s mindset. Back in February, he refused to acknowledge this virus.  He kept saying it wasn’t as bad as the flu and it would “simply disappear one day.” Where was the push, the urgency, the “cutting of red tape and speedy approval” to get PPE manufactured for healthcare workers?  Where was the urgency in having people keep a safe distance and the wearing of face masks?

Suddenly he wakes up less than 100 days to the election and realizes the country is in the worst health crisis in a century?

So much of what has occurred did not need to happen if we had a strong, effective and science-believing president."

I also understand that the vaccines being developed are based on the one from China. If what the article says is true that this young man was infected and died with the Europian mutated version, then it appears that we are battling 2 separate but similar covid viruses. Does this mean everyone should be working on 2 types of vaccines? And since the natural immunization from having the covid-19 is only 3 months, how many times are we going to need to be re-vaccinated?  It appears these viruses are not going away for awhile."
2020-08-24 15:34,"The discovery by researchers in Hong Kong who reported the first confirmed case of reinfection with the coronavirus after the patient returned from a trip to Spain “suggests that immunity to the coronavirus may last only a few months in some people.” But after “researchers sequenced the virus from both rounds of infection and found significant differences in the two sets of virus,” could it be that the coronavirus is mutating while it is travelling around the world ???

2020-08-24 15:54,"Having an asymptomatic re-infection is what we take vaccines for. They do not prevent infection, they enable the immune system to react to an infection before symptoms develop. This is good news, both for the subject (who didn’t develop symptoms the second time around) and for the development of vaccines (the initial infection provides the type of immunity we expect from a vaccine)."
2020-08-24 16:03,"Concerning, to say the least.  This looks to me like a typical cold/flu season, with an atypically lethal virus strain.  My hope is that future mutations don’t improve that lethality, but I wouldn’t wager on that hope.  Makes continual vaccine development problematic as well."
2020-08-24 16:04,"If this is an index case of reinfection and while it is statistically insignificant more studies are needed to determine whether the antibodies to the first infection were unable to prevent the so called ""re-infection"" from a variant or that the persons memory cells were unable to mount a response to protect against re-infection. 

Viruses play several dirty tricks to evade host defense and surface variation is one of the most common tricks played by HIV and Influenza and maybe just maybe Coronavirus. We have a different seasonal flu vaccine every flu season and that is why a seasonal flu vaccine is recommended every season. Currently there is an abundant supply of the 2020-2021 seasonal flu vaccine, one for for those above 65 and one for those below 65. Whenever I advocate for getting the seasonal flu vaccine, I get responses like I don't generally get it or that it is too early to get it or that I am not afraid of the flu. We need to develop a culture of proactive self care and getting timely immunizations should top the list. 

We are lucky in US that we have a good supply of the seasonal flu vaccine and many in the vulnerable group do take it or their primary care physician insists that they get it. In Canada, a person I know well did not get the seasonal flu vaccine and died when the flu virus infected him. Another who also did not get the vaccine barely survived after 17 days of hospitalization and oxygen support. How could this important vaccine delivery be neglected?"
2020-08-24 16:12,"Some researchers have already published their data in June that, the antibody level in COVID-19 patients has a significant decrease after three months.

The total lack of concern over the deaths except in making him look bad, and now creating ‘good news’ just in time for the convention, and surely, claims of a vaccine (that no one will take) miraculously in time for the election, with the same accusations towards a deep state conspiracy."

Some experts, though, said the news is not as bad as it sounds and that it is not cause for panic. For one thing, the patient did not have any symptoms in the second infection.
""This is interesting but not alarming,"" tweeted Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
""First, this appears to be rare,"" he added. ""Though we don't go looking often enough so unclear. Second, person was asymptomatic during the re-infection. This is exactly what one would want to see with immunity — that you can pick up virus again but that it won't cause serious illness.""
One of the major questions still circulating around coronavirus is how long immunity lasts.
""What is not completely clear yet is how strong that immune response is and for how long that immune response lasts,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, an expert at the World Health Organization, when asked about the Hong Kong results during a press briefing Monday.
""We need to not jump to any conclusions,"" she cautioned."
2020-08-24 16:04,Reinfection after 4.5 months.  So much for the heard immunity plan - sorry Sweden.  So without an effective (long-lasting) vaccine it is either accept the new normal - or get sick as a dog 2-3 times every year.  Well at least we will get to have plenty of convalesce plasma - even if it only has a minimal positive effects against the disease.
2020-08-24 16:59,"For the reinfection case, is it possible there was a false positive the first time?  I believe the article suggests a mild case the first time implying it would not have been given extensive medical attention.  If, for example, at some point the patient's sample or result was confused with another patient's, he might have appeared positive the first time.  Applying the principle of Occam's Razor, is it more likely this is the one confirmed case of reinfection than a testing or reporting failure occurred

I would have liked the article to focus more on the integrity of the testing and reporting process.

With the millions of infections, I would expect if infections  reoccurred with any frequency we would have many examples.  Does this make sense?"
2020-08-24 16:46,"NYT: ""Covid-19 Live Updates: Researchers Document First Case of Virus Reinfection""

Ahem...

The watchword is ""confirmed"". I knew about this since early May. South Korea reported 22 people who got reinfected back then. But it wasn't picked up widely. Maybe because the consequences were so dire?

People, listen to me: SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, the ""China Virus"" - however you call it, it's a Corona virus. The exact same type as the one that causes the common cold (actually there are four strains that do that).

Have we ever gotten rid of the common cold? NO! Even after NASA was in trouble when one of their astronauts developed it on board an Apollo spaceship. That was in ~1970, fifty years ago. And we STILL don't have anything to actually fight the common cold! ""Take two Aspirin and call me tomorrow"" won't do with a mortality rate of 5% or so...

It's time for science, medical, pharmaceutical and politics to get serious and tell us the truth. Our lives - as we knew them, as we've planned them - are over. We now live in Covid-19 times, and it WILL change the way we live for us, our children and future generations.

Wearing masks and washing hands is the least. Think about getting a shot every two month - and having to pay for it. Think about no more parties, concerts, rallies etc. forever. Think about becoming a Hermite, basically.

Luckily I'm way ahead of you. Being an anti-social outcast suddenly seems to be a survival trait :-)"
2020-08-24 16:34,"This report of reinfection doesn't even address what is the most important question here: Is this ""reinfected"" patient contagious? Immunity is a complex concept and is often misunderstood. Having antibodies or a memory T-cell immunity does not mean the virus can never enter your body again. It means that once you do have the virus in your system that your body should be able to neutralize it before it can be harmful to you. We see that this man was asymptomatic which is good news for him. So why is there no word on whether he could infect others?"
2020-08-24 16:28,"This reinfection is not a surprise to me. In Liberia, all persons who test positive for Covid are required to be admitted in to a government treatment center and one can’t leave until he/she receives two negative tests.

I am aware of a lady who contracted Covid in April and was subsequently released from the treatment center after getting her two negative tests. She was later readmitted to the treatment center in July after  testing positive again."
2020-08-24 16:45,"This article title is misleading because it sounds like immunity to covid cannot be achieved. However, later in the article it says that the viral sequences from both infections were significantly different. The individual most likely maintained antibodies specific to the first strain he encountered, but the second strain was different enough that the antibodies he had did not recognize the new strain. This is a known phenomenon in other viruses, like the influenza virus, and is why the flu vaccine is an annual vaccine that protects against multiple strains of the virus.

This is one clingy pathogen. 

The scientific community has been suspecting for a while that the immunity conundrum would be rife with red herrings, dead ends, changeling templates, inconclusive data, and impossible timelines. If the incidence of reinfected people starts showing signs of increasing, then it's not just a bumper sticker that Covid will display, we may all wake up one morning with a tattoo on our chassis. We may be dealing with it for some time.    

I have a vulnerable family member who is so scared. It really hurts, and I wish success for our best and brightest scientific stars to find its kryptonite. In the meantime, we all must coexist and take care of one another."

But humanity has got to understand that there are things that can happen because of our blind stupidity that we never knew or imagined could happen, and that end up changing life on planet Earth, or perhaps even destroying it.

Those who are fast, get there first, make the money, but we all the rest of us end up having to pay, and who knows what affect it has on the future.  We need a common core behavioral system because unless all of us play by the same rules this is going to keep happening in one form or another because everything is connected and close to everything else now."
2020-08-24 17:24,"We should be critical of whether this reinfection case truly dashed the hopes for long term immunity. In statistics we have things called outliers. What we have likely found in Hong Kong is an outlier - someone whose immunity lasts for much less time than most. Median immunity may very well be >1 year, in which case we would EXPECT to just now start finding the first outliers! 

Put in another way - a certain cancer might give people 1 year to live on average. If one person out of the millions that have this cancer dies after 4.5 months, we should not immediately assume that everyone who gets this cancer dies after 4.5 months. 

Hopefully media coverage of immunity will avoid jump scares and stick to science, statistics, and the simple fact that we do not know very much about this virus."
2020-08-24 17:15,"The 33 year old man had only mild symptoms the first time and no symptoms the second time around.

A reinfection might not be dangerous to the individual patient, but could be fatal to family and others with whom he was in contact."
2020-08-24 17:46,"We should be extremely cautious in how we interpret this report. In many ways, this is exactly how immunity works: your body is much more efficient at fighting a virus the second time around because of so-called memory immune cells (memory B and T cells). These memory cells recognize the pathogen and mount an immune response much quicker. The fact that this individual had no symptoms the second time suggests, although not definitively, that his body was much more effective in fighting the virus. Ongoing vigilance is always needed but this likely will not be a legitimate concern, and we need to temper the hype a little bit."
2020-08-24 18:04,"I donated plasma last week after taking the antibody test a second time to prove a high-enough Covid-19 antibody titer — the relative strength of immune response. I was infected with the virus in mid-March, and in mid-August still had 3X the required response in my blood.

I was disappointed, however, that no one recorded or even asked when I was infected. How, exactly, are they studying the strength and duration of people's immunity without this necessary information? Who is driving the bus?"

2020-08-24 17:47,"I'm far from a supporter of Donald Trump or anywhere vaguely near. His response to our present situation is simply negligent and callously irresponsible.

But this virus will circulate now, probably forever, throughout the human population. So does the flu. When we get a fairly effective vaccine, perhaps by early next year if the appropriate protocols are followed, then it will confer immunity in the same way that flu vaccines do: they're imperfect, and viruses mutate. Some people will die of Covid-19 every year, just as people do of the flu (about 40,000 last year). We shouldn't panic about that or shut down the economy every time this surfaces, or quarantine every infected person. We don't test for the flu in this way or quarantine in this way, neither should we.

Please note that the subject in question had mild symptoms with his first round, and is now asymptomatic. An asymptomatic case now is cause for strict mitigation, but will become less so in future, i. e. large parts of the population will come down with the disease but have minor or no serious effects. We can't function if we're not prepared to take any risks at all in society, in which case all of us will just stay home for the rest of our lives (this pathology has a name: agoraphobia)."
2020-08-24 18:04,"Between the lines, I still read hope.

The whole reason they could confirm the reinfection is that it had a measurably different genetic signature the second time around.  Which means the patient didn’t catch the exact same strain.

Clearly the second bout wasn’t bad at all: to me this says, (1) that the immune system still recognized enough of the virus to figure out how to fight it more quickly; and/or, (2) that the virus is already starting to attenuate to be more human-friendly (attenuation: like the flu, colds and others, viruses evolve to spread, thrive and persist as prolifically as possible—which usually involves adapting to not kill the host!).

Not saying to let our guard down—but let’s not be too quick to abandon hope on vaccines and other progress made.  And don’t get lax about the hand washing: honestly, when is the last time you did the “surgeon’s wash”?"

So this is the new standard for FDA approval?  Trump's gut belief that something ""may be effective""?????  So now his base will also be eating oleandrin, drinking bleach and popping hydroxychloroquine, because the SAME evidence exists for all those.

Birx, Fauci, and now Steve Hahn demonstrate repeatedly they are unable to maintain professional demeanor, their long and storied medical experience useless in the face of Trump.

Individuals and agencies laid waste, it's almost funny listening to pundits wonder if Big Pharma (gifted hundreds of billions of socialist dollars to play at developing vaccines which will then, miraculously, be emergently approved without anything like proper evaluation on the eve of the election) will come through or find a way to hold vaccine hostage until Trump gleefully agrees to pay hundreds of billions more upon delivery.

Having made his announcement of the pre-election approval miracle, Trump will lose all interest in the vaccine, it will no longer be a priority, and will wither and lie fallow.  

Not that it matters.  Only a fool would accept a vaccine created under such conditions.  Nothing the US says can be believed.  I'll wait for WHO approval."

One common theme is that the kids study outside in small groups sitting under a big tree.  Looks awesome!  But in the dreams there are never any bugs, hurricanes, snow, etc.

So here is a thought.  What if we changed the school year to run from say March through Thanksgiving and closed for the winter when cold and flu season is at its highest and the weather is at its worst?

Another thought - This paper just recently published a study showing that children under age 10 rarely transmit COVID-19 and worldwide cases show that only 2% of all cases are under age 18.  Fred Hutchinson reported this week that a preliminary study showed that 80% of infected folks do not infect others.  

We also know that by and large, if you are under 40 this is not the same threat as over age 70 with underlying conditions.  So, what if we opened schools to kids under 10 with parents under say 35 who have no elderly or immune compromised members at home?  Those early years would be the hardest to do by remote learning and the teens need more watching than 6 years olds regarding social distancing.  

We might be able to send a chunk of our workforce back to work with few issues until a vaccine is discovered.  But instead, we will argue with each other about the politics of the disease rather than try and figure out a workaround."

They were banned from going back into their classrooms, so they had no access to their resources. They were starting at square one. But they did it. They did it because they love their students. They wanted to provide some stability to their students in a terrible situation. 
We educators all thought that the time away from school would be used wisely, to consider options for how to open safely come September. Instead, everyone was concerned about opening bars. 
Well, here we are, no closer to reducing cases in many states. All those states who probably thought, “why should I care? It’s NY, a blue state with a democratic governor and all those “libs.””  
Now, our education secretary,  who has never set foot in a classroom, is telling teachers they are essential workers who need to put their lives at risk and teach in this pandemic.

We should never forget that in the early summer, the CDC issued science-based guidelines for schools to reopen in the fall, guidelines Trump didn’t like because they required students to be six feet apart from each other—an impossibility given the spatial capacity of most if not all American schools—and also required adequate ventilation in classrooms—an impossibility given the preference of the US government to invest in military equipment at the expense of public education infrastructure. Thus, it seemed as though schools would not be able to reopen, which meant parents could not go back to their lousy jobs on behalf of the rich—and Trump might not get re-elected! So Trump told the CDC to issue revised guidelines—ones based not on science but on magical thinking—which, appallingly, it did. (Less space between students was suddenly okay! Voila! Just like that! Who knew science could be anything we want it to be?!) Of course, the revised guidelines are not worth the paper they are written on.

Inevitably, if schools are opened people will get sick, spread disease, and die. So this is what we do:

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study. I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as necessary. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers.

Since COVID is a very new disease and mass vaccine trials just got started, the speed and the extent that such weakening is not time-tested. Under such circumstances, it may be hard to determine now when and under what circumstances that herd immunity can be achieved and, more importantly, be maintained over a substantial period of time. Until then, COVID would still remain a serious threat to many local communities."

That he can't achieve even the basics is entirely his doing.

We are where we tragically are exclusively because of Trump.

What death there is, what economic ruin and community dissolution, what disintegration of families and personal trauma are all created by Trump.

Well, and Jared of course.

Now CDC and FDA appear for sale to the current political despot. Dr. Steve Hahn apologizes weakly and belatedly for misstating relative efficacy (between two different doses) and absolute efficacy. Is Dr. Hahn just plain stupid, or has he been drinking so much disinfectant that he can’t keep straight basic elements of statistics?

Unlike the Trump Administration, Notre Dame put clear plans in place, with backup plans to backup plans. They’ve been decisive and clear. 

And they’ve done thousands of surveillance tests, which is precisely how they know how much control they have of the virus.

We don't want to overwhelm our labs.  And, how long does it take to get the results?  If it's more than a couple of days, then by the time you learn the result of your test, you'll already either have developed symptoms or have cleared the virus from your body without getting symptoms and be out of danger; either way the result will not be useful if it arrives too late.

The assumption that neutralizing antibodies, IgG class present in the convalescent plasma would lower the Coronavirus -2 (CoV-2)  infection burden in the upper respiratory track especially the lung are assuming too much. If the convalescent plasma is administered fairly earlier on, I would be only marginally optimistic that it will have any significant benefit. 

If CoV-2 was primarily a blood borne virus like Hepatitis B virus (HBV) that is found circulating in high amounts in body fluids then a convalescent plasma from a patient with HBV would be beneficial assuming that the plasma is virus free and that was exactly what was recommended to the HBV patients by the FDA.
But I am not so sure whether administering convalescent plasma would reliably and reproducibly provide much benefit. So it is not that big an advantage but a safe prophylactic that just maybe benefit a handful of patients. 

Prevention is still better than cure and avoiding CoV-2 infection like a plague is the best way forward. To those over 99% of the US population who are still infection free and hope to survive this pandemic I say just keep doing what ever it is that you have been doing to stay out of the line of fire of CoV-2, just keep doing the same.

Beyond feeling sorry for those who choose to work with the White House, I am sorry for us. Controlling a pandemic requires considerable cooperation from the public to follow often onerous  public health recommendations. That cooperation, in turn, requires trust and confidence in the issuing institutions. But those institutions are telling us they cannot be trusted.

Starting with the CDC's ruse early this year, to save scarce PPE resources for medical personnel, they advised masks are unnecessary for the public. This was followed by garbled information of what type of masks the public could use and then urgent statements everyone masking is essential to controlling this virus.

Trump is not motivated by intellectual endeavors and has transgressed against the sanctity of knowledge and science. One of the first acts of a new president, should we be so fortunate, would be to overhaul leadership at any/all of these institutions and over some period of time, find a way to transfer their direction either to the entity itself or a public trust of some sort. 
I have no doubt in the ability of individual scientists at any and all of these institutions, and pray they are not harmed in the long run by an apparently sick culture. But, culture comes from the top down and enough perversion can ruin it. We can only hope for the best.

I was very concerned about this situation. I had to quarantine for 2 weeks as I could not get tested without a doctor’s order. No one got in touch with me to let me know I was exposed, so there was no contact tracing as far as I could tell.

I haven’t looked at the CDC’s revised guidance on testing of asymptomatic contacts, so I won’t comment on its appropriateness, but it should be pointed out that the significance of negative results in asymptomatic case contacts is limited and testing in this population generally should be limited to clearance testing at the end of a period of self-quarantine or to organized contact tracing, where an early positive result would identify large numbers of secondary contacts and thereby preempt chains of transmission. 

It seems like every time a public figure is exposed to COVID-19, they say, “But I tested negative, so I’m ok.”   It makes me want to tear my hair out.  CoV RNA is commonly not detectable during the incubation period, which can last ten days or more, so a negative test a couple days after exposure means nothing.

Surely Hahn wouldn't knuckle under to political pressure and sacrifice thousands of innocent Americans of so what's-his-name can get reelected?"

It reduces the risk but does not eliminate it.  A small percentage of the time, someone who is still sick could test negative twice.  Do this enough times and you will get a headline that claims reinfection.  
We need someone who understands quality control and risk statistics to sit all these folks down and explain these very simple concepts.
I am not at all convinced that this is a real phenomena."
2020-08-28 22:34,"Certain agencies should be above and beyond politics. The FDA has over decades created a global gold standard with respect to drugs and treatments. This gold standard had a direct benefit for the health of Americans and people around the world. It also benefit American pharmaceutical and research bodies to think broadly and be better than if they might have been if left to their own short term inclinations. Dr Hahn seems to have betrayed his agency, the FDA reputation and FDA credibility. The agency must be isolated from all political interference or influence! Press officers, should they be necessary should have no connection with politics! Standards, particularly in these Covid 19 times must be upheld. Should a vaccine emerge that looks very good it must pass all the established standards to prove beyond doubt both for effectiveness and safety. Credibility for the vaccine, trust by the public and trust in the FDA demand it. The FDA and CDC have been debased by Trump’s ego and his henchmen and must end now! Unfortunately that requires courage and integrity by the two agency heads, which is sorely lacking!"

Yawn.  These differences between respondents on the basis of their political leanings are nothing new.  This has been widely reported for some time.  Such polls would be more meaningful and interesting if poll takers were to try to get at the basis of the difference, for example by asking respondents to cite data and data sources upon which they base their evaluations of the government's response to the pandemic.  

Dig deeper and report those results to us.  We might actually learn something."

The virus disproportionally affects black, brown, and poor folks - all of which disgust him anyway since his real estate days with his dad. I think it's a horrible calculation but we are talking about Trump. He wants those Trump die-hards to have hope but letting the others die, ""it is what it is.""

As well as a huge stock upside to Moncef Slaoui, the vaccine czar who has big holdings in Moderna and other biotech firms standing to gain under Trump’s kleptocracy. 

And then there’s the snake oilsmen selling directly from the White House podium. The pillow guy hocking a fake cure of a very dodgy nutritional supplement. Hydroxichloroquin investors benefiting from the same snake oil chief touter, Trump. Bleach as a hoped-for cure “in a minute”.

Convalescent plasma over-hyped by Trump for the RNC show. It’s definitely not a lasting cure. 

And “someday it’s just gonna disappear .... I hope”. 

There will be no uniform vaccine compliance by the population at large under a snake oil swamp monster. Would you buy a “warp speed” vaccine from a used-trope salesman?

There's a reason I've raised the alarm all summer long on these pages. It's the same reason I banged the pandemic drum all January. Sometimes the pieces on the table are so large you can see them from outer space. You don't need medical experts to know that if you pack children and teachers into small, hot classrooms with poor ventilation, you've provided a virus everything it needs and craves to spread. 

And here's the crazy thing...we aren't even in-person yet; this is the result of opening fall sports, something DeWine has recklessly pushed all summer, and pretending we're practicing social distancing. So two days and we already have dozens quarantined and we're STILL talking about forcing in-person learning in a week. Gee...what could possibly go wrong?

Four days ago, before private schools started opening, Ohio's numbers had dropped into the 600s. Today? We're back up to 1,200+. So when are we going to start putting 2+2 together and doing the calculus of survival? This is not rocket science.

The day Wuhan announced it was building a hospital in ten days, every international airport in the world should have been shutting down or, at a bare minimum, testing every traveler. It's unconscionable that there has not been a unified decree to close schools in hot zones, to make wearing a mask a federally mandated law, to enforce social distancing.

So the smart people are focused on the long game of understanding and addressing the underlying mechanism of infection rather than relying on the traditional trial & error antibody/test/survey approach. The money people on the other hand know that something called a vaccine is needed to restart the economy and education systems to prevent the lockdown harm from dwarfing that of the virus. And they also know there is a lot of money to be made in coming up with such a ""placebo"" vaccine. Most likely both approaches will succeed. Placebo vaccine (justified by some statistical gerrymandering) comes by year end making a lot of money for drug companies and getting the country back up and running, followed sometime later by a real vaccine arrived by the new methods and with limited reliance on traditional test subject symptom surveys."

And folks who would otherwise volunteer for science/humanity in order to find a vaccine would have far fewer reasons to do so once one has already been approved.

Let's look at Moderna's new mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273), which caused systemic side effects in most participants.

45 volunteers were divided into three dosage groups — 25 mcg, 100 mcg and 250 mcg — with 15 participants in each. In the low-dose group one participant (6%) required emergency medical care.

In the 100 mcg-dose group, systemic side effects were found in 80% of participants after the first dose, and 100% after the second dose.  Note that the coronavirus vaccine will be a two-dose regimen and will likely be recommended annually, like the flu vaccine.

In the highest dosage group, 250 mcg, 100% of participants suffered side effects after both the first and second doses.  Three of the 14 participants (21%) in the 250-mcg group suffered ""one or more severe events.""

They only tested on young healthy subjects.

Despite these worrisome results, the trial is being heralded as a huge success.

We did have 24-hour news, but were not bombarded by Facebook, Twitter, etc. And we had presidents who--whether we liked them or not--seemed to take the job seriously. No more.

Re: “It Can’t Get Worse…Right?” August 31, 2020
Reading this article, I am reminded of mistakes made covering the Bush Administration’s lead up to the Iraq war and the Clinton campaign coverage (obsession with the e-mails, predominantly negative coverage) and Trump campaign coverage in 2015-2016 (far more forgiving). NYTimes reporting seems to favor the side that attacks the free press and stifles efforts to report the truth. A major imbalance in today’s article resulted from quoting a Republican political activist without a balancing Democratic party view. He made a number of false statements that went unchallenged ( eg “ Democrats don’t want to stop the violence because they think the people perpetrating the violence are meaningful voters for them.”, what???, Wisconsin public employees with retirement fund savings will support Trump, yeah sure…) 
The writers exaggerate and feed a Trump narrative stating “one city after another (has) erupted in flames.” They employ both-sides(ism) describing the campaigns as “bitter, angry, divisive”- that is the Trump campaign. And, most unfortunately, they state the candidates agree “American Democracy is on the line” when there is overwhelming evidence only one candidate stands up for and defends our American Democracy- that is Joe Biden- and this is the most important issue for America today.  We count on the New York Times to do better than this."

And the president of the United States, who opened the door to the predations of the pandemic by his inaction, his indifference, and his loathing of attending to the details of his job, has his sycophants telling us that he is the right man for the job.

There has been no mention--none--during the three days of the Republican National Carnival of the death toll, just about 180K and close to 6-million infections. The president is on record as saying ""We'll have to live with it."" I certainly won't mention that the said ""It is what it is.""

But where has fantasy ever intersected with truth? The president is hostile towards shutdowns and wants all schools fully re-opened, the better, he thinks, it will benefit ""his"" economy. Parents are jobless. Homeowners and renters face eviction or foreclosure. People are food insecure. And Mitch McConnell's Senate is on vacation.

If much of America is good with this, then we're truly lost. And this includes the youngest among us, our next generation, people whose intellects and skill sets and promising futures now appear to be as bleak as the hope that a vaccine will be ready by Election Day.

We, as a nation, stupidly elected Donald Trump to be our president. We're paying for that mistake now and into the foreseeable future.

But if the objective is to obey the Hippocratic ""First do no harm"" oath, and gain control of the pandemic, then of course more testing is called for.

In early May, my husband and I, with neither symptoms nor a Rx, were tested for FREE at a local drive-thru facility. A few weeks ago we took a free at-home test. Sincee he can't work remotely, we will continue to test periodically at-home for as long as this program remains open to county residents.

Meanwhile, our friends in Arizona haven't been able to be tested even once.  Ample test kits aren't available.

We're all Americans trying to remain healthy for the duration, yet somehow, there's no parity in our experiences. 

In a normal universe, the Trump administration would seek/follow guidance from the CDC. But in the inverted dystopia of today's America, the CDC takes its cues from Team Trump, whose personnel have zero collective medical background, yet want to call the shots on testing, sourcing/distribution (or, more accurately non-distribution) of PPE, ventilators and other essential supplies, and showing a statistical success where there is none.

Just about everyone who discovers they have been exposed will immediately want to be tested, despite what the CDC is now saying. The ones who don't want to get tested, probably wouldn't have before these new guidelines anyway.

2020-08-27 17:29,"Just to point up what a bird-brain Trump really is: limiting testing artificially lowers the case count (his goal) but at the expense of inflating the mortality rate.

Good to see that CDC now pushing back somewhat, but the whole brouhaha reeks of politicization and has done substantial harm to the reputation of the CDC.

SRW, M. D."

I know with the Shingles vaccine, the early one was less effective so people just re-vaccinated with the later, far more effective one.

It seems that this question has not really been addressed. If there is no interaction between vaccines, and if the first one does no harm, seems like even if it is less effective it is worth having for the short term."

1)The NBA, NHL and other sports are testing all their players every day, and so far, they have had pretty much zero new infections, and when they have the person infected is isolated the minute the test comes out, and they have traced all the covid infections to outside the teams. 

2)On the other hand, U of Alabama started practices and only tested when kids showed symptoms, and had a good number of their players get infected . Colleges are reopening, kids are not tested, and infections are soaring."

I never thought I would see the day when I have to disregard the advice of a governmental health agency - but let's be real, the guidelines being provided to us are driven by political motives to suppress the numbers of cases until November. I have no doubt the CDC will be left to it's own devices after then."
2020-08-27 18:18,"The CDC has lost all credibility and has proven to be a Trump puppet. It's very sad that in their quest to report fewer cases, they will cause more deaths. The deaths, however, cannot be hidden for long. Whether they are reported as Covid-related or not, there is a clear graph that can show you the historical average for the same period in a given area, the Covid-related and then the unexplained (unreported) deaths.

The same is true regarding Covid-19 test results.  Those test results don't mean what you think they mean.  Scientists know that, and here in a fairly easy-reading article from the NIH they give you an inkling of how to think about Covid-19 test results:
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269418"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269418</a>/

The CDC, trying to please Donald Trump has led us astray.  Try this, try that.  Today this, tomorrow that.  Test for this, don’t test for that - depending on the day and Redfield’s and Trump’s crazed directions.   

Birx, Redfield, Azar - from the same cookie cutter - rolled out by Donald Trump.  Hither skither, my friends, whatever the day brings.

2020-08-27 19:07,"A public servant like Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of the Centers for Disease Control, C.D.C., who willfully allows his agency and its health guidelines to be changed by politicians should and must resign. The American people depend on the C.D.C. for credible health information, but now, after the latest in a series of political interference by the Trump administration, that trust has been totally shattered. It's time for Joe Biden to create a shadow government, especially with honest, trustworthy medical expertise to provide the necessary information that people can trust. Our lives are at stake and we desperately need sound medical advice that we can no longer trust the C.D.C., as well as the F.D.A. to provide. The Trump administration's callous disregard for the truth provided by sound scientific evidence is creating chaos that has already caused tens of thousands to die unnecessarily from the coronavirus. And their latest corrupt manipulations of both the C.D.C. guidelines and the completely invalid claim of the effectiveness of enhanced blood plasma for treating the virus will only result in additional lives lost."

Note the parroting.  Redfield is a Trump sycophant who has failed miserably in his duty to protect the American people from this pandemic.  His positions are politically motivated and designed for an audience of 1 (Trump).  Under his watch 180,000 people have died so far.  That is a professional failure of epic proportions and if he had any integrity he would resign.  Ditto for Giroir and Birx who have been accessories to this horrifying fiasco of a pandemic response.  Does anyone believe this most recent change to guidelines was based on anything other than the political calculations by an incompetent administration that thinks only of its re-election vs public health?"

2020-08-27 20:23,"Frequent, rapid required testing is the only way to identify potential hotspots before they are too large to contain. It is working with the professional sports leagues. One university is implementing just such a process to safeguard the return of students on-campus, with its own test center.

Instead the CDC is moving in the opposite direction; and you wonder why people who are already uncertain about trusting the government and scientific experts trust it even less, thanks to Trump’s complete politicization and dismantling of all the vital services. His sabotage works, either by removing transparency (removing hospital data), removing data points altogether (no testing), or destroying public trust, leaving people to guess, or do what they want.

Yet his supporters will keep insisting he’s doing a great job with their blinders on.  Until a Democrat is elected to fix another mess created by the GOP, spending so much effort just doing damage control, and thus never really able to make true progress on the most critical issues of our time."

2020-08-27 17:48,"Testing does absolutely nothing to contain the outbreak of the virus. It only identifies someone who has the virus. If that person doesn’t quarantine within a day or two of the positive test the test is useless in stopping the spread. Additionally, unless the contacts of the person who tests positive are identified and quarantined the test doesn’t stop the secondary spread of the virus. Presently we do a lot more testing than any nation but how often do we identify and quarantine potential carriers of the virus in a timely manner? Forget additional testing and concentrate on tracking and quarantining potential carriers, testing has become a political football."

2020-08-27 21:40,I find it amazing that with the greatest economy ever with the greatest leader ever we still do not have a rapid and very sensitive test widely available so that we can quickly screen and isolate while waiting perhaps for more specific test results to confirm infection. Perhaps we should strive for mediocrity.
2020-08-27 16:03,"How could the CDC have ever issued testing guidelines for the Covid-19 virus that excluded those exposed who were asymptomatic?  That ruling is so preposterous it is hard to believe that Dr Redfield has a doctorate in any field of science. We already know that there is a large proportion of people who test positive and remain asymptomatic but may still spread the virus while entirely asymptomatic. That is precisely the cohort we need to know most about. Even a 9th grade student understands that. How could ""Doctor"" Redfield be the director of the CDC and allow such unscientific rules to be released by the CDC? We expect the leaders of our scientific institutions to have more common sense than politicians like Trump and his political appointees."
2020-08-27 21:43,"At this point I just look to the guidelines from countries without failed leadership. The CDC is just the latest casualty of the great republican reality rejection. Meanwhile, the New Zealand Ministry of Health recognizes that widespread testing is critical to contain the virus and recommends testing if you have possibly been exposed or have pre-existing conditions even if asymptomatic. Their logical and science based recommendations have been clear and consistent throughout and unsurprisingly they have faired several orders of magnitude better than we have. In fact, every developed nation not under the control of a blundering nationalist has faired orders of magnitude better than us. Im not sure I can remember such an objectively quantifiable measure of a political parties failure in my lifetime. There is no way to spin the numbers, though no doubt he will try."
2020-08-27 19:47,"Does anyone anywhere actually care what the corrupted CDC says anymore?

I note in my NYT ""California Today"" newsletter today that the State has contracted with a firm to provide about 150,000 tests per day in that State.  Meanwhile, NY every day tests at least 60,000 and has approached 100,000 on some days.

These States are doing it right -- and doing it right now includes ignoring much of what Trump's CDC comes up with as ""advice"".

Simply put, the CDC, together with other corrupted Federal health agencies, is now irrelevant and not to be trusted.  It preaches the falsehoods and fake news that Trump demands and which red state governors parrot."

2020-08-27 21:33,"As a complex, the immune system is more than just antibodies versus antigens. Immune cell “memory” can be durable- like polio, measles, smallpox in part because the viruses that cause them are stable and more unchanging in the antigens they present. Though even these immune responses can weaken over time with many needing a “booster” shot sooner or later. Others- flu, rhinoviruses, cold causing corona viruses are changeable. Viral vaccination to produce a durable immune response can be very difficult. Antigens/antibodies are very specific and viruses are pretty good at finding ways to evade the body’s response. We do not prove the efficacy of vaccines in the way Jenner did in the 18th century- self inoculation and self infection. I am concerned that research for a COVID-19 vaccine is rushed. The pressure by government (political gain), and profit (big pharma) is driving the research and trials. A researcher must enroll hundreds of subjects in clinical trials and observe them for a long period of time- cell memory, response, and strength of response wax and wane. Science, especially medical science, is not politics, it is not profit. It is for the benefit of human beings and I feel politics and profit are trumping (Ha!) humans. I am very skeptical and will think more than twice about getting a COVID-19 vaccine until I am sure it’s good, researched science that’s being put in my arm."

2020-08-27 21:14,First it was Dr.Hahn of the FDA who touted a study on treatment for COVID-19 using exaggerated claims of efficacy and now Dr.Redfield of the CDC is advising against testing even when there is exposure to Coronavirus.These are supposed to be respected medical professionals but their statements sound as though they are dictated by the White House.Under intense pressure from their truly professional peers they have had to walk back their statements.I would guess that they both know better but were bowing to political pressure.The American people deserve the best medical advice from our extremely capable medical community- we should not have to suffer the indignity of science mixed with politics.The FDA and the CDC are headed by physicians who swore to “ Do No Harm”- they should keep that as their guide!

Trump has now gotten what he wanted: ‘slow down the testing and the numbers will go down.’ Well, sort of. The number of confirmed infections may decline; the number of hospitalizations and deaths likely will not. And the percentage of those tested who are positive likely will rise, since fewer people who are asymptomatic will be among those tested.

Why on Earth is the CDC allowing the President and his minions to play these stupid games? Perhaps because CDC personnel are spineless; but more likely because those who refuse are muzzled and shoved aside.

Their responsibilities in life, in taking care of their families, their lack of social support and inability to seek help when women would, all contribute to a wearing down of their systems.

This article makes a great point about the issues of deficient numbers and type of  T-cells in severe COVID cases and that women have less of this problem.

But how can the passages above be true (and consistent with this story's overall message)? They're saying that women have more auto-immune diseases, and an overly strong immune response which is problematic for COVID, but somehow less of a COVID problem.

And where is the evidence that people with auto-immune diseases are more susceptible to serious COVID problems? That's certainly not what the CDC is saying.  Nor is the Inflammatory Bowel Disease medical community (pretty sure the same is true for things like Rheumatoid Arthritis.)

The NYT could do people a big favor by looking at this issue (several auto-immune organizations are tracking this) and do a piece that lays out what's happening. My sense is that even though auto-immune patients have higher levels of IL-6, TNF-a and CRP (all problematic for serious COVID patients, who get much higher levels), they are generally not at higher risk for COVID-19."

Covid has taken the lives of people much younger and healthier--on the surface, that is--than me.

2020-08-27 18:27,"The fact that the ACA (Obamacare) does not encourage men to seek out and have a relationship with a doctor the way that the ACA encourages women to do so is likely another factor. Who do you call when you feel sick, maybe a cough, maybe a fever and a headache, and you haven’t been to a doctor in years?

The ACA requires insurance companies to provide women an annual, co-pay free “well woman” visit. This builds a relationship and a medical history. 

The ACA does NOT require insurance companies to cover “well man” visits. Look it up.

Providing men with the same level of preventative care as women should be a no brainer. Not to mention that it should be illegal not to.

Men already deal with stereotypes and toxic messaging that tells them that self care is weak and for women. The ACA should not be sending the exact same message. 

Our public health policy, of which the ACA is a part, should be encouraging men to take care of themselves.

2020-08-26 16:18,"I think the problem is not reopening schools, the problem is how will schools reopen. Governments should put effort in new protocols for schools to prevent them for closing again. Teachers should motivate students to respect each of the messures taken to prevent from contagion. When schools reopen you maybe think that there would be cases for sure, because in a school lots of people are toghether indoor for a long period of time, so a contagion is likely to happen, but if every single student wears an FFP2 or a KN95 facemask, in a distance of 1 inch from the students next to him or her, with windows and doors open and daily desinfections the probabilities of a contagion decrease a lot and a contagion may not happen."
2020-08-26 16:28,"How about a report on how US medical school campuses are dealing with their return to schools and teaching clinics?

I'm an alumni of UCSF and I've always been in awe of their brain power. From listening to their videotaped grand rounds on covid 19, I am impressed with their basic research and public health outreach. If any institution can lead the way, I would bet on our top medical universities, which are likely very well funded.

I'd like to see if these institutions can fund the rapid testing and contact tracing necessary to allow in person class rooms and protect the thousands of personnel on these giant campuses. In this way, by their actions, they can show that there are parts of this country that still have that ""American know how."" I believe we can do it with brains, money and organization. Other countries have gotten the upper hand over this virus; why can't we?

As for the teaching clinics, I would guess students and their instructors all accept the risks of their professions, despite all known protections."

In recent years NYC and NY has subsidized the financial budget of the Federal Government giving much more money in than it has received. But a New Yorker Trump and the Republican Senate seem inclined to punish NY because it is a blue state and doesn’t vote for them.
This will be suicidal for the future of America and I predict will lead to a very deep depression. For without a viable and robust NYC,  America will inexorably sink into the ranks of a declining and likely failed state."

The coronavirus may have tipped the balance to alternative transportation and deeper into the virtual world. I see no benefit in transporting millions of New York commuters into a seething caldron of virus infected and concentrated brick and mortar encased humanity.

Consider the myriad alternative uses for the empty  rail tunnels, culverts and overheads. They could be put to use for more environmentally sound and productive uses, (automated freight transport right-of-ways, aqueducts, power grids, even fisheries and aquatic farms). The list is only limited by your creative imagination. As for transporting humans; wouldn't we rather work closer to home, within walking distance past little community gardens, outdoor cafés and small fabricating shops, the kind that build better bicycles that can no longer be imported via container ships to non-existing ports.

2020-08-26 19:21,"I am a nurse who tests my pregnant labor patients for Covid-19 upon hospital admission. Some have been positive and asymptomatic, others with symptoms and negative.  I have never been tested, nor told I should be. I cross my fingers and wash my hands constantly as I have co workers that have gotten infected and been hospitalized. 

Recently, the hospital told us that even if we take care of Covid positive patients, as long as they are asymptomatic and we’re not performing procedures on them that create risk, we don’t need to use N95 masks.  The CDC  is their source for this direction.  I do not feel confident that the CDC has been directed by physicians or public health experts.  Alex Azar is not a doctor, nor is Jared Kushner.  This article further confirms my suspicions and I will do what I feel is safe for me and my family without confidence in the guidance from the CDC."

I trust the Brits more than my own government health agencies now."

2020-08-26 20:06,"Over the last few pandemic months, I’ve noticed that CDC guidance seemed to be based on factors other than best public health practices.  When masks were rare, we were told we didn’t need them.  I think the real reason was that the CDC wanted them to be reserved for healthcare workers who needed them more.
Now we’re told that those merely exposed to the virus don’t need tests. Two possibilities occur to me:

1. If we reduce the number of tests, maybe processing time will drop, and results will be reported soon enough to be useful.

2. If we reduce the number of tests, the number of cases will drop.  

Number 2 is an outright lie from our president.  The solution to number 1 is to solve the processing issue or come up with a test that doesn’t require processing.

In any case I would prefer that the CDC guidance be consistent with best public health practices rather than politics or process problems."
2020-08-26 20:06,"The (unsurprising) discovery that the administration is pressuring changes to CDC guidelines is nothing less than the latest backslide into a public health emergency from which we may never emerge. It's more than troubling - it's scary and life-threatening at the national and international levels. I have a long history of work as a contractor with the CDC and had always been able to look upon them with the highest regard, through previous Republican and Democratic administrations. Their clinical expertise always prevailed, and they had the last word - were trusted by all. I remember sometimes worrying that there may be some influence over our direction at the very top, but it was just a hint or rumor, and it never affected work outcomes - actual printed or online products. The precedent being set now, as with everything this administration has touched, will rock the CDC and its health-related orgs (HHS, SAMHSA, NIH) to their very cores and have lasting impressions on those of us who have relied on them for years. Do we now have to learn how to circumvent their direction and guidance and become reliant on local resources and experts only? Fine for cities like NYC, but what about rural jurisdictions with very little access to large scientific communities?"
2020-08-26 20:11,"My initial reaction was that this is bad news and more meddling for political gain. But I think there is likely legitimate expert opinion on both sides of the issue. The grave situation we face today in the U.S. is a crisis of trust. We no longer know which sources of information are trustworthy...including elected officials, news media and medical/scientific experts. Inability to trust these foundations of civil society will continue to exacerbate the pandemic and undermine our nation."
2020-08-26 20:12,"Why doesn't it surprise me that we find out that changes to the CDC's guidelines to decrease the amount of testing for covid were imposed from the Trump admin?  And why does it not surprise me that the changes are being defended by two Trump-appointed lackeys in the CDC?

What does surprise me is that the truth leaked out so quickly (less than 24 hours); usually it takes at least a day."
2020-08-26 20:10,"With this much political influence over the scientific agencies, how is the American public supposed to have confidence in the soundness of the CDC advice and, ultimately, the safety of a vaccine?

This political interference is plain dangerous and irresponsible."
2020-08-26 20:19,"No one pays attention to the C.D.C. guidelines and everyone is doing their own thing locally. A local university just declared null and void all testing done before Monday August 24, 2020 and tests have to be repeated if done even last week. The testing capacity even for asymptomatic people is now abundant if you can patiently wait in long lines, but it should not be a substitute for common sense safety measures like wearing a proper mask properly, physical distancing indoors and staying out of bars. 

NY city can increase subway ticket prices and the city can increase taxes or do the major cuts. Last I heard was the subway commuters are now a lot fewer."
2020-08-26 20:21,"Some readers make the case that many who don’t wear masks choose not to out of the sense of individual liberty that is part of the American culture. While individual liberty is indeed a part of American culture, I think this causal conclusion obscures the fact that many people who refuse to wear masks are following the lead of our Administration. 

Doing something in the name of individual liberty implies free will and choice. Unfortunately, for a long litany of reasons including quality basic education, I suspect that many people not masking are not actually exercising free will.￼￼￼"
2020-08-26 20:11,"Asymptomatic people are the most important to test. They are the ones walking around and potentially infecting others. Symptomatic people should behave as if they have Covid and stay home, test or no test.

2020-08-26 19:01,"Medical experts have said that 40% of people with coronavirus are asymptomatic.  That could be the person checking out your groceries, or your pizza delivery guy or your spouse.

And if we were really doing a lot of unnecessary tests before newly infected people will test positive, our test positivity rate would be LOW.  Which it is NOT.

But unspecified ""medical experts"" wrote a ""report"" that was ""considered"" before the CDC declared that insurance companies should stop paying for COVID tests for asymptomatic people?  Really?  Please show us that report, including the authors' names.

Trump's appointed ventriloquist dummies on the Coronavirus Task Force (which does NOT include Dr. Fauci) can mouth the lies he wants us to ingest all day long, but they are still just lies."
2020-08-26 19:02,With these guidelines why are Trump and all his goons being tested every day!
2020-08-26 19:10,"A few weeks back ""pooling"" was all the rage. That never happened. It would have saved valuable resources, but it would also have generated more ""cases"" - at least in Donny's mind. 

To Trump ""No Testing"" is the ""Best Testing"", because if you have no ""cases"" than the virus isn't really there and you can claim victory, get re-elected and declare yourself ""King of America"" afterwards (or will it be ""Leader"", like in NK?).

This CDC mess - together with the the watered down guidelines on schools and other nonsensical CDC messages - clearly shows how a fascist oligarchy is run by a wannabe dictator: you don't like something, you pick up the phone, you threaten them, they cave, you get what you want.

Just like the Mafia, basically. And Don isn't called ""Don"" for no reason, or is he?

The problem is - as always - with the American people. After this and other episodes, how is the world going to believe that you were only innocent bystanders? The world didn't believe the German people when they tried that excuse!

After the election - IF there is still an America - you will have to face the music. Who stood up, who laid down, who was in the opposition, who was an enabler? Even after the political rift in America may one day be bridged the question will remain: who was a coward, and who was a hero?

One thing is sure: you won't find the later ones at the CDC, the FDA or the DHS for that matter. 

You were all ""just following orders"", right? 

Right!"
2020-08-26 19:33,"Oh for crying out loud!!! Who’s surprised?! We need MORE testing not less if we’re EVER going to get a handle on this virus and keep semblances of a viable economy. The administration is being stupid, bordering on criminal."

Somebody may want to tell Mr. Trump that if the number of people tested is reduced, the case-fatality rate will probably increase. Case Fatality rate is the metric Mr. Trump used in his interview with Jonathan Swan.

Yes. In fact, they're doing just that. The CDC has now been pressured to dismiss (as in drop) asymptomatic coronavirus sufferers from their tallies. This is a blatant attempt to hide the facts from us and will inevitably provide the American public with a skewed (as in significantly lower) number. It's called _cheating_ only this time it's the sort of _cheating_ which will have the immediate effect of increasing the spread of the disease, as well as the deaths which inevitably increase when the numbers increase. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump will crow how wonderful it is and what a GREAT job he's doing at leading us out of this crisis.

If we don’t test asymptomatic people — how will we ever get an accurate sense of the true risk and severity of the virus among the entire population?

If anyone in the Rose Garden for Melania’s impression of a deer in the headlights speech was wearing a mask, you couldn’t tell it from what was on camera. At 28  minutes, that was plenty of time for exposure. They learned nothing from Herman Cain.

As for getting help for the cities, step one is prying the Senate out of Trump Party hands. (There is no Republican Party any more - it’s Trump all the way down.) Nothing will happen as long as Moscow Mitch is too busy loading the judiciary with partisan hacks."

The phony re-enactment of an immigration was ridiculous - they are attended by thousands and are an event in themselves.

First, governors who support the president will follow the new guidelines and cases will surely go back up in those states - An example is the explosion of cases in southern universities. The end result is more voters turning against the administration in those states.

They should not be of the illusion that they won’t quit because they might be able to stave off further corruption and criminality.  That, as the past three years have shown, is an illusion—the White House is a nest of irredeemable corruption.  So if the  CDC and FDA leaders are truly scientists and medical people who have taken sacred oaths to do no harm, they need to prove it.  Furthermore, we need to see the instructions that have come from the White House, which clearly indulges in to the kind of magical thinking (if you can’t see it—peekaboo!—it ain’t there) something most one-year olds have figured out isn’t the case.

It isn't ""happening"" here.  It has ""happened"" here.

I pass down country roads up in Columbia County, NY now and see Trump flags flying from various homes.  It is so reminiscent of the scenes in Cabaret when the libertine Berliner ""hipsters"" traveled to the late 1920's German countryside and found a very different world was evolving there."

All that will occur is the temporary dilution of the numbers for a couple of weeks for what the administration thinks will give an advantage to the president for his reelection bid.
What will actually occur is over a several week to couple of month period the number of cases and subsequently the number of deaths will be greater. It reminds me of a child that breaks the lamp in the living room, if he says nothing he can make believe it never happened and no one will notice."

But Trump wanted to cut down on testing in order to create the illusion that the virus is waning in America, while nothing could be further from the truth. He is causing the CDC to CREATE a square hole for a square peg. Talk about hoaxes. Trump’s re-election is not worth the loss of anyone’s life, but more death will surely follow this misguided directive."

""One official said the directive came from the top down. Another said the guidelines were not written by the C.D.C. but were imposed. ... But he also said other members of President Trump’s coronavirus task force were involved.""

Yeah, Dr. Donald Trump, MD, Trump University Medical School 2017 (First in Class - because he was the ONLY one in the class) and Dr. Mike Pence, MD, Trump University Medical School 2018 ORDERED the CDC to put out new instructions that say ""Unless you have symptoms, and preferably only UNLESS YOU ARE ON YOUR DEATHBED, will you get a test.""

This, of course, after the same Dr. Trump said many moons ago that ""We have all the testing we need. EVERYBODY can get a test.  The tests are BEAUTIFUL.""

This from the same Dr. Trump who said, ""inject disinfectant as a treatment.""

Dr. Strangelove has NOTHING on Dr. Trump.

But the CDC is shooting its own reputation in the foot (and the head).  People will not be willing to listen to their guidance if it can be manipulated by politicians.

And when a ""vaccine"" is announced, I for one will become ""an anti-vaxxer"" and will not take that ""vaccine"" until it has been administered to members of the Trump personality cult for a solid 6 months.  They can be the guinea pigs, thank you very much.

Once again, short sighted thinking by this monstrous man."
2020-08-26 21:07,"This is a unique point in time where if managed well, research can actually address how to manage all viral infections. Instead we have a government actively interfering, purposely mismanaging and in fact hobbling scientists in their quest. Slowly but surely the chance of rapid reinfection is entering the picture. The only way this is established so far, is because the patients were infected by two different strains. But what if folks could get reinfected by the same strain? How on earth would one know if it was an awakening of a dormant or suppressed prior infection or something new? Especially in the light of not very accurate tests? Honestly the scientists in all these organizations must be pale with anxiety at their interpretations being actively ignored and twisted. At this stage, the only good a vaccine is going to do is make some folks very rich. 

Please vote to get rid of these awful decision makers. We need to rethink and completely overhaul the management of this disease. 4 more years of Trump, equals, 4 more years of house arrest.

--We can no longer do surveillance testing because we can't determine the positivity rate without asymptomatic cases

--We can no longer do contact tracing because every asymptomatic person in the chain will be a dead end for tracers.

--Insurance companies will probably refuse to pay for tests of asymptomatic people

--We'll be blind to the extent of the spread. 

--Lives will be lost.

How can we control a pandemic when the White House sees it as a political problem? We need a new president if we're going to turn this page."

If Trump can get the head of the FDA to fast track convalescent plasma and give incorrect statistics about its efficacy in a press conference and if he can get the CDC to stop necessary testing to keep the case numbers down, he will have some “doctor” inject saline into his very brave arm and claim victory against the invisible enemy, the China virus.

Trump is basically just a con man terrified of what awaits him if he loses the election and the immunity it gives him.  He has no morals, no ethics, only a primal instinct for self survival.

I had masks and gloves on the shelves in my workshop for working on home improvements & painting and we started using them the second week in March. We’ve been using them ever since when going out in the community. No one but our 3 family members is allowed inside our home without a mask.

What is called “science,” and thus the “sacred work of God,” has been exploited for political advantage. When science is commanded to any extent by political influence, it’s a wash in the sense that the truth becomes buried, harboring a lie.

Although its employees may live up to this pledge, numerous decisions (e.g., mask wearing, reopening guidance, testing) that have been announced under the CDC name have obviously been influenced by political calculus rather than based solely on objective scientific data. Leaders who believed in the CDC mission would have resigned in protest. 

The political influence on the actions of the FDA (e.g., regarding use of hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma) and the movement of COVID data collection from the CDC to an HHS private contractor and back again also undermine the public's trust. The persistent politicalization of health decisions will further erode public confidence–and rightly so–in the efficacy and safety of a vaccine when one is approved."
2020-08-27 0:41,"Thankfully this pandemic is being managed by Governors and state departments of health. Federal Government just collect taxes and gives it back to the rich. Of course it does not mean all Governors follow science. At least 12 did not do so and as a result nearly 100,000 more people died. I hope there will not be a second wave, which there will be, all state governors will follow science."
2020-08-27 0:38,"It’s idiotic to demand evidence that the CDC was pressured into changing its guidelines when anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of Covid-19 is aware that much of the spread of this modern day plague occurs through asymptotic and presymptomatic individuals. 

Widespread testing to detect these individuals is a necessary cornerstone of any effective public health endeavor to control this pandemic. To limit testing to individuals with symptoms is to embark on a catastrophic, cynical, self-serving political ploy that will cause countless unnecessary deaths and wreak economic havoc. 

In short, an ill advised strategem that is absurd on its face, and all too tragically business as usual in the Trump administration."

2020-08-27 1:07,"The influence of a cadre of Trump political props on public health policy is not surprising. The lack of scientific spine among health professionals, like CDC Chief Robert Redfield is appalling. His capitulation to Trump’s toadies follows on the heels of FDA head Stephen Hahn’s recent emergency approval of an unproven therapeutic — remember he also approved of hydroxychloroquine before disapproving of it.

All of these unprofessional and unscientific actions will only sow doubt among Americans about the value of vaccinations if and when a vaccine becomes available. Sadly, given the politicization of the virus in this country, I fear that COVID-19 is going to be omnipresent in the U.S. for years to come. The rest of the world has no choice but to quarantine all Americans and close their borders to us. What a fall from grace!"
2020-08-27 1:46,"To be fair, in many of the countries pointed to as success stories, Singapore being one example, it is nearly impossible for anyone not deemed high risk or highly probable of having the infection to get a test. This makes comparisons across countries very inaccurate."

It’s designed to make the status of the pandemic better than it really to give cover for states and localities to open schools and the economy before the election.  

The Republicans are making the case that Trump should be reelected because he will keep us safer. It is absolutely appalling that his administration is willing to sacrifice public safety and public health to win an election.

Hopefully with clear missions and absolute protection from the White House and all its cabinet septs, answerable to Congress as well as the President.

We'll have to deny protection from prosecution and punishment to agency leaders, and strictly limit the Presidential pardon.

While we're at it, let's give Congress rules with real teeth, the ability to insist, to sue, to bring criminal charges, and to punish, particularly the Executive.

May Brett Giroir's spin live in infamy --a servile yes-man that would allow bad politics endanger the lives of Americans everywhere. Today he failed his oath to protect America.

Too bad, he couldn’t have pressured this sooner in March. 
So Covid case numbers are now being sent to a private HHS statistical firm by his order.

And yes, Dr. Redfield  would have been fired .  Trump's new policy is already being used to downgrade and dismiss the fact that we are still in a crisis- thanks largely to the Trump regimes unparalled ineptness and open obstruction in the fight against COVID-19 Now Trump's big business cronies will justify only very limited or no testing of employees when an outbreak is seen.  Further a rise in COVID-19 infections will work hand in glove with Trump's strategy for societal disruption and confusion  This will move more people to vote by mail, which Trump will use to discredit the election result."
2020-08-27 3:28,"It is clear that the Trump administration is running along a knife edge of two conflicting results from its actions.  As the administration pushes and prods health officials to issues recommendations to ease ""lock down"" restrictions and thus have the economy rev back up, it risks an outbreak greater than that which was experienced in June after the May easing of restrictions.  If that resurgence arrives in about a month and a half, it will injure his campaign, as he will be held accountable just as the election takes place.   However, if the pandemic is resurgent, then more voters will stay away from polls on election day, which could support his candidacy. thus, an early resurgence likely doesn't help or hurt Trump.   But, if the resurgence comes after the election, Trump is a net winner because the economy would warm up, helping his chances, while the health costs would not be experienced until after the election.  On balance, Trump is best served by him pushing for opening as fast as possible.  The public, of course, is not.  But Trump has never cared about the public."

I can no longer trust the advice of our leading source for infectious disease prevention and treatment. These recommendations are beyond stupid, they are also dangerous to public safety. This is reprehensible and the doctors who have allowed this should resign. On November 3, we will have a chance to bring back integrity to every area of our government that has been contaminated by Trump’s corruption."
2020-08-27 3:18,"The day is fast approaching when opening any school too soon will be seen for what it was... ignorant and dangerous. Oh, wait...it's already here. 

Quite literally every school and college that has opened has immediately run into trouble with positivity rates, no matter how many precautions were taken. Two private schools in our district aren't even open, but just holding sports trials has already sparked cases. 

It's fair to ask how many of the positives translate to actual sickness, but so much about this virus remains alarming that the only smart move is to go to remote learning until we bring numbers down and know more. How we've complicated something so straightforward is anyone's guess. But future historians will mock the self-serving attempts to justify the unjustifiable idiocy of this moment. 

 And I'll bet my house on the fact that those screeching the loudest demanding reopening will be the very first to sue if their child comes down with MIS or Kawasaki Disease as a result of being infected. You can bank on it.

Forget the kids; the parents may find themselves in an ICU or coffin. Apparently so-called ""adults"" still have not been able to put 1 + 1 together and realize that while children are *less* likely to get it, they are carriers and many of them do become ill. Very ill. A boy one town over got sick the first week back and is on a ventilator fighting for his life. Tell me with a straight face in-person learning was really worth it.

The US is a disgrace."
2020-08-27 3:07,"Simple. If you're asymptomatic but suspect you've been exposed to covid, just say you have symptoms and get tested.  You might want to hurry, because I wouldn't be surprised if the CDC updates their guidelines to say you should only get tested if you can't breathe."

Reversed once that dog didn't hunt.   Then parroting the party line of everyone is safe to go back to school, only now there are outbreaks everywhere because ""children don't get COVID, and if they do, they don't spread it"".  Yeah, maybe if you don't have children or have nannies this might appear true.  Real parents have other experiences.

Next the CDC will say a vaccine is safe.  Really? True or 'liar liar pants on fire'?   Trump deep state spreading convenient untruths to peddle an agenda?

They are going to put going to work and a paycheck  ahead of school guidelines and restrictions.They know if they send their symptomatic child to school, the school isn't going to send the child home immediately  but instead will have to find a place to put them for the day and maybe even provide healthcare. Then the school will have to put that symptomatic child on a bus with a ton of other students because they can't reach a parent on the phone for pick up in person .The next day, the same symptomatic child is back in school again the following day because it allows a parent(s) to go to work and the rules about having a negative  aren't enforced.

This doesn't even include the chore of notifying all the other parents of students in the class that there was a positive case detected.

In Germany, people have a degree of mutual respect for one another -- independent of political orientation -- and are all willing to pull together for the common good and obey social distancing rules, masking protocols and responsible contact tracing -- meaning they reveal to contact tracers who they were in contact with so stop community spread if they have been infected.
  
In the United States, our culture has been fragmented by three decades of self-serving political antagonism by the Republican Party, and to a lesser extent, the Democratic Party.   We need to heal this rancor or our civilization is going the drain. 

Simply put, we all must stop looking at others not like us as if they are devils, and we must resists political movements that demonize other people.  We must be in a war -- yes -- but for healthy ideas that won't leave half our population in poverty.

Tracking is immediate, no faffing about, find those at risk and test them and get the results back quickly, isolate as needed.
Everyone from the top down seems to be on the same page in terms of agreeing that this is a problem and are listening to the experts. 
Priorities have been set, if the safe opening of schools means that bars and nightclubs need to be restricted or shut down, then so be it.

How wrong they were.  The fine print of their own constitution actually defines their nation as a dictatorship in waiting (hold on, we’re almost there).

Also, far too much focus on infections, and not enough on hospitalizations, which is what really matters."
2020-08-26 19:56,"Germany did pretty well at first, but got over optimistic. They
failed to maintain virus control measures till they drove cases to zero. Opening schools requires getting the virus count almost to zero before you can do  it successfully. (Korea)

The correct response to a confirmed case in a school is to CLOSE ALL schools within about 30 miles for TWO WEEKS, and wait at least till the community prevalence goes below 5/100,000 over 7 days which only a few German states have managed.
Berlin right now is running 10-15.
Korea got down under 1/100,000 over 7 days before they reopened.

In contrast Los Angeles is now at about 100/100,000 over 7 days, about the same as the US as a whole. New York and New Jersey are doing better, at about 20-30, almost as good as Berlin, all still far to high to reopen successfully.

2020-08-26 23:08,"Germany has in many ways been a sort of role model for New York in terms of using testing and data measurement to address the Covid crisis.  For instance, we first learned of the critical importance of the R(0) factor from Germany's initial concentration on measuring it.

As you note, New York State is one of the few US jurisdictions which have sufficiently low positive testing rates to allow schools to safely reopen.  Additionally, the State has advised school districts to develop reopening plans, including in-person and virtual instruction in consultation with parents and teachers.

As a result, NY's approach will not be a ""one size fits all"" and this too matches the German approach.

What will be critical in NY, as it is in Germany, is to continue wide-spread testing and immediate attention to any Covid outbreaks.  New York City, in particular, faces an extra challenge with many older, poorly-ventilated schools.  The City must assure parents and educators that it is able to engage in effective, wide-spread testing and be ready to shut down schools quickly with a viable ""virtual"" alternative already in place as a contingency.  

As a NY'er I am pleased that the State and City continue to address the Covid pandemic with the same science and data-driven approach we see in Germany.

It will be critical now to see if both NY and Germany can indeed develop effective methods to enable and ensure a safe learning environment.

The kids, the educators etc. deserve nothing less."
2020-08-26 23:09,"This article neglects to mention a major difference between Germany and the US:  policy decisions about how/when to open schools in Germany are made by each state’s ministry of education, based on scientific data and input by experts such as virologists and epidemiologists.

In most of the US, this decision has been left up to each school district’s superintendent, who has no background in epidemiology and is under pressure from local school boards — including for whether their employment contract gets renewed. The requirements to be on a school board are usually only having a minimum age of 18 and no criminal record.  

The lack of respect for expertise and competence in the US (as evidenced by the current president and his staff) may end up being the country’s undoing."

From  Time  Magazine  March 30 th

"" Germany became one of the first countries to develop a reliable method for testing for COVID-19. Unburdened by a restrictive central regulatory body, since healthcare is administered at the state level in Germany, private companies moved quickly to mass produce those tests, meaning they could be rolled out rapidly to the population. At least 1.4 million of the tests distributed worldwide by the World Health Organization by the end of February were produced by one German company based in Berlin.""

The lessons the US needs to learn is

1.  Not to have a federal plan , but leave it up to the States
     A local response is more flexible and  more
     effective

2.   Not to listen to  economists  and to retain its industry

Germany does not believe in outsoucing  (praised by Krugman in ""In Praise of Cheap Labor"")  

As to how local the response is
      
German States are tiny   by US standards.   Germany is divided in to 16 States and the  ENTIRE area of Germany is smaller than 1/2 of Texas, or smaller  than 2/3 of California.    

We are talking about a response on the area of US counties."

Six year olds, for the most part, will learn what they need without formal instruction, if their questions are answered. 
For those kids who really need in-person one-on-one instruction, maybe university students who are studying to teach, especially to teach special ed, could, after being properly tested and isolated, do remotely-supervised internships working in the homes of such children. Universities are increasingly online and such experience might be invaluable for all concerned.

Here in US privacy and 'rights' outweigh sharing potentially personal information- like, where have you been the last few days?  who have you spoken to in person?  have you spent time with other people? who? what are their names, etc?  A brick wall many tracers are hitting here in US is lack of compliance when people are contacted by tracers.  I wonder if Germany makes it mandatory, or if there are penalties involved?  GPS monitoring?  I'm sure their privacy protections are vigorous and cannot be co-opted by military forces to erroneously remove, deport, or prosecute when these actions would hinder tracing efforts."

2020-08-27 1:08,"I, as an incoming college freshman, appreciate Germany’s commitment to reopening its schools in-person. I am worried that certain classes, especially those that involve lab work or group projects will suffer from remote learning; also, meaningful class discussions are difficult to conduct online. Furthermore, taking notes in class leads to less distractions because you have to be more considerate of your peers and pay undivided attention. However, we also cannot ignore the risks. Since the outbreak, the world has been filled with uncertainty and responses have varied. Germany’s approach seems to offer some clarity that is desperately needed. Having a clear benchmark would help school officials navigate these unchartered waters. Specifically, a set percentage of infections that would lead to school closures or total remote learning would provide students with much needed direction and perhaps help curtail risky behaviors, such as large gatherings. A percentage is more practical and fair than having a set number of infections serve as a trigger, because school populations vary. In addition, Europe’s laboratory approach, where each country follows similar, yet different plans, should be something we embrace in the United States. Although some measures are best implemented at the national level, the different responses of our states is a strength rather than a weakness as some argue. As time passes, we will learn how to more effectively contain this and future outbreaks."
2020-08-27 1:00,"I feel that the way NYT and other news media is discussing schools overseas is to continue to profile one country at a time (usually German, Sweden, China) and then discuss how poorly it is going. By reading these articles, one would maybe have the impression that the US in the norm - that the struggle to go back to school is happening over the world. This is not true - amongst my regional team in Asia Pacific, nearly all of our kids are back in school now, with the exception of Philippines. China, Japan, Korea, Aus//Nz, Thailand, .. all back in session and have been for months . Right now, here in Singapore, I can hear the delighted shrieks of children running around during PE class in the school yard next to my home. These articles are giving the false impression that the rest of the world‘s families are still having daily chaos as a result of Covid. While things are certainly far from normal, outside the US most countries have moved from “crisis & triage” to “managed care” and we’re settling back into much more predictably. 

I’m Looking forward to casting my ballot for Joe Biden this fall so that I can hopefully see some leadership and relief for my friends and family in the US ASAP."
2020-08-27 1:43,"“It only works if community transmission rates in society overall are manageable.”

This is the huge caveat -- the United States is on an entirely different planet than Germany. Since context and comparative data was omitted in the article here the numbers from today (<a href=""https://ourworldindata.org"" target=""_blank"">https://ourworldindata.org</a>/):

7-Day averaged per one million people:

Germany: Cases = 16.22, Deaths = 2.88
  USA: Cases = 129.01, Deaths = 0.06

So it is about 8 times more likely that a randomly chosen US resident is infected with covid than a randomly chosen German resident.

It is about 45 times more likely that a random US resident will die from covid than a random German citizen.

Districts in Germany where case and death load would spike to US level would immediately go back to lock-downs (which they had on a couple of isolated incidents)

There may be something to learn for the US from what the experiences in Germany some time in the future when this country starts approaching the pandemic is a remotely sane and rational manner and cuts case loads down by an entire order of magnitude.

But for right now what is happening and working in Germany is pretty much irrelevant for people in the US."

The present number of new infections is 1350 per day (7 days‘ average) for all of Germany (pop 82 million), i.e. 1,65 persons per 100.000, which has risen lately due to high numbers of returning vacationers."

I am not so sure it would hurt the Irish. In fact, it may even benefit them. Here's why. If Phil Hogan resigns as EU Trade Boss, the slippery Brits will not be able to allege Irish prejudice in the resultant trade deal with the EU.

I trust the other 26 EU states to protect EU values, with or without Phil Hogan or any Irishman present in the room. The Irish Government seems to agree with me. Tonight, it is signaling Brussels that it sees something far more important than having an Irishman at the negotiating table i.e. Irish/EU solidarity on the existential struggle against the Corona virus. Once again, the Irish understand the power of people sticking together in adversity.

The Irish people have shown exemplary willingness to sacrifice whatever it takes to stop the spread of this horrible decease. I think their co-citizens in Europe would defend their Brexit interests even more if the Irish are willing to sacrifice their coveted seat at the Brexit trade negotiating table rather than allow anybody, no matter how high, to ignore the personal sacrifices of his neighbors in the fight against the Corona Virus. Commissioner Hogan would do more for Ireland by resigning than by remaining."

After his attendance at the 'Golfgate' dinner he reported in a mealy-mouthed apology that he had in fact been to THREE counties: Kilkenny, Dublin (for a medical appointment) and Galway (where the golf and dinner took place).

Later it transpired that he had been stopped by the Police for using a mobile phone while driving. This took place in Kildare - a FOURTH county! And Kildare is in lockdown with all entering or leaving banned.

Once this became public he then admitted in his report to the EU President that he had indeed been to Kildare - claiming as an excuse that he had to pick up essential papers.

Since then it has been discovered that before his 14 day quarantine was one he also went to Limerick, a FIFTH county for an additional game of golf.

And it's rumoured that he went to Kildare twice and awas also seen in Roscommon, a SIXTH County!  But his office says that was a 'personal' meeting and so irrelevant.

I disagree with a comment below about the writer wishes folks in America would resign over transgressions.

May be he has forgotten the #metoo which has exacted many a heads.

And forget transgressions of physical kind - a high ranking officer of Ford Motor Conpany (really strange one) was forced to resign because what he wrote when he was in college - decades back.

And how can the writer forget turmoil on the op-ed pages of this newspaper.  The cancel culture is exacting revenge and many heads are rolling - nit to mention statues.

Yes, the Commissioner showed poor judgement, as many did by attending a dinner with an attendance above the acceptable number, but Ireland, grow up and move on. Ireland will not retain the Trade Commission if Phil Hogan is deposed. It is time for  those who have true Irish national interest to speak out and stop the Irish nation doing something stupid on a far grander scale.

2020-08-25 18:17,"The picture accompanying the article is misleading.
Yes, the restaurants are packed now,  Monday through Thursday, thanks to the very smart and generous Government scheme (It is impossible to get a reservation at any local restaurant if you do not plan in advance) but the restaurants demand the wearing of masks while entering the restaurant and have limited the sittings inside and outside to allow for more social distancing.
This scheme is a big success in a City where masks are obligatory in Public Transports and where every store will only let you come in if you are masked and use a spurt of purel to clean your hands before entering.
Unfortunately, young people still gather and party ....and the Virus is still rampant."
2020-08-25 18:37,"Whilst this scheme is stimulating demand for restaurants, I do fear that sitting in even a socially distanced restaurant, with people not wearing masks, is likely to result in more of these people becoming infected with COVID19.

Whilst the people dying from this virus, has reduced radically over the last few weeks, the testing regime is throwing up substantial daily infections in the UK, which can translate to serious and fatal infections in the near future.

Doctors in the NHS, have become extremely stressed in the NHS and I fear, many of them will not be able to take the pressure if there is a second wave of the virus overwhelming the hospitals.

We miss dining out together or with friends, going to the cinema or theater or bar, etc. but we are prepared to self-isolate until a vaccine/cure is developed. 

Even a 50% discount won't change our minds, though we hope that those who do not have our risk profile consider taking advantage of such discounts--good for the economy and morale (as long as everyone is following the appropriate dining protocols).

The immediate effect was to pump money into the food and beverage sector to boost money in a sector, which is suffering the most pain, and to sustain jobs, but the more subtle long term effect is to boost confidence amongst the population that it is safe to go out and to socialise. Now that people have started eating out again, there will not be such a need for this kind of government intervention.

But here are the potential personal consequences for you and people with whom you interact: you are at low risk when reinfected, but you can spread to others. If they have not had it, they are still at risk for the devastating version. This is why we desperately await an safe and effective vaccine, and likewise for a therapeutic that can make the serious cases survivable and with low risk of horrible side effects.

Here are the public health consequences: just because you have had it does not mean you are free to cruise around as if liberated. You could still kill people by doing so. And while the people you see might be healthy and at lower risk, if you infect them they can carry it to much more vulnerable people.

This is especially a concern for healthcare personnel who contracted the virus once.

Well, the thing about this is that it's important to know as soon as possible, the truth will eventually come out. If people can get reinfected, but it takes three months to pass first (indication are) and among the small percentage of the population exposed to virus originally, possibly as high as 40% in some NYC neighborhoods, but nationally, probably 20 million or 7% of the US population, an even smaller percentage is exposed to the virus a second time, and gets sick again, this will eventually occur in such numbers as too large to ignore."

These blood donations would actually be therapeutic  for the donors, speeding their recovery, if their old RBCs were not reinjected.  This would leave them with thinner better flowing blood and a lower risk of microclots."
2020-08-24 10:05,"The embarrassment in all of this has been our health care system’s (or lack there of) inability to coordinate large scale clinical trials for convalescent plasma up to this point. 70,000 Americans have been treated with it and we do not have clear data for safety/efficacy? Remember when remdesivir was approved in May and trials of HCQ and other drugs were completed over the summer? It’s all about the money. Big Pharma can’t make money off convalescent plasma."
2020-08-24 10:06,"The convalescent plasma has much better chance of helping a Covid-19 patient than hydroxychloroquin.  The chances of any harm to the patient can occur only by mistake in accurate blood group matching.  As regards to the vaccine, without full clinical trial it can be fatal or lead to permanent damage.  For Donald Trump, if he thinks that a deep state is delaying it until after November 3rd, requires a psychiatric referral."
2020-08-24 10:58,"If plasma injections were shown to reduce mortality by 35% over a one month period, I don't understand why Drs Collins and Fauci would oppose early approval. Maybe they are indeed   part of the ""Deep State"""
2020-08-24 11:34,"Questioning Trump's motives is always a fool's errand because we all know why Trump says things. But it's important to realize that there is a level of therapy that science and experience has proven more helpful than Trump claims involving such things like hydroxychloroquine plus his premature exaggerated promises about convalescence plasma. Remdesivir and dexamethasone have proven efficacy. And blood thinners may well assist with thrombosis in some Covid 19 victims. Ultimately, there may also be more than one vaccine but I won't use it until a year after it is randomly tested, introduced and scaled up. In the meantime, we are better off relying on true medical experts and publications like the New England Journal of Medicine and the British Lancet than we are Trump and those he has co-opted."
2020-08-24 11:40,"So now we clinicians know that we can no longer count on either the CDC or the FDA to tell us the truth.  This is a huge loss not only for those of us trying to figure out the best ways to prevent and treat COVID-19, but also for the public, who are once again being put at increased risk for the sake of a megalmaniac scrambling to maintain power.

Don't you think that if convalescent plasma decreased mortality by 35% we would be using it more than we have been these last months?  That doctors and nurses wouldn't have been all over the media begging for survivors to donate? This move doesn't increase its availability - we're already using it - and there are no new, fantastic findings.  This is only a distorted misinterpretation of the little we know."
2020-08-24 13:27,"I had thought that I would get vaccinated as soon as one was available. After seeing how the FDA caved in to a tweet from our information challenged president, I'll wait until I can read a report on a large-scale, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in Lancet, Nature or the New England Journal of Medicine that shows the vaccine is safe and effective."
2020-08-24 11:56,"Under political prodding from the Putin regime, Russia has rushed an inadequately tested vaccine into use before phase three trial even started.  As a consequence, the Russian public and most Russian doctors are sceptical of its safety and reliability, and are avoiding its use.  At the same time Russian medical associations are critical of the Putin government for politicizing medical science.

Now comes Trump, aping his Kremlin friend, and desperate for the appearance of a miracle cure for which he can personally claim credit in order to salvage his flagging reelection efforts.  While convalescent plasma is no repeat of Trump's hydroxychloriquine quackery, his criticism of the FDA for not buckling sooner to his pressure to circumvent normal medical processes has politicized plasma therapy by exaggerating its effectiveness and confusing when and how it should best be used.  Trump's harassment of the FDA until it complied with his uninformed wishes was, of course, driven not by concern for Covid victims but, as usual, by his egomaniacal self-absorption. 

Consider this a dress rehearsal for an inadequately tested October surprise vaccine to be sprung on the nation in order to advance Trump's political interests."

Also, the timing of the announcement is impeccable and comes one day before Trump’s reality TV convention. He will take credit and talk about the therapy this the whole week without fully knowing the effectiveness of the therapy…..if it backfires, he’ll start tweeting,  pointing fingers and throwing individuals under the bus as he’s done throughout his life."

He has now denigrated the CDC and the FDA, and has essentially converted them into yes men organizations which he will use to support his campaign, rather than allowing them to support the American people. Watch for resignations in the FDA. That’s your best indication that trump has devalued the formerly sterling reputation of that organization. 

Fortunately, trump had cut us off from the World Health Organization, who refused to bend to his will. At least we as Americans can still look to them for advice.

Saving 10 lives is nothing to sneeze at, but we are not talking 35% of 1000, which is the impression the President conveys, as does this article.  As Mr Yang would tell you, MATH matters."

This NYT article gives insights into why this is true and who is responsible.  In the face of nearly 200,000 deaths due to the mismanagement of Covid by the Trump people, there is relatively little outrage. People in other countries have protested against the incompetence of their governments; when will people in the USA rise up?"
2020-08-24 15:03,"The June 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association reports a study on the effectiveness of convalescent plasma. Plasma is the fluid component of blood minus blood cells. Plasma of Covid-19 survivors contains antibodies to the virus which should offer protection to someone in the acute phase of the disease. But what seems logical in biology often doesn’t pan out. At this point, the study in JAMA as well as others have showed no statistically significant benefit in clinical improvement or mortality from convalescent serum treatment. 

The JAMA scientific conclusion contrasts with Donald Trump’s self-serving claim that convalescent serum is “a powerful therapy” made possible “by marshaling the full power of the federal government.” In pseudo support of Trump, the FDA issued a mealy-mouthed comment that data from published studies, showed that “it is reasonable to believe” that the treatment “may be effective in lessening the severity or shortening length of Covid-19 illness in some.” Basically, the FDA is agreeing with the JAMA study, won’t say so and, instead, grovels under political pressure to the White House.

The actions of both White House and FDA in this instance as well as the flood of truth-defying statements from this administration about Covid-19 is raising public concerns about the safety of vaccines once they are available and unwillingness to get them which will prolong this terrible pandemic."

Operative truth is whatever interpretation (usually positive) of the facts of the matter that his followers will believe, originally used by Richard Nixon.  It is difficult to distinguish it from nihilism, the concept of no absolute truth.  Those who believe in absolute truth, such as conservative Christians, are vulnerable to being mislead.  The "" marshaling the full force of the federal government"" is nothing more than governance by dictatorial decree, another form of nihilism."
2020-08-24 18:17,"So now we have a precedent for approval of a treatment without proof of widespread efficacy. The FDA more or less says ""It ought to work, and it shouldn't be harmful."" Add to that the intense pressure from the Trump team, and voila, it's approved. Expect to see this replayed for an experimental vaccine. But there's a big difference between a therapeutic treatment for a seriously ill patient and a prophylactic measure for millions of perfectly healthy people.

Psychoactive drugs and those used for urinary incontinence are examples where drug efficacy may be only slightly greater than placebo.  These trials are often conducted at a leisurely pace and with ""professional"" subjects.

Trials for therapies against infectious diseases like COVID-19 that can kill in a short period of time have to be different.  These trials must be based on comparing a trial therapy with the best known of standard therapies, not placebos.  There really is no standard COVID-19 therapy; it varies widely by location and availability.  Don't demand a gold standard if there is no gold available."
2020-08-24 12:34,"Stephen Hahn and his cronies are a disgrace. They are not keeping the health of Americans at the top of their agenda.

Last week the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published treatment guidelines that state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend using convalescent plasma EXCEPT in the context of a clinical trial. <a href=""https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management"" target=""_blank"">https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management</a>/)

Now, we'll NEVER know whether this treatment is effective. Because who's going to agree to enroll in a clinical trial where there's a chance one could receive a placebo, when he/she could just get the plasma outside of a clinical trial?

According to Axios' reporting, Peter Navarro got the FDA honchos in a room and told them, ""You are the deep state and you have to fix this."" And they caved.

When I last looked, Peter Navarro has no scientific or medical training. He is not an expert on clinical trials. He is a spin-master and that's all.  And he puts his own interests above those of the American people and their health and safety. 

The same can be said of Stephen Hahn and his cronies at the FDA. They have no special expertise in infectious diseases. Hahn is an oncologist/radiation oncologist. He is just another hack.This is tainting any future approval, probably by Emergency Use Authorization, of any vaccine. Who's going to trust the FDA? Not me, that's for sure. First, I lost trust in the CDC. Now it's the FDA. I am an infectious diseases physician."

This study from Columbia has some helpful numbers.  From five patients, researchers were able to specify 252 different antibodies to the virus’s spike protein. 

Of the 252 antibodies they found 16 with promise in combating infection, and ultimately narrowed it down to just two antibodies that were potent against SARS CoV 2. 

So in a vat full of pooled plasma from multiple recovered patients, we can guess there will be hundreds of different antibodies against the coronavirus. A few will help. But there is no way to say, without deeper analysis, which ones work really well.

A different vat of plasma will contain a different array of hundreds of antibodies, and of these, a few will help.

So yes, some agents in a pool of plasma are likely to help.  

But since you never know exactly what’s in the plasma, nor which few of its hundreds of antibodies helped achieve recovery — what’s the point of repeatedly testing this changeable and unspecified medication against a placebo?  The only thing in this experiment that doesn’t change from one batch of medicines to the next is the placebo. Emergency use is fine.  

Net, a better treatment than plasma would be a cocktail of just two monoclonal antibodies that were identified as potent in the Columbia study.  Pending that type of concentrated, rifle-shot treatment, plasma may do some good if administered early."

Daniel Griffin described his first day in the ICU with covid-19. Six patients died one after the other. He felt helpless. He could do nothing to save them. He drove home, parked in the driveway, and cried. 

Two things happen: (1) in patients like this, in desperation, you try everything -- convalescent plasma, HCQ, anything. (2) with time, after you learn to treat these patients, their survival improves. You don't always know why. But you're treating patients with everything you've got, they're doing better, and you're afraid to stop anything. 

At that time, you should do randomized, controlled trials of each of those treatments. 

You can tell the patient, ""We have this new treatment, convalescent plasma. We don't know if it works. Would you like us to try it?"" 

Or you can say, ""We have this new treatment, convalescent plasma. We don't know if it works. Would you like to be in a randomized, controlled trial? That way, we'll find out if it works, and you will help us save the lives of future patients."" 

A lot of patients agree to that.

Greece has no tourism and hence no money to speak of this year.  How could they possibly save any jobs when without tourists their jobs are meaningless (more or less) ?  Since in America money matters most, much more than people, which is utter shame but it is what it is, the jobs are being lost since they are not viable.  The hocus-pocus in saving (meaningless) jobs in Europe is silly but is hailed on the pages here for purely political reasons and to spite Trump, which is 99.99% of articles, ideas, and concepts in this propaganda outlet.

In the U.S., we are going to see a wave of unemployment, homelessness and hunger unlike anything since the 1930’s.

But can we really say the entire European economy is gone and not coming back? That is a bridge too far. It is past worst case, all the way to unreasoning panic.

Of course the total economy will come back. A Continent of people will not just stay home, producing nothing and consuming nothing, entirely unlike their character for centuries.

Some industries may not come back to their former glory. However, the magic of the market assures that some will come back stronger.

One example mentioned here is Airbus. In the whole world, its only real competitor is Boeing, and Boeing just self-destructed with a huge aircraft design flop -- the 737Max crashes and design failures and regulatory failures will haunt Boeing for years, and worse they now don't seem limited to the one airplane. Airbus must win from that, because somebody will build airplanes, and they are the only other business doing that."
2020-08-24 16:58,"Fauci and others have been warning since March that a second wave will occur during the fall/winter of 2020/2021, and that it will be far worse than we have already seen. More cases, more illness, more death. In the US and elsewhere.  

In the US, we need to decide, as a collective peoples, whether “it is what it is” reflects the response we expect from leadership, or decisive actions that limit spread, prepare for treatment of the ill, prepare for rollout of immunizations, and support for our economy to avoid economic fallout to the extent possible. I trust a Biden administration to lead such an effort 1000 times more than a Trump administration."
2020-08-24 16:59,European countries will continue to support their citizens and businesses by printing money and paying unemployment benefits of a size that Americans will never see. That’s what “government FOR the people” is all about.
2020-08-24 17:02,Is the European economy direct victim of Covid? Or is it more a result of the American market and emerging markets having failed to address Covid hence falling flat thus impacting demands from Europe as well as supply chain vulnerability? I would hypothesize the latter. This means European actions early on to protect jobs were good but that conclusion may get lost.
2020-08-24 17:10,"“Executives are realizing that the damage is going to last for much longer than you can survive on government support programs, so they are restructuring now,”

In the meantime, governments “are going to face a difficult choice about continuing to subsidize workers in sectors where there is a question about the long-term future,”


If that is the case, then kurzarbeit is working as intended. It is not about keeping businesses alive that are doomed anyway. It's about helping otherwise competitive businesses and workers weather the initial crisis onslaught. Businesses are forced to adapt to the new economic reality and at the same time are given enough time to adapt to it. There comes a time when they have to fly on their own again."
2020-08-24 17:18,"Some of the layoffs are from restructuring plans that companies may have wanted to implement anyway pre-Covid. In other cases, I am sure that companies are also going over and above initial layoffs given that’s it’s easier to hide such non Covid related firings. 

Furthermore, technology was given a 6 month trial run and mostly worked. Some of the layoffs are coming from this as well. 

American companies are doing the same thing. That’s why a lot of furloughed employees will not have jobs to return too. 

In the short run there will be lots of real pain. In the long run, we MUST upgrade our education programs so that every young person is given the skills for the automated high tech world. If you won’t improve education, then you need to start putting out plans on what you are going to do with millions of unemployable people."
2020-08-24 17:39,"Perhaps the phrase ""this time is different"" may actually apply in the case of Covid-19. Downturns driven by the usual economic factors tend to have predictable outcomes. While history does not necessarily repeat itself, past economic downturns have shared enough common traits to enable somewhat reliable predictions of cause, response,  path and conclusion.

Unfortunately, Covid-19 offers no such potential relief as:
1. So much about this virus remains unknown.
2. There is no universally accepted treatment for the virus and a workable vaccine is still somewhere in the future.
3. Political leadership has foolishly engaged in denial, delay and false promises in the hope that this unsolvable problem would somehow solve itself.
4. Fiscal and monetary policy can only provide short term relief.
5. A majority of Americans are employed in service jobs, many of which (restaurant, retail commercial, independent service, etc.) are likely to fail, leaving millions unemployed.
6. A lack of social consensus on the value of masks, social distancing and credible scientific research will continue to facilitate the spread of the virus.

Unless or until a workable treatment and/or vaccine are developed, the virus will spread, people will get sick and die and our economy will struggle to recover. We may yet achieve ""herd immunity,"" but if so, the cost in lives and economic loss will likely dwarf anything we've seen to date."
2020-08-24 18:16,"This is an issue that is going to explode rather quickly.  Either we rethink the entire concept of 'work' or deal with violence in the streets the likes of which we have not seen before.

Unlike the folks who suffered during the Great Depression, today's people are already on edge, already are armed to the teeth and are not willing to grit and bear it.  

Sadly, neither party is willing to accept the inevitable reality that a complete restructuring is needed and will come one way or another.

Bernie Sanders and his ideas are looking better everyday.  Same with Andrew Yang---who was not invited to speak at the convention although several republicans were---and his idea of a ""Freedom Dividend"" or basic income.

Jeff Bezos will make about 300 million today.  Think about that while you contemplate about what Biden will or won't do for you."
2020-08-24 18:29,"Work changes and jobs are eliminated.  But what doesn't change is our need for money to pay the rent/mortgage, the utility bills, the credit card bills, the student loans, etc.  Maybe it's time every country tries to find a better way to deal with basic human needs so people don't feel compelled to steal from each other for the basics in life.  Every person needs to eat, drink, stay warm, have a place to live, wear clothing, and feel useful.  In most of our societies people who can't find work when they want/need it are severely penalized even if they are not at fault.  

I think it's time to explore a real universal basic income for each person.  Or we need to look at the concept of work time, free time, and what we all need.  Do CEOs really need salaries and perks enough to buy a small country?  Should unskilled workers or any worker be paid so little that they cannot afford the basics in life?  Yes this sounds utopian-ish but I think that it's realistic when so many people could be out of work and in economic and mental misery.  

We need to think now before we're overwhelmed with the coming crisis.  Or we can let the crisis dictate our reactions.  Things will change no matter what we do."
2020-08-24 19:04,"I'll venture that COVID-19 is revealing that we have far too many workers and potential workers. Population in excess of what is needed to provide products and services for its members is devaluing labor to the point where the choices are: 1) a much more extensive dole; 2) deal with an angry, impoverished and numerous underclass; 3) distribute jobs with fewer hours (or, in these remote work days, deliverables) among more workers. I choose the third, but there needs to be a living wage attached to the reduced work load (a disguised dole perhaps) and an effort to reduce population. 

Anybody have any other choices?"

I found it on the Facebook profile of the influencital  Belgian geo-strategist Jonathan Holslag, who is advisor to several governements, NATO and other agencies. – Personally, by circumstances and calling for more than fifty years acquainted with the ominous disregard by our over-enthousiastically technological culture (since the locomotives deviced by Stephenson around  1810!) of the indispensable substratum for our existence that Nature is, all this is after all not so negative a news. Since the mid eightees I retraited in summers with prophetical people in the green Ardennes in Belgium to study the great names in eco-philosophy. People like Murray Bookchin (whom I liked very much), Arne Naess (the Norvegian founder of the Deep Ecology Movement), Rudolf Bahro (the DDR dissident who was put to jail by the communists and a foremost criticist of “the megamachine” of our system that destroys Nature) and others. In this position, one reads this kind of messages not only as thermometres of collective loss, but just also as a god-given chance to steer by. 
The fact that airlines and car builders fire tens of thousands of people, it is a reason for joy, for those who are rooted in the Green Movement and her prophetic, long neglected ideas!"

2020-08-25 14:33,"Sadly, most of these ""retraining"" programs are little more than weak attempts to see if ""your current skills fit some other job"" rather than true retraining. 

Very unusually, in this situation employees are being paid and not having any work to do (otherwise, they would not be lay off fodder).  The obvious response should be:  companies identify those likely to be laid off and permit those employees to use their government paid corporate time to retrain ideally with some real retraining financing from the government.   Anyone unwilling to avail themselves of this program... well, you had your chance and months of paid time to prepare.   Not ideal, but far better than the American wing-tip-kick-in-the-pants don't-let-the-door-hit-you-on-the-way-out attitude."

2020-08-25 13:48,"How many jobs does EU and USA think to loose when the “greenhouse effect” on which I tought my pupils in Louvain as early as 1989 continues like we witnessed in the last three years? I can count for you: it will not surface numbers different from actual numbers just a dozen of percent more or less, but we will see numbers of a “different order” like our professor in statistics used the term: we speak of one zero more! Not 22.000 people will be laid off, but 200.000 or more. 
It is sheer madness, to continue “business as usual” in the use of transport machines and house heating that generate CO2 , the gas that disrupt weather and climate thouroughly. And don’t miss out: this is only one chapter on which those dedicated army of eco-philosophers and green critics of society study about since more than forty years!
It is high time to start studying the theme of “man and nature”, and high time to radically change our use of energy (oil addiction in the word of Kurt Vonnegut) and our addiction to technology. 
In this sense, I put more Faith in God than in man: man is not able out of himself to realize this, we have seen this for the last half of a century. Man needs “disaster” like this to offer him a helping hand to veer radically the steerwheel of the ship of society.

2020-08-21 16:06,"As I have been saying for months, this is a marathon, not a sprint.  The Sweden strategy may ultimately be the best strategy, time will tell.

But I don't see any further support for the lockdowns that occurred in March/April.  That was supposed to be about ""flattening the curve.""   We had 1 shot to use that strategy, but leaders were unwilling to relinquish control and the narrative changed from flattening the curve to reducing deaths.

Mask use, social distancing, and banning of large events are still on the table - but no population (maybe other than New Zeeland) will support a new lockdown.  We have new treatments, better methods of treating patients, and all countries are getting closer to some level of herd immunity."
2020-08-21 16:08,"The price you pay for strict lockdowns that suppressed the natural progression of the virus is a second wave when that artificial suppression in lifted.   

In the absence of artificial infection (a vaccine), the virus will resume it's normal course halted through the lock down.

So simple, yet so ignored. Covid is a long race and too many people here were judging who won when it was only half over.  While Sweden and eventually the US recover from their bout with Covid, the rest of Europe will struggle with their artificially created ""second wave"".  In the end, we're all likely to end up in the place.

As for young people, they were not tested in the first phase because only those with symptoms were tested and testing was not widespread.  Any reports that ""more young people are getting the virus now than back then"" is suspect although it is probably at least reflective of the elderly being more careful than the young because, as we know, it is they who are at risk.  While cases are going up, death and hospitalizations remain extremely low."
2020-08-21 16:45,"In this context, the remarkable success in New York State stands out.

2020-08-21 17:11,"All of what’s happening now with countries closing their borders and enforced quarantines also occurred in the Middle Ages with walled cities. The source of all spread is travel. It is as simple as that—people or other disease carriers moving from one place to another whether to the local grocer or around the world. That’s how the bubonic plaque spread across the Mediterranean and into Europe. People in the Middle Ages also refused to take precautions. I’ve read estimates that a third to half the population of Europe died. Those who made it enjoyed a labor market with pronounced scarcity and that was one beginning for free labor markets. As my 89 year old dad reminded me a week ago, each of us is ultimately responsible for himself, herself and themselves. Here’s to the survivors. I think we will be a good lot."

2020-08-21 17:24,"We need to shift  from the strategy of trying to tell young people to stay home. The truth is, the risk for someone 25 is minuscule, and many people that age feel that the benefit of living their lives and working as they usually do outweighs the risk of the virus. It’s understandable given the extremely low death rate for young folks. Give all the anecdotes of sick young ppl you want to, it’s rare for that to be the case. And young folks know it. 

We need to be telling folks over the age of 55 to stay home. That’s where the highest risk is. The risk for everyone with this virus is not the same. Young people are not ignorant to this fact.
Policy should reflect this truth."

They appeared to do that.  Now, the lock down approach is being re-tooled to try and buy time for a vaccine.  That won't work without destroying more of the economy and impairing the education and development of young people.  There certainly will be a vaccine and/or therapeutics, but let's not continue on waiting.  Society and the economy should be be open with common-sense approaches like masks and social distancing.  Covid19 is not some unnatural occurrence.  It is simply a virus that is highly problematic for a groups we can now identify based on experience.  These high-risk groups should be isolated and supported until a vaccine is available.  The short-term economy is going to likely skew very sharply younger and healthier.  Educating the public on who is at-risk and taking basic preventive measures is an investment in the future.  Destructive lock-downs to protect the elderly and frail is an expense that will takes year to unwind."

I - just like every mom I spoke to - am angry that months of harsh sacrifices are being jeopardised by - mostly - a bunch of selfabsorbed teenagers and twentysomethings. If we are going to have another harsch lockdown it's not going to come over well."
2020-08-21 20:43,"Tellingly, this growing concern in Europe regarding the onset of a second wave should also inform New Yorkers.

The devastating Covid outbreak in NY closely followed the onset in Europe.  Apparently, infected travelers arriving in NY from Europe during February and March quickly introduced the virus to the Northeastern US -- mostly via the gateway airports such as JFK and Newark.

The slope of infection morbidity and mortality in NY, for example, closely mirrors that of countries such as France, Spain, Italy, Britain and Germany.

This is unsurprising in that apparently up to 3 million travelers arrived into the NY metro region from these locations during February and March before the travel shutdown.

New York has ""recovered"" from the first wave in remarkable fashion. The timing and scope of NY's ""recovery"" also mirrors that in the aforementioned European nations.  Indeed, New York instituted shutdowns and other controls such as mask orders much like Europe did using similar scientific and data measures and techniques.

And , again, much like Europe, New York has since engaged in a careful, phased reopening. 

As Europe now begins to face a second wave -- it should, and must, inform New Yorkers, including its leaders such as Governor Cuomo, that we may well be in for a virulent Autumn as a second Covid wave begins here.

Until there is either or both a vaccine and cure this virus will remain ready to strike as soon as anyone lets down their guard."
2020-08-21 21:13,"Fear not, America has no need to worry about enduring a second wave. We have had only one wave, a first wave that surges and ripples across the country and has not yet been controlled. An enduring example of Americans' spirited individualism. Our national leadership and many inspired local leaders have chosen to flail feebly at this wave, then bail out. They're trying to control our wave by pretending it doesn't exist, which will ensure its long life. 
They are preserving the strength and longevity of the great American first wave, no fears of a second wave here."

 Lockdown and subsequent re-opening is like teetotaling for two weeks, and then rewarding oneself with a bottle of hard liquor. This. Will. Not.Help. 

It is especially galling that this outcome was not only entirely predictable but also avoidable: Proper PPE for everyone would make any sort of lockdown moot.

The best part (best, if you're an epidemiological  statistician) will be when the heat comes back on in the northeast and the urban elitist schadenfreude disppears in a poof, as cases rise again.

If there's anyhting about this to make us feel better, it's that the fatality rates of the secondary peaks all seem to be much lower than the initial outbreak. That's something, anyway."

2020-08-21 19:59,"The case rates in Europe are still low enough such that it's premature to jump to too many conclusions.

That said, we need to remember: lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop. Once the lockdowns are mitigated, there are inevitably surges in case counts. Politicians and much of the media underplay this reality.

Lockdowns accomplish two things: they flatten the curve, and thus protect the health care system from unmanageable spikes in case loads. And, if we are very lucky,  they may reduce case counts until there is a safe, effective and widely available vaccine.

But at the same time, the lockdowns do tremendous harm.  They have devastated the world economy, which will probably take years to recover. Many people, especially the most vulnerable, have suffered economic harm that will last their lifetimes. More concerning, the lockdowns have had many side effects - collateral damage. As a consequence of the collapse of global trade, there is widespread and growing hunger and starvation. Treatable diseases have increased dramatically, as medical care and vaccines have become unavailable.

Thus, as many demand lockdowns, our leaders must balance their benefits with their costs.

More importantly, we must do everything we can to support the development of a vaccine. This means supporting government and academic efforts, and it very much means supporting pharmaceutical companies. Today, we need them. In particular, we need a vaccine a whole lot more than we need lawsuits."

2020-08-22 0:10,"The CDC says immunity may only last for 30 days, though T-cell memory may enable the body to recognize subsequent infections faster. 

If your immune system can only get you 30 days of immunity, then what are the chances that a vaccine will be 100% effective delivered in one shot? As such, there is no 'herd immunity', just herd slowing things down as different folks make their way through a period of immunity brought on by exposure of a vaccine. This is even assuming that nations can manage an effective vaccine roll out. 

So what exactly is the point of lockdowns when med systems are not overwhelmed? Sure, some nations may be able to be a New Zealand, but unless NZ want to seal their borders to national disasters like the US and Brazil, there is no going back to 'normal'. The new normal may very well be multiple covid infections and increased national mortality and decreased longevity.

In fact, we've brought Covid under control about as well as anywhere else in the world, albeit at a terrible cost in lives and to our economy.  And just as I began to hope that I might find it possible to travel to Europe before the end of the year with relative safety, I learn that the plague is on the uptick.  The takeaway from this is that I cannot fathom the idea of traveling to Europe OR ANYWHERE until a VACCINE becomes available.  There simply is no other sensible option."

It was both reasonable and it proved wise.  People who live in Singapore understand that it's to protect others and not oneself.  It is not a protocol in isolation.  Respect and protect all those who live and work in Singapore and they will protect you.  Even now in the 2nd phase of restrictions being lifted, everyone wears a mask and practices social distancing.  We track ourselves when we go to public areas like malls, restaurants, and grocery stores. All students are back in school. Foreign workers are back to keeping the infrastructure running. We still get daily reports of new and existing cases thru WhatsApp. Accurate and timely information is provided daily by experts and explained in great detail as to the reason and expected benefits. And we don't see patrols enforcing mask wearing anymore.  Singaporeans have learned that the benefits of working together as one will open the economy quicker. The gov't has told it's citizens that we will not be going back to a pre-pandemic economy and has worked with businesses and education institutions to offer training and subsidies to up level it's citizenry.  Singapore is no longer mentioned in western news outlets, but it should be a model of good leadership and how universal mask wearing and behaviours of a unified society can return us to a more normal way of life."

Infections at the moment in our city are around 32 to 100,000 people. The city itself has over a million people, very multicultural, and has one of the highest population of young people in the U.K.

However, one of our leading intensive care consultant in the city is reported to saying the city’s hospitals admission are negligible, and for many days our death toll from the virus is at zero.
He believes that we have to be careful on how we are viewing infection rates, we are testing more, young people seem to be the cause of a lot of infection, but mostly mildly, and people that are older or elderly like me are being proactive regarding masks etc so limiting our chance of being infected.

We wait and see in Birmingham."

Now, that being said, I will say there is blame to go around and that is Donald Trump who at the age of four years old was already a millionaire, who has surrounded himself with such in his administration, a Republican Party who long ago gave up on Emergency Services as it was ""expensive and would create a great deficit"". If this was not a devastating worldwide pandemic that has caused destruction and tragedy as well as economic hardships, I would say yes you must at all times look towards the needs of the future and make certain that the capabilities of the government to provide necessities of life is first and forefront but this is a totally different situation it is tragic and at the same time a travesty.
Fortunately, I live in a country where we had a Prime Minister, Opposition Party, and Premiers from our Provinces who worked together and were able to come to a consensus that citizens, shelter, food, and medication were more important than the deficit.

This is what I pay taxes FOR: to support people who fell on hard times through no fault of their own and give them money for food, shelter, and other necessities when they cannot afford them. Instead, the socialists are using this as an opportunity to destroy the asset I invested in while *forcing me to continue working on it for free* (even if tenants do not pay, I am legally required to maintain the house for them).

In a self-governing society of free people, it is unlikely individuals would opt into a situation of needing to survive on their own in destitute times.  Most, I believe, would opt into system of governance deployed by their community to prevent their destitution.   Are you one?

2020-08-21 18:46,"""Even before the pandemic, about 25 percent of tenants were paying at least half their pretax income for housing.""

And there lies the rub -

If you visit any financial planning website - one of the questions they always ask is -

""Do you have enough money saved up that you could survive for the next six months if you lost your job, or had unexpected medical expenses?"" -

And - that doesn't include financial assistance from the government - upon which most of this article leans heavily to make its points -

If you're paying about $2,000 a month for rent - that would mean you'd need to have $12,000 in savings just to pay rent alone for those six months - (And - BTW - we're now just outside the five-month mark) -

Then add basic necessities  such as food, gas, utilities, etc -

So - now the government checks are going to stop- and here we are -

The point being - if you're only making $32,000 a year - perhaps that artist's loft in Brooklyn - or that lovely studio in Manhattan - is not for you --

If someone is paying half their pre-tax income for rent alone - it's not the landlord's fault --  I wouldn't pay $3,500 (or more!) a month for an apartment even if I had the resources to afford it -
 
A Times article from a few days ago reports that NYC rents are decreasing by 10% as vacancies rise - and why is that - ?

In the short run, we should give these people money to make rent so they can stay in their homes. After the crisis is over, we should get rid of exclusionary zoning and build like crazy. NYC alone has a current housing shortage of 80-160k units, a demand for 40-80k new units a year, and we build only 9k new units each year. We should also expand the Sec 8 voucher program so lower income folks (who will never make enough to pay market rents) will be able to pay the rent, especially the lower rents once we push rental vacancies in every geography to 7%+ (e.g. Chicago levels,  where rents are much cheaper than any other major US city)"

2020-08-21 23:05,"The landlord could have put money in an index fund. They could have even gone with a REIT. Instead, they put it in a single building. Well, the risk of investing is that you can lose your principal. That was always the deal. That risk is how landlords justified their sometimes obscene profits. But now, apparently, the risk of many tenants being unable to pay is unfair. The government should step in and save the landlords. 

While I have some (limited) sympathy for small landlords, the fact is that rents are increasing at least partly because of speculation:

Banks lend on cap rates, which are based on the rent roll. Previously, rents rose organically with inflation, so landlords bid more on investment properties, so the winning bidders needed to raise the rents to pay back the banks the inflated purchase price the landlord chose to pay, because the rents are up the banks are willing to lend more money to buy comparable properties, so other landlords bid up that purchase price, so they need to raise rents to pay back the bank on that inflated purchase price plus interest.... and the tenant is stuck with the bill that the landlords and banks bid up. 

The government needs to prioritize helping everyone get a roof over their heads before (further) subsidizing investors’ highly speculative deals gone bad."

Not saying it's beyond anyone's ability to be fiscally prudent, but it might take some kind of educational program (not just snarky and smug comments from middle-class people who successfully pinched pennies at some point). 2) How can low-income people be helped to make better decisions?

2020-08-21 14:29,"Ideally, universities should either go entirely remote or, at least, waive any requirements and/or penalties for those not wanting to live on or near their campuses and permit completely remote learning options for those who want that. Then they could spread out more the remaining residents and better supervise them. At least the students who are not likely to violate the rules would be safer because they wouldn’t feel compelled to live among those who blatantly will. If Congress and our “I take no responsibility” president wanted to ameliorate this situation, they would give grants to universities to offset the money for room and board. As it is, their failure to act has left most universities having no good option but to try for a residential experience this fall."
2020-08-21 14:44,"So colleges want the students to be adults?

Maybe they should be more clear because I’m pretty sure they don’t mean be like the adults at Sturgis, for instance."
2020-08-21 14:53,"But they are not adults. They are kids on the brink of adulthood and it’s unrealistic to expect anything more. Even the so-called adults are not acting like adults in this pandemic. 

It’s up to the actual adults to analyze and determine the best steps for their college populations, using facts and guidance, not wishful thinking and reliance upon still developing brains."
2020-08-21 15:01,"Why are states like Florida making the same mistakes over and over again? Shape up DeSantis.

We are not ready to safely open schools to in-person instruction in many states. This is because the virus is too prevalent in those states. This means that the virus is present in too many people in the general population, so that even with a modicum of social distancing being employed, the contagion rate is still too high.
Too many of the students will transfer the virus to other students, to teachers and to staff. Then all of these people will take the virus home and transfer it to everyone there. Some of these people will be part of the most vulnerable populations: Older than  say 50-55, with the familiar co-morbidities of obesity, diabetes, cardiac conditions, and compromised immune systems. This is not to say that some students won't die as well or get seriously ill.
I think CDC guidelines call for <1% positive test rates. Places like Florida are still in double digits. Florida isn't alone  by any stretch. You know who you are.
Re-opening schools will be difficult in any event but at these elevated positivity rates, it is impossible and irresponsible."
2020-08-21 15:02,"In my final years in college classrooms, when we got to the World War I poets, I would pause and tell my students that I sincerely felt sorry for them. I told them they reminded me of the tragic generation of kids who had to fight ""The Great War."" Like my students, those kids had been raised in a period of unexampled affluence and comfort, and they had been sheltered by their parents in a golden cocoon of innocence from what Stendhal called ""truth, truth in all its bitter harshness."" I told my kids that this innocence, comfort, and happiness was the worst possible preparation for what the World War I generation had to endure. It was part of a systemic ""old lie"" that made Wilfred Owen so bitter about his parents' generation. Finally, I told my students that though I hoped they would not face world war, it would be inevitable that they would literally spend the entire rest of their lives watching America decline more and more into second-rate status vis a vis China (and soon enough India too). My kids' youth was going to be a beginning at the top, from which the fall would be relentless. I told them that like the parents of the World War I generation, their parents would have done them a favor by toughening them up for the inevitable, rather than trying to ""protect"" them in their constantly hovering helicopters. I didn't know how right I was."
2020-08-21 15:18,"Be adults? The main idea behind going to college is to become an adult. If all kids need is a demand, there would be no reason to attend these bloated institutions, the same ones that look the other way when kids drink, drink and drink. Take responsibility, don’t blame it on adolescent students."
2020-08-21 15:20,"‘’Be adults’: Universities in the U.S. are warning students about gatherings as they return to campus.’

Maybe things are different now, but college has traditionally been a young persons’ first shot at long periods of totally unsupervised behavior. Social mixing, often heavily lubricated with ethanol, is frequent and sometimes more important than academics for some students. The idea that they’d all behave responsibly is probably a fantasy."
2020-08-21 13:38,"I used to work for a major public university when I was a student, and it was so clear then as it is now that administration believes someone students can just be talked into or out of behaviors the administration wants. You’d hope that the people who lead universities would understand that “misbehavior” comes from structures which encourage secrecy and privilege.

You want college? Maybe this is the year you disallow fraternities and sororities on campus. They’re competing for the attention and participation of your students as organizations with priorities different from your school.

You want college? Maybe this is the year you recognize the outsize strength (if not cultural cachet) of returning learners, local commuters, the non-18-22 year-olds that are eager to dedicate their time to study. Those folks could serve the student body at a time like this as examples of studious, serious undergraduates, and don’t neatly fit your model of blame.

You want college? Maybe this is the year you recognize associating your institution of study with a football brand cheapens your ability to credibly warn students about what is harmful to themselves, and advantageous to their brains. School is not a tailgate. School is not a frat party. School is not a stressed out 19 year-old. School is the structure that makes learning happen, or stands in the way.

Maybe administrations actually don’t want college at all, and are just hoping students see through this charade enough to call it quits"
2020-08-21 13:50,Wow college students misbehaving?  Shocking.  Who could have ever predicted that this might occur?
2020-08-21 14:30,My kid’s schools started Monday. Notifications came out yesterday an hour apart. Two positive covid cases already...
2020-08-21 14:43,"My university’s social media feeds are chock full of meetup requests by first-year and transfer students. Classes haven’t even started. 

“It’s going to be okay” and “We’ll be safe” and “bruh there are lots of false positives” and “if you follow basic health protocols you’ll be fine.” They believe in myths. Their attitudes toward COVID-19 are interchangeable with their ignorance of alcohol abuse, hazing, STDs, and sexual violence.

We did this to ourselves. Over one summer, universities tried to back pedal a juvenile campus experience they’ve been pushing for two decades. They lure students who aren’t attracted to higher learning by promising them a social life via “the campus experience.”

Let’s not forget how this monetized immaturity is paid for. My Segal Award for National Service underwrites—through student fees—a playground of entertainment for kids who aren’t serious about education. What my grant doesn’t pay for is supplemented by federally subsidized loans that the Department of Education pays interest on for things like golf cart parades, athletic fees, and “free” t-shirts.

I have to accept that my mandatory fees are going to pay for the imminent outbreak. What a racket."
2020-08-21 14:07,"So the idea is to bring the students back to campus, supposedly think they will not congregate and party; then close the campus and send the students home to spread the virus back to their communities across the country?"

2020-08-21 15:18,"“Be adults,” because we can’t be. Because we need the money so bad we cannot bring ourselves, the actual adults, to do the right thing, we are willing to concoct any excuse or narrative to do this very dumb thing. So yes, you be adults (and warriors too!) and when the inevitable occurs, no matter what, we will say: “No responsibility.”"
2020-08-21 14:15,"So the marketing of college as a four-year extension of high school, where jocks and brains alike can carry on their endless intrigues, has produced attitudes distressing to those running the scam.

Oh dear.

You want adult behavior?  Try (a) keeping out the childish (oh sorry, they're the ones that bring in the money, aren't they?) and (b) treat the rest like the adults you want them to be."
2020-08-21 14:31,"Laughable the problem is that the leaders of these schools didn't act as responsible adults and put profit over their responsibility to look after their students. It doesn't take a PhD in psychology to understand that when you have a large number of people(""adults"" or kids"" living and studying in confined spaces of course your creating a virus breeding ground."

And, if we were honest, and since we were all kids once, we'd admit we knew that. So it's all about the money again, and keeping hypocritical highly-paid university administrators in their jobs.

Its the 21st century. Go virtual. Go cheaper."

2020-08-21 14:52,Young people who want a “traditional university experience” do it for the parties not the learning. We have made these overpriced universities a pseudo educational experience that’s really an expensive Rumspringa for kids willing to sell their life away to debt before they realize it or wealthy families to send their kids to. Higher education has been a sham for a long time that commercial business has helped keep afloat by inflating jobs to consistently need higher and higher levels of education for menial positions that didn’t require it before. It’s just becoming more apparent now that we are in a pandemic how silly and needlessly expensive the university system is.
2020-08-21 14:31,"We’re five months in and the adults haven’t figured this out, so I don’t blame the kids for getting on with their lives"
2020-08-21 14:43,"Is anyone who went to a four year residential college, especially those with robust fraternity/sorority systems, really surprised by this?"
2020-08-21 15:13,"How about the universities act like ethical grown-ups and give tuition breaks for providing a substandard service? Maybe the deans and presidents can give back some of their hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars salaries as well.  You, American universities, are nowhere near the moral highground here."
2020-08-21 13:39,"Drinking and partying have been a big part of US college culture for many generations.  Will be difficult to change that in a short amount of time.

Perhaps some good old peer pressure  ""quit it, you are ruining it for everyone!"" may help.  However, my guess is a lot of these students want to get it and then have immunity so they can continue life as always."
2020-08-21 14:06,"These universities have unreal expectations for students.  The college experience is a social one that involves growing as a person by interacting with people from all walks of life.  Colleges are now asking 18-22 year old kids to act in a way they've never acted in modern history. 

Do they expect them to sit in their tiny dorm rooms isolated all day?"
2020-08-21 14:43,"Many colleges and universities can look to the change in their marketing budgets—and throw in the football and basketball budgets, too—in the last forty years or so to account for why students won’t suddenly act like adults. With the swag and taglines and photos of all the amenities, appeals to campus fun and pleasure aim lower than “adult.” It’s odd then to blame the students for treating the product that way.  It’s not what they were sold."
2020-08-21 14:26,"Any university official that is surprised by students gathering off campus is either extremely naive or, more likely, knowingly pushing the blame for their failures onto students. By allowing incoming students in the dorms and telling returning students that they would have in person classes in the fall, universities provided what they needed to provide to minimize drops in enrollment while simultaneously expecting for cases to rise. 

On every front we have seen that Americans asa whole are not capable of putting the safety of others in front of their comforts, so why is anyone surprised that entitles college students of all people are not being the bastions of self control that chancellors want them to be.

None of this is to mention that of all the clusters of outbreaks at UNC chapel hill, all but one were in dorms. Now that we know the virus is capable of remaining in the air for considerable amounts of time, a single person catching the virus in such a crowded setting would lead to massive and unavoidable spread. Do those seventeen year old children sound like they were behaving recklessly, or does it sound like their college failed them?"
2020-08-21 14:38,"I see no real need for most 18 or 19 year olds to be in college.  Most have no idea why they are there, except that they've been told them their entire lives its a thing they are supposed to do.  Parents who push their kids into college are another irresponsible group in this scenario.  Taking a couple of years to grow up, maybe travel, maybe just get a job, anything to gain some perspective before being expected to make a career choice would be a great experience for the bulk of students."
2020-08-21 14:57,"Oh, now we expect college students to ""be adults""? After years of campuses coddling students over mental and emotional health challenges, accommodating their claims of being wounded by contrarian ideologies, rewarding their fragility with all manner of pricey resources, and then giving out grades of ""A"" and ""B"" like Halloween candy – now we expect mature behavior? (Obviously this does not apply to all students – some are still curious, humble, hard-working and ambitious, but after 30 years in academia, I assure you: the collegiate-corporate culture is partly to blame.)"
2020-08-21 15:22,"“Be adults” is a strange ask for typically 18 year olds who 1) go to college to become adults, and 2) adults can’t even follow social distancing and other safety precautions. The 170k  deaths in America were in large part because actual adults couldn’t act like adults. 

These universities, disguised as businesses, will do anything for that tuition money, while shaming students for this instead of investing resources for online learning or safety measures."
2020-08-21 15:26,"Given the number of non-college student folks well over 18, including the president himself, who have veritable tantrums when told they need to wear a mask, these kids do not have a lot of good examples to follow.  Elected officials in red states,including governors, sheriff's and others insist that no one should be required to wear one.  Lawsuits are being filed and argued over the issue.  

Yes, grow up and act like adults.  The message needs to be directed to those in power to set an example. Start at the top."
2020-08-21 15:31,"Define ""kids."" Individuals who are 18 years of age appear to be regarded as ""kids"" if they're college students, likely enrolled full time, and likely boarders on campus. An age peer who enlists in our military to both serve and earn an education that way is seen as an adult. Higher education is a privilege, not a right. To have earned that privilege, students must accept the responsibilities they've tested their way into. They must show evidence by their behavior that they're mature enough to carry the responsibility of higher education. Stop calling 18+ year olds ""kids."" College is a mark of adulthood. Students must enter and inhabit that  role that's new to them. Parents, college administrators, and faculty must hold them to society's expectations of adults. Follow the rules, don't behave selfishly, put the community ahead of oneself, and focus on learning. Learning is why students are enrolled in a coveted position in a college class. If young adults think the purpose of college is to socialize foremost, then they should relinquish their admission, party until they mature into adulthood, and re-apply. Many, many young adults want to learn. They sacrifice to earn an education. Admissions Offices: focus on admitting these young adults, not the immature ones who don't appreciate how privileged they are to have been given the opportunity to pursue higher education. We're on a war footing battling the virus. These molly-coddled ""kids"" do indeed need to grow up immediately."
2020-08-21 15:53,"Yes, college kids should be responsible citizens and many of them are. But there are unfortunately enough who will not behave responsibly and so will put not just themselves but everyone else in danger. Moreover, we should recognize that in a situation in which large numbers of people are crowded into close quarters for long periods of time, it is tough even for responsible people to prevent the spread of the virus. So maybe the people who decided to reopen colleges in a nation where the virus is still out of control should behave like adults and admit they made a big mistake."
2020-08-21 16:01,"The adolescent brain, with its atrophied prefrontal cortex, the seat of risk analysis and planning, doesn't reach adulthood until about the age of 25. In other words, 18-21 year olds are hard-wired to take risks and rebel against authority. Parents and university administrators who cram their kids into dorms in the context of a pandemic are setting them up to fail. I propose deferring university (and maybe even high school) and finding ways for youths to explore productive risks instead, like fighting fires, harvesting crops, assisting with elder- and child-care, sorting waste, installing solar panels. After a year or two of such work, they would return to school with a clearer understanding of the issues they will have to address as adults, which may result in more meaningful engagement in the classroom. This proposal may seem off the wall, but it won't hurt to try something different. Clearly, our practice of continuous schooling from age 5 (and earlier) to 22 and beyond hasn't served us as well as we have liked to believe."
2020-08-21 16:18,"We don’t believe 18-22 year olds today can be expected to act as adults, to do even simple things to save their own lives or others in a time of unprecedented crisis? Why? I now wonder how, during World War ll, parents of this age group convinced millions of  “young people” to make the phenomenal sacrifices they did to save the lives of many people, both here and abroad. We can’t imagine anything like it today. Sad. To both parents and students in 2020, time to grow up, now or never."

2020-08-21 16:47,"Need we be reminded that high school graduates living away from home for the first time are just barely adults. I think the real adults in this equation for reopening college campuses should be the administrators. They are trying to figure out safety measures that meet the minimum guidelines, but they KNOW which demographic they are dealing with: “immature adults”.  I think there NEEDS to be more honest risk analysis on the human health aspects of decisions and less from the trustees/regents on financial health.

I’m not suggesting that all college students are children behaving badly, but their brains and life experiences simply have NOT YET been tested.  I believe that even many mature adults who have been around since 1967 (Hong Kong Flu) or 2009(H1N1 swine flu) don’t really understand pandemics let alone what our national response should be.

I am old enough to not have any children or grandchildren in college, but as a parent, I CAN imagine the stress involved in allowing a young, healthy, optimistic, child of my heart to be part of some miscalculated campus experiment. I think we need additional federal budget appropriated, not only for better health care, (virus testing and vaccine development) and economic stimulus to schools, individuals and communities, but most importantly to train and provide counselors for the poor mental health outcomes of this pandemic that will be longer lasting than a semester or year of college tuition lost by some university."
2020-08-21 17:14,"When I was in college, we did party a bit and stay up late.  We also congregated in the coffee shop, but we weren't facing a pandemic.

We all know the adage:  ""Youth is lost on the young,"" but this kind of behavior is a symptom of a loss of values.  It also reflects the insanity of feeling invincible.  

As we can clearly see from the daily climbing death toll, no one is invincible.  If these students can't handle some adult behavior during a pandemic, then our future really does hang in the balance."

The other part that isn’t spoken about is the stress these kids felt because they were concerned about spreading the virus to more vulnerable essential workers who were responsible for cleaning covid infected spaces.

Excuse me while I go and bash my head against any ivy-brick wall. Be adults? The people who need to be adults are the actual adults...if there are any left in this benighted country.

Every adult knew months ago that all students are vulnerable, many are carriers, and few have attained the thinking skills necessary--nor should they ever have been put in the position of having to-- to make the call on whether returning to school is safe. 

Let's see if we can assemble dots so big they're planets.

 If you cannot parse that you fail the single most urgent test of our time. We do NOT need science, medicine, advanced degrees, or studies to know this. The visceral evidence is first before our eyes and then in our hospitals and morgues. 

America, start acting like sensible adults. Stop putting the burden of making life and death decisions on our children! It's obscene and deadly.

The science says that those under 25 are not adults. They can not process risk. They should not be on campus now. Asking them to be “adults” is like asking a 2 year old to have patience. It won’t happen, because it can’t happen. I LOVE my students. I am so glad I am teaching online. Last night I had a nightmare, I was told to back to the lecture hall, I faced 100 students. None were wearing masks,. When I asked them to wear masks, they refused.  Let put the blame where it belongs, on the Republicans. Our kids are being kids. 
There is a reason 18-21 year olds are the best soldiers in war, they don’t fully understand the risks and will go with the group on to that beach, etc."

2020-08-21 16:40,"One or all of the following must be true for university leaders not to have seen coming that undergrad students in particular would fail to behave as adults: they all skipped the period between the ages of 18 through 25; as univ students themselves, they were all bookworms and did not have the slightest interest in the social going-ons on their campus; and as school administrators they were and are totally unaware of the social going-ons on at the school where they earn their paycheck. 

Since time immemorial undergraduate students in particular have seen universities not solely as educational institutions but also as party centra. For many students, it is their first time away from home, out of eyesight and earshot of their parents control and that of other adults. No prizes for guessing what will happen then. 

I guess too many of the school leaders were swayed by the nonsensical arguments made by people like DJT and Ed Secretary Betsy DeVos that school should and must reopen, irrespective of the 170,000 plus Corona virus fatalities. Oh well, now those school leaders find themselves with a complete mess on their hands, one of their own making to boot."

Meanwhile, at Notre Dame where the positivity rate (16.5%) is well into the Red Zone, the administration is using student conduct to buffer itself against criticisms of being insufficiently prepared. Sure, student conduct is the cause, but so is the risible idea that they would do otherwise. I thought universities were bastions of knowledge?"
2020-08-21 15:28,"Maybe we will stop blaming universities now for students not being able to have the ""college experience"" in the middle of a pandemic.

Two elements are real, one, the virus and the other, the school. One will welcome “back to school”, and the other will suffer because of it. Unless/until the virus is contained, the school cannot SAFELY operate. No matter how the problem is approached, or, how many experts try to solve the equation, the virus is a fact, and, it seems,the only part of the situation that seems to really know what it’s doing."

2020-08-21 18:45,"Einstein said ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.""
A similar observation is that immaturity is fully understanding something is very risky but doing it anyway.
Multiple studies have determined that the frontal lobe isn't fully developed until the age of 25. While some people mature earlier than others there are some who never mature at all. It is absurd to expect the average college student to act responsibly all or even most of the time."
2020-08-21 19:03,"The promise for on-campus instruction was simply a ploy to enroll students and have them pay tuition and room and board. If the universities has not done so, many of them would have faced financial insolvency. It made more sense for the universities to promise what they could not fulfill while taking tens of thousands of dollars from thousands of students. Forcing students to move out and again lose tens of thousands of dollars on Zoom lessons and on their room and board was premeditated by a multitude of universities’ administrations in order to keep the universities afloat."
2020-08-21 19:22,The most crucial and urgent issue right now is another round of unemployment stimulus and it's somewhat surprising that there is little to no coverage of this.
2020-08-21 19:51,"Thank you for publishing the illuminating editorial from the University of Notre Dame student newspaper, The Observer. 

Many weeks ago when the university announced that it would return to on-campus classes, this seemed to me and almost nightmarish dream. A dream, that the university could return to normal which everyone would like. But also a dream that university funding would not suffer as the virus continues to make its way through our population, young and old alike.￼￼￼￼ Putting the lives of faculty, staff and students at risk is one of the most dangerous things I have seen the university ever do.￼

Yes, we love you Notre Dame. But not enough to die of COVID when we don’t have to.

And the years  that followed saw the highest prosperity America had ever seen. Besides interest rates are at 0% for the government borrowing and most of it comes from within the US anyway.
If managed properly, which it is not at present by Trump and the Republican Senate, the economic pain caused by the Covid19 can be mitigated to allow for a boom once the crisis is contained .
Roosevelt was concerned about helping the American people and destroying Fscism, not about the rich or the debt , and he succeeded beyond any expectations.
Now is the time for massive investments in America's infrastructure, new energy, healthcare , education and research for the future . 
Excessive military expenditures and tax cuts for the rich only serve to prop up authoritarians at home and abroad  and will doom America to fall behind the rest of the advanced world."
2020-08-21 13:24,So the US’s big plan to fight the virus is to wag fingers at a cohort of people whose prefrontal cortex development is incomplete while demanding they “be adults.” Brilliant. Maybe we should take that same advice and have an actual plan.
2020-08-21 16:11,"Smart people, I have noticed, when being blown to bits by raining shells and enemy fire (this time a virus), run for cover and stay down.  Virtually all my training in my youth emphasized that it is silly to walk into gun fire to make some kind of a point - because you are dead.  I spent countless hours in drills where we cadets ran full speed toward the (imagined enemy position), and then crashed into the ground, our knees and elbows bloodied beyond recognition - to practice for real incoming fire.

Here we have situation where the virus is raining down on us.  The intensity is growing, not lessening because more people are infected and not less.  When we first saw signs of the salvo, I grabbed my near and dear ones and rushed indoors, and slammed all doors shut and opened the window of the web.    

Now, the intensity of the barrage has shot up.  And my employer, my mayor, my legislator, and indeed my president safely ensconced in his bunker, are telling me all is well, and go out there and stand in the way of this barrage.

Thanks for the orders.  You go stand in the barrage.  When Mitch's and Trump's school age children go into crowded classrooms, I'll be sure to send mine after a 3 week wait and see period.  Not before.

I'll deal with the after effects of social isolation of my grand children; thank you very much.

2020-08-21 16:25,"This is nearly a Trumpian response to normal behavior.  Don’t blame the students for behaving in exactly the way we knew that they would and should.  The fault lies with the colleges and university for burying their heads in the sand and believing the Trump mantra of ignorance.  The colleges were not prepared adequately for the students and the faculty were appropriately concerned.  There was not comprehensive strategy to test all incoming students, staff and faculty.  There were no measures to enforce the public health guidelines and there were no efforts to deal with students as students.  Acting like adults is completely irrelevant as we have seen over and over again with adults acting as ignorant children.  One cannot manage this pandemic by ignoring reality and science.  It is astounding to me that leaders are shifting blame from themselves to the victims.  Trump must be thrilled that his methodology of lies and deceit have become acceptable mainstream behavior.  Wake up people, listen to the experts."

Maybe it is time to teach young people responsibility and empathy as they go through life, and not send them off college expecting them to act like borderline criminals. I do NOT believe that it is necessary to expect and accept this from any gender, age group, race, religion, or anyone in general. Maybe because they have not been taught better, they will grow into another generation of selfish slobs like the ones who spread virus and hatred now.

Surely college campus administrators didn't expect a majority of their students to follow every rule every hour of every day. These are, for the most part, not East Asian young people. Instead, they're Americans, and they'll pick and choose which rules to follow, like they always have, unless or until forced to do otherwise."
2020-08-21 19:28,"So many universities are far too dependent on athletics. They wouldn’t be bringing students back to campus if they didn’t need that revenue from fall sports. The pictures I’ve seen from an array of SEC schools are so scary. Tuscaloosa, my goodness. I love my alma mater but these pictures make me both scared and embarrassed.

The 7 states of the Deep South currently account for 33% of all cases  — I’m referring to the “Old South 7,” or the original states to secede: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida. 1.8 million cases. 

Throw in Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas to round out the SEC, and that’s an additional 236K cases. 2 million of 5.5 million cases in just 11 of 50 states, largely because we have a culture that doesn’t respect the value of wearing a mask. 

Watch what happens when SEC football kicks off. I haven’t felt this scared since I got stuck for an hour on a downward facing loop of the Scream Machine at Six Flags when I was a kid!"

2020-08-21 19:18,"People keep mentioning these kids' inability to assess risk appropriately, but given the data on hospitalizations and deaths for their age group, are they not correctly assessing the risk for themselves? The fact is that the virus poses low risks to 18-22 year olds. No, the risk is not zero, and yes, there are all the other decision-making factors to consider when judging their behavior (such as moral, the risk to other people, etc.) But as far as strictly risk-assessment for themselves, it's not outrageous to see why students would choose to flout the rules. You might call them selfish and morally repugnant, but that's a separate issue. (And yeah, yeah, long-term health issues are a possibility, but there really isn't a whole lot of data on 1) whether that is a significant risk and for what age groups/demos, or 2) whether the problems are truly long-term at all.) 

These universities probably should have just simplified things and gone totally online in the first place, avoiding this entire situation, but now that they're in it, I think it's asinine to reverse course. Given the lower risk the virus poses to these students, and the (fair, I think) assumption that they're going to socialize outside of safety recommendations no matter whether they're home or on campus, I think isolating them at school, where they socialize with and are physically around mainly their own age group, is the best course of action. Why send them home to mom, dad, grandma, grandpa?"

2020-08-21 20:23,"Now, strictly theoretically, of course -- one would expect that some of America's ""best and brightest"" educators and administrators can be found on its college campuses.  Right?

After all, these are the places of higher learning.  Academies filled with highly-intelligent professionals sporting all kinds of degrees (Ph.D.'s and the like) and so many of them well-published in journals etc. and lauded by their peers.

So it should be kind of a ""no-brainer"" to these esteemed learned leaders that during the course of a global pandemic attempting engaging in congregate learning would be unwise.  After all, even the most basic medical advice would warn against gathering large numbers of potentially infected people together in places like classrooms, lecture halls, libraries, cafeterias and dormitories.

I mean it's kind of obvious -- isn't it?

Yet what have so many of the learned people running our esteemed colleges and universities etc. done?

Why they've called student to campus to, yes, gather together in places like classrooms, lecture halls, libraries, cafeterias and dormitories!

And now, given the ongoing pandemic what has happened?

Spreading contagion leading to closing of campuses.

Who woulda thunk this would happen?"
2020-08-21 22:57,"As with all attempts at reopening, and indicated in this article, it all depends on whether there is community transmission in the first place.

2020-08-21 22:51,"Everyone who enters an environment with possible/probable covid will only be safe if they wear quality N95/P100 to protect themselves.  

Everyone needs a self-protection kit that includes several N95/P100 masks, goggles, and gloves.  If the virus can't get to you, you won't become infected.  These kits are a good investment, as you will be able to use them when the next pandemic hits.

This is a simple solution, inexpensive, and hiding in plain sight.

2020-08-21 16:47,"You be adults, administrators. So far the only adulting you've done is to cave under the pressure of your superiors to make the insane decision to re-open in the first place.

2020-08-21 23:16,"""A report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests child-care centers may reopen safely in areas where the virus is low. It’s a promising finding that may offer a glimmer of hope.""

Is it a promising ""finding""? Or is the CDC operating as Trump's mouthpiece again.

Remember just a few weeks ago when the CDC issued guidelines for school reopening? It was based on science, expertise, and facts, and included recommendations that essentially precluded most schools from actually being able to reopen (6+ feet apart, adequate ventilation, etc.). Trump didn't like those guidelines because the one and only thing that matters to him is the economy, and he figures that without open schools, the economy can't get started quickly enough for him to get re-elected. So he told Redfield to issue revised guidelines--ones that this time were based more on Trumpian magical and wishful thinking. The CDC under Redfield obliged. Of course, these revised guidelines aren't worth the paper they are written on.

How can any of us trust the CDC ever again? I know I don't--certainly not while Redfield is its head. 

How can I now not assume that the CDC has ""found"" that child care centers are safe to reopen simply for the same reason it issued revised school reopening guidelines: because Trump wants it to make that ""finding"" because, in turn, opening childcare centers helps people get back to work."

It’s been clear to me that University “planning” has been willfully ignorant of reality, and instead proceeding as they wish the world to be not as it is. Please don’t blame the victims here once again. A virus doesn’t care if you’re in a dorm, a classroom or a frat party. There aren’t “good” gatherings and “bad” gatherings. And if you’re going to do a shortened semester it’s kind of useless if you have students who commute daily or on weekends. These are common sense principles, and university administrators are smart people. Only they cannot make the hard choices that save lives because they wish it weren’t true. And that is why America is #1 in death."

What next, demand the National Weather Service report rain isn't wet?

It's a plain outrage, subjecting Americans to medical procedures that have never been evaluated.

How do we know these tests have not been intentionally designed to produce negative results, thus proving Trump has cured COVID 19?

Any policy or product that has ever had Trump involved in ordering, approving, reporting on it, any Trump by the way, and ancillary relations, is by nature suspect and requires even more rigorous evaluation.

This is tantamount to requiring doctors to provide only Trump-approved diagnoses.  To lie, just like our President.

Not peep out of Birx (of course) or Fauci (again, what a disappointment). 

Now we sit quietly in a corner, again, as Trump endangers American lives.

What's truly sad about all this is, despite all his puffy rage, his lugubrious dance hall routine at tightly-scripted pep rallies, Trump could have had exactly what he wants (business open, schools open, sports, movies, jobs) if he had just done what he was supposed to: impose mask regulations and related penalties, require quarantines, shut down businesses and institutions that encourage mass gatherings and irresponsible behavior.

As it is, we're in exactly the condition Trump and his lemming lackeys in the states want us to be.  This is, without exception, without question, exclusively Trump's fault.

And Fauci and Birx, of course.

And Ron DeSantis and that fool Greg Abbott."

2020-08-21 14:32,"How did his efficiency improvements result in mail delivery delays?  

Were these delays considered possibly in pre implementation planning?  

How were replacing 23 seasoned top USPS with untrained neophytes expected to improve efficiency?

Since the primary mandate of the USPS is to deliver mail to all citizens of the country, how does he expect the USPS to be able to pay for rural delivery by postage income?"
2020-08-21 14:39,"Given how vital that efficient delivery will be to this election amid the pandemic, Democrats in Congress must absolutely insist that any must-pass legislation this fall contain funding to allow the Postal Service to conduct all operations at former levels of service, and that DeJoy's so-called ""reforms"" will be not just suspended but rolled back through the election."
2020-08-21 13:30,"DeJoy's elimination of USPS mail boxes and high speed sorters, is akin to eliminating loading docks and transmissions from his trucking company operations.  

This is intended to destroy the USPS for his political gain and profit."
2020-08-21 13:55,"In 2006, Congress passed a law to require the USPS to prefund 75 years worth of retiree health benefits in the span of ten years.

Why the USPS has financial problems — because the Republicans wanted it to.

Anything in news media concerning the USPS finances that leaves this information out is fundamentally dishonest."
2020-08-21 14:10,"""Mr. Johnson ... will applaud Mr. DeJoy’s “commendable attempt to reduce those excess costs.” 

I'm surprised DeJoy didn't hang banners over the post offices proclaiming the nobility of his cause: ""Saving Taxpayer Dollars from Government Workers!"" 

After all, the Trump Administration sent Feds in battle gear to engage protesters in our cities under ""Operation Diligent Valor.""  

In that case, Trump cruelly set his sights high above the curb where George Floyd was murdered, sparking greater outrage. With his assaults on mail-in voting, Trump takes the same sledgehammer approach, this time to mail-sorting machines."
2020-08-21 14:12,"Recognizing Trump’s motivation for dismantling our USPS is important.  Two of the foremost reasons are the desire to make postal delivery a private concern, one that funnels profits into a few rich men‘s pockets.  Perhaps more importantly, he’s eliminating a paper trail for this election which would make his claim for voter fraud easier.   When we only see the obvious as we think of motivations for his words and actions, we lose seeing what is often even more devious."
2020-08-21 14:27,"I'd love to hear an impartial economist (""impartial"" within the limits of human capacity) defend the argument for ""greater efficiency"" for the post office. Given the quality of service from the USPS, the Republicans owe us a better argument than ""efficiency"" for their gutting of this vital service. Hold your breath at your own peril. 

Some things are sticky and require work and resources: in-person public education and, clearly, sorting the mail for 330 million people. Where we should be speaking ""investments,"" the Republicans speak of ""efficiency"" - - which is but an economist dog-whistle for bringing necessary services to their knees. 

Please, everyone, if you can afford to do so, please purchase a book of stamps in the coming days."
2020-08-21 14:47,"How many of you believe that he was not aware of the removal of drop boxes and sorting machines (that work just fine) across the nation? I guess he forgot to check with the party line monitors or was it the Senator from Oklahoma on Morning Edition who forgot to check what the story line was? The Senator told us that the sorting machines were old and did not work well if at all. That of course is a lie as the postal employees who brought it up to the press explained these machines were working just fine. 
Oh and there is the delays in mail he tried to minimize and avoided talking about the life threatening delay of mail delivered prescription medicines (A GOP Corp invention to steal more jobs and pocket the money) causing injury that might shorten lives and I expect we will hear eventually will cause the loss of life. 

The USPS loses money because they are not allowed to charge prices that pay for their expenses. It has been this way since the early 70's when the GOP began in earnest to steal our government and economy from us."
2020-08-21 13:48,"Postmaster DeJoy will have no joy testifying under oath before the Senate and then the House. How can he explain his efforts to cripple the Post Office before the Nov 3rd election at the same time that his Post Office advises 46 states that they will encounter major problems with mail-in ballots?
Removing about 13% of the massive mailing sorting machines was the capstone of DeJoy’s efforts to tamper with the Post Office’s commitment to timely deliver mail, prescriptions, and other time-dependent items. Can he possibly deny that his actions are not lock step with Trump’s vendetta against the Post Office and his statement that a malfunctioning Post Office would prohibit mail-in balloting?
I have no reason to trust DeJoy or Trump related to Post Office Operations. I expect that the House will pass a bill that would require DeJoy to rescind his crippling Post Office restrictions and to return the multi-million-dollar mail sorting machines that we removed. Absent timely Senate action, I predict that the DeJoy/Trump duo will continue to sabotage the Post Office operations prior to the Nov 3rd election."
2020-08-21 13:40,A thing to watch for in this testimony is the action of the Republican members of the Committee.  Will they objectively evaluate the issues or will they do their best to protect the President and DeJoy and support their effort to privatize the United States Postal SERVICE.
2020-08-21 14:10,"2006: Republican controlled congress enacts previously unheard-of-ever legislation requiring USPS to ""prefund"" future medical insurance and care for all employees for 75 years into the future.  USPS bottom line suddenly plunges billions into the red for the first time. DeJoy might start there if he's really sincere about cost cutting.  

And dare we point out that his $30-75 million investment in private mail competitor XPO Logistics looks highly suspicious and illegal.

What's next?  The Commander In Chief suddenly demanding that the US armed services' $750 billion annual price tag become a government profit center too?"
2020-08-21 13:18,Just another Trump lickspittle.

2020-08-21 13:43,"DeJoy is another Trump toady, installed to tear down another American institution to make it more difficult to vote.  The Senate will put lipstick on the pig. Again. 

A plan to dismantle voting machines and cut back on overtime is not the basis for a ""false narrative"". It's simply a fact that will benefit Trump, who fears mail-in ballots."
2020-08-21 14:00,"Trump and DeJoy have already done sufficient damage to the Postal System to hamper mail-in voting and that is the REAL reason why they have agreed to desist—at least obviously!
   But NOW it is time that the postal sorting machine these two recently stole or disconnected Be RECONNECTED and put back in service. It is also time that the traditional corner mailbox be returned.
  The above needs to be done NOT simply for voting but because the USPS is an integral part of American life: the only way Americans receive letters from home, receive their pension checks, social security, 
and medication. 
   To cut off postal service as Trump and his lackey have done has also cut into small business dependent on mail payments, thus posing further economic damage to our country.
  Only total ignorance and selfish ends by DeJoy and the President can account for the criminal attack on
the American Postal System. These sins must be corrected NOW!"
2020-08-21 14:56,"He realizes he is under oath, right?  I am watching the questioning from Senator Hawley.  DeJoy assures us that USPS is solvent, then why is he dismantling sorting machines? I hope the NYT includes that answer in its reporting of today's hearing."
2020-08-21 17:28,"Of course Mr. DeJoy will promise to deliver the ballots...too late to be counted.  Remember that even first class mail delivery averages 1-3 business days.  And that's not a guarantee, but an average.  He can make even first class mail take as long as is needed to void the ballot.  Now a promise to treat all ballots like express mail- guaranteed overnight- might  mean something.  Not great (I've had express mail fail) but it is better than chasing this meaningless first class story."
2020-08-21 16:19,"DeJoy is simply following the Trump playbook:  

1.  Lie in your opening statement about the established facts
2.  When confronted with these facts, repeat the lie.
3.  When provided with the evidence, lie again.
4.  When challenged by individual questioners lie to them.
5.  When all else fails, lie one more time."

2020-08-21 16:48,"Mr. DeJoy fails to explain how the removal of functioning sorting machines and blue mailboxes is saving money and making the postal service more inefficient. This is a typical shell game being run by the Trump administration. Now you see it, now you don’t. Maybe if the removed equipment had immediately been replaced with new and more efficient sorting machines and mailboxes, it might make sense (though that would cost millions), but that didn’t happen.
The best solution would be to replace DeJoy!! 
And please don’t attribute information coming from DeJoy to the Post Office  (“according to the Post Office”)! His actions are NOT supported by our loyal and hard working postal employees!!!"

2020-08-21 18:23,"What Dejoy and Donald do not realize,  the government and all of its services is not a privately owned business. We The People own it and we are the end-users and direct beneficiaries of it. 

Donald and Dejoy do not have the luxury of a privately owned business and doing whatever they want without working with the representatives that we have hired to watch over OUR government and its services such as the UNITED STATES POST OFFICE (USPS).  The key here is the US branding, not the Trump branding, contrary to Donalds beliefs. 

Regardless of what changes were made or their intentions, Dejoy had better learn to work with us and not be adversarial like Donald, good communications will go a long way here and help prevent these types of hearing.

You would not have made, planned for, or let large sweeping changes take place without the prior knowledge and blessings of its major stockholders. I am sure you do not answer to stockholders with the same disdain and lack of respect that you did today at the oversight hearing.

Going forward, work with the oversight team, communicate to them, and let them communicate to us."

2020-09-01 14:14,"This article relies heavily on guidance from the CDC. Yet it seems pretty clear that under Trump the CDC's recommendations have been partly shaped by political pressure. For example, to what extent does the discouraging of testing have do do with the lack capacity for widespread efficient testing? Is it that testing wouldn't be useful or that it isn't useful given our broken system? It would be useful to hear what other reputable epidemiologists have to say on the matter, as well as to know something about the approach to this question taken in countries that have been more successful in fighting the virus—not only in Europe, but in East Asia."
2020-09-01 18:41,"No comments, days after this piece posted.

Could it be because of the truthful final statement?

This is the honest medical opinion of a health care professional.  Kids will transmit illnesses, as they always do, and always have done.  Mitigation of risk is the goal, not elimination of risk.  That is the truth, not spin, or wishes, or hopes, or prayers.

Outside of medicine, people want certainty when it never existed before.

Mitigation of risk will require every adult and child to sacrifice something.  Some activity, something.  It appears that this is not possible in much of the US.  We have and will continue to pay dearly for our selfishness."
2020-09-01 16:11,"There's some good info in here, especially urging parents to keep kids with mild symptoms home even when iit may have been safe to send them in previous years.

But, I think all this testing apprehension is causing more harm than good.  Of course it's helpful to get a test.  Knowing something for a moment in time is better than knowing nothing.  If the tests are slow, they are less helpful--but helpful nonetheless.  People are smarter than these doctors assume.  If a test comes back negative, I trust that people will not use this as a free pass to invincibility, but will continue to take proper safety precautions and monitor their health.

This reminds me of the stigma that was associated with wearing masks back in March/April.  Many doctors proclaimed, and news outlets published pieces stating, that wearing masks was not helpful.  Presumably, this was because they were worried that people are so dumb that they would think a mask made them immune from the virus.  But, of course wearing a mask is helpful, at least a little.   People can be trusted to continue to take other precautions.  

Because of these articles, it took a while to convince people that masks are indeed helpful, which may have exacerbated the spike in cases in late June/early July.  It also makes one question the doctors and news outlets that had to do an about-face, especially considering there was no acknowledgement of the previous errors.  I hope the same thing doesn't happen with testing."

2020-09-01 15:32,"Perhaps the most important part of the article:

“But this school year is different, experts said.

“This is not the year to be sending your kid to school sick, even a little bit, even with mild symptoms, which I know is crazy. Because it’s really hard for parents,” said Adam Ratner, M.D., a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases and director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at N.Y.U. Langone. “Sometimes mild symptoms are all we have to go on and kids are really good at shedding the virus, even if they don’t have symptoms. And so I worry about spread from kids who have mild symptoms within the class.”

Symptoms that warrant staying at home include coughing, runny nose, sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain, regardless of whether or not your child has a fever.”


Thank you for this."
2020-09-01 15:27,"“...children with fevers to be kept at home and remain there until their fever had subsided for at least 24 hours.”

The author should’ve added the all-important, “without the use of fever-reducing medication.”

Too many parents pop some acetaminophen (e,g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin) in their feverish kids and send them off to school to infect and cause hardship to others."
2020-09-01 14:28,"If, if, if, if...

This article was not particularly helpful and I think quoting the CDC after we’ve seen how they can be manipulated is especially unhelpful. Let’s face it—testing is a mess in this country and it doesn’t have to be that way.

The premise of this article, is it a cold or Covid, kind of petered out by the end. Here’s the biggest take away—if a kid can catch a cold, a kid can just as easily (perhaps more easily) catch Covid."
2020-09-02 5:30,"No one should be following CDC guidelines at this point. The CDC has been ""infected"" by politics at this point, so advice to not be tested if asymptomatic should be ignored. If you are exposed, get tested. If testing is unavailable to you, self-quarantine."

2020-09-06 3:38,My family just went through this.  My son woke up with a terrible cold on Thursday.  We went straight to one of those minute clinics (or what ever they are called) because it opened before the pediatrician.  Did a strep test and Covid-19 test.  Strep test was negative and we were told Covid-19 test would take 3-5 days... we got very lucky and results came back within 48 hours and was negative.  It was a bad cold and he's still recovering but my wife and I were planning for a long month in case it was positive; 2 weeks for our son to recover and 2 more weeks when we came down with Covid-19.
2020-09-25 23:42,"How on Earth can someone say we've become ""hooked on testing""?!?! Most people can't even get a test on demand and all we've heard for months is that increased testing is the key to reducing community spread. The article literally says that test supplies are limited. And testing absolutely is helpful, whether it is ""just one moment in time"" or not. 

Publishing contradictory nonsense is what degrades the public's trust in CDC and others."

So really the question is reducing the prevalence.

He's frankly totally oblivious of the strong economy he inherited and the where-withal to fight a pandemic (successfully used for the Ebola crisis) that he had but recklessly dismantled
2020-08-29 2:18,"In the bright light of day the so-called “first lady” invariably comes across as insecure, somewhat spaced-out and dumb. Her staged ‘speech’ was utterly robotic, read falteringly line-by-line from the teleprompter, and with little evidence of sincerity or, at many points, even real comprehension of what she was saying. Living with a flaming misogynist like trump must sure be taking its toll on the poor woman."
2020-08-29 2:27,"“Aides to Mr. Trump said on Friday that their line of attack would not change. They plan to repeatedly highlight Mr. Trump’s familiar ‘law and order’ message, and are blunt in their assessment that they will benefit politically from violence erupting at some protests.”

Or, to put it a bit now succinctly: no one is safe in Donald Trump’s America."
2020-08-29 2:28,"The Biden campaign Must make Trump own the current unrest. Trump can't be allowed to simultaneously claim he MAGA'd and that the country is now super dangerous and in need of extra law and order. The riots are on Trump. Is he the president or not? Not even because he has the wrong stance on law and order, but because he sows unrest. To the extent there is fear, the national fear IS Trump's doing. If Trump says it's democrats fault, point out the white supremacist violence that has happened under Trump. Point out the ongoing police violence and Trump's juvenile advocacy of police violence, EG in his campaign when he encouraged police not to protect people's heads after they are arrested and put into police cars.

Biden would also do well to encourage BLM to explicitly denounce violence and property destruction during demonstrations. As Jacob Blake's family explicitly did. (denounce violence and property destruction).  From a very practical perspective, it detracts from the message and makes rioting the issue. It can't and shouldn't be attempted to be spun in a productive way. MLK would not approve. It has to be disavowed now if BLM is to continue positively and if BLM has any interest in removing Trump.

Biden should also support the police through the vehicle of police reform. Make the Police Union responsible for weeding out racists and sociopaths. That puts the police and public interest on the same page."
2020-08-29 2:32,"[They plan to repeatedly highlight Mr. Trump’s familiar “law and order” message, and are blunt in their assessment that they will benefit politically from violence erupting at some protests.]  My question is...Trump has been in office for almost four years, if he is a law and order president, why hasn't he done something about it?   Frankly, what has he accomplished these past 3 3/4 years?  Tax break for the upper 1%.  That was done by Paul Ryan and his cohorts in the Senate.  Trump just got to sign the bill.  A great economy?  He inherited that from the previous administration.  And Trump is doing a good job of running the economy into the ground, sort of like his previous bankruptcies. This is the worst president and administration in my lifetime.  I'm 80 years-old."
2020-08-29 2:31,"Trump is not about law and order. He is about 1984. You're either against civil disorder and vigilantism, or you're for it. So one cannot reasonably condemn Antifa while giving a pass to the militias, but many self-styled conservatives are lopsidedly allergic to Antifa, rioters, looters, and peaceful demonstrators, for that matter. The reason is that as privileged whites, they consider others weak and inferior - think about the language they are using to describe Democrats - and expect them to roll over and serve, and they consider it impudent and ungrateful to fight back. They don't want free expression. They don't care what protesters are talking about. They want to stamp out dissent and rule, and they at least tacitly support the use of violence and injustice to do so. This explains much of American history -- Indian wars, lychings, Jim Crow, killer cops, redlining, segregation, repression of female leadership, and much more. So while Trump fans may hate Antifa, or peaceful protesters simply walking past their houses, Trump loves them. As in 1984, he depends on them, to distract and build more power with his fretful base. Without Antifa -- whatever his fragile supporters, with their delicate sensibilities, may suppose that to be -- Trump has nothing, which is exactly why he's betting his future on whooping up hysteria over uncontrollable ""anarchists"" in the wild, foreign environment of American cities. For the record, I don't support rioting or looting. Or Big Brother."
2020-08-29 2:29,"One of the worst things that has ever befallen this country is: The Fairness Doctrine.  It was conceived in the belief that all sides in an argument have equal gravitas. It also anticipated that all sides would speak truth and use logic.

When the lies from one side so overwhelmingly outnumber the lies from another, the fairness doctrine only serves to give weight to the greater liar.

Columnists, analysts, and pundits should stop abetting Mr. Trump.  Giving  equal deliberation and consideration to Mr. Trump's law-and-order message as  to Mr. Biden's message regarding Mr. Trump's handling of the pandemic is in itself unfair to the American public."

2020-08-29 2:38,"It is quite ironic that Trump has engaged in lying, corruption (for which he was impeached) and inciting of violence promotes himself as a ""law and order"" President.  He is as unlawful and disorderly as he can get away with."
2020-08-29 2:44,"A very challenging campaign, now. 

Biden must be careful to not allow puffery in his campaign and to be very clear and firm about his statements. 

He must keep the loyalty of the Democrats but bring in all the independents and Republicans that he can. He can condemn misbehaviors by police officers and rioters but he must support the police and the protestors, both. 

In condemning Trump’s leadership during the pandemic he must be very explicit and accurate. No room for error with the eagerness of Republicans to repeat all that Trump says without any acknowledgement of his misrepresentations. But Trump did blunder and appeared to actually run from his responsibilities. The harm that has resulted from his handling of this crisis is appalling, far worse than it had to be."
2020-08-29 2:38,"I think that if most people were informed accurately there would be an obvious outcome this election. Instead, we have allowed our political discourse to be driven by people who lack virtue and push fear for political gain. Now, we have militias and provocateurs causing chaos that these people point back to as proof that the fear is real.

This feels exactly the same as how the president regularly causes outrage that he uses to fuel his claims of being a victim. I just hope Biden’s campaign can break these cycles."
2020-08-29 2:46,"Biden says that Trump is incompetent, and cites the fact that under Trump's presidency, the USA, with just 4% of the world's population, has 25% of the world's pandemic fatalities.

Trump says that Biden is somehow a tool of the ""radical left"" and that, under Biden's presidency, the major USA cities would be run by Democratic socialists, just like they are now being run, under Trump's incompetent regime.

Decisions, decisions."

2020-08-29 2:45,"How do you campaign against a pathological liar?

trump’s dishonesty is well known, yet his supporters don’t abandon him? Why?

He is undeserving of loyalty or respect- qualities he doesn’t exhibit toward others.

And now his revolting behavior includes tricking Black residents of New York public housing into giving interviews that he secretly includes in acceptance of the nomination for a second term.

He tramples the constitution, has his minions violate the Hatch Act to use public taxpayer owned properties to promote his lies, and he uses violence he incited to suggest his opponent won’t address the situation.

If he is the law and order president, he should resign and turn himself in to pay for his crimes. He owes every American an apology for abusing each and every one of us."
2020-08-29 2:42,"We need to take a deep breath and remember the famous Teagan quote, “Are you better off now than four years ago?” And four years ago Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million and won in the Electoral College by the narrow margin of 74,000 in just three states—Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all of which have elected Democrats as governors since. With the Covid-19 virus still out of control and the economy reeling toward a major recession or worse, it’s clear that Donald Trump has only one pathway to a second term left. Cheating! And he’s working hard at it by attacking the mail-in vote and crippling the U.S.Postal Service’s ability to deliver ballots on time. Fear and lying will not be effective against the life-and/death reality of the coronavirus and massive unemployment. Americans voted for better health in 2018 giving the Democrats the House and for economic security. Trump has lost on those two vital issues and fear of social unrest will not compensate for people fighting for their very survival."

(Last year there was a sharp discount on Halloween scary boos before The Pumpkin Man even made an appearance).

President Trump was strident about his restoring 'Law and Order' to the point where it began to sound like an Oater.    Look Where We are Now.  'Out of Chaos comes Opportunity'? and the tragedy of it all, our armed forces being ordered to turn on demonstrators, because of fear of losing control.

Trust and respect have to be earned.  Joe Biden is a pacifist.  He is not going to set America on fire like a raging bull.  'Remembering the Price of Freedom!' from Disabled American Veterans who made sacrifices for their country, our country and children:

'America is still at war in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.  Every  day, our troops still face daily danger in places like Korea, and Africa' - (Please tell the President that his gift is tax-deductible according to IRS regulations).

2020-08-29 3:01,"Both candidates are going into the election without fully understanding the long term effects of the pandemic, which will eventually subside when a vaccine is fully tested and distributed. The American economy has been heavily dependent on consumer spending since the Reagan Administration. Prior to 1983, it measured twenty or more GDP percentage points less. Something will give, perhaps due to the skittishness of Congressional and Senate leaders.

There are so many ifs, the candidates, both Biden and Trump, are focusing on spark issues: law and order and pandemic containment, issues that they have little control over. If the Fates are kind, the economy will bounce back, but those fickle old ladies have been known to be spiteful.

America has festering problems, core issues that we have ignored, year after year, to address. The national debt, inequality, healthcare and global warming overhang America like dark clouds. Any one of those can burst and cause a game changing  future. Perhaps that will be for the best, though it wouldn't bode well for either candidate."
2020-08-29 3:00,If I was running Biden's ads a few things would be key: Trump stating that the pandemic would vanish along with a counter of casualties.  The Helsinki wink.

I am all for social progress and more racial and social equality.  However, the Democrats are taking the position that ""Without progress, there will not be order.  No justice, no peace.""  That is terrorism.

The correct position, that of the Republicans is ""without order, there is no progress.""  That is the basis of civil society.

White Biden seems more inclined to social justice based on moral reflection, it is a great pity that the Trumpists totally reject Jesus's example as recorded in the four gospels that begin the New Testament of the Christian Bible. But then, who would expect respect for Christian principle from those who reject all good morals, along with reason and democratic principle, to devote themselves to 100% blind faith in Donald Trump of all people.

I haven’t heard a single Democrat saying violent protests are the way to go. They do support peaceful protests which is perfectly reasonable and allowed by our Constitution.

Even Giuliani said in his speech “how did this violence happen so quickly?” The answer is sitting in the White House! Trump refuses to take any responsibility or even acknowledge that his divisive attitude is part of the problem.

Kim is a post Mao thug who identifies his nation with him.

If I were any of these authoritarian fascists I would go hard on encouraging US division.

The USSR dumped Czars in 1917 and crushed division internally until about 1989.

Russia was born from internal division within the USSR only 30 years ago.

After 1945 it took as its territory most of Eastern Europe.

The Iron Curtain lasted less than less than a century.

Russia is not a great power anymore. 

If Putin manages to hold power for the next decade and avoid division good luck mate but I would not bet on his odds.

China just over 70 years past was divided, invaded and subsists as a one party paranoid about its past and frankly scared more of internal dissent than Trump.

The cultural revolution under Mao, the avuncular killer of his own people is close of mind of Xi.

The Chinese military exists to crush internal dissent, the party to preserve another life dictator.

Trump thrives on internal dissent and promulgates lies that will let him sit in the oval office.

If Biden gets so caught up in what he thinks is a winning issue, ignoring the more complex issues, I'm afraid he and we are doomed.  Over and over, Biden needs to double down on Trump's highjacking of the law to do his political bidding; his flouting of the rules of law by cheating in business; refusing to accept constitutional limits on his authority; using courts to bury opponents; etc. etc.  Biden must use every tool available to show Trump's penchant for lying, cheating, hiding his crimes.

If trump was a contestant on The Apprentice, and had been given four years to make something great, and he did the job he’s done as pOTUS, trump the emcee would look at trump the contestant long and hard, with dramatic music in the background, and then say, “You’re fired!”

Fear mongering works and Trump will never let the vengeful mobs leave the voters' minds. At this point he clearly knows it is one of his most powerful  weapons to destroy Biden who cannot wait to denounce the small percentage of looters in contrast to the number of peaceful demonstrators. It may already be too late to turn it around if he cannot deliver a carefully crafted message to lower the heat on the whole issue.
2020-08-29 5:07,"Unfortunately the virus is in control as is SARS-CoV-2 is like its sister human cold coronaviruses then this Fall in combination with Influenza will make what we have seen in the past small potatoes.

2020-08-29 5:19,"Joe Biden needs to appeal to the mayors of the cities where they are experiencing daily violence that they need to take a firmer hand and curb this mayhem. It is out of control and little if anything is being done to stop it. He has said very little about it until just recently and even then he hasn’t taken it too seriously. Has he seen what’s going on in the cities or is he oblivious? Maybe he needs to turn on the TV and see what’s actually going on throughout our country.

The cities and buildings are burning and the Democrats stay mum. With this type of behavior, they certainly won’t win any elections. This is feeding right into the hands of the Republicans and will surely guarantee President Trump a second term in the White House.￼ ￼"
2020-08-29 5:26,How the Republicans can hammer home a law and order message is beyond me. All this civil disorder erupted on their watch. Or not?
2020-08-29 5:27,"If you were to tell me that Trump won this election and ask for an explanation I would say most likely is that he cheated. 

Second most likely is that he successfully won on Law and Order. 

Biden needs to get ahead of this issue and take the fight to Trump. He needs to way dial up his 'denounce the violence' throwaway statements and go full Sister Soljah. He should make a televised speech that endorses peaceful protests but use the bulk of his speech to blame any violence and rioting on Trump and say that he will not only restore 'decency' but also restore 'calm and order'. 

There is an opening here for Trump. Biden needs to close it down straight away"

You know Joe Biden because he has a long track record in the Senate and as Vice President.  Despite the Republican propaganda, why expect anything different from Biden now? Obama respected the rule of law and Obama's reforms were moderate, and Biden's are highly likely to be as well."

If the candidate is not willing to go out there and push his case then he has no place in the White House. That would explain why Pelosi is so against a debate between Trump and Biden. It has nothing to do with Trump. She and the rest of the Democrat establishment fear the electorate will take a good look at Biden and realise he is not fit for office. Why oh why did they not elect a better candidate? There were so many better choices.
2020-08-29 5:23,Biden needs to do more than hammer at Trump’s Covid response. Voters need information as well - ARE the corporate tax breaks paying for themselves? No. Does Trump have an alternative to Obamacare? No. What is Trump’s plan for keeping expanded Medicaid? How come so many of his staff have been arrested? What has Betsey Voss done in his name? Voters will become bored with nothing-but-COVID attacks. Trump should not President for a lot of reasons.

Besides the obvious (pandemic, economy etc) The main thing that is missing is a direct, full force, frontal attack on Trump as a personality. Instead of being ""high"" use the grotesque performances in the republicans convention and satirize them. Throw them into his face. Dig into him, mock him, ridicule him, humiliate him. Take him out of balance. Show some spark and nerve. Pull the rug from under his feet. Since the beginning, Trump, aided by a slavish media, had the talent to suck all the oxygen in the room. That must be fought off, and the only way to do this is to use Trump's own words, lies, unbelievable ignorance and stupidity and throw them in his face. The corona is a very important subject but is not enough. A thousand people die in the US every day and the sky is not falling. People are (metaphorically) sick of hearing about it.

No matter what metric one cares to use (economic vitality, standing of the USA on the world stage, freedom from internal tyranny and abuse, health care, education, opportunity to do (fill in the blank), social and racial harmony, etc etc etc), personally and nationally, we are NOT better off than we were four years ago. 

“I alone can fix this,” trump stated four years ago. Well, 4 YEARS later and it ain’t “fixed,” buddy - not by a long shot. And nothing I saw this past week, your week to shine, showed me you’ve got any idea at all on how to “fix” anything.

Money and “he/she likes me” together with “they look the part” picked his cabinet. Biden’s mission is to reverse the damage. He will select quality, qualified people to help and he’ll listen to them.

Trump needed video of chaos with which to try and scare people so he sent in unmarked Federal ""law enforcement"" to Portland to throw tear gas and stun grenades.  Hello dirty trickster Roger Stone?

Anything more than a smidgen of fringe radicals supporting this narcissistic, one-man cyclone of crass buffoonery is terrifying. 

Seeing my evangelical friends throw their wholehearted support behind this trainwreck of moral turpitude is even more distressing. It speaks volumes about the destructive power of dishonesty and manipulation. Trump and his enablers have convinced far too many of us that he is the opposite of what we can clearly see; that in spite of pardoning criminals he is the law & order president, that in spite of an enormously disproportionate death toll he has done a masterful job of handling the pandemic, that in spite of this country being shunned by most of the world he has vastly improved our standing among the other nations, and that in spite of his happily and publicly stuffing millions of our tax dollars into his own pockets he is unselfishly giving his time and energy to save our nation. 

In short, Donald Trump is rapidly destroying all we know & love about this great nation while convincing millions that he is making it great.

I feel this election was Biden's to lose (of course, nothing was guaranteed given the post office meddling and other potentially illegal dirty tricks, including Russian influence.  

The Democrats held a very good convention, but their voices are now drowned by the bellowing caged animal whose rhetoric is sounding increasingly deranged.

Thus he immediately and loudly condemned Trump as a xenophobe for halting all in bound flights from China when there was no confirmed evidence of community spread.  Joe knew this would not stop the spread of virus to America, and would only be unfair to Chinese travelers. Joe Biden has a keen intellect, is a strong logical thinker, and with 50 years as a senior politician in Washington, has learned an extreme amount about both virology and epidemiology.  He was involved the successful fight to keep Ebola out of America.  He knows a lot about working with businesses to produce medicines and vaccines as over his 78 years he has consumed many of both. We could all feel much more comfortable with Joe Biden at the helm of the battle against Covid."

During the previous week of DNC, both Trump & VP Pence were active promoting their  agenda every single day. This is the vast difference between Biden & Trump. Biden simply Fails to engage in an Active, Visible & Forceful Campaign to promote his Agenda before the American people. Trump is hyper active at all times in promoting his Lies to win over the American people. Before the Convention Biden was hiding behind his ‘presumptive’ status to remain passive in his basement for over 4 months. Biden Fails to inspire confidence in the American people of his capacity for Active Leadership."
2020-08-29 8:50,"That is correct several rival themes are emerging after the 2 conventions. What the conventions have done is that party loyalties have solidified. That means the Dems are now more resolute about defeating Trump at all cost and the Repubs are more determined than before about reelecting Trump. The 2 partisan baskets are now filled with rock solid party supporters and loyalists. The question is how many are in those 2 baskets. I think it will be roughly equal and what I have been saying for months, the election will be decided by independents.

Traditionally Blacks have en mass supported the Dems but many Blacks feel insulted to feel that they are not thinking for themselves and a new group of Black independents has emerged. There is also a new awareness that it is actually the first Republican president, Kentucky born Abraham Lincoln who took a bullet from a white supremacist after successfully abolishing slavery and now once again it is a Republican president who has signed off on criminal justice reform, opportunity zones for areas with highest black population, pardons and early release for non violent imprisonment to provide relief for disproportionately affected Black families, school choice for better educations for acquisition of marketable skills, a long term commitment to historically black colleges.

Everything is perfect, Biden and the Democrats are the worst people to ever walk the face of the Earth, and Trump is only interested in YOUR CONCERNS.  This is the best of times, and if you see anything that is less than perfect, blame it on a guy who has had no official position for nearly 4 years.  Everybody deserves rainbows and unicorns.  And ice cream.

The Democrats are pointing to all of the problems that we face, the Coronavirus Pandemic, the resulting economic problems, the issues of racial relations that we are experiencing, and global warming (which is exemplified by the rapid increase in intensity of storms, such as Hurricane Laura).  These are all very serious, and dealing with them is, by definition, not going to be any fun.  But dealing with them is a NECESSITY.  Those problems will not go away by themselves.

In the Depression of the 1930s, the country had 3 years to figure out who had not a clue, and Hoover lost in a landslide.  He still got about 39.7% of the popular vote.

We need to defeat Trump, and he needs to receive less than 39.7% of the popular vote.

Talk about law and order? That statement is one of the most frightening, succinct descriptions of this presidency I've ever seen. From the beginning, there has been no ""platform"" other than to enrage and stir the pot in order to assuage one very large ego. There is no ""there"" there. And his minions follow suit, riding roughshod over the truth and government rules and ethics as we knew them.

If not for the mishandling of the coronavirus early on, the fear and frustration playing out on our streets would most probably not be at the heights they are now. If CDC re-opening guidelines had been faithfully followed, the red states that saw such surges would not be in the shape they are now, and more children would safely be returning to school.

As a consequence, the nation has experienced one of its largest economic nadirs since the Great Depression, including tens of millions of unemployed workers and the near-extinction of many businesses. The Republican-controlled Senate has stymied most relief efforts geared toward small businesses, the economically-strapped, and the unemployed, while funneling billions into the coffers of multimillion-dollar corporations that spent years spending extravagantly on stock buy-backs to enrich shareholders. They have also blocked any budget relief that would aid the state and local governments that have been at the forefront of fighting the pandemic since President Trump decided that he “takes no responsibility” for a nationwide crisis. After three years of mounting political polarization and extremism encouraged by the President, a pandemic, racial unrest, and an economic crisis deepening entrenched inequalities, the social fabric of American society is tearing at the seams in waves of disorder typically reserved for failed states. And the GOP, under Trump, wants to be the party of “law and order”? We have officially entered a realm that exists well beyond post-truth."

As the Biden and Trump conventions underlined, our shared values no longer include following the rules, nor obeying the law.

Would a reelected Trump be likely to ramp up or tamp down his profiteering on the hollowing out of our government? Would a reelected Trump go after opponents using the tools of gov't more aggressively, or is he likely to back off?

""What is striking about the dishonest messaging from Trump and his fellow Republicans is that the media's focus has been on whether it will work or convince voters. The focus on these questions makes politics into a value-free, fact-free game. The message to voters says that what matters in politics is whether a candidate’s message resonates with his or her base.""

""The focus should be on what is happening in the country (e.g., a Category 4 hurricane with no mention from the president, a pandemic out of control, another example of systemic racism in policing) and the abject dishonesty of a party unwilling to accept responsibility. The media ignores the degree to which Republicans contribute to racial injustice. Messaging from the Republican convention is clearly an effort to capitalize on racial violence. How is it possible that the coverage is so frivolous and the lack of accountability so great?""

We face the most consequential election in our lifetimes. It behooves the rest of us not to praise (the GOP's) ingenuity.""

Hence for that very reason, these debates must be maintained. Judging from the chemistry in the room, all will be able to tip his or her hat in favor of one or the other. Moreover, considering the recent statements aired by Biden, the concerns over his presumed fitness whereas to approach these much-anticipated debates seem to have withered away. Anyway, this is due part of a process that has been in place for ages now and shouldn't be skipped."
2020-08-29 12:20,"Our law and order president needs to acknowledge a few facts: most of the violence is being fueled by right wing extremist groups who are locked and loaded, ready to help out the police or at least this is what they say. AR-15's don't belong i the hands of a pathetic 17-year-old misfit or slung across the chest of a white supremacist. The shootings and violence are taking place, and have been for several years, on your watch not Joe Biden's. Stop banging the drum for law and order and repeatedly invoking fear tactics while you sit idly by like Nero and watch the cities burn as you and your   cohorts throw more gas on the fire."
2020-08-29 12:33,"When I looked at the online addition of the NYT last night and today I was astonished to find no mention of the march on Washington that took place yesterday: a peaceful demonstration by 50,000 people in support of BLM. This event was a major refutation of what the GOP is claiming about the motivations and actions of the protesters. Why did all mention of it disappear by nightfall of the day it occurred? Did the Biden campaign have no comment?"

2020-08-29 12:26,"If you watched both convention's it is clear who is pushing for chaos and disorder. On both the rioting and the virus, who side is calmly walking from the White House while mobs yell, make obscene gestures and push loudspeakers in people's faces. Who gets permits to protest legally, when anti protesters show up an attack.  Who pulls people from vehicles and beats them. Who blocks traffic, smashes windows and loots and burns. Democrats run these cities where the police have been prevented from acting and received no support from their leaders. Ask Joe or his  team, was Blake breaking the law, should he had allowed himself to be arrested ""peacefully"" for current crimes and the outstanding warrant. You won't because it might mean he has to say aloud what he is doing behind our backs."
2020-08-29 12:29,"Trump? Law and order? That's a cruel joke. Here is this so-called president's rap sheet:

- $25 million settlement in 2016 for defrauding students at ""Trump University.""

- $2 million fine in 2019 for operating a fraudulent ""charitable foundation.""

- $10 million civil penalty in 2015 for ""willful and repeated violations of the Bank Secrecy Act"" at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort

- $477,000 fine in 1991 for money laundering by Russians using Trump Taj Mahal"
2020-08-29 12:51,"Did Trump openly threaten and intimidate former Ambassador Yovanovitch WHILE she was testifying?

Yes.

Was there correspondence between Trump and the Russians who were at his son's meeting held at Trump Tower related to tampering with the 2016 election?

Yes.

Did he obstruct justice at least 10 times?

Yes.

Did he refuse to testify before Mueller?

Yes.

Did he raise his resort fees - even doubling Mara Lago's - but not divest in his private enterprises?

Yes.

The list goes on.

And I'm tired of the fact that even this newspaper is not exposing Donald J. Trump THOROUGHLY.

RIGHT NOW

Because if you don't, this two-bit money-laundering felon gets away with this idiotic campaign of his, held at OUR house, and which can result in an even worse version of his Reality TV show that has a trap door we are falling through - many of us to our deaths."
2020-08-29 11:49,Some of Trump's own supporters are contributing to the violence. The so-called Umbrella Man in Minneapolis could be seen on video smashing the glass of businesses while holding an umbrella. Turns out he's a white supremacist whose ideology supports Trump. The young 17-year old man from Illinois who crossed state line into Wisconsin with an AR-15 where he murdered two protesters while wounding another one was sitting front row at a Trump rally. His Twitter account also shows his support for Trump. Yet Ann Coulter is  calling for him to be president.
2020-08-29 11:55,"If Biden & Co opt to make Cov19 mishandling their focus then just let go of hope for a win. This is about jobs, inequality, infrastructure, law and order, education. Climate change and cov response can wait- get a grip or lose."
2020-08-29 12:02,"I heard this morning that a poll showed that many Republicans would be willing to lose some of our democracy if it means staying in power.  I just read a news article which interviewed a Trump supporter, who'd gone to see him at a New Hampshire airport after his acceptance speech for which he used the White House as a political prop (much as he used the Bible and a church as one recently after having tear gas fired on peaceful protesters), who said that the BLM protests are ""unAmerican"", ie: a woman supporting the first US President to cheapen the White House for political purposes, a president who has consistently defended a foreign enemy, Putin, over his own country, who has routinely attacked US veterans, who has lied to her over 20,000 times, etc., says protesting is unAmerican.  This is the evidence that the American experiment and democracy is coming to an end. Trump is only exploiting this kind of ignorance, stupidity, and willingness to sell out the country for partisan reasons. He's willing to do it as well, and that is why they love him. Trump isn't destroying America. His base and the Republican Party are, and it's because Republicans have absolutely no standards whatsoever for behavior for Republicans, while having hyperstandards for political rivals.  As Matthew Dowd, a Bush campaign manager, said, if Obama had used the WH that way, ""heads would be on fire."""
2020-08-29 12:47,"The administration bungled our Covid response but that is a loser as the primary campaign issue. Violence. When people are being oppressed, they often react violently. ""Law and Order"" is code for suppression of the 99%. We know that the chaos, anarchy and violence comes directly from the Trump administration. That picture should be easy to frame."
2020-08-29 12:51,"In typical Trump fashion he is setting up a false issue... Law & Order. Why? Because 1) he is trailing badly in the polls 2) he has no platform. Nothing on infrastructure, nothing on health care, nothing on the environment (except ruining it), nothing on the economy, nothing on healing the country, nothing worthwhile on foreign policy. The list is endless. The Dems have to run ads pointing out his distain for minorities and his false issues. He seems to forget that this is his watch and any out of control protests are his fault."
2020-08-29 12:33,"The ""rival themes"" are pretty basic, I think:  ""Here's what Trump is doing and has been doing"" vs. ""Here's what Biden MIGHT do."""
2020-08-29 11:54,"If it is Covid vs Law & Order, the latter wins. Dems are going to be badly disappointed if they are trying win on Covid platform. You can say that Trump failed in some aspects; but everyone knows he did not “start” it. On the other side, some will claim Trump helped the economy move forward and did his best with an unknown pandemic. And by election if things are improved, vaccine development is on track, the failure message will be lost. Americans look at present and future. Trump can pin law & order as a future matter if Biden wins and scare people."
2020-08-29 12:12,"People voting solely based on security and religion-race line should be careful about their choices. Last year, Mr. Modi ran his campaign along the same lines as Mr. Trump is doing this year, and won handily. But then, the aftermath of his win is for all to see. Increased inequality, increased violence and rioting, an economy which went from bad to worse to a point where the federal government is unable to pay the state governments their fair share of the indirect taxes and a worsening Covid-19 situation. So, dear Americans please be careful about the issues that you choose as a reason for your vote in favour of whichever candidate that you vote for."
2020-08-29 12:25,"President Trump made two decisions which will have a profound impact on this pandemic. Despite the ongoing impeachment saga, which clearly has accomplished nothing, he instituted a travel ban on China. More importantly he began Operation Warp Speed which will deliver vaccines to Americans many months sooner than if he had not done it. He was not responsible, nor was Biden, for many Americans who do not mask up. I see far too many New Yorkers without masks, on the streets of Manhattan and we have many state officials imploring them to wear them. He was not responsible for the decision by Governors to force Covid patients into nursing homes. He is responsible for sending the National Guard into areas, like Wisconsin where law and order is a distant memory. I mask up and fear violence on the streets more than the virus but I am grateful for Operation Warp Speed as I am on the most vulnerable list, so to speak."
2020-08-29 12:35,"Trump's problem is that his message is more emotional than real since street crime and riots are generally not the purview of the federal government. He will not be able to do a better job of solving any lawless problem after elected than he is able to do right now. On the other hand, there are many things the federal government can do to ameliorate the pandemic."
2020-08-29 12:25,Police reform and community relationships need structural change. If you examine successful western democracies in this area the common thread is strict handgun control. Everything else is a band aid.
2020-08-29 12:44,"""Law and Order"" as the GOP theme is nonsense.  It is their attempt to hide behind a dog whistle since there is no successful anything of substance to hold up to the public that Trump did.  There is no Wall.  The tax break only helped the very wealthy and the trickle down economics argument for the Great Tax Give-a-way has been proven to further concentrate wealth in the hands of a few while the rest of the population gets hit with the bill.

The removal of a platform is a doubling down on the ""do nothing"" attitude of the pretender dictator.  At best, Law and Order for the GOP is a display of repression and head bashing.  There is no plan at all to address how we can achieve a better society with the efforts and protest displayed by so many of us.

There is no easy solution.   The belief that an uneducated SAT cheater, draft dodger, serial liar, abusive and failed businessman who admits to not reading while relying on the misinformation of FOX can lead anything is pure folly.  A lot has been discussed about those who blindly follow this faker.  If they do not seriously and objectively look at him, I suspect that Trump's curtain will fall eventually to their dismay when they actually experience the failures that they will have to live through.

The GOP also throws out the boogyman socialism word, thinking that will shake up Trump's base.  What about the New Deal, corporate welfare and medicare?  Will they be thrown under the bus?...count on corporate welfare to stay.."
2020-08-29 12:07,"While this borders on conspiracy, creating mayhems is actually beneficial to the GOP. You have seen it in movies when the law & order guy was really the trouble maker behind the scene, stirring up controversies and sowing discord. On the internet, the Russians have done that for quite some times. In real life, the Trump camp might actually welcome it. There are no other ways you can explain how a law enforcement officer could shoot someone in the back at point blank range and subsequent blame the victim for being a less than decent human being with a knife in the car - without mentioning there were also three children in the car as well.

How else can you explain a 17 year old vigilante with a rifle in tow could walk passed all those law enforcement vehicles without being detained?

This violent protest just plays into the law & order type hand. All the actions and reactions are so predictable and cliched.

If the protesters are any smarter, they should just follow President Obama's sage advice: Vote!"
2020-08-29 12:14,"It is frustrating to watch. I think Democrats should point out the obvious that Trump can not even claim to be a Law and Order President. What laws does he stand for? Hatch Act? Nope. Right to assemble? Evidently not if it interferes with a Sunday photo op. Campaign finance law? Trump has openly expressed he plain doesn't understand that one. And Order? Last I checked, protests escalated in violence level when he sent Federal troops into Portland, who started snatching peaceful protestors without cause. And then there was the 17 yo in Kenosha, whom his supporters have labeled a hero? How do these tactics and rhetoric maintain order? Just because he says ""I'm for Law and Order"" everyone accepts that, and the Democrats don't attack that assertion as ridiculously false and comically hypocritical? As someone who does not want 4 more years of this, it is painful to watch."
2020-08-29 12:25,"These are NOT the issues we face in the November election.  The only issue is whether the US will remain on the road to becoming a democracy, or whether it will become a corrupt autocracy/oligarchy like Russia."
2020-08-29 14:13,"The paragraph on Trump's use of the South Lawn says it all. What's important to him is to play the part of the bad little boy and get away with it. To create the autocratic visuals was just the icing on the cake.
But the thing is, that's my house. And in my house, we play by my rules. Be a good guest, Donnie. Show some mature judgment and respect."
2020-08-29 13:23,"It seems obvious that Biden should assert himself more forcefully against violent (vs peaceful) protests. This will reassure many who are fearful that he won’t protect them. By remaining passive on this point he’s giving Trump an edge that he doesn’t deserve.  Biden should also call out that it is Trump’s incompetent leadership and blatant disregard of our citizens’ pain and suffering (Covid, economic, race-related) that has led to Americans’ frustration and anger in the first place. Trump creates the explosive situation and then stands back and relishes it."
2020-08-29 13:20,"Both campaigns need to demonstrate leadership of this moment instead of the past. The most important event facing Americans is getting vaccinated for COVID. What evidence does anyone have to demonstrate that they know how to plan and execute a historic and successful vaccination campaign? Who will be their expert advisors? Will they take lessons from other nations that have already demonstrated superior COVID responses? Who will profit from the vaccinations? Will it be lead by the federal government with fantastic support for the rest of the country or return to everyone fighting the world for anything they can beg, steal, extort, or waste taxpayer dollars on?
Biden should demand transparency and legitimacy that what is being advertised by Trump is good science and best medical industry standard practices. The press must hold politicians and elected leaders accountable to preparing for vaccinations in every corner of the nation. This nation has failed the pandemic response miserably from top to bottom. The press was unprepared to demand leadership and report failures in time to make a difference. Unpreparedness is no longer a pass from anyone pretending to know what should be happening. If best models for vaccination distribution are in operation anywhere else in the world the press needs to inform the public so we can demand our leaders follow the best practices from nations that have already demonstrated superiority in fighting COVID."
2020-08-29 14:25,"The Protests are becoming too political and causing too much damage to Private and Government property. The property damage and attacks on the Police and Demonstrators typically occurs only after dark. So why not require that Demonstrations occur during daylight until after the Election? Require that every Demonstration has:

A gathering place with microphones & sound equipment.

A place where attendees can register to vote that is well publicized and easy to locate.

Since past Demonstrations have been infiltrated by various Groups to cause Disruptions and Property Damage,.encourage the Participants to bring their cell phones and take photos and videos of the of the damage and disruptions as it is happening. Give the Police space to stop any attempts at Property Damage.

All participants are required to bring and use Masks and Social Distancing."
2020-08-29 15:58,"I think more attention should be paid  by the Democrats to the fact that the violence and protests have mushroomed during President Trump's term in office.  And to the fact that his own inflammatory rhetoric has stimulated them. For the past four years, we have been treated not only to his own rhetoric but also his failure to condemn even more overt racism among right-wing organizations.  So how is he going to end all this with another four years in office when he can't do it at present?"
2020-08-29 13:19,"Joe Biden is saying everything many commenters are complaining about the deprivation of. On Facebook, I regularly see ads quoting him as asserting that the violence and every other bad thing “is all happening on Trump’s watch,” and that Trump has caused it. The Biden campaign is also regularly running tv ads with the same points. Perhaps some posters should ask themselves which media outlets they are frequenting- or contact the campaign to say they’re not seeing this. It sounds like there is some outlet that’s doesn’t have it or not enough."
2020-08-29 13:27,"Biden’s campaign would do well to focus on how his presidency will protect all rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, not just the second, with specific emphasis on our first amendment rights, which are now seriously threatened. Describe how a Biden administration will act differently than the current administration to keep order (through negotiations with stakeholders, anti-poverty policies, and fair, responsible police reform, etc.), to restore protection for our rights to practice our different religions without fear (or to not be religious); to protect our right to speak freely without facing punishment, even when criticizing the government; to ensure that there exists a free press that keeps the electorate informed of the issues of the day and that fulfills its democratic role responsibly in this age of disinformation; to protect the right of people to peacefully assemble and protest against injustice; and to listen and respond respectfully when a group of people ask the government to make a change, reflecting on current social realities and government policies that are hurting American citizens, instead of hammering down on them using the military as our current president has done."
2020-08-29 13:50,"The Trump campaign can save a lot of money by running ads just saying he’s willing to accept another term.  From listening to his most devoted supporters, it’s evident nothing will sway them to abandon him.  After the careless crowding of delegates and other well heeled Republicans at campaign events was questioned because of risk of the virus spreading, the response was that it doesn’t matter, we’re all going to get it.  That’s pretty crazy.

The Biden/Harris campaign by comparison, represents the side that follows rules and norms.  While Republicans have succeeded in turning the word “liberal” into a political liability, Democrats have to prevent Trump from defining them with the negative themes they associate with the label.

The authors write:
“There is some polling evidence that Mr. Trump has a slight upper hand when it comes to confronting crime. Thirty-two percent of the country said they thought they would be less safe from crime under a Biden administration, compared to 25 percent who thought they’d be more safe, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll from earlier this month. But 41 percent said that it wouldn’t make much difference who was president.”

We had better pay attention to these numbers."
2020-08-29 14:39,"After 4 years of a Trump administration with a Republican do-nothing Senate, maybe a new administration run by a ""socialist"" leaning president with a ""radical left"" agenda might just be what the country really needs and wants.  Joe Biden was the most centrist of the Democratic candidates running for POTUS in 2019, and far from the ""radical left""  as the Republicans are now claiming. But the Trump administration has botched their job so badly that anyone but Trump along with McConnell would probably make most Americans much happier about the direction of the country in 2021."
2020-08-29 15:42,It's not surprising that the president would get low marks for his combating of the virus.  The results have not been good.  But the question of what Biden would do differently or what additional steps that he would take to improve the situation needs an answer.

Like: 1) Confusing phrases from BLM like ""defund the police"", a phrase that Biden has had to come out and explain why he doesn't believe that...making Trump smile. 2) Photos/stories like when BLM protesters recently got in the face of outdoor DC diners who were doing nothing but eating...plays right into Trump's hands. 3) Signs like when I marched with BLM in a suburb and a guy had a sign that said: ""All Police are Murderers"". All? Didn't help the cause"

My Democratic Ballot is already filled out!"
2020-08-29 13:53,"""...Mr. Biden continues to offer his support for peaceful protesters of racial injustice and police brutality."" 
IMO he must also equally and explicitly condemn the violence and destruction of property, which many voters fear more than they do covid."
2020-08-29 14:09,"So happy to hear Biden finally plans to get out to the states and start complaining, er, I mean campaigning.  I was starting to question how someone who can't even figure out a safe way to get out and about is supposed to run a country.  But, he's finally come around and says he will start traveling after Labor Day.  What a clever strategy!  He's giving the Dem leadership in the rioting, looted, burned-down cities time to get the mobs under control, clean up some of the debris and sweep up the ashes, thereby taking that issue away from Trump.  Brilliant!  ;-)

I just hope he hasn't waited too long and it's not too late."
2020-08-29 16:17,"There are a myriad of soft spots that Trump has created for himself, and it’s probable that Biden can throw punches aimed at them. Yet he needs to be “out there” to counteract the lies and scare tactics which the President has conveyed at his convention and continues to hammer on as he appears at campaign events and speaks to the media. We can all see Biden’s strengths in his debates against Trump prior to the election.

That Trump pinpoints his deeds and words to non-college grad women is troubling. Perhaps he thinks that because they lack a degree they aren’t capable of deciding for themselves whether they are in “danger”. The key may be for Biden to craft his message to everyone in an equal way to demonstrate he’s running for President of all of us, not just the “Trumpists” who seem to relish the vile and vindictive President whose words seem to resonate with them.

We must get rid of Trump."
2020-08-29 13:06,"Joe Biden should be holding outdoor rallies every day with audience sizes limited to allow for social distancing.  

Between Labor Day and Election Day, he shouldn't be in Delaware. He should be in one town after another in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona, Florida and Ohio, hammering on an economic populist message that attacks the privilege of the Trumps, their grifter cronies, their Republican stooges in the US Senate and the billionaires and millionaires whose interests they will defend at all costs.

It's the economic plight of working-class Americans of all races who are suffering hardships whose causes go beyond the coronavirus that Biden should be talking about every day. And the life-changing remedies and opportunities that can be made available to working-class people in this country if we can remove Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell from their current positions of power.

Biden-Harris campaign rallies every day. Outdoors. Before live audiences, with social distancing. Between now and November 3rd. Delaware is NOT the place to be."

2020-08-29 15:07,"Let's see. The RNC is promoting ""Law & Order"", a trope that plays better when there are violent conflicts between groups. Facebook is a hotbed of bots demanding militias to take action against imagined wrongs. Armed and angry people show up and fight - with protesters, with each other, with police. Fights make the news, supporting the RNC message. Is this a concerted effort - by foreign actors, by RNC, the Trump campaign - to get Trump
re-elected? And is the Zuck complicit?  Trading less regulation for 4 more years of Trump?  Paranoid, but not necessarily wrong."
2020-08-29 16:03,"There is a laundry list of things that Biden/Harris can focus on, including what appears to be tampering with the mail and an election via the dismantling of USPS. Is there evidence enough of collusion with Kanye West to run for president as an attempt to pull voters from Biden? What about the RNC in general, as it seemed to be a stage full of dysfunctional family members, self-absorbed, grifting actors who had taken over the White House. The women seemed like a re-run of the 1950s white male dominated ideal: subservient, coifed, heeled, eager to please the man in their life.

Many of the minorities and immigrants in the videos have now said they were not even told they would be part of the RNC. Trump's inciteful hate speech spurred a 17 year old to be a vigilante and kill 2 people at the Kenosha protest. The list goes on. 

What we have to fear is the undercurrent of hatred in this country, that Trump eggs on, and the dictatorship we are facing should he be reelected. It is a long laundry list."
2020-08-29 13:52,"This ""law and order"" theme, as it is playing out in Trumplandia, emphasizes the importance of the first half, and ignored, part of the Second Ammendment, eg. ""a well regulated militia.  The mayor of Kenosha, Wisconsin replied when asked why he did not deputize citizens to help the police with crowd control during the demonstrations that he had feared exactly what happened - an untrained, unregulated, indisciplined person losing control and shooting someone.  And yet that is exactly what happened - his police force handed out water bottles and thanked for their help the unregulated, undisciplined, untrained militia that showed up, and then an underaged wannabe shot three people, killing two of them.  It was inevitable, and will certainly become more common in the future if Trump's version of ""law and order' sways and wins this election.  It is time to pay heed to the first half of the Second Ammendment"
2020-08-29 13:35,"It seems very hypocritical and nauseating for this president to promote law and order when he continues to believe and act as if the law doesn't apply to him while his Republicans have no problems when he breaks it. Mark Meadows, his Chief of Staff, declared no one outside of the Washington Beltway cared Trump and members of his Cabinet broke the Hatch Act. William Barr is a vocal cheerleader of the belief that presidents cannot be convicted, charged or even investigated while in office. 

Perhaps in the interests of honesty it would be best if Trump and his sycophants just drop ""law"" from ""law and order.""  Deploying his unidentified military group, equating peaceful protesters with looters, arsonists and anarchists while separating children from their parents, Trump will give us order via illegal orders. 

It all seems so hypocritical coming from Cadet Bone Spurs."
2020-08-29 13:40,"No matter how Trump and his Republican supporters try to spin it there is no doubt that Donald J Trump showed a very serious lack of leadership ability in his handling (or lack thereof) of the Covid-19 epidemic in America. The numbers are out there. The deaths cannot be hidden. The comparison between America's response to the epidemic and the responses of other economically advanced nations where the leaders followed the advice of the epidemiological experts is out there for the whole world to see. Anyone who denies the evidence is just delusional. Trump failed miserably. 

But Covid-19 is but one of Trump's many failures as POTUS. The space allotted here is insufficient to list all of his failures. To support this failed presidency for another 4 years is unquestionably an act of Treason. All those politicians still telling us that Trump will make America great again, after he has done so much to diminish America's reputation around the world, are Traitors."

The police who recklessly kill and maim break the law and betray their oaths.  

The entire Trump cabal is indicted or convicted or under investigation and spits on laws they don't like.  

The RNC was a crass celebration of lawless vigilantes and the unlawful hijacking of national landmarks.

They let him pass right by them and drive away from the shootings! Trump is getting exactly what he wants. This is  his idea of law and order?  Why aren't the Democrats screaming about this?

2020-08-29 11:56,"I remember the first time I saw the White House in person.  It was 1987 and, along with 3 fellow grad students, we traveled to the National Mall to explore the ""Names Quilt (now called the AIDS Quilt).""  I was hoping to see a patch sewn for my uncle (my favorite adult at our annual family gathering up on the Russian River in California), who had died in 1984 from AIDS KSHV.  While I experienced many names, colors, pictures, and emotions, my uncle's patch eluded me.

BTW, cumulative AIDS deaths 1981 - 1987 20,436 (72 months) - 181,000 Covid-19 deaths in 7 months.

Being a California boy, I wandered the mall and found myself looking straight into that iconic South Lawn White House vista.  I actually remember thinking ""that is the people's house, that is living history (the next day we would tour that astonishing house).""

Fast forward to last Thursday and the final night of the RNC.  I cannot tell you how disgusted and sickened I was by Trump's blatant and narcissistic desecration of ""the people's house.""  I will never forgive him for despoiling my memories of that day (not to mention his, well, you know ....).

1987 with Reagan as President, and a first vote cast for Jimmy Carter California Democrat , and I never once questioned our democracy.  Thanks, Mr. Trump, for the travesty you are."

2020-08-29 14:58,"The Trump campaign is turning to “Law and Order” as their focus – that can work to the Biden-Harris advantage. The protests, unrest, and yes damage is real – Biden and Harris need to focus on the root-cause as well as the cost to taxpayers for all these shootings. 

Those towns, cities and states are going to be paying out millions to the families of the targets of the unprovoked attacks by police officers. The history is that the families win big and get huge settlements all of which is paid out of tax dollars. 

The bottom line is that continuing the systemic racism costs a lot of money and that “hurts” a lot of Trump supporters, even if they live in the suburbs. Biden-Harris should line up a bunch of local, county and state officials to talk about the cost impact of systemic-racism – those multi-million settlements have to be paid for. Then there is the cost of maintaining an underclass just because “some people” believe that people with more melanin in their skin aren’t really human beings. Let’s look at the former confederate states: while they all have pockets of success, by-and-large these states are economic under-performing regions. That is because there is an extension of the systemic-racism that also dislikes poor white people.

Dehumanization is the root-cause problem. We've experienced it many times in the past. Nobody is exempt once it starts. As one person observed: ""...and then they came for me."""

It is also increasingly clear that, unfortunitely, the American voter has not shown itself to not be too sofhisticated and frankly focused in  decision making...such critical decisions appear to have been made like they're watchiing a tv program. I believe, however, this election may be made by the voters guided by the covid 19 issue, its spread and cure. This is true because this disease and the issues surrounding it is novel, has not been cured yet and most importantly, has and will touch nore people whether it be family of other personal impacts.

However, China is taking the opportunity to spend more capital to build dams for flood control and water management.  China also put strong emphasis in improving environment to reduce soil erosion and return certain farm lands to marsh as reservoirs to store water during flooding.

As Covid-19 becomes a non issue in China (both Beijing and Wuhan this week allow people go out without wearing  masks), people come back to work.  And these huge initiatives will generate many jobs.

Coincidentally, April 17th is also the date when the US with Trump's ""perfect testing"" finally caught up with South Korea on a per capita basis – 2 months late. That is why they have a total of 313 deaths and we have 180,000 and counting. The worst of it is that it's not over. We STILL don't have control of the virus."

Right now the Democrats want the former while the Republicans want the later.

COVID's not going away.  Period.  It's here to stay.  Anyone notice, after the initial fanfare, there barely a peep in the news about vaccines.  Well, other than mention of those working on them.

We saw and heard the insults that self-deputized vigilantes used against lawfully elected officials at the state capitol in Lansing, Michigan. State troopers all but stood aside and allowed the ""liberators"" to behave in most un-American fashion. They threatened the governor and her cabinet officials because they were displeased that her common-sense message of caution in the face of the pestilence that was plainly a menace was in direct opposition to the incendiary words of a president who was only concerned about stocks and markets, not about safety and health.

So, when the 17-year old boy finished his work and turned toward the Kenosha policemen, sitting in trucks, they simply sat there and then drove past him. I can only wonder if they would have given such a pass to a 17-year old black boy who was wielding a long gun while walking toward them, at least three people on the ground behind them?

So to win, he brings his vindictive base a circus. Although, in fairness, this is what the GOP has decided to do for quite some time--and we thought Michelle Bachmann, Herman Cain, and Sarah Palin were strange choices for presidential and VP candidates!  Trump has them beat by a mile.

The politics of resentment runs strong in Trump's base and the tea party before it, and that is why his obvious cruelty plays well with them. They resent teachers (poorly paid as they are) because teachers have benefits that they do not.  Yet they work against affordable health care, better education, and money spent on people with disabilities.

2020-08-28 1:54,"By encouraging mob violence and vigilante justice Trump should be disqualifies from holding public office. Of course this is not possible. But, organizations like the MLB,NFL, NBA and WNBA could declare him ""persona non grata."" Their platforms are more respected than his."
2020-08-28 1:56,"If you read the scientific literature regarding the pandemic and If you read responsible journalism, you know that the differences in performance between countries is affected by many factors. Some, like the average age of the population, are out of anyone’s control. Some, like the quality of the health care system, are long term considerations that pre-date the pandemic.  And some, like the caution exhibited by the people, are affected by many different factors. 

As for political leadership, its role tends to be exaggerated. Angela Merkel doesn’t make many public speeches. She gave one on the virus that was much praised. And as a scientist she understood what was at stake much better than Trump. But she clearly is not the main reason for Germany’s success. Nor is Trump the main reason for America’s failures. 

The roles played by Trump and Merkel  have been exaggerated. And nobody exaggerates more than Krugman. He’s not accurate, he’s not fair and he is not a responsible journalist."
2020-08-28 2:05,"For too many businesses everything is qualified and quantified by the quarter. Some decisions and visions need to rely on a much longer-term investment and patience. Clearly. Trump and associates were unwilling to give more than a quarter of a year for businesses/communities/schools to bounce back. Tragically, the insistence that Covaid 19 be ignored has caused terrible grief and required for many a long-term recovery.

Speaking of 1/4th there are two four-letter words that have decimated our nation and planet earth. HOAX and FAKE have been applied by Trump to just about everything he doesn't like or believes his ""followers"" don't want to hear and certainly not accept. Because Trump controls - intimidates - most GOP legislators (they choose not to oppose - they are responsible for their inaction) he has a huge impact on our lives. The Covid 19 is an immediate scary disease - not a hoax - for all but the face maskless (macho) Trump followers. His hoax attitude toward climate change becomes more distressing for all nations and peoples the longer he allows methane and coal seepage and limits mpg improvement and opposes subsidizing solar panels and the turbines (he hates) and .... We need to become a nation energized and excited to lead the world in Covid 19 vaccine research and planet healing."
2020-08-28 2:05,"Dear Mr Krugman, greetings from Brazil. The second country with most infections after the USA. I have been here for 4 days, and I am amazed that everyone is wearing a mask, even inside their own cars, while driving alone with windows closed. The numbers in Brazil are falling, so is the number of death. Businesses are slowly reopening, but there is a long way to go.  It is impossible to keep the infections from spiking unless everyone adopts the same rules. We will have a very long recovery road, if people don’t take the pandemic seriously."
2020-08-28 2:11,"Joe Biden was right when he maintained last week that the US economy can never fully recover unless this country gets serious about taming Covid-19.

I'm just waiting for the article about all the new cases following tonight's grand finale, which looks more like a super-spreader event than a political convention.

The definition of insanity is how the Republicans are mishandling this virus: denials, obfuscation, magical thinking, and blaming others for its continuance.  Rinse and repeat, until the death tolls rises even faster than ever.

And while they're at it, why not throw in a little pressure on the FDA to approve a vaccine before completing all the Phase III efficacy trials,  because, who cares how effective, or dangerous such a vaccine could be as long as the announcement occurs before November 3?

There are a thousand reasons why our pandemic chugs along happily--and they all have to do with the person at the top."
2020-08-28 2:14,"Sometimes, one has nothing to add to the discussion.On this side of the border it also looks like 1984 in America and Emmanuel Goldstein was too Jewish and far left left wiggle room.
I can only tell a different story. Quebec  had a revolution  where it went from conservative patriarchy to full democracy in fifty years. We took that path the GOP is warning you against  and looking back we certainly did the right thing.
We are as healthy, dynamic , optimistic, wealthy and stable a society as has ever existed on this planet. When people are told the truth they always do what is correct. It is what we call democracy and conservatives call the tyranny of socialism.
I know some Trumpist will respond we only think we are free secure and happy to pursue happiness  and all I can say is he is correct.
Debate is impossible if only one side believes in truth.
I watched our sports channel for today's news and I have never been prouder to be Canadian. Everybody asked great questions but they all agreed it would take everybody to find the answers. It is amazing how brilliant athletes can be when they are asked to think and humble we can be when all we have are questions."
2020-08-28 2:22,"Among Republican governors who rushed to reopen, count Kim Reynolds of Iowa. After reopening restaurants, bars, gyms and casinos on June 25, she did nothing to slow down the spread of Covid-19 throughout the summer (such as mandating masks or limiting the size of social gatherings). Instead, she focused her energy on requiring in-person school attendance from school districts, arbitrarily asking for a positivity rate above 15% to allow online teaching (the World Health Organization recommends 5%) - while hot spots kept popping up across the state. Today, the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 in Iowa exceeds 1000. It finally took a dramatic jump in new reported cases this week (which by now far exceeds the peak observed back in early May) for Gov. Reynolds to issue a timid order to close bars in 7 counties, starting today.

On Tuesday, Gov. Reynolds spoke at the Republican National Convention to heap praise on the incumbent. She had nothing to say about the upsurge of Covid-19 in Iowa."
2020-08-28 2:24,"So, the right-thinking people got what they always wanted, another Reagan. They sure look happy, those Trump people. 
(Hurray for our side!) I wonder where they will be in four years?

I have a very strong feeling that this Administration will not end well for anybody--except DJT."
2020-08-28 2:41,"""some of those additional deaths would surely have happened even if Trump had done what he should have done""  I calculated the deaths that are Trump's fault.  I took daily deaths per million since the beginning of the pandemic (mid-March), for six countries: the U.S., Germany, Canada, Spain, Italy, and Sweden.  Within the first 75 days, all deaths are due to the pandemic.  But after 75 days, as the other countries made progress in preventing contagion, the excess deaths in the U.S. become the responsibility of our response.  I calculate that, as of today, that number is 43,000 dead Americans.  Currently, excess U.S. deaths is 3 per day per million.  That is the rate over what the other five countries are currently experiencing.  If this anomalous death statistic remains until election day, another 70,000 Americans will die.  So, Trump will be responsible for 113,000 American deaths, that could have been prevented if we'd just followed the lead of the rest of the Western World."
2020-08-28 2:46,"That America doesn't have adequately widespread and responsive testing is a failure of Trump and his government; that there is no comprehensive tracing system (which is easily done with smartphones) is a failure of American society.

300,000 deaths, in this context, seems inevitable by year's. You know, I live in China, and given what we did - once this it America, I knew it was going to be a disaster. 

But I guess the main scary thing is that Trump's supporters don't care. They lack any and all empathy. They are fine with thousands of more death. 

It's a grim reality."
2020-08-28 2:47,"It's easy to blame Trump and say he's wreckless and directly responsible for the increase in caseload.  However, let's not forget California.  The bluest of the blue states struggled to contain the outbreak not because of politics, but because humans missed socializing in bars and restaurants.   We should accept responsibility for our actions instead of playing the victim card."
2020-08-28 2:54,"When last I checked, NYC teachers were threatening to go on strike because of inadequate efforts by the city and state to satisfy even the most basic measures against the virus, namely testing and contract tracing. 
Speaking for April, it wasn't until the first week of April that the scientists at the CDC decided that masks were a good thing after all. Then New York Gov Cuomo waited another week until he issued a directive requiring masks, with NY deaths averaging 900 per day. No Southern red state governor has pushed aside previous reluctance to mask, and turned to encouraging masks, with greater than 250 deaths per day, including New York sized Florida and Texas. 
We keep hearing about Trump this, and Trump that, responsible for every evil in the world, but liberals like Krugman can't explain why blue states are still failing. Yesterday in New York, 7 new deaths, and 900 new confirmed cases. Over the course of five days of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections, there are at least 2,000 to 3,000 people walking the streets with the virus. 
Feel safe yet?"
2020-08-28 2:57,"Mr trumps newest narrative includes the CDC recommending less testing and ignoring asymptomatic carriers altogether.

Not only is Mr McConnell steadfast in demanding legal immunity for businesses in covid-19 law suits, he also wants to erase the entire medical history of the pandemic.
When Mr mcConnell insisted on no witnesses being heard at impeachment hearings, his doctrine has morphed into a nation wide drive on human lives.

We saw Mr trumps call to arms in Kenosha this week.
A 17 year old child-anarchist killing people without the same remorse Mr trump lacks."
2020-08-28 2:59,"I work in the food industry, and when others have tried to push their worries about food into me, I have told them to trust in the FDA, that it does the research to make sure food additives are safe and that pesticide residues are so low you’re never going to be affected, regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional. It’s terrifying to see this agency become politicized and have to fight just for an opportunity to do research and not push things through that haven’t been fully vetted. This is what is going to hurt us so badly when a vaccine is approved. Will enough people have trust in this administration to even get us to herd immunity? Whatever happened to the country that helped eradicate polio."
2020-08-28 3:01,"Anti-maskers are everywhere and although my mask protects me, it's mostly to protect them and is thus a sign if my empathy and imagination.  In other words,  I have enough imagination to think that I, being in their place, would not want to get a deadly virus from me.  I do have a modest proposal, with a tip of the hat to Mr. Swift.  Grocery stores and other essential businesses should hire Wisconsin law enforcement officers to enforce mask compliance.  It would lead to better compliance and perhaps eliminate repeat offenders."
2020-08-28 3:01,"In the future, Dr. Krugman's graduate students can graph the date and size of U.S. economy with several overlaid lines: medically related decisions of Trump and part of his administration would be one, legislation another, plus the stock indices and other economic points.

For now, every time we hit what seems to be the bottom of the hole, it ends up being at best only a landing before falling even further down.

There's so much we don't know about the president's motives; weird administration actions; and what's going on in the innermost core of Trump, his legal issues, and his family's tax issues.

We don't know how much worse things are going to get before they get better. Way too many of us -- about 180,000 so far -- are gone forever and it's not stopping.

I commented on a Sunday late in May that things then might look much better in retrospect on Labor Day after a long hot summer. George Floyd was killed the next day.

Those of us lucky enough to be reasonably healthy, housed, fed this month -- and assured of the same going forward -- have no idea how events and politics will work together for the rest of the year. Imagine how many more unknowns a huge slice of the population is experiencing in their lives.

When we say things couldn't be worse, they tend to get even more so. With 6 to 8 weeks left of hurricane season and only a few more until Trump faces the electorate, anything could happen."
2020-08-28 3:02,"To keep his base happy Trump had to oppose the epidemiologists as his base views these experts as part of the liberal establishment of elites. If the medical experts say don't take hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid then Trump says take it and he actually says he did although that is probably a lie. Once Trump established himself as a demagogue with a large following by taking on the elites he has had to keep the lies going to survive politically. He must keep lying, even about the most basic truths of modern science. And his party has to follow him. Given the urgency to deal with climate change it is the great tragedy of America that this type of politics has taken root. It appears this tragedy will play out to the bitter end as the stream of lies is needed to keep this right wing movement that Trump has propelled into the highest levels of power going in this country."
2020-08-28 3:22,"Even after people around them(trump and pence) have been infected, they, trump in particular is having large gatherings.it is totally irresponsible. trump is responsible for 200,000 deaths and 6 million cases. It can be argued that there may have been a few deaths and cases even otherwise,but the US has by far the worst covid record in the developed world, and the blame for it squarely rests on trump. covid is spreading like wildfire even now in states that voted for trump in 2016.the trump states occupy almost all the top 20 worst states for number of cases per 100,000 people, in recent weeks.
Trump has completely corrupted the CDC, FDA and several government agencies. Only Biden can unite america, and fix all the damage. There is no hope left from Trump and Pence. Covid is only going to get worse and worse. The FDA and CDC have become untrustworthy under assault from trump. We should be wary of an treatment they approve from now."
2020-08-28 3:30,"While the NYT's current zeitgeist is that everything is the fault of Trump, the number of deaths from Coronavirus are more or less following the predictions made by Dr Fauci and Birx months ago. I don't think the models they used for their predictions and estimates had ""things Trump tweeted"" as an input variable to their calculations. In other words Coronavirus and it's economic impact are simply too complex especially for big democratic countries to control to any degree no matter what they do."
2020-08-28 3:34,"After tonight I want to know what happened to the Hatch Act and the laws against political campaigns on federal property using government resources? What is next, military aircraft sporting Trump/Pence signs?"

“My fellow Americans. We face an unprecedented challenge. The coronavirus is attacking us in every corner of our country. We can stop it. It takes sacrifice in many ways. But one simple, patriotic thing we can all do is wear a mask. Are they annoying? Of course. Are they funny looking? Yep. Do I want to wear I one? Of course not. But they save lives and will allow us to fully reopen and get back to some sense of normalcy. So please, follow my lead and the sound advice of medical professionals from around the globe. Wear a mask whenever you leave your house. —puts on mask—Thank you, and god bless America.”

Wow. Not that hard and it would have drastically changed our trajectory. But no. That would have been too hard for our elected president. That shows how truly awful Trump is as a human and as a leader."
2020-08-28 3:57,"The fundamental responsibility of any CEO or leader of a business is to know the risks to that business.  Open a the 10-K annual report of any public company and note how extensive the risks section is.  The trump organization is not a public company and has always been run as a family business with the only equity stakeholders being the trump family.

Government is more closely paralleled by public companies in the degree of disclosure, regulation, and broad stakeholder base.  This administration has run government as a family business.  You see the result.  The lack of disclosure, the self serving behaviors, the unjustified policies, etc. are what you can do with a family business.  You can run a family business into the ground and nobody but the family will care (perhaps their creditors as well).  Let’s make government public again.  This has not worked for the shareholders.  Ironic that the efforts to suppress the vote are like seizing or devaluing the stock of most shareholders.  Basically this administration has tried to created two classes of shares with one class having no voting rights."
2020-08-28 4:02,"""Now, the U.S. situation appears to have improved a bit over the past couple of weeks""

Key word there...""appears"".  We were running around 60,000 cases per day a few weeks ago.  Now, after there is clear and documented evidence that Trump's instruction to lessen testing is coming to fruition.  (Testing down almost 20%) suddenly we are reporting fewer cases.  (Not even getting into that the administration is threatening to punish severely hospitals who report the true number of cases to the CDC instead of a private contractor where they can control the numbers)

So no, Doctor.  There is no evidence that cases are actually getting better.  We're just not seeing them.  And it will take a month or so for.the deaths to indicate the real trajectory of this virus now."
2020-08-28 4:04,"Almost every first world democracy has been more successful in containing the spread of Covid and in moderating the economic impacts than the U.S. in particular, Germany, Australia, Japan, South Korea have performed far better. What is their commonality: An evidence-based and coordinated response.

As a nurse who has worked on Covid, Trump’s response has been atrocious at best. We are 6 months into the Pandemic- testing and PPE are still challenges. Something as fundamental as Contact tracing is scarcely even mentioned. Trump has failed us."
2020-08-28 4:07,"Shutdowns work.  And if they’re done right, they don’t need to be endless. 

Here in the Australian state of Victoria, we’re on the back side of a true second wave of COVID-19. (This is in contrast to the US where the epidemic never fully abated.)  In March and April, along with the rest of Australia, we shut down, and despite restrictions that were relatively soft by international standards, we managed to prevent widespread transmission in the community.  In May we began to open up, and for several weeks there were hardly any new cases except in travelers returning from abroad. 

Such has remained the state of play everywhere in Australia outside Victoria. Whether due to bad luck, bad management or a combination of both, in June, COVID broke hotel quarantine containment lines in Melbourne and took off running.  We entered a hard lockdown in early August, and after a short lag, daily case numbers have been falling steadily from a peak of over 700 and just four weeks later are only a little more than 100. 

It is unreasonable to lay all the blame for America’s COVID death toll at Trump’s feet; no matter who was in charge, it is likely that the US would have suffered a devastating outbreak. But our experience in Australia confirms that community-wide action undertaken under firm leadership absolutely can halt the spread of this virus and do so in a relatively short period of time, making way for measured steps back to a sense of normalcy."
2020-08-28 4:19,"I think this is actually the third time Trump has pushed for catastrophe.  The instance Paul leaves out is his campaign for in-person schooling, which has already resulted in thousands of new infections, and chaos in schools, which opened, and then had to close quickly again.

Trump needs to be brought before a tribunal, along with a whole bunch of his flunkies and enablers without whose help he could never have caused so many deaths and such widespread destruction."
2020-08-28 4:34,"'Pence’s tale of heroic, decisive leadership was so completely at odds with reality that pretty much the only words he spoke that weren’t lies were “a,” “and,” and “the.”'

The problem with Trump team's Munchausenesque hyperbole is that even measured criticism of it tends  to sound shrill.  We have had an experiment in democracy grounded in free speech for the last four years.  Truly it is time for that denouement of democracy on November 3rd.  Let us hope we can keep the republic."
2020-08-28 4:36,"Dr. Krugman, you leave me confused.

Supporting mobs of people wanting out of lockdown = BAD
Supporting mobs of social justice protesters = GOOD?

You can't tell millions of people to socially distance and self quarantine for the good of the country, but then turn around and applaud social justice warriors congregating in even larger numbers without undercutting the original argument.

It doesn't matter whether the social justice protesters have good intentions; that's besides the point.

Either people should be free to congregate or they shouldn't, irrespective of the reason. It's time for the progressive elites to figure that out for themselves."
2020-08-28 4:37,"Trump’s response to Covid-19 won’t be a factor in the election.  Right now, Biden is losing the support of centrist voters, because he pledged to halt construction on the border wall and failed to adequately address the lawlessness taking place in Democrat-run cities.  I don’t think he has a chance."
2020-08-28 4:55,"I totally agree with this column. The Covid-19 pandemic crisis was a make or break challenge for President Trump and he failed.  He does not have the competence or temperament, or integrity to be the leader of a nation with the potential to lead the world in making it a better place for humanity.

I just finished watching his acceptance speech for the Republican Party's nomination and watched him enter into a narcissistic fantasy of his government's achievements that was far removed from reality.

His term in office has harmed America economically, in his trade policies, in his stance on the health and well being of the American people by detracting them from access to healthcare and education for their children.  His party has not and will not accept that too many American's do not make sufficient income to feel financially secure.

His temperament and behavior bring out the worst in people and have strengthened the divisions in our society.  

He has created a very damaging fantasy that global climate change is a hoax and that access to clean air and water is not a right of civilized people.  

A leader would welcome these challenges.

I am sure that intelligent analysts will sort out the economic and social consequences to continue on the path mapped out by the Trump Republican Party.

The single truth that he uttered tonight was, ""most important election in history"".  I agree and urge every American to vote for Democrats in November.

Let's build a better place."
2020-08-28 5:07,"And why aren’t kids back at school again?

More school age children have died of the flu, and possibly even gunfire in inner cities, than from Covid.

Against that immaterial risk, we need to compare the lost year of learning in a critical year of the child’s development.

So who’s benefit are we closing schools?"
2020-08-28 5:12,"If we believe the scientists and mathematicians and we do in my house, we are headed for a very long slow recovery. 
Colleges are back in session and by mid September a large portion of students in dorms will have cases in college town hot spots. If students are sent home, the spread will be even broader. 
Next year when a vaccine is on the market, only a fraction of the populous will trust enough to get the shot. 
At 1,000 dead per day, 30k per month the US could be at 300k deaths by Christmas. 
If no vaccine until next March, add another 100k and the entire school year will be remote. 
This is a bleak picture, but with no change in societal behavior, what’s the alternative?"
2020-08-28 5:27,"We are now in the summer months, where a decrease in the numbers of cases of covid 19 should be expected. And that is the case, although still alarmingly high.  We should be using this time to prepare for a potentially very high increase in the number of cases in the autumn, as happened 100 years ago during a similar pandemic, the so called Spanish flu, which made the second year of that pandemic worse than the first year.  Instead we are celebrating a vaccine, which may or may not work, and social distancing and mask wearing as preventive measures are falling by the wayside.  The president and the Republicans, as usual, commit their malpractice by refusing to practice these preventive measures as they march forward in their destruction of what is left of our civil society as well as our material well being.  Vote Democratic in November."
2020-08-28 5:50,"Of course, one can always play around with statistics. But it is remarkable how some people are bending reality, in the U.S. and in comparison with the rest of the world. In Germany - by the way much more densely populated than the U.S. - we have about 1500 new infections per day (which is worrying), with a positivity rate of less than 1% at testing. In relation to our population the U.S. should/would have about 6000 new infections daily (in fact it has more than 40.000). We have a death rate of abut 5 to 10 per day - not 1.000 or more like in the U.S. And our economy is fairly ""open"". With masks, social distancing and a carefully managed opening up (or regionally locking down for a period) you can achieve a lot. It is quite simple, not a mircale."
2020-08-28 6:06,"If Trump had used the Defense Production Act at the outset of the pandemic to quickly produce much needed Covid-19 tests, we might be doing as well as Germany by now, where schools have reopened."
2020-08-28 6:15,"It is about more than the epic mismanagement of the Pandemic Response by Trump, it is the people who insist it isn't so, even here.  Trump Supporters are prisoners of an alternative reality were our cities are burning and the nation is in terrible danger from Radical Leftists.  

There is a whole media ecosystem supporting the Trumpist world view.  I see it every time I turn on my computer, the banner ads and you tube ads and teasers are ,,, Disturbing.  Trump voters refuse to acknowledge the damage Trump's cabinet of kleptocrats have done to our institutions. The Post office briefly held their attention, but it is being crowded out by the ""news"" about our burning cities.

How did a group of right wing nihilists dedicated to destroying our society gain control of a major political party?

Radical Socialism like protecting nd restoring the Post Office, better health care for everyone, strengthening social security addressing inequality?  Where do I sign up for it?

I would dare to say that this could not happen in any other modern democratic country, where checks and balances still exist.

Most worryingly, I wouldn't be surprised by Trump tweeting ""LIBERATE AMERICA!"" on election day to urge armed mobs to ""secure"" polling sites."

2020-08-28 7:36,"In the recent weeks, in Germany the infections nearly doubled compared to the months before. According to the German CDC (Robert Koch Institute) main reasons are travelers traveling to and from corona-risk-areas, and large family gatherings in which safety measures like social distancing, masks, etc, were neglected.

This shows: This virus shows no mercy, is rapid, and is dangerous, even if you act within discipline, and even if you start from a much lower level than the US currently has."
2020-08-28 7:59,"I listened to some of the speeches of the RNC convention. For anybody who would be completely new to Trump and his government, listening to these speeches could easily make them think Trump is The Messiah, a paragon of virtue, a virtually faultless leader, not to mention the emphasis put on a supposed American exceptionalism. 
America is a great place but it is no Shangri-La.
In fact the current world view is that America is in a considerably worse place now than it was when Trump became president and its stature in the world has been greatly diminished.
I am really curious to know how many Americans will believe in this GOP attempt at magical realism?
I guess we will know once November is upon us but I am not optimistic."
2020-08-28 8:09,"Can Mr. Krugman analyze why has Germany's response to Covid ""been infinitely better than ours""? 

Why have they been able to have a coordinated national response, so they could more safely reopen their schools?

Why do they have many decades of a national health care system that is not based on high profit as in the U.S., but based more on the public interest and citizens' rights?

What is the attitude of their citizens and politicians that leads to a more rational, scientific, coordinated response to the pandemic? 

Explain the contrast to the American irrational, unscientific, uncoordinated response. 

Can Mr. Krugman explain in a column or even a few paragraphs--- what are the underlying political and social attitudes that lead to these differences?

Trump is failing and exploiting the nation. But the conditions for this failure were there. 
After Trump is gone -- then what does Mr. Krugman think we should do to avoid a repeat in the next pandemic, whenever that comes? 
List some of the changes we need."

For all the bad press that they didn't do as well as their Scandinavian neighbors, they still did better than most of the USA -- including Maryland, and most of the states their size (Illinois, Pennsylvania, etc.).   The big difference from America --- good leadership and responsible population.  Plus after the early debacle in the nursing homes, they learned and changed."
2020-08-28 8:40,What makes mr Krugman so interesting is that he has read literature he watched movies he loves music and he has a charisma in writing. So his articles are much more than economics.

2020-08-28 8:43,"Countries doing the best against the virus are generally smallish, ethnically and culturally unified ones in which an agreed word to the wise is mostly sufficient.  A big, diverse country like the U.S. has a much harder time getting overall cooperation on anything, virus included.  What is the answer to the virus problem?  In fact, other than shutting down the whole economy, nobody really knows, and it's misleading (time wasting) to blame it on supposedly inept political leadership.  I'd say the real answer, the one we appear to have adopted, is to let everybody do whatever they want and eventually some sort of consensus will emerge and we shall all learn to live with the virus because, contrary to widespread hopes, I don't think it's going away."

Everybody knows that a second lockdown would be a disaster for the people and the economy that is to be avoided. As well there is a fraction of people who deny that Covid even exists.

However, the most prominent voices you hear in terms of school opening are scientific voices that ask how this can be done safely. The majority of the people and the entire government starting from the top rather seems to listen to the facts than to anything else. And a joint (state and federal) government meeting yesterday showed that the government is before all willing to make sure, people adhere to the Corona safety rules - even if their personal believe system might be wired differently. Motto: We are all in this together.

In my own view, the virus is just seen as what it is: a dangerous virus that acts so forseeable that it can be managed with discipline, scientifically informed decisions, and solidarity between the people."

2020-08-28 9:36,"Good column as ever.  
I have been sitting here in France since January when I came to teach a course I give here each year.  We decided to ride out COVID over here — and in fact might not be able to go home now even if we wanted to because travelers from the EU are blocked.  With the Administration’s doleful communications performance, who really knows what might happen if we turned up at the border?  
As it turns out, after all these months, we have decided to emigrate permanently to France.  I can’t tell you how good it feels just to live in an normal country again.   The French government acts in the interests of all the people, there is a strong sense of the common good, and, frankly, the average French person, in my experience, is just a lot less selfish than the average American.  Personally, I don’t know how to explain to people that they ought to wear masks out of concern for their fellow citizens.  If they didn’t get the “always take care of your fellow citizens” memo at home when they were young, it’s too late to explain it to them now.  What really fascinates me is that many of those refusing to wear masks are evangelical “Christians.”  Folks, whatever happened to “thou shalt love they neighbor as thyself” “ and “Am I my brother’s keeper?”  One would have thought literalist Bible thumpers would have taken at least some of that to heart."
2020-08-28 9:56,"It feels a little 'trapped' up here in Canada, but not by much. Gone are the days of quick and easy border crossings to shop and buy cheap gas, fun vacations and great travel to a functioning America, all the while meeting incredibly warm and interesting people. I really loved America. Have you ever been to the Methow Valley in Washington State? It's absolutely extraordinary there.

Now I don't want to ever cross the border again. How could Trump have happened and hold absurdity for so long? How could these bizarre enablers, so so many of them, support and succumb enough to produce the absolute insanity of this 2020 Republican National Convention, right in front of what used to be one the most respected and iconic places in the free world? How can people not see the con going on, such a clear and present con? Madness. Anti-reality.

I'll stay right here, thank you very much. There's plenty of space and sanity in Canada with all sorts of normal things going on, despite the challenges we too face. At least reality still works up here. The border is still closed, and we here are relieved. Stay away from us."
2020-08-28 10:11,"mr krugman, could the USA afford to close the country ""again""?
i have read the the UK and other countries paid their citizens, 80% of their pay, to stay home during the first wave of this pandemic.
  can you see something like this happening for our country?"
2020-08-28 10:13,"The pandemic is *the* reality check Trump and his enablers cannot wish or talk away, same with global warming, but that will take a little longer. With the pandemic the resurgence is unavoidable when schools and colleges reopen and the results will be in *before* the November election. Try as he may, Trump will not be able to evade this very predictable natural event. And the results will be his responsibility.
It’s amazing to me that the Republicans and trump think they can subdue nature. It’s  a fool’s errand. He could have had an economy, if he had advocated for masks in March... and done the testing right.
I know, I know, there will be the October surprise, the Deus ex machina, the very rushed vaccine. That might very well give the appearance of a victory, for who knows, how effective that will be an with what hidden sode effects. By this sleight of hand he will be able to claim victory before the election and the bill will only come due afterwards, how very typical of Trump a move this is."

2020-08-28 10:51,"Based upon what I read about the weakness of the winter flu season in the Southern Hemisphere, I predict there will be some trends that Trump and his supporters will use to prove up their argument that Trump handled the pandemic deftly. I believe we will see less death from influenza this season, whether Trump wins or loses. Trump supporters are going to use that and other similar statistics to argue that the dead were going to die anyway, so overall, the pandemic didn’t cost us much. So grandma died in April rather than November.  Who cares, will be the argument, these people would have died soon anyway, and there was no reason to destroy the economy waiting around for it to happen. 

Even if true, there is something clearly wrong with that thinking. But how do you convince an angry mob who have been freed to hate with fervor that even one more tender moment with someone you love is worth fighting for?"
2020-08-28 10:57,"""incitement to armed insurrection"": The one new menacing term here is ""armed."" The Republicans have been conducting an insurrection since Rowe vs Wade in the '50's and the Democrats switching from Jim Crowe enforcement to backing Civil Rights in the '60's. That's when pursuing specific values for the nation became more important than democracy itself.
It got more politically violent when Newt Gingrich implored candidates to use vile language to attack opponents and Carl Rove collected funds to sponsor far-right candidates against moderates in Republican primaries—at all levels, not just national. 
They've pushed the judiciary branch right, capped by Mitch McConnell blocking Obama's choice for the Supreme Court.
Modern powerful computers became a GOP anti-democracy weapon for more extreme gerrymandering to further savage minority voting rights, while new low-tech walls go up around polling places serving ethnic groups perceived as pro-Democrat.
Trump is simply their long-sought keystone, so dismissive of democracy that he openly kisses up to demagogues while poisoning friendly relations with allies and appointing Executive department heads to dismantle and weaponize their departments. He has a dictator's cruel, ruthless soul; and his Republican cohorts can't do enough to please him."
2020-08-27 23:22,"Donald Trump could have been a hero throughout this pandemic.  So could McConnell, Pompeo, DeVos, and the rest of the GOP.  They could have worn masks, made speeches about how important it was to protect ourselves and others in the face of this new virus.  They could have gotten together and coordinated a response at the national level so that the states hit hardest in the beginning didn't lose as many people as they did.  They could have helped to contain the virus and prevented what we are seeing now:  nearly 6 months of people dying because they didn't act.  Six months of job losses.  Six months of restricted activity.  

Their failure to lead means that they have failed as public servants.  They have failed to preserve and protect the citizens and residents of the country they have sworn to serve.  They have failed as adults.  And they continue to fail us by being petty, by lying, by caring more about their rich donors and the richest corporations than the people who comprise most of the population of America; working people who depend upon a regular paycheck to make ends meet.  

The GOP owns this crisis now.  None of this can be blamed on Obama, Clinton, Biden, or any other Democrat.  It's all theirs, the fallout, the tragedies, the economic upheaval, the disasters that will come.  Just as the Great Depression is associated with Hoover, the COVID19 pandemic will be associated with Trump.

2020-08-28 11:17,"Prof Krugman, as usual, lines up the facts and data into a compelling argument, just as did Nicholas Kristof in his thorough and careful takedown of Trump's claim to have the done 'the exact right thing,' in yesterdays NYT. What astonishes me as I am sure it does many other readers is that such horrid and utter
mismanagement of the greatest crisis the country has faced since WW II has not disqualified Trump for a 2nd term in the judgement of the GOP or its voters. 

Yet Trump remains the GOP 2020 candidate, after early 180,000 counted deaths, and likely tens of thousands not counted, a cratered economy, depression levels of unemployment. Any person alert to evidence must be concerned how Trump, out of this 'American carnage,' is still the nominee, with what he claims as 90% of the party's voters supporting him. It appears that GOP voters, so long held in thrall by ridiculous notions like 'supply side economics,' or guns don't lead to gun deaths (despite 30,000 such deaths per year) have now so internalized GOP lies that 180,000 deaths, 25% of the total world wide Covid 19 cases, and worsening unemployment show not what a person still possessing judgement would recognize as abysmal failure but instead are proof of the need for Trump's leadership. Thus the GOP's parade of lie ridden speakers at their convention was not laughable but sober testimony--however destructive a 2nd Trump term would be for the cohesion of the U.S., and an ideal prospect for our adversaries."

2020-08-27 23:47,"Yesterday I was eating sitting on some steps outside in a public area where I live. Of course I didn't have my mask on, but I was isolated. It seemed ok. Then I heard some screaming kids. I looked around and didn't see anything, but I knew they must be close. I kept eating. Then I looked to my side, and there they were. A large group of people, clearly a family, with little kids, parents and grandparents. I suspected they would walk by (even though they didn't have to). None of them had masks on. They came right by me, multiple times. Including the kids, brushing up against me and yelling. The parents couldn't care less. I covered my food and put my mask back on, with my hands on my face. But I also kept thinking that my mask mainly protects *them* from my breathing. There are gaps between my mask and my face, so their air can get in. What are they thinking? They are putting me at risk, but they are also putting themselves at risk. Do they care? Are they just sick of wearing masks? Are they listening to Trump's madness? And I live in a relatively liberal city. Most people are courteous and are doing the right thing with masks, but when some enter stores unmasked, I do not see them routinely challenged about it. I fear the onset of colder weather with people spending more time indoors. I dread the surge of infections that we will see in the coming months. I sincerely hope Biden wins in November. That is our best chance to stop this insanity of needless sickness and death."

2020-08-27 23:58,"The Republican Party's core strength is its marketing ability.  For many years, they've been famous for creating their own reality through clever marketing tricks and flat-out lying. Remember Dick Cheney claiming that the post-Iraq War insurgency was ""in its last throes"" even as the violence increased to catastrophic levels?  Remember, too, how George W Bush's administration consistently blamed the media for excessively negative reporting when they were reporting the real situation on the ground?

The Republican Party became so accustomed to simply lying and blaming the usual scapegoats that they were woefully unprepared for a pandemic.  Lying and scapegoating don't work against a pandemic - and that's all the Republican Party knows how to do any more. 

If they lose in November, they'll blame everyone but their own actions.  The Republicans have lost any notion of accepting any blame for their failings - which is why their claim to be the party of personal responsibility is just one more lie."
2020-08-28 5:18,"Krugman’s selective use of data conveniently misses the following:

The combined population of two Republican states Texas and Florida approximates that of two Democratic states NY and California 
The combined number of confirmed cases is also approximately the same

Somehow, the combined deaths (isn’t that what we are really concerned about?) in the two Democratic states is TWICE that in the two Republican states.

2020-08-28 11:36,"Trump's management of the coronavirus crisis has been an abysmal failure, but it may not be enough to deny him a second term. To some extent, the virus, by virtue of its persistent, has lost the ability to shock and has faded into a sort of white noise. Meanwhile, polls suggest the public is souring on BLM, and increasingly conflates it with violent protests and rising crime. Trump and the Republicans have seized this opening and have linked the Democrats, however unfairly, to an anti-policing and anti-law and order attitude. Biden ignores this at his peril. What is needed are forceful, simple and relentless statements from Democrats reminding voters that Trump's chaos and ineptitude led to 180,000 deaths, Depression-era levels of unemployment, and civil unrest."

Such a question would force Trump to confront his primary failure whereby he prescribed the opposite (less testing) of what was and continues to be needed to control the current pandemic. 

A good follow-up question would be ""Given the fact that you cannot choose a course of action that makes you 'look bad' in the short term, doesn't that disqualify you from any decision-making process, let alone as commander-in-chief?"""
2020-08-28 12:16,"This reminds me so much of sports teams.  Like a baseball team.  The season starts with a string of losses and when the manager is questioned about the performance, he uses his thumb to point back to the clubhouse and says ""That is a winning team in there.  I predict  we will win the World Series"".  Yet the losses continue.  And the baseball experts suggest ways to improve the team and criticize on field decisions like not putting in certain players or bunting with two strikes.  Yet the manager's response is to keep saying we ARE winning.  And he orders that the scoreboard be darkened so no one sees the score  And the next day the newspaper headlines read ANOTHER LOSS, 9-1.  And here it is : September, and the manager says ""We are gearing up for the playoffs"".  But everyone knows not to buy playoff tickets.  The standings don't lie.  And then the manager is stunned when he is fired.  And the entire front office staff is let go.  Well, Don, it's the Fall and there is no late season surge.  Sorry.  Time is about up.  1,000 a day in the lost column is impossible to ignore."
2020-08-28 12:22,"Trump knows that his followers will accept other people’s deaths to protect their wallets. They do not have the respect for science and are unwilling to accept inconvenience.

2020-08-28 12:25,"""On the day Trump issued his LIBERATE demands, around 33,000 Americans had died from Covid-19. The total now is around 180,000.""

As bad as the quote above sounds, there are details that make it worse.
1) Daily U.S. Covid-19 death rates before the tweet were a few hundred per day. In August those rates have averaged over 1000 per day, around 1 death per minute.
2) It was already clear in Italy and a number of other countries initially hit hard, even China, that lockdowns and mask requirements were working.
3) While Trump was cheerleading us into a second wave, many countries have partly restored their economies through lockdowns, masks, mass testing, and contact-tracing. 

As a nation we could have done things much differently, like many other nations did. Sadly, our national leaders chose a high-risk course hoping for a short-term political edge instead of public safety."
2020-08-28 12:27,"I agree completely. We should have used March and April's shutdowns to prepare for school in te late summer and fall. Forget bars, restaurants, Disneyworld; we should've been erecting tents and structures for outdoor classrooms for the July - October school session. That should've been our unifying priority; with school open, business can also open."
2020-08-28 4:09,"I agree about April being Trump’s cruelest month, but tonight may have matched that cruelty. To witness a thousand or more people sitting on the White House lawn shoulder to shoulder, most without masks, is such an affront to all those affected by covid-19. All the frontline workers, the nurses and doctors, all who have put there lives on the line for their fellow citizens to witness this! This is a cruel blow, an insult and utterly revolting to see this president disregard the most basic of rules around the spread of this virus. 
Disgraceful."
2020-08-28 12:40,"August has also been an exceptionally cruel month.  Trump has politicized the FDA and CDC with the inappropriate FDA endorsement of COVID survivor plasma as a treatment and the CDC recommendation (pushed through while Dr. Fauci was literally unconscious) to not test those who are not symptomatic.  The CDC action will result in exponentially more infections and deaths.  And, together the corruption of the FDA and the CDC for political gain will affect not only COVID outcomes in the US, but also all medical outcomes.  If we cannot trust the FDA and the CDC to be non-biased science based agencies, how will we ever move forward in developing reliable treatments and protocols for any disease or public health problem?  Seeking treatment for anything from acne to cancer will be no different from going to a used car salesman.  Your well-being will be second to another's agenda for their own personal gain and you will be without the tools needed to know when you are being played.  Good luck with that."
2020-08-28 12:42,"If April was Trump's cruelest month, August will be his best YTD. People are seeing the transmission and deaths rates decrease on a daily basis. The new concerns, however, are the murders, shootings and rioting occurring in many Democratic cities. People want to know where the police are. Democrats seem to support  de-funding the police. Big mistake. Safety is the new primary concern. People will not support a candidate who does not guarantee their safety."
2020-08-28 12:42,"Not sure we had a second wave as much as a rolling first wave. Still the point is states delayed closing activities too late and reopened them too soon.

Let's not forget that when the coronavirus knocked on the White House door, a Presidential charlatan answered and said:

""So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that, too. Sounds interesting, right?""

""And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful.""

The pandemic, the hurricane, the fires, the unemployment, the cities under siege are all happening on Trump's watch. Yet, he and the Republicans have cobbled together a story that exonerates them of any responsibility.

Why does public safety have to be a matter of political whims and tantrums? 

CDC needs to be totally removed from the administration and set up as a charter organization outside the government. The government should be legally liable for deaths as preventible, and for its failure to manage public health. (It probably is, but the apathetic legal response to so many Trump disasters is appalling.) 

Democrats and progressives needn't be pinning medals on themselves, either. The total lack of effective action to manage Trump is an indictment of America's lack of spine. What, do American lawyers really live in some sort of
professional sector-wide coma? Everything he's done, including the ALEC-led deregulation disaster, could have been challenged and it wasn't.

Yeah, yeah,,, there are no wildfires in California, either. And why do people believe it? Because it gives them comfort, like the belief in life in the ""hereafter"" (and despite my atheism I think the existence of a life after death is minimally more likely than the advent of a functioning Covid19 vaccine anytime soon). Politics gets away with blatant lies because it gives people an excuse to pretend (""It will all be over by Christmas!"" was a much-loved claim made in 1914 about the European conflagration in which many Americans were also sent to their deaths).

2020-08-28 10:22,"I would like to push back on the ""shockingly irresponsible"" notion of not testing assymptomatic people.  I speak as a COVID survivor and physician.  CDC and others in infection prevention (IP) recommend that after high risk exposure (within 6 feet, 15 min no PPE) an individual quarantine for 14 days.  Once symptomatic and test positive, that individual  remain quarantined for at least 10 days with at least 72 hours of symptom free before breaking quarantine. Contact tracing begins 48 hours prior to the onset of symptoms.  
After visiting in-laws out of state, I returned to work at my hospital on monday am. On tuesday pm, we learned that a person whom my wife had high risk exposure to, had a fever and tested positive.  We were all assymptomatic. I called IP at work and was immediately quarantined for two weeks. No recommended testing despite high risk exposure to my wife. My wife developed symptoms on weds and tested positive. She was ""isolated"" at home.  Two other family members became symptomatic and tested positive 48 hrs later.  I was assymptomatic, got tested and was negative. The next day I developed symptoms and the following day I tested positive.  
Should my families care been different? Should we all have been tested up front and tested daily?  We all isolated and quarantined. What would we have done differently? 
What I find shocking and irresponsible is incomplete unpacking of health care policy. I detest the president, but also detest being manipulated."

Later of course, taking their cue from Dear Leader,  there were several trumped up reasons given by his followers:1. We are Americans; no one tells us what to do. 2. If God wanted us to wear masks, we would have been born with them 3. Health reasons. Perhaps valid for some. 4. We'd be breathing in carbon dioxide.  And so on. And so forth. But from Trump himself all that was heard was that he'd be meeting princes and potentates in the Oval office. And what kind of figure would he cut? That so many lives were lost on the altar of his narcissism, troubled the man not a whit. So no Mr.Krugman. Neither April, nor May, June, July, August would have lost this president any sleep."
2020-08-28 0:53,"It seems to me that Trump’s disinterest in protecting people from this deadly virus is because a high percentage of those dying are the elderly and people of color.

Yes.  Trump is that awful."
2020-08-28 2:17,"Trump cannot beat Covid19 if he loses the election. So, he has to do what is needed to win the election and deflecting blame (or spinning the narrative into an  alternative reality) is what is needed to handle Covid19. Agreeing to do what the Liberals want would be political suicide and cost him the election. That, in sum, explains the Trump Administration's response to Covid.

More importantly, what is the Biden-Harris team's strategy to beat back his spin? Nothing that I can see working!

There needs to be a contrast made between Trump-Pence America (Covid. Race Riots. Economic Mayhem. Broken Alliances. International Pariah.) and the Obama-Biden America.

Trump has proven that there is no limit to the effectiveness of these worn out excuses.  He uses them over and over again because they work.  Why do they work?

They work because his followers cannot accept that their leader has done them wrong.  They are so emotionally invested in Trump that they will believe anything he tells them no matter how many times the truth is placed in front of their eyes.  Trump is the master of a cult.  Reason, logic, facts and figures are not required.  In fact they will create their own facts and figures as required.  We just lived through four days of that.

There is one figure Trump cannot influence.  That is the Covid death count.  We are still losing about 1000 people a day on average.  Even though the case count in going down, the body count is steady.  

When will the body count matter to Trump supporters?  When their loved ones are in the totals.  This is the ultimate cruelty of Trump.  He hurts his own people even more than his enemies.  For example the trade tariffs hurt domestic manufacturing.  He has driven farmers to ruin.  And now his total failure of the pandemic is costing rural people their jobs.  They will stick with him until Covid gets there first.  Trump hopes he gets their votes before that happens."

Lou Dobbs would speak angrily (what else?) about Hillary being a ""homicidal maniac.""  There would be widespread unrest, with hundreds of thousands of gun-toting Republicans, urged on by right-wing media, marching against ""Hillary's American Genocide.""  And Donald Trump would be tweeting about Hillary being the worst mass murderer in world history.

He blamed Trump for not giving NY 35,000 ventilators that he never really needed. Cuomo sent some of the ventilators Trump sent to another state. Cuomo downplayed the virus in April, as did NYC’s mayor.  He ordered the inflicted to be sent to seed the virus to nursing homes against their will.  Cuomo still hides the number of nursing home deaths. If they died in a hospital, they don’t count. Transparency?  Fauci said mask weren’t necessary until he said they were.  If Cuomo listed to Fauci, the subways and buses would have been shut down.  They weren’t. Decisions were made as scientist disagreed on the solutions.  Cuomo blames Trump for not handling the situation better.  NY’s economy is crumbling, and Trump is the scapegoat.  Go back to March and April, and pull some of Cuomo’s quotes as to the seriousness of the virus. Look at death rates compared to the stupid governors that didn’t follow Fauci’s changing opinions. Blaming Trump for NY’s failures is good politics. When New Yorkers are shown the statistics accurately, every governor that used common sense will fair better than NY’s death rate except maybe  NJ and Massachusetts. New Yorkers might never know how many thousands needlessly died from Cuomo poor decisions. He is intent on keeping the data unknown. Examine Cuomo like you did Trump. I’m waiting."

This nation should have been quivering with rage at the way our people of all colors and lower incomes have been under-educated and misinformed all along.  I know this is a gross generalization, but knowing a handful of exceptions doesn’t excuse the charge of systemic racism and classism.  In fact, if America were truly educated, we wouldn’t have systemic oppression of anyone. THAT would be law and order.

On top of not going to school, many ( or most?) American children will not have opportunities to learn by play because they will be surrounded by unintelligible worksheets; lured by tv; quarantined from friends and play spaces; or picking up the pieces after the virus comes through.

The people close to him including his family and former staff have said he is very dangerous and should have never been in power.There has been a continous procession of his staff leaving trump since 2017. His administration has constantly been in chaos. His policies are almost all horrible. A leopard cannot change it's spots.

Exactly nowhere, and the country will be forever another $3 Trillion in debt.

The cost of our squabbling and indecision and ineptitude has been far greater than the $ 3 Trillion, of course. People are dead. Others will never recover their previous health. Businesses have gone under, homes lost, careers ended for now. I'm sure people are out on the streets. One wonders if the total abdication of responsibility by government, and  the resulting cascading personal tragedies it triggered, contributed to the deaths of George Floyd and others, and the escalation of the culture wars into battles in the streets.

When fantasy and reality clash, reality will eventually triumph. In support of that, I offer Mr. Trump's serial business failures when the numbers didn't add up to his vain hyperbole. It perplexed me to no end that so many of Trump's admirers could not pause to consider how the self-styled master deal maker and genius could contrive to go bankrupt by owning casinos and was thus relegated to a vapid fantasy TV show and a fake university, while also frantically slapping his name on vodka, steaks or anything else that would give him a nickel for it.

Mr. Trump is desperate because he can sense that his latest and greatest con is about to unravel, as all cons eventually do. This time, however, it's not just him in danger off going down. And I think he'd just as soon take the rest of us with him."
2020-08-28 12:21,"Every expert stressed how key testing was/is.  And watching our pathetic non-response, I knew we'd never get the kind of testing that we needed to navigate Covid -- and we haven't.  Even now, test results lag by 2 weeks, which renders them effectively useless.  It was clear to me that Trump didn't want testing (which would have showed how out of control Covid was here), it was also clear that we lacked the manufacturing capabilities to come up with enough tests and what are essentially long Q-tips.  In other words, the mighty USA couldn't cough up enough Q-tips because we've forgotten how to manufacture."
2020-08-28 1:01,"And not a word about the thunderous silence of congressional Republicans. 
Trump is not doing this in vacuum, by himself. The Republican Party is complicit in every thing the President does, or doesn't do. Trump owns them, and they own everything Trump does.

2020-08-28 12:16,"Donald Trump wants to divide the country into winners and losers.  He just wants to keep his winners growing at the expense of more suffering losers. He is determined not to save those who are in need of help.  American dream for the majority of many has become an impossible dream.

The pandemic will not go away that easily.  It could become a seasonal flu even if a vaccine is available.  The nature of disease could be more complicated than we know. And Trump has no clue at all on how to tackle the problem.  It is just like he has no clue on how to solve the social problem at all."

2020-08-28 12:43,"Trump, prior to coming to office was known for his bankruptcies, for which it appears he never took responsibility, once more Trump has demonstrated an incapacity to take any responsibility for the true state of America. He focuses on the past but the present and future are not his doing..or so he wants the american people to think. Bankruptcies often indicate that projections are misaligned with reality, in the case of Trump his projections have not only been wrong but also deadly and this is in spite of the availability of expert advice.

The results of his projections have lead to 180.000 dead americans , massive unemployment, loss of homes and main street economic collapse, but oddly rather than learn and self correct he has doubled down on his obsession with trying to shift blame to states, scientists, democrats and media. His ""Liberation"" nonsense allowed for businesses like bars and restaurants to become spreaders of the virus. Now he is championing a reopening of  schools where  due to the impossibility of social distancing viral outbreaks will easily spread into communities, teachers ,homes and  nursing homes. 

Trump wants to manage how he is perceived but the inconvenient truth is that his mismanagement has resulted in historically high unemployment, record deaths, Main street devastation and social unrest, In short he is bankrupting America as he bankrupted his other businesses, by indifference to details and reality, a nation can not be run this way !"

It's awful to hear his naked lies and distortions, projections of catastrophic outcomes if an American chooses to vote for a Democrat. It's sickening to hear the contempt for and  personal attacks against his political opponent's health and character; the echoing callousness of hearing suffering spoken about, yet so removed as to step over invisible Americans, the 182,000 who died of Covid so far.

Undermining Americans' trust in federal branches of government and agencies. including respecting the independence of other branches and agencies to do the work entrusted to them, endangers the democracy of the United States .  How many people in public office don't believe our government is government of the people by the people for the people? They corrode from within.  Power struggle deadlocks over peoples common good become obvious. Reps fail us.

Donald Trump is known to say he respects everyone, yet acts with respect for no one but Donald Trump.  William Barr is known for his personal view on expanding powers of the Executive Branch. He says he's not beholden to Donald Trump.  I think he means it.  He couldn't care less.  He's not a power to the people guy.  He's a power to the president guy, whoever he is."

“In times of change learners shall inherit the earth, while the learned are beautify equipped for a world that no longer exists.”

In the context of Hoffer’s insight the “learned” are the 40–50% of Americans who appear to lack critical thinking skills because, for generations, religious groups, politicians, and the wealthy have used high school textbooks and curriculum to present an incomplete and false history of America. With no opportunity for young minds to discuss, and most importantly, learn from the good and the bad that is our nation’s history, our country is on the cusp of becoming the Russia of the western hemisphere.

So it goes in the land of the naive, and the home of the deceived."

If Trump would simply take the steps other countries and parts of the US have proven to be successful in fighting covid, the pandemic would recede, making economic reopening a safe option. 

The economy would bounce back and Trump could take credit.

But Trump is hell bent on leading the country to hell in a hand basket.

So the pandemic will ramble along, and Trump is left with the squishy end of the stick.

Trump just won’t learn. Maybe that’s a good thing."

We now see Tucker Carlson, Ann Coulter et al praising Kyle Rittenhouse.  The ""fine people on either side"" are figuring out that if Trump is re-elected,  they are unstoppable.  And then our ""grand experiment"" is truly over."

2020-08-28 13:43,"A very interesting article. The level of violence we are experiencing as a nation is associated with the far left. The BLM movement leaders have stated this clearly. ( If we do not get what we want we will burn it down). All cities, all occurrences. To suggest that Trump supporters, or to even associate them with that violence, burned down South Minneapolis, including a 30 million dollar new housing facility for the homeless, is a real crime; a mis-representative historical rewrite.

As far as Covid-19, Trump, as usual, used his mouth and tweets very poorly and is the absolute worst President ever in what he says. But not in his actual actions regarding governmental policy, which has been very strong at times.

It is an unusual time, and a sad one, when the media dictates social policy in our country. At some point, adversity and exclusion will hopefully be seen as a real loss and lend itself to more inclusiveness. The re-election of Ilhan Omar gives pause for concern that we will never heal as a nation. A time when hate of both people and country as a platform wins , regardless of party affiliation, is a sad thing and this article does support the continuance of hate as a modus operandi moving forward."
2020-08-28 14:07,"I recognize that Krugman's analysis of Trumps handling of the Covid-19 is spot on.

When it comes to medicine, there is such a thing as the scientific method for evaluating, measuring and quarantining. Trump and his party have largely ignored those methods, perhaps reflecting that trump is an impulsive businessman who has little understanding of science.

And yet, i a registered D. would if the vote were taken today, vote for Trump over Biden and Harris.

My abhorrence of the R's is no less than Krugman's just as a working stiff I see the D's vision as being even worse.

Worse than the pandemic is cancel culture. The complete suppression of views that do not conform to yours. this is where the D party is today.

Were it not for a free press the casualties of this virus would be 100x greater.  For if Trump had his way, there would be absolutely no mention of this virus in the press so as to bolster the Gross Domestic Product.

Do not underestimate the value of free press and free speech. You  shouldn't be choosing what is allowed to be said and what isn't.

Of course the Covid-19 rates are declining: Trump has been doing almost as much as he can to suppress collection of good data, and to suppress active testing, as he’s been doing to suppress mail-in voting this fall.

Certainly the numbers are down, but it’s very easy to lie with statistics, which is exactly what’s happening.

Ditto with death rates.

So the real question is, if children start dying in massive numbers as schools keep attempting to open this fall in the US..... will we even hear about it?

Don’t believe a thing you’re hearing out there now. The CDC has been reduced to a mockery of its former self, among other things. So has the news.

2020-08-28 14:24,"This is a good and factual article. Overall, the RNC convention meeting was filled with the hope that Trump would lead the USA to a promised land. Whenever someone promises something so unbelieveable, you need to ask ""what is your past track record?"" or ""Tell me about you successes and failures"". This is standard for job interviews. 

The voters would have profitted from my questions being put to Trump, Pence and the GOP, since they had Presidency, House and Senate from 2016 to 2018. What did they do in those 2 years for the voters, except for the Trump Tax Cut that helped Trump and his friends."

I very quickly could no longer afford monthly coverage or doctor visits, let alone meds, under Trump's 'new and better' ACA and so I had to leave the US... without my then four-year-old.

I will be careful here because years later (and hey, unexpected bonuses - my son is finding online school easy because we've been video chatting every night for years!) just thinking about it can make me cry, and often does. 

The US needs to know that the rest of the world is looking at them in shame, horror, and pity. Friends keep calling to say ""this stat is a typo, right?"" but it's not. I will not see my jet-setter son again until at least July next year (Australia remains on lockdown). I will miss almost 18 months of his young life; still, my doctors here are all quick to assure me I'll have a much better chance of being alive to see him if I stay here, where it's safe.

""Today the Justice Department requested COVID-19 data from the governors of states that issued orders which may have resulted in the deaths of thousands of elderly nursing home residents. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan required nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients to their vulnerable populations, often without adequate testing.""
Now, just because the governors of these states have been asked to provide information, it does not mean they are guilty of misconduct. But the COVID-19 infection and death rates in these states clearly show that their nursing home populations bore the brunt of their democrat governors leadership failures and simply awful judgement. Those failures caused the hospitals to be overwhelmed and contributed to the spread of the virus. Even with the so called ""second wave"" in the Sunbelt states, the death rates per million in those four democrat states exceed the death rates in the recent ""hot spot"" states like Florida and Texas by more than 300 percent.

But what about Mike Pence? He's supposed to be a conservative Christian, yet he lies, he expresses no remorse for all the horrible things Trump has done, including mishandling the pandemic causing thousands of people to die who wouldn't have had to. I remember the VP debates in 2016 when Tim Kaine was incredulous that Pence was supporting Trump; he said, ""I know you!"" 

And what about members of the Republican party who are, either sincerely religious or otherwise compassionate people, okay with all these deaths?

I think Kaitlyn Schiess's NYT piece on how Liberty University under Jerry Falwell Jr. (another total hypocrite) went wrong--that it taught the love of political power, physical safety [implicitly, I think, by means of owning guns], and economic prosperity--is spot on, and explains what has happened to the Christians who support Trump.

They've been manipulated (mostly by the abortion issue--as if the GOP leaders actually cared about abortion) into worshipping power, guns, and money. That's what's called idolatry.

To who disagree, I challenge them to read the sermon on the mount in the gospel of Matthew & explain how Christ's teachings square with the Republicans' policies & practices.

2020-08-28 13:17,"What was encouraging from Biden and Harris yesterday, indicating that 80, 88, 00 & 04 will not be repeated, is that Dems now understand the need to refute false memes. The chaos in the streets now (along, of course, with 180,000 dead) is TRUMP'S WORLD. He is in charge, even if his MO is make noise and do nothing.

But Dems should also paint T into a corner as he predicts  a dark and terrible Biden's presidency to come, since history gives a true picture of what to expect from the rather peaceful and prosperous (especially following the Bush Cheney wars and economic crash) Obama Biden administration of 2009-2017."

The thing we have now, from mid-May to the present, is the Trump Pandemic, a catastrophe caused by the selfish, ignorant behavior of a man-child who cannot ever read, hear or accept that doesn't suit his personal onsessons. In truth, the Trump Pandemic name should also carry the names of the pandering GOP governors Abbott, DeSantis, Ducey and Kemp, but that's a little unwieldy."
2020-08-28 12:45,"“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” Covid 19 lies by Trump has provided ample evidence that Trump is insane. Endorsing Trump’s lies about the pandemic makes the Republican Party insane.  Those who call for opening the economy without thoroughly addressing the virus has destroyed the economic future and is insane. Sending kids back to school where they will be in large groups without screening for Coronavirus, training how to mask and wash hands, and socially distanced is just a foolhardy gamble that is insane."
2020-08-28 13:07,"Trump, during his term, cannot be said to have shown respect for life--human,  animal or plant--save his own and perhaps that of his family. 

From throwing rocks at his neighbor's baby as a child, to bullying schoolmates to the extent that he was placed in football, and military school,  to curb his tendencies, to learning to break the law from his dad, he is what happens when narcissism, bullying,  law-breaking and wealth flourish unfettered in a grown man. 

Now he is America's, and the world's,  worst nightmare.  Fellow Republicans refuse to stop him or review legislation from the House.  People have died,  lost their homes, go starving and uneducated on his watch.  

He doesn't care.  ""It is what it is"",  says he. 

His wrath is particularly aimed at Democratic states, where more deaths may help his re-election.  

He's rotten to the core.  Vote him out of office in November, by any legal means your state allows.  Let reason reign again."
2020-08-28 13:14,"Mr. Krugman, I think you are missing something. The virus is ravaging the poor and communities of color. The party of Trump just does not care about this. If the virus starts to sicken large numbers of white middle-class people, then Trump will have a problem. For now, these people are only being hurt financially, and he is promising to end the things that hurt them financially."
2020-08-28 13:19,"The big irony is that the USA are the country of the shrinks. Nowhere else are psychological issues investigated and analysed with the same intensity.

And Trump is a pretty extreme case of a narcissistic personality disorder. He displayed the symptoms for decades.

How can people vote for a known sociopath? How can people work for such a person?"
2020-08-28 14:03,"President Trump and those that follow his lead are coming dangerously close to be Bio-Terrorists with their denial and actions related to Covid-19.

The question that Americans need to be asking themselves is at what point is such Bio-Terrorism, with approaching 2000,000 dead, so critical that their Inalienable Rights to life are in jeopardy and therefore they have the Inalienable Right to ignore the Rule of Law and The Constitution of the United States in defense of their lives?"
2020-08-28 14:20,"Yesterday recorded 1118 COVID-related deaths in the USA, capping more in the last three days than the mortality count of the 9/11 catastrophe. From the Republican National  Convention one would hardly realuze that this loss of life mattered.

Yet the GOP fantasy carnival on the people's property portrays the coronavirus as a mere blip in recent American history, with the president having saved ""millions"" of Anerican lives by -- what? -- issuing a travel ban last March from China that was poorly enforced and riddled with loopholes.

As for the hard work of strategic policy-making, the president proved himself worse than incompetent; he explicitly and wilfully abdicated any semblance of national leadership. He is constitutionally incapable of effective executive management.

Perhaps the GOP slogan should be ""No Lives Matter """

2020-08-28 14:33,"Back in the 1940s, when Fascism broke out in Europe, and Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, we began a federally funded and led Manhattan project to develop a super weapon, which 75 years ago,  ended the war in Japan, and changed the world forever.  We need that again against COVID-19, and again it has to change the world forever.  A U.S. disease is a world disease.  We erased small pox, and polio that way.  The main approach today is to change human behavior, wearing masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing.  We are having hard enough time on that. We also need much faster testing and contact tracing.  How is it, in American, supposedly the most advanced economy in the world,  we can't get enough PCR machines or reagents, advanced testing methods, or contact tracing.  

We are relying on he standard economic model based on return on investment. Imagine fighting WWII,  big capital industries to create weapons of war on speculation.  If you build it, we will buy it.  Instead, the Government put out specifications and those companies who met the specifications got big contracts to manufacture, test, and deliver weapons systems to the war fighter.  And who would have self funded a Manhattan project?  No one.  Not today either.  

This administration has no intention in creating or leading policies to save us.  It's only interested in suppressing democracy and instituting itself as an authoritarian domain for the foreseeable future."

2020-08-28 14:36,What is shocking is that both the FDA and CDC are under the influence of the WH and its non-science approach to COVID-19 treatments and testing.  Shall we expect Trump to also cut short the required steps to developing a vaccine in order to announce its use before the November election?
2020-08-28 14:43,"And yet Krugman fails to acknowledge that Sweden was able to go without any lockdown at all thereby keeping its economy strong.

Why does Krugman assume he does what the only right approach when experts disagree? And what does he propose if a vaccine isn't forth coming - that we go back under a total lockdown like Biden suggests he would implement?

I can't help feeling that COVID is being played like a political football.  De Blasio has the NYC economy in a chokehold by his refusal to re-open restaurants etc despite the fact that we have less than 1.4% rate of new infections.

Just what is the logical point at which we re-open?  When we have have 35 infections in a city of 8 million?  3?"
2020-08-28 14:43,"Paul Krugman writes:  Germany, whose response to Covid-19 has been infinitely better than ours, has managed to reopen its schools more or less normally, amid constant testing. For America, that’s an impossible dream

That is not true regarding testing

Average Daily number of tests per 100k population (all time average) 

US              203
Germany     75
Canada        86

Indeed, there is only one country, if you can call Hong Kong

2020-08-28 15:08,"Professor Krugman has accurately described the Trump administrations fecklessness in dealing with the pandemic, and the resultant peaks and valleys of death.

I certainly don't wish for more death.

However, with more states opening up business, schools reopening, and football season, it is possible that an upturn in infection could sway the election.   That also might help to solve the metaphysical quandary about science being the best way to determine truth.

An abrupt end to the 2020 college football season might change a lot of minds."
2020-08-28 15:11,"One would think a renowned economist would mention the horror of all the small businesses destroyed by Covid, explaining that it's not just the death from the disease, but the cascading financial burden. Then of course he could point to all of the crying store owners who've seen their businesses looted, and then burned to the ground. Their life's work in ruins. 

And then, as a renowned economist, he could explain the horror those cities will experience for decades, because of that loss. The insurance rates alone to open a business there will be astounding. But hey, as an economist, Krugman could explain the risk reward mentality of a businessman, and he'd explain that nobody would want that risk. Why put all your money in a place where you can expect no protection. 

But instead of benefiting from his singular area of expertise, Dr. Krugman avoided speaking of this issue. Curious."
2020-08-28 15:12,"His tweet of April 17 told me where Trump and company was headed, and now, according to the party line, we live amid chaos and ruin, Barbarians at the gates, hordes of the lawless marching on the suburbs. April 17 told me that Trump was willing to go that last step and incite the militia types into action, creating fear that he would use to win re-election. It never seems to occur to Trumpists that Trump is the cause of the chaos, misery and unemployment. All of this is quite unsettling but riling the far right into action is incredibly dangerous on every level."

2020-08-28 15:23,"TV Commentators have recently been asking if the conventions will change anyone's mind in November.

I would submit that anyone who has not made up their mind prior to the conventions has not been paying attention and should be disqualified from voting."
2020-08-28 15:26,"I didn't make through Trump's entire speech---I just couldn't. But what kept going through my mind in the first half-hour was that West Point motto: ""Make us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be won."" I fear our nation and the leader of this nation has chosen the easier wrong."
2020-08-28 15:30,"April was Cumo's Cruelest month, so although the CDC had already recommended masks the April 6, it wasn't until more than a week later, April 15, that he ordered public mask wearing, as deaths reached 900 a day. And still the effect of masks isn't wholly conclusive since cases already peaked earlier in the month, and likewise deaths at 999 on April 9. There was no time lag in peaks since only the sick got tested at that point. I'm not saying masks weren't critical in containing spread of the disease, but the statistics and science are not fully developed. There are some countries with low mask usage, and yet low transmission. Common sense, and the success of many countries with high mask usage also tends to favor masks as an essential measure.  It was not until May 28, that Cuomo said businesses open to the public could deny entry to people without masks. 
The trouble with Krugman's analysis is that it doesn't take in to account the reality that currently in the US, there are two different types of response to the virus, great numbers of deaths from the virus followed by a shutdown, or a shutdown, reopening, followed by great numbers of deaths. Since Krugman doesn't want to face that reality, he finds solace in blaming our obviously incompetent and self interested president."
2020-08-28 15:39,"Trump has made very plain to all willing to understand, that he will put our lives at risk if it might gain him a few votes.  The people who appeared at his speech yesterday, mostly without masks, are apparently willing to die for his reelection, but most of us are not. 
 In early May, there were 60,000 people dead.  For those with memories of real things: that's when The Lincoln Project first ran their ""Mourning for America"" ad and when Trump was pushing to reopen States before it was safe to do so according to the guidelines his coronavirus task force had issued.  It is now 120,000 deaths later.  Trump has made it quite plain that he does not care how many people die if it might win him an election.  His Republican enablers were willing to pretend that the virus is gone, when in fact models show the death toll may reach 300,000 people by December. 
 Among sane and sentient voters, that should disqualify Trump and all Republicans who are willing to let their citizens die to promote Trump's self-centered delusions."
2020-08-28 15:43,"""To be fair, some of those additional deaths would surely have happened even if Trump had done what he should have done....""

Some, some, some - how many? What is 'fair' about offering a useless word like 'some'. Eleven or eleven thousand? Rather than a fair qualifier we were offered a highly deceptive suggestion of near parity. Better than 'a few' by how much was 'some'?

The objective and fair thing to state was the precise number of sickened and dead post Trump's statement. Let's not distract with a guess about the unknown as if that would be fairer."
2020-08-28 15:49,"Actually, from an epidemiological viewpoint, Trump's refusal to acknowledge  the spread of COVID-19 at the end of February  ended the possibility of any better case scenario.  But your point is still well taken.   Yesterday in the small town of Livingston CA, a huge chicken processing plant was shut down because 1/10 of its 3700 workers were positive for COVID-19, resulting in at least 8 deaths.  What's instructive about this horrible situation is that two months ago, Foster Farms  was told to  institute  a set of measures to contain/slow down infection Foster Farms did nothing and got away with it. California could and should have made Foster Farms comply. The insanity that  resistance to medically mandated emergency measures is glorified by the Trump regime will never stop.  Only Trump's removal and a stop or go to jail governance  will change the the crisis."
2020-08-28 15:54,"It is a game of pretend and one that is played by both Democrats and Republicans, neither of which have any intent to relinquish the political control to which we the public are saddled.

Why governing, the simple and straightforward managing of our society, is still a mystery rests on the fact that control reaps inordinate monetary benefit to all who are concerned at every level, from the smallest township to every major political office in our nation.

Simplistic, but, if analyzed through a nonpartisan lens, accurate.

We need honesty which in my dictionary means dropping all spiritual mystery from governance.

We know what works and what doesn't, but can and do, mirroring the wealthiest among us, delude ourselves into thinking we deserve whatever station in life society dictates we occupy.

There is enough here for all of us."
2020-08-28 16:11,"Trump reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode from 1963 entitled ""The Old Man in the Cave."" In a post-apocalyptic world, a town relies on the advice of an unknown old man in a cave. When they find out the old man is actually a computer, they rebel against the reason the computer gives them, listening to the leader of a group of soldiers who disdains the computer because he tells them computers led to the problems. Of course, the computer was correct about contaminated food, and those who followed disdained the reasoning died. 
The sole survivor, implied to be a programmer, is left as an ""eyewitness to man's imperfection. An observer of the very human trait of greed. And a chronicler of the last chapter—the one reading 'suicide.' Not a prediction of what is to be, just a projection of what could be. This has been The Twilight Zone.""

2020-08-28 3:06,"People should read  ""The Great Influenza""  it's an eye opener. The amount of propaganda flowing from the Wilson Adminisntration is largely responsible for the 664,000 deaths in 24 weeks. 

Oddly there were anti-maskers then, that thought that they had some constitutional right to spread disease.  But even then scientists understood social distancing, mask wearing,  they understood if someone coughed into their hands, then touched something, of shook your hand, all it took was you rubbing your chin in thought, rubbing your eye, touching any mucus membrane, now your infected.

Even seeing people literally dropping dead, blood gushing from every orifice,  even seeing people walking around with cyanosis, didn't seem to change anti-maskers minds, even when they themselves began dying, whole families would've been wiped out. 

Even then scientists understood, social distancing, wearing a mask, most cities adopted no spitting on sidewalk laws.  But then, as now,  the politicians in charge chose to ignore the threat, until it was to late.  Wilson, like Trump, chose to peddle propaganda, lies.  Only Wilson went one step further, he managed to suspend Habius Corpus,  ending with the Supreme Court with Oliver Wendell Holmes, writing for the majority, was constitutional.

Wilson arrested anyone that talked about the Spanish Flu, or wrote about it.  Wilson busied himself with passing the alien and sedititon act,  ultimately throwing 10,000 people in jail without charges. Sounds familir"

Admittedly, there is immediate presentation of fact checking following the stage show. Most likely, the base that voted for Trump in 2016 changes channel to some brainless entertainment right after the propaganda show ends or watched the convention on FOX.  It makes me wonder if Trump and Zuckerberg cut a deal- no censoring in exchange for blocking Anti-trust actions. In the end, it’s a slippery slope for private entities to censor content for lies and disinformation even though it is the only type of information the administration delivers. It would be wonderful to fact check  the speakers in real-time and have the television networks flash “Lie!” in bold flashing red color at the bottom of the screen."
2020-08-28 14:43,Trump is not governing the country. He is running a television show in which every day he vanquishes all rivals. His words.  So to expect fact based policy from this administration is to miss the point. The only facts that matter are the alternative facts that Trump's administration makes up as it goes along. The problem is that 30% plus of people are either buying the cruelty or willfully ignorant.

Having cratered the economy, Republicans still cannot help themselves from hewing to their playbook. Giving people money only helps what Dr. Krugman refers to as ""those people"", urbanites and minorities. They fail to recognize that their people have now become ""those people"".

1) The U.S. Covid mortality rate is not a negative outlier - it is in fact close to those of most of the major western countries.  
2)  The U.S. economy is expected to outperform the major European economies this year by a considerable margin - including Germany's.  
3) Most EU countries, including Germany, are dealing with increasing Covid infection rates

I also have a question: What is the sense of a hard lock down strategy in the U.S. if we are unable or unwilling to completely shut the U.S. southern border?   Covid is rampant in Mexico and many other Central and South American countries.  How do we justify the tremendous economic and social cost of harsh lock downs if legal and illegal immigration will bring the virus right back?

2020-08-28 6:04,"It's a stretch to say that Trump has learned anything -- that he's more than a bag of stale appetites, chronic dysfunction, sadistic tics, steaming bile and biliousness -- but if he has, it's that he can conduct himself in the most despicable way, spurn the law and flout morality, with absolutely no consequence.

His illegal appropriation of government for his reelection -- egregious Hatch Act violations up front and center throughout the Republican convention -- has been widely denounced but so what?

He's placed himself above the law, beyond its reach, which is itself a powerful case for re-election.  That he can get away with anything -- and has -- is to his supporters a monument to the great American myth that real men do it their way. In Trump country outlaws are us.

American impunity is just another kind of American exceptionalism, and Trump is the tsar of impunity.

Think about it: we're down to an interim US Attorney in the Southern District of NY, and Manhattan's DA as the sole law enforcement agencies chasing down a renegade POTUS.  

Everyday Trump aids and abets covid 19, more people get infected and a thousand die every day.  Why aren't docs and nurses across the country on strike -- like the NBA players who quit playoff games in protest over Kenosha?

2020-09-01 15:37,"A while ago, I went to see a dermatologist about dark, round spots on my forehead.  The dermatologist I visited was an experienced, white MD-PhD.  He said the cause may be secondary syphilis.  I told him I was not sexually active.  He floated the idea of taking some skin from my forehead (which would leave a permanent scar) and doing a biopsy.  I refused.  

When more dark round spots appeared on my forehead, I went back to the doctor, who, again, talked about secondary syphilis.  At that point, it seemed clear that the doctor didn't know what to do.  So I discontinued visiting him.

On a trip to Ethiopia, I visited a well-known dermatologist.  A few seconds after looking at my forehead, the doctor said he thought I had lichen planus.  He asked me to get some blood work to see if I had hepatitus C, since they could occur at the same time.  He then ordered a topical cream that quickly got rid of the dark spots."

On a broader front, doctors can't know everything and good health care requires that patients do their homework.

There is no cure and treatment consists of content wound care. It doesn't care about melanin.

I wanted to say who I was before making an additional observation on dermatology. Every dermatologist I have visited in the last 20 years clearly, from the literature and posters in their waiting rooms and exam rooms, made most of their money on cosmetic services. Dermatology is a speciality that attracts people who want to make a lot of money.

The fact is, that many dermatologists, both white and Black, are trying to educate themselves about how to better care for non-white patients. There are multiple conferences every year devoted to Skin of Color, with attendees from around the country and the world. 

Just like any other specialty, dermatologists need to keep up with new developments, as well as make up for deficiencies in their medical training. Please note there are many doctors doing their best to help their patients."

I did my residency at a very prestigious ivy league school, and there on one occasion, my attending doctors couldn't even identify acne on a black person.  I told them it was acne and still the patient was sent for a derm consult....seemed ridiculous  to me at the time.  But the point is, training in whatever capacity shows  the student or resident active cases and we  learn from that.  If students or doctors are training in a facility where few Black or hispanic patients are seen, lectures should be included to show the variations,  that is critically important and teaches us to provide all patients with excellent care."

Non-dermatologists lack training in skin of color and that is a problem.  There are excellent professional solutions including VisualDx which is mentioned in the story.  Yet, there is a deficit of buy-in from hospitals and clinics taking this issue seriously. More needs to be done to further invest in software and books that help train in skin of color diagnosis and treatment for generalists.  It’s a problem that can no longer be ignored."
2020-09-01 23:12,"This issue is not limited to Black and Latinx skin. Many US dermatologists don't think East Asian people get skin cancer. I had a skin colored bump on my face for almost three decades. My first biopsy was benign, but the bump regrew. My second biopsy was inconclusive so my dermatologist in LA wanted a plastic surgeon to excise the growth. However, I moved away and I was focused on another health issue. In SF, I saw Dr. A who couldn't detect the biopsy scar because it was thin and flat. Two years ago, I saw Dr. B who specializes in skin of color. She refused to do another biopsy even though the bump was a 1/2"" oval with raised edges. She said it was cosmetic. In July, I saw Dr. C for diffuse hair loss triggered by a car accident. I told her about the bump, which was now asymmetrical and protruding. Dr. C did a biopsy and diagnosed me with basal cell carcinoma. I'm getting Mohs surgery in September for skin cancer that I've likely had for 10-15 years. I'm Chinese American and several doctors told me that Asian people don't get skin cancer. My Japanese American friend had a facial mole that would dry out and bleed. When her dermatologist finally did a biopsy, it was basal cell carcinoma. Her first Mohs surgery revealed so much abnormal tissue that she had a second Mohs surgery with a plastic surgeon. The plastic surgeon removed tissue from her eyebrow to the bottom of her nose and rebuilt her nose bridge. My white friends all had faster diagnosis for the same cancer."

No one around me believed how serious it was and teachers would constantly tell us not to worry about anything. We went to school for two weeks until finally, the school board decided to move school online.

The Governor then had issued a stay-at-home order, suggesting people to not go out as much as possible. Coming from a wealthy neighborhood in Greensboro, NC, many families had the choice of staying home to protect themselves from Covid-19. 

In my case, my family could not stay home. My dad owns an ice cream shop which is where we get most of our income from. If we had closed the shop, we would not have any money to pay rent or food. We HAD to go to work everyday in fear of getting Covid-19.

This is the same for many people around the world. Some of us don't have a choice to avoid the virus no matter how much we want to. One of the biggest reasons why people keep contracting the virus is because they HAVE to go to work in order to support their family. 

In the case that many families live below the poverty line, the government needs to step in to help them. Those families are the ones doing the essential work and helping the economy. They work super hard everyday and still don't have enough for rent or food. The wage gap in America is so big that the wealthy own houses in Beverly Hills while others can barely afford a condo.

Of course, rent relief needs to come from government payments, and these don't need to be held up any more than the other pandemic relief payments.  Send in your lease and/or eviction notice, and a payment goes to the landlord. Sometimes a landlord with a non-paying tenant does need to resort to eviction to get rent.  Mr. Desmond drowns this simple truth in the ambiguity of ""rent collection rates"" to support a clear falsehood.  Let's help renters, but don't put the onus on landlords.

We need to help renters to keep communities stable and prevent in inadvertent spread of COVID.  The logic place to start is for local, state and federal (if Congress can get it's act together!!) authorities to help.  
I am glad that Mr. Loaiza found another job."
2020-08-29 20:47,"The prospect, Mr. Desmond, of landlords turning out renters and banks foreclosing on homeowners' mortgages plays quite indirectly into the hands of the president. If people are on the streets, or living out of their automobiles, without having what's generally known as ""a fixed abode,"" these individuals and families will lack the requisite papers to stand in line to vote on November 3rd. 

Incidentally, these displaced people will, yes, become the contagion that spreads the coronavirus. Anyone who thinks this is not all part of the administration's plans to disenfranchise and devalue people hasn't been paying attention.

The administration has taken note. After a sluggish response to the pestilence, the president basically marked time. He couldn't accept responsibility for the infections and deaths. It has since become clear that he hoped that the problems would continue in the (blue) states and metropolitan areas where people were far less likely to vote for him. This, be it remembered, was in the late winter and early spring when hospitals and clinic were going overwhelmed with new patients on practically a minute-by-minute basis.

Now that people are put out on the streets, the likelihood is excellent to off-the-charts that they will somehow contract the virus.

But make no mistake; by reducing the probability of so many anti-Trump voters, his evil plan is working."
2020-08-29 21:05,"This is a solvable problem. First, all mortgages for these buildings must be deferred. The mortgages must be paid in full, but the time is extended and say for the next year or six months no mortgage will be paid. True, banks won't earn interest, but they don't need it - they're already getting plenty of help from the government. We have to stop evictions. This is insane to put people out on the streets.

Second, no rent should be paid by the tenants, but taxes, insurance, and any maintenance fees on these buildings should be paid by the tenants, so tenants would pay the salaries of workers who maintain these buildings. This will decrease the total sum paid by tenants substantially, and will allow building owners to not lose money. True, building owners won't earn income, but this is an emergency period.

The argument made by landlords that ""this is our income"" is not valid, because in an emergency time, one should only earn money for work performed and not earn passive income. The problem with government giving money to people to avoid eviction (or give rent directly to landlords) is that we are just making the landlord class richer. 

An analogy with food stamps is incorrect, because farmers actually perform work - they produce food - so when we give food stamps to people this ultimately goes to people (farmers) who perform work."
2020-08-29 21:07,"Once again, like so often is the case, we see the inability of the self-acknowledged ""progressives"" to understand the financial interrelationships of the rental housing market.

Peruse some of the Comments here to see ""tenants"" lauded and ""landlords"" condemned.  Almost intentionally ignoring the fact that most ""landlords"" are also mortgagors.  They do not own their buildings outright.  They are indebted to lenders of various types whether banks or similar debt providers.

And, these lenders too have obligations to depositors or  investors.

Deny the landlord his rent and he defaults on his mortgage.  That default, multiplied many times over, leads then to a banking and financial crisis etc. 

I've been a life-long Democrat who has worked a full career in various areas of finance.  It has always been a conundrum to me how the Left in America always manages to ignore the reality of the system in which it exists.  

In doing so, it ensures that it is always on the outside.  That it never achieves power and it never has much of a voice in how to ""fix"" things that are clearly wrong.

Yes, we need to avoid an eviction crisis during the economic disruption brought upon us by the pandemic.  But we need to do it in a way that doesn't further exacerbate that very disruption.

Bankrupting landlords will not keep people in their homes.  Figuring out a way to provide sufficient cash flow to landlords for them to maintain their properties and service their debt is the wiser way to proceed."

2020-08-29 21:39,"Deferment of mortgages and property taxes on nonpaying residences is reasonable. Evicting someone, collecting 3k, not telling them, and evicting them anyway is bad karma. 

Ironically, after all the mass evictions, they are unlikely to find enough tenants that are able and willing to pay the same rents as those who were evicted. Back in 2010, I negotiated a rent reduction after I saw the place I lived being advertised for less. A similar dynamic is already occurring in the urban centers and is likely to spread anywhere that jobs are being lost or converted to remote work."
2020-08-29 21:40,"I moved house in 2009 right as that recession really set in. Unable to sell my previous home, I finally rented it out. Half the year’s rent was needed to cover taxes and insurance. The other half was “income”, though in a couple years maintenance costs ate most of the profits. In some years, I absorbed the losses since I was still working and my tenants have few choices. 

The taxes doubled the last couple years and I was forced to raise the rent last year. I am now retired and cannot operate it as a charity. With the coming of the virus, my tenants now pay less than half the rent. The loss of income hurts. I am not hungry today, but my future independence is at risk. 

There are many landlords like myself... ordinary people trying to live simply, and who may/may not have a little savings laid by. I don’t have access to any of the relief programs. I’m just holding my breath waiting for a recovery.

Before labeling all landowners as profiteers, we could be thankful that some people are willing to supply housing to the majority of families living outside the luxury home market rather than simply placing all their capital in the stock market, etc. I personally would love to see new moderately priced homes built. I don’t know how to enable that as the price of entry has skyrocketed.

Until then, congress cannot serve as the means by which citizens express their preferences for how they want the country to work.  In addition, they can't express those preferences when they are repeatedly confused by the alternate reality created by conservative media.

1.  Reinstate fairness doctrine.
2.  Constitutional amendment to make money not equal to speech, to remove money from elections.
3.  Voting rights.
4.  Elimination of district drawing by politicians.
5.  Improved voter registration, extended voting, public commitment across all political parties to increase access to the vote.

Unfortunately, with FOX and congress beholden to rich donors, none of these can happen.  The country is going to fail because 9 billion, instead of 10, was just not enough for some people."
2020-08-29 22:19,"From a market perspective, it makes perfect sense for evicted families to live in their cars in front of their houses which have been boarded up until the rental market recovers.  Many evictions produce many vacancies and rents that fall until they cannot cover landlord expenses.  At that point, landlords cut their expenses and the carrying cost of their investments by taking their rental units off the market; tax laws often encourage this.

From a human perspective, this makes no sense.  But markets are ahuman.  

In these emergency situations, we should begin by figuring out what we want to happen to the society or neighborhood, and then see to what extent we can get it to happen.  Market thinking in these emergency situations works very differently, focusing on how each player can stick the losses from the emergency on someone else."

This wait-and-see approach is not only cruel; it’s penny-wise and pound-foolish.”

For anyone confused and still thinking there’s equal blame between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, stop and think about what’s happened here.  

The main take away for voters this November is the Democratic House acted in good faith over three months ago and passed the Heroes Act to prevent this eviction mess and other problems facing the country from the economic crisis.  Republicans in the Senate and White House blocked this.  Democrats recently attempted to compromise with Republicans and offered to meet them halfway but were rebuffed and now the GOP pretends as if there is no crisis at all.  If you’re extremely wealthy, they’ll pass a tax break for you.  If millions are about to become homeless?  Good luck.

The House has passed hundreds of bills addressing many other problems the vast majority of Americans want government to tackle.  Yet, Mitch McConnell and the GOP controlled Senate similarly block these bills.

So if you’re sincerely looking for real solutions to problems, then there is only one party attempting to govern on behalf of all Americans."

How many such stories must we read before finally realizing that ""American exceptionalism"" is fast becoming little more than a fever dream for many of us? 

I wonder how many Westerners have ever heard of Mohamed Bouazizi. Mr. Bouazizi immolated himself in 2010 on the streets of Tunisia, an act of futile despair that soon toppled the Tunisian government and brought forth the Arab Spring. We heralded that as a triumph of democracy, a blow against authoritarian rule abroad, all while sliding inexorably toward authoritarianism here at home. 

Must desperate Americans begin setting themselves on fire on the steps of Congress and the Supreme Court, or on courthouse steps and city squares across the land, before we recognize how corrosive this continuing pell-mell concentration of wealth into the hands of the 1% has become, or how dangerous Trump's deranged dreams of becoming President-for-Life are to democracy and freedom in America?"

By the way, their landlord should be sued for theft or fraud for directly receiving the $3000 and never telling them.

Additionally, in some states it is very difficult to evict non paying tenants quickly.  In CT in normal times it can take 6 months or more to evict and during that time unscrupulous tenants view that as a period of free rent before a Marshall can legally force a tenant to vacate. With covid the eviction process will take much longer.  This risk is normally accepted by the landlord but if the risk becomes some magnitude of the norm it needs to be socialized to stabilize the rental markets."

Fine if it is covering some rental expenses, but on the whole this way of thinking is both horrifying and tragic. Why are renters responsible for covering their own AND another person's (their landlord's) living costs? The renter who goes to work (and risks their life as this story illustrates) is supposed to pay the living costs of the person staying home collecting rent? Please don't tell me it is because the landlord is old and needs the money etc. If that's the case, then sell the property.

In CA they allow (even encourage!) corporations to buy up housing and then jack the rents up. Doing that is illegal in Tennessee, for example, where housing is affordable and the middle class still exists. In blue states like CA the government is determined to destroy the middle class.

There's downline entities that depend on that rent check.  To expect the landlord to shoulder that burden is ridiculous.

It is unfortunate when people can't pay their rents for any reason but the survival of the institution of rental housing depends on everyone involved doing his part.  That means the tenant has to pay. He's using the space - why should he not be expected to pay for it?  And if he's not paying for it, why should he be allowed to use it?

Have you ever heard of property taxes?
 Your theories are misleading and promote a skewed narrative that is divisive and only adds to a misplaced anger in the youth of our society. You suggest everything can just be paid for and a clean slate magically appears. Money doesn't work that way, eventually someone has to pay for things. For example if one promotes a lie of Google not paying taxes to stir up anger, well, you are contributing to a falsehood. Force corporations to be taxed higher and forget about their willingness to enact training and education programs within their companies. That leads to less diversity and fewer opportunities.

Meanwhile landlords have tried styling evictions as “breach of contract” matters, requesting preliminary injunctions rather than writs. Northwest Justice and the private bar are doing our level best to inform the bench of this subterfuge. 

Inslee also carved out two exceptions: if the landlord issues a 60-day notice of intent to move into the rental property, or a 60-day notice the landlord is selling the property. In either case the landlord can proceed. 

And yet, I heard from a single mother with four children whose landlord delivered a notice to pay or vacate late Friday. Her stress levels were through the roof.

Lesson: moratoriums on eviction need to be carefully worded, with exemptions for small landlords, and cases where evidence could be presented to a judge that tenants clearly will not be out on the streets, would be arguable.  This is our case.  My mother is in a retirement home.  Her major asset is a home rented to a tenant who has more money than we do, and only keeps the home because it is a convenient place to do heroin.  If we cannot evict him, my mother's fondest hope, to leave something modest to her four grandchildren, will be dashed.  Eviction moratorium for those truly affected by the Coronavirus, yes, but it is the job of legislators not to write lazy laws.  It would be easy to make the difference.

We're not tearing ourselves apart, we want this over, but it won't be unless all of us do what's sensible and beat this virus. It isn't creeping socialism, it isn't backdoor communism - it's just sensible. To date Australia's death toll is 600, and mostly in the deregulated, for-prifit aged care homes.

Renter facing eviction makes an offer of what they could pay for rent ( if anything). Again, before any eviction is signed off on.  3. The amount is given as an option to the landlord who has 14 days to respond. Failure to repsond means no eviction is allowed. 4. If Landlord does not accept the proposed new offer, then tenant is matched to a data base of available rentals and offered three alternatives. 5. If none, governmental assistance DOES provide financial assistance to the lowest priced available rental within 50 miles ( or some distance) that can house the number of occupants safely.

There isn’t an eviction crisis.  There is an affordable housing crisis.  In his book, Mr. Desmond argues for more federal funds for affordable housing.  It’s true, we need more affordable housing.  But an eviction moratorium is not the answer.

I am intimately involved in the rental housing industry in Michigan.  Most tenants have paid their rent.  Those who have not have refused to pay because they believe they don’t have to because there was a moratorium in place.  Now that it has lifted, we are going back to court to find out why.  So far, no one has had an excuse other than their refusal to pay.

For now, Congress should make sure unemployed people can pay their bills, including rent.  A moratorium just punishes landlords who haven’t done anything wrong but provide housing to people who agreed to pay for it.  It’s also unconstitutional.  Since when can Congress just take private property without compensation?  The answer is they can’t.

And what we are seeing is people taking advantage and spending money on consumer goods rather than rent.

Pay your bills.  Help the people with unemployment compensation who need it.  Let the court system work and follow the law.

This is nothing more than using the pandemic to scare people into a radical change in policy.

Don’t fall for it."
2020-08-30 4:05,"There are people who earn just enough money to get by.  We do have a robust safety net.  Let's say that the family in the article was earning $30k per year and paying $18k for rent.  They were also getting $9k per year in food stamps, free school lunches and WIC for the three year old.  So they were managing.

 When they filed their income tax in Feb 2020, they got a refund of $12k of taxes never paid for the EITC and child credit. And Medicaid for the family, even in stingy Texas. The federal government added a pandemic $3500 for two adults and three children and the father was entitled to a bonus $600/week in unemployment benefits over his unemployment, even if he was mostly self employed during the off season.  The federal pandemic payment was expected to cover shortfalls.  Many states had unusual delays in processing unemployment, but the federal government tried to get the pandemic payments out quickly.  So it's odd that the family only had enough saved to cover one month's rent.

Did the reporter ask what they did with the $12k tax refund and $3.5k pandemic payment?"
2020-08-30 4:29,"It is no surprise that someone who is director of the ""Eviction Lab"" knows nothing about eviction and rentals.  To begin, the landlord has no responsibility to the tenant other than provide good condition housing in exchange for RENT PAYMENT.  That is what the rental agreement is all about.  If the tenant can not commit to that obligation, he/she should find new housing voluntarily.  There are multiple levels of safety nets that include Section 8, food stamps, welfare, medicaid, earned income tax credit, and now also renters assistance that the tenant can use to cover shortfalls in their income, but the tenant has to take responsibility for their problems and not pass their problem to the landlord.   This author is also writing this editorial as if all landlords are trying to defraud a poor renter.  If this person's landlord actually did try to defraud, it is a very rare example.  The alternative is for the government to directly provide housing for the poor, but we all know how those turn out in the government housing projects.  The focus should be on reality, not fluff and hot air."

2020-08-30 5:19,"Mr. Desmond is unfortunately, mistaken.  Owners of rental properties are not the government, they are just private citizens.  When a tenant does not pay rent for a month, no one should expect the landlord to subsidize the renter.  That is the responsibility of the government.
In Buffalo, which was the second poorest City in the United States 15 years ago, has had a nice renaissance.  Landlords, mostly small businessmen and women, invested in a dilapidated housing stock from the early 20th Century, and brought the buildings back to life. Now, with a moratorium on evictions, tenants are choosing not to pay rent, saving up their money for the next rental property.  It has brought the economic revival of Buffalo to a halt.  
Mr. Desmond is correct that government support is needed. Society cannot ask the owners of rental properties to run a public assistance program for the poor.   Do no confuse landlords with the government.  Landlords need to be paid.  Failure to pay rent is theft of the landlord's property."

The author's statement above is disingenuous in that it only considers the potential for eviction to be a method of motivating payment from a delinquent tenant.  However, states that bar eviction via moratoriums are depriving landlords of the opportunity to find an alternate renter.

While I agree the current crisis is horrible, the author could at least be truthful in analyzing why landlords resort to eviction: it's not simply to motivate the renter to pay (many can't, and landlords know that; hence, they want their property vacated and available for a replacement tenant).

The Senate might well have adopted a bill with substantial rent relief had the Democrats not loaded the bill with pork for their pet constituencies."

2020-08-30 7:00,"For those who support these eviction-moratoriums I would ask this... Are you personally willing or able to provide another family with rent money every month? The answer is likely no. Perhaps you'd love to, but you just can't afford to pay another family's rent? Then don't ask landlords to do what you are not willing or able to do. Largely, they are not able to provide free housing either. 

Landlords are often just middle-class folks who can scrape together enough for a down payment on a rental property. Most started with just one property, often a ""fixer"" requiring long hours, hard work, and diligent penny-pinching. 

When operating costs increase, businesses are forced to pass those costs to consumers via higher prices. It is no different with landlords. They'll need to figure out a way to recoup their losses, and guard against future losses. Probably by charging higher rents, higher deposits, and imposing stricter income/employment requirements. 

As usual, the government's clumsy interference will probably reduce the housing available to the very people it is trying to help."

Unfortunately, due to a multiplicity of reasons,  it has not been controlled in the US.  The US is still having more than 1000 Covid 19 deaths per day.  With Winter soon coming, one might expect the death rate to soon get worse.

The scope of the societal destruction that is occurring in the US by Covid 19 will change many aspects of how we live including, I believe, our basic capitalistic economic system.  It is very possible in my opinion that very soon renters and home mortgage owners may start to refuse to become evicted utilizing means other than legal to prevent their evictions.   There will be a call by the financially affluent for a more centralized authoritarian government to restore order and protect the economic system.  The less financially affluent and more financially threatened will resist this call.  We are seeing this being played out already in our upcoming Presidential election.

Those debt collectors can in some circumstance push the property into foreclosure to collect on that debt. Government is preventing you from collecting rent and evicting nonpaying tenants, but is simultaneously bleeding the property owner dry,

While they clearly need to provide housing assistance to the poor, they need to start allowing evictions. Housing courts have been closed for over 6 months.

The average profit on investment is less than 10%.  In my area rents are typically less than $1,000 a month.  $1400 for a fully furnished unit, including cable wifi and heat. A ruined carpet can take a year's investment.  Many small landlords have mortgages that they struggle to meet and the landlords are now being called on to be the local housing charity.  

Fact is the answer is supporting better wages, more job security, less greed on the upper end--and I don't mean the landlord, I'm talking about the mega-rich with multiple homes and $1,000 dining bills who can't imagine life on $2,000  a month.

Whenever this happens the only institution that can correct the problems is the federal government, because state governments do not have the authority to print money. 

Balancing budgets did not save the economy in the Great Depression.  It only led to more layoffs and more evictions and bankruptcies as the government laid off workers.   So Roosevelt tried a different approach and increased taxes 
and the budget dramatically:

1932 - only $6 billion budget - unbalanced. 
1939 - 50% increase to $9 billion budget and very unbalanced
1945 - over a 1000% increase to $92 billion budget and even more unbalanced.  

At the end of WWII, Truman decreased military spending,  but replaced those jobs with jobs in education (GI Bill) and later Eisenhower built the interstate highway system.  As the government grows, the private sector recovers.  Truman then achieved balanced budgets in 1947, 1948, and 1951.   Eisenhower in 1957.

Tax cuts stimulates the stock market, but stock inflation is not job creation.

2020-08-30 12:02,"While the landlord's problems might appear to be solved by eviction, they are not.  In the time of COVID-19 with a 10% unemployment rate, there is no great sea of new potential renters to draw upon.  So a rental unit with a tenant at least temporarily not paying rent (and who might repay his debt in future with a higher minimum wage and less income inequality) is replaced with a vacant unit also earning nothing.

A full accounting also pushes many newly evicted and newly infected tenants into another great economic sink in America, our health care ""system"".  ""Rent"" for a hospital bed can easily reach tens of thousands of dollars a month--and that's just for one person, not the entire family unit.

And the cascade continues as hospital seek payment from impoverished patients through Medicaid, pushing their states' budgets further into the red.

When work is lost, families are blown to smithereens, health groans under a pandemic and states are left with laying off more of their workers to stay afloat, having an absent Congress (read: Senate) and a rudderless executive cannot right the ship.

The former represents a fairweather fantasy that is easily challenged by the biological propensity for human organisms to fall prey to microscopic viral communists who greatly level the distinction between richer and poorer.

As a former landlord myself, I realise the pitfalls  of being both a lender and a borrower, in direct contradiction of Shakespearean advice. I understand the requisite need for renters to pay the appropriate amount of rent at the appropriate moment in order to fulfil my financial obligations to my creditors. However, I also comprehend that bad things happen to good people and that, at times, latitude must be granted. It’s a mutual trust situation.

Ideally, in decadent, western capitalism, there are societal elements that transcend ideology. No one should be homeless, poverty stricken, cold, or hungry. If we could deal with these burdens collectively, property crunches are much easier to negotiate. The problem is that wages and working conditions, generally speaking, are kept depressingly low so that, in a crash, there is little hope of a quick recovery while fat felines profiteer - including landlords.

There is no justification for allowing eviction notices which intentionally give the tenant the false impression that the tenant must vacate in a few days and that the situation is hopeless.

This, uttered from a guy who paid about $30,000 cash for the house, drives a BMW, and talks about spending most summer weekends on his boat.

I have no issue with what he can do with his multiple properties or how he lives his life; he is certainly entitled to do as he wishes. His ""poor me"" act and playing me for a fool stuck in my craw.

We are fortunate--we bought a house (mortgage far less than rent, as is the case in this city). And we are doubly fortunate, because when this guy texted me to say that not only was he keeping our $1100 security deposit for a list of purported expenses for which he provided no receipts upon request, he claimed we OWED him an additional $550, and I could just Venmo him the money.

And when unemployment is running at 10% or higher (and because of the myopic way we count the unemployed, you can be sure it is FAR higher).

There are many mom and pop owned rentals that can’t afford late rent collection. But that just tells us that too many are struggling to find other sources of income to supplement low wages or insecure jobs.  They don’t all make a lot on their rent but instead, hope that when they sell, the real estate value of their property will have increased.

I understand that the pandemic has thrown the economy into chaos, and the last thing this country needs is more homeless people.  But as the article makes clear, missing rent entirely for two months can easily result in eviction.  And if the landlord is dependent on the rental income for the mortgage payment, then the landlord has only one moth after that to get someone else in before the bank starts foreclosing on the property.  The bad (or good, depending on you POV) news is the pandemic is creating an opportunity for banks and investors to grab up a lot of property very cheaply to re-sell later at huge profits when things get back to normal.  Trump boasted of his intelligence in pursuing this strategy during the 2008 crash.  They’ll be grabbing them up like toilet paper.  
There needs to be some involvement with mortgage holders of rental properties to mitigate the risks to landlords so they can hold on to the properties without rent, or at lower rental rates, until the crisis is over.

If you think landlords should rent out their houses whether or not a tenant pays their rent, then maybe you should buy houses and let others live in them for free. Because that’s what you’re essentially asking landlords to do when tenants don’t pay."

The thing I can't forget is sitting on the side of a dusty Montana road as a cold November evening came on, an overstuffed suitcase on my right and a box of crummy kitchen implements on my left, and saying to my dog, ""Well, boy, where do we go from here?"" 

But what must be underscored here is that my experience of nearly forty years ago seems utterly trivial in the face of the terror and dread and emptiness Jhon Loaiza must have felt when he and his wife and daughters were evicted from their home.

It's a shame this sort of thing has to happen in America, the wealthiest country on earth BY FAR.  The all-encompassing tragedy of eviction should make all of us who still have a roof over our heads understand -- and I mean really understand -- what it means to walk a mile in another's shoes.

My husband (who is deceased) and I bought these houses over 30 years ago and we never evicted anyone, never came close. We managed to pay off the mortgages over the years, so 'mortgage forgiveness' will not be helpful.  Without the income from rent, it would become impossible for me to pay the maintenance, insurance, and property taxes.

Being a landlord does not make me the tenant's parent -- there is no reason why I should add them to my list of dependents. Here in Austria, people who have lost their jobs have received government assistance, and most can still pay their rent, thanks to EVERYONE (renters and landlords) paying higher taxes.  That's the way it should be."
2020-08-30 14:17,"This story provides us with a classic example of why we Americans must balance our punitive form of capitalism with progressive economic reforms focused on permanently eradicating the impoverishment that Americans in the middle and lower working classes routinely experience through no fault of their own. A recurring basic income would help the family in this story immensely. America must pursue a recurring basic income, living wages across the economy, affordable public college, loan forgiveness programs for graduates who choose low-paying private sector or public sector careers, and child care aid to allow parents to work hard without worry, among other reforms, if our country is ever going to live up to its reputation."

And I still have to pay for the utilities and taxes so it costs me to support her. How is this fair?"
2020-08-30 14:23,"This article presupposes that all landlords are corporations or fat cats. Many landlords are middle class people who have a mortgage on their rental property and need rent to pay that mortgage. Smaller landlords tend to take chances on renting to folks who don't have three months rent to put into a security deposit, let their tenets have pets without 'pet rent' and are more flexible with terms of the lease. To punish those smaller landlords will lead to more evictions, as the small landlords stop paying the mortgage and then the bank take the house and evicts the tenets. This writer does not seem to understand this, which is amazing since he wrote a book on rentals."

But with millions of people unemployed, there aren’t lots of other great tenants waiting around. With a federal government committed to inaction, the situation is unlikely to improve soon. If the problem is with banks holding mortgages on landlords, they need to understand this too. Avoiding evictions is better for everyone."

2020-08-30 15:00,"As a previous small-time landlord with two units, the rent went up every year because property taxes, insurance, and water went up annually. If our tenants hadn't paid, we would have sold immediately. 

It's actually very hard to make money as a landlord; even though we liked our tenants, we eventually did sell because the stock market offered better returns with no headaches or lawsuits. In some cities, like San Francisco and New York, apartments sit empty because it's cheaper for the owner than having a below-market tenant. 

The solution, if we want to avoid evictions, is for the government to offer to pay rent (essentially Section 8) directly to the landlord, or for the government to house people directly, not depend on a landlord (who will eventually have to sell if they can't make money) to subsidize tenants."

The problem is that these are not lessons that can be learned in school.  Hard and bitter experience is the only teacher.  It was so during the Great Depression, for those who lived and suffered through it.  They learned the value of work, whether they liked it or not, whether it was convenient or not and the only question was could they get it.  They learned the value of saving for emergencies, even if it was only a few cents per week.  They also learned to prioritize their expenses: rent, food and then everything else.  The generation that lived through the Depression and their children learned these lessons the hard way and prospered later because of them.  The sooner those lessons are learned now, the better off we all will be."
2020-08-30 15:24,"We are landlords, it is the source of income for our family.  We employ six people to manage and maintain our homes.  From the start of the pandemic we offered to work out payment plans with any tenant who could show us that their income had been substantially affected by the pandemic.  Generally, it has worked successfully for our tenants and us.  But, there are some who chose to abuse the moratorium.  Their income continued, but, their payments stopped and there was nothing we could do about it.  They didn't even respond to our communications.  we are not, effective tomorrow, allowed to evict and we will.   We are not evicting anyone who is doing their best to pay a reasonable portion of the rent.  As to the others, and I say this clearly, their eviction was their choice not mine.  Blanket eviction moratoriums are bad for everyone.  We, our employees, other tenants who are trying to pay fairly all are hurt.   Any restriction on evictions should be in the court where evidence can be heard as to whether the tenant is able to make payments.  Even so the losses suffered by landlords ought to be shared across society until the supermarkets start giving away free food."

The writer appears to fundamentally misunderstand what America is. Most other developed nations find those things priorities. America, under Republican leadership in particular, simply does not. Millions of Americans facing eviction, in large part due to vast government mismanagement of the pandemic, is the evictees' problem. As is the resultant upheaval, mental and physical health crises and lack of medical coverage. The mentality is - If you choose to be poor, you must suffer the consequences. It's as cold as 180,000 dead bodies, but it's the American way."

However, I also had tenants who lied on the application about their financial ability to pay rent, tenants who used the backyard as a dumping ground for construction debris, tenants who stole fixtures.  I have had to use Small Claims Court to seek rent from irresponsible tenants and I have been threatened with a baseless lawsuit from someone who saw an opportunity to make some money.  (It went nowhere).

Through all of this I had to meet my financial obligations: mortgage, utilities, insurance, maintenance of the property, checking out applicant credentials while staying in compliance with local laws.  I ended my landlord career some years ago.  That said, I find myself ambivalent about what I might do in today's circumstances when responsible tenants may find themselves in arrears due to situations beyond their control."
2020-08-30 15:35,"I lived in Africa. And I've lived in the US. So I think the US housing market is a racket. In Africa virtually everyone had a house, however so humble, in good times and in bad. In the US it is pushed that you either need to buy what is usually quite an expensive house, or rent a quite expensive apartment. It's nonsense. No one should have to spend 30 years paying for a house. No one should have to pay a third or more of their income on an apartment, indefinitely. It's just a roof and four walls, after all. There is so much more to life than paying for that. Should living spaces be nice, and safe? Sure. Are African countries paradise? No, though they can be very nice. But in the US housing is too expensive. Paying for it is too stressful. The US needs to re-prioritize housing in a big way. We need alternatives to having so much of our citizens' wealth extracted every month to stay in housing, or else be homeless."

Today it was announced that there will be no evictions for nonpayment of rent until after March 31 2021.  There is no moratorium on foreclosure for not making a payment.

Dear media, stop Trump hating and start loving your fellow Americans, they need you help, please be their guiding light.

Many/most landlords of lower to mid-range rental properties are sole proprietors with significant mortgages. In the case presented it sounds like the landlord was less than honest. But don’t paint all landlords with the same broad brush. 

In many cases these sole proprietor landlords are up against large monthly mortgage payments. Miss a few and foreclosure is launched by the bank. As a result, the landlord is forced to look for tenants who can pay ... most don’t have the financial ability to carry non-paying tenants for more than a month or two.

2020-08-30 15:48,"There would be a lot more sympathy for landlords if they hadn't been so exploitative, especially over the past decade. For most landlords in Greater Boston, what they command in rent far exceeds what their mortgage bills are, if they still have a mortgage. Like Desmond said, landlords continue to squeeze more and more money from their tenants simply because they can, and not because their mortgage payments are increasing or because property taxes are rising. 

I know of many situations in Greater Boston in which landlords live entirely off one or two rental units. That means that the rent a tenant pays not only pays to house both their family and the landlord's, but also pays all the property taxes, and provides the landlord with money for his or her other needs. For most landlords, it's not enough that tenants are buying their house for them; these landlords want to extract as much wealth as they can from their tenants."

Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. was murdered in Memphis on April 4, 1968 and Black African American men, women and children erupted in urban righteous revolutionary rage.  President Johnson signed the proposed housing legislation into law on April 11, 1968.

Every piece of federal civil rights legislation that became law in the 1960's Civil Rights era was paid for primarily by the activist action blood, sweat and tears of Black African American men, women and children.

 While every American man, woman and child who didn't share their color aka race, ethnic, sectarian and national origin disproportionately benefited and profited. 

Yet no Black human life matters as much as any and all white human lives in America in 2020.

Pro-tip: If you want to make money, maybe you should earn it honestly.  Instead, you're buying houses from predatory developers who flip homes and make neighborhoods unaffordable, and then you're charging far in excess of a normal rent structure because you want to get rich.  

I have lived in the same rental home for several years.  I've sunk thousands of dollars into repairs and renovations to make the place more liveable.  My landlord recognizes this and has never raised the rent.  But I still pay for two bathrooms and only have access to one, thanks to major errors in plumbing done long before I moved in.

The checks require co-signatures of both tenant and landlord - preventing either party from stealing the money --

On the benefit check - there is a line clearly marked for the tenant's signature - as well as for that of the landlord -

All the banks here are well aware of this system - and no bank will negotiate a check without the proper signatures - and any attempt to do so will be viewed as an act of fraud -

It's the tenant - not the landlord - for whom the emergency rent benefits are designed - in an effort to help them stay in their home -- and any municipality which sends the funds directly to the landlord - without even informing the tenant that the payment has been sent, is guilty - at least on the surface - of being complicit in a fraudulent scheme ..."
2020-08-30 3:16,"We landlords in Milwaukee  fully agree with Matthew Desmond’s conclusion that ""rent relief” is the solution. And it needs to come from the federal government. (Though not with a blanket 12-month eviction moratorium applicable to all 34 million renters countrywide, regardless of hardship).

So why does Desmond hurt his credibility by ignoring the fact that eviction filings are DOWN year-over-year in many jurisdictions?

He cherry picks one week in July for Milwaukee, claiming they were up 109% (likely due to filings in that particular week by our largest landlord with 8,000 units).

Our Wicourts website is easy to search. It shows 1251 Milwaukee filings in the first 20 business days of August 2020 but only 743 for the same time period of 2019. That’s 41% LESS despite the pandemic.

 So what does that tell you? It shows landlords are being forbearing and cooperative as they wait for their tenants to get their UC or CARES Act benefits.

Those of you who have read Desmond’s book EVICTED will remember his portrayal of the inner city landlord “Sherrena” who supposedly was clearing $10k a month renting to low income tenants. Soon after Desmond left Milwaukee in 2009 she lost all her properties to tax or mortgage foreclosures. Desmond didn’t mention that when his book was published in 2016. 

Landlords in Milwaukee are actively moving non-payment cases to mediation in cooperation with local tenant advocates. Keeping the lawyers (for either side) out of it is the best solution."

Life in the US has been getting harder for the poor.  Homeless camps like those I see didn't exist a couple of decades ago.

Now COVID-19 has caused unemployment to lurch upward and there is no guarantee that jobs will return as COVID-19 is ultimately vanquished.

Some industries (e.g. airlines and travel) may be permanently smaller.

What causes the homelessness?

Perhaps overpopulation.

Republicans tend to deny global warming, which is a consequence of too much population growth.

Democrats on the other hand seem to deny the finiteness of resources, which ultimately leads to poverty and homelessness in the face of too much population growth.

The mechanism is simple.  As the population increases, the value of unskilled or semi-skilled labor goes down.  There are too many workers.  So wages fall.

Since the Immigration and Reform Bill of 1986, population in the US has gone up by about 87 million, an increase of about 36%.

It made sense to welcome immigrants in the 19th century when population density was low and there was a vast frontier in the West.

Now Democrats seem to insist that it is ""racist"" to even discuss the limits to growth.

We need smaller families and less immigration."

2020-08-30 16:09,"Think tiny home. It is better to own a house than to rent. Many people build their own tiny homes. If you can find some compatible people and form a group, y'all could, perhaps buy a bit of land, subdivide it legally, and make your own neighborhood. If you wanted or needed to move to another area, that little lot of land would still be yours unless you sold it to neighborhood. You could just load up your home and move. 

This is not a solution for now, I understand. But it could be the solution for the future. As long as the maintenance is kept up on a tiny home it should last just as long as any other modern construction. 

You could also move up and out if you want. When we moved to France, we lived in a t2 apartment that cost 750 euros per month and that didn't include any thing else. It was a total size of 2 of 35 square meters which is 376 square feet. We were able to get it so cheap because one end of the apartment was over the underground parking entry/exit and the other end was next to the neighborhoods dog's potty area (cleaned once every two weeks). That was 20 years ago. If we had to move again, I would insist on us building a tiny house or living in a tent. All that money you are throwing away on renting could buy you a decent tiny house. Maybe that will be all you need?

In 2002, my ability to stretch $$ ran out.  I saw a tenants rights lawyer (highly recommend!) so I could stall my landlord  for 4 months.

I'd been in my apartment (6 unit rowhouse) 12 years. My landlord had called me the perfect tenant but he was in danger of losing the building without my rent. We were both between a rock & a hard place.

I lost everything & bounced around D.C. homeless shelters 8 months because my Social Security Disability claim got lost.

I'd had a job I & was in grad school at Johns Hopkins - I had to quit 2 courses from finishing.

The homeless shelter was a nightmare- the staff was dangerous. My fellow residents were good people.  I was a rare exception: a white person w/a college degree. I learned a lot about my prior privilege living w/ those folks. 

I told my friends this happened to me because God wanted me to learn something about myself I didn't know.

What eventually saved me: Obamacare.  And Barack's Obama's policies for discharging student loans if you became disabled.

I still thank Barack Obama every day for the good life I was able to rebuild.

Mr. Desmond, this is a disappointment to say the least.  You study this full time and the best you can come up with is a vague plea to Congress to throw money at the problem.  One could perhaps design a model where rent collection is temporally prorated downward and the bank then follows up with a temporary downward proration.  The program could be certified by a non-profit funded by the banks.  They would actually save money because eviction bears a cost to the landlord and foreclosure bears a cost to the bank.

I have a question: what if the rental income from the house or apartment is the only source of income for a retired person and it would be very hard without this income?

Eviction is not the answer, but squeezing the landlord who depends on the income is robbing Peter to pay Paul.

America is not the land of milk and honey, nor of hope and glory, at least not under #45, but it doesn't have to be this hard either."

They are middle-income, and they both work full time jobs to support their family.  About 10 years ago, they bought a three flat in Chicago.  They have spent whatever spare time they have outside of their jobs to maintain the property and make it a clean, affordable, and healthy place for their tenants to live. The Garcias live in the first floor unit, and rent out the second and third floors. More than half the rental income goes towards their monthly mortgage payment.  The rest goes to other expenses. In February, 2020, their 2nd floor tenants, the Smiths, did not pay their rent.  The Garcias gave them another month to catch up, but no rent came in.  Then the  CARES Act prohibited them from serving an eviction notice until after July 25.   The Garcias pleaded with the Smiths to pay something, but they refused. In April, the Smiths told the Garcias, “just try to take us to court!  It’s closed!”   The CARES Act also says the Garcias cannot file their case until the end of August.  Even after they file, if it is uncontested, it will take 1-2 months to get an eviction order entered. Because there is now a 6 month backlog of eviction orders to be enforced, the Smiths will be able to live there rent-free until spring.  Meanwhile, the bank will foreclose on the property, the Garcias will be ruined, and the bank will then evict the Smiths anyway."

Never underestimate Trump advisers' diabolical IQ, nor Trump's intuitive grasp of the usefulness of evil.

Trump & Republicans can't stop Covid-19 from killing the economy. So, they'll use it to massively suppress the Dem vote. Covid-19 demographics show it will kill, hospitalize, disable, and terrorize many more likely Dem voters into not voting. Trump's early school opening gamble aims to spread Covid-19 more rapidly like the open-up-now-'liberation' Twitter campaign and the 'anti-mask' culture-war have. The P.O. disruption will limit mail-in voting enhancing the Covid-19 voter suppression terror campaign.

Eviction moratoriums are expiring. More likely Dem voters will lose federal unemployment supplements blocked by GOP senate. Others may lose their state unemployment payouts thru various disruptions. The Covid-19 economic dislocation can then cause many more evictions. More likely Dem voters will lose a valid voting address. Many will miss re-registration dead-lines with new addresses.

Desperate people take desperate chances. This seemingly irrational pattern of GOP actions and inaction that hurts the economy could be desperately RATIONAL.

Eviction is just another means of suppressing the vote."

What happened however, during the last economic calamity,  was Congress never could figure out what it’s priorities were expect ensuring that executives got their take. Everything was crashing a burning.  So now here we are in a very predictable situation again with housing.  

On the ground here’s what ends up happening.  When single family homes get bought in historically owner occupied neighborhoods, the whole fabric of the neighbor changes.  We have a housed owned by American missionaries in Africa who now rent to Argentine refugees who then illegally sublet rooms in their house to other immigrant Spanish all working gig jobs to wire money back home. We have a house bought as a foreclosure that a young America couple use to live in and is now owned by a Middle Eastern group of investors who have have stalled on completely gutting it. Yeah globalization!!!!

No one in this entire equation cares about the house, the neighborhood, the community at large.  Not the property owner, the property management company, the tenant.

These are basic life skills that we are not teaching in schools. 

We need to teach kids what equity is. We need to teach them why renting will never build equity. We need to teach them that equity is freedom. And to strive for home ownership over renting. 

And THEN, we need to make it easier for people who have learned these basics to become home owners. So much of the problem is that people are dealing with landlords who simply don’t care. They don’t view the renters as equals because they don’t own property. 

Jefferson’s earliest draft of the Declaration of Independence read: “life, liberty, and property.” He understood that property ownership was the key to living free... that property ownership was essentially the same thing as the pursuit of happiness. 

Money-hungry landlords (like Trump) have corrupted this country, but we do not have to settle for scraps. We can teach our kids how to become home owners and how to live well in this Republic.

Mr. Loaiza's landlord had 90% or more of the rent money- but he threw the family out anyway and regularly pressured them to pay up-- with threatening calls and court documents. These were not all cold, calculated economic measures taken to maximize profit. As some commentators have noted already, the landlord might end up with an empty property-- 

In America--it has become clear: there exists a good number of sociopaths in the population. The poor sociopaths rape, riot, rob and murder... the rich sociopaths find ways of humiliating and belittling employees and tenants-- (and other financial underlings).

What a cruel person. It's easy to be a fair landlord.  I never raise the rent until the apartments change hands.  I have good relationships with all my tenants, and make allowances for late rents, even though by Texas law you can evict someone in days.  I will forgive rents if necessary in the coming months.  I don't need the money enough to live with the guilt of greed. More importantly, I will never move back to Texas."

2020-08-30 17:01,"This is probably the best, most empathic description I have read of what it’s like to be a renter in America. The bills that go up and up and up as the property deteriorates. The insecurity. The arbitrariness. They paychecks already gone to rent before another dime is spent. The deep despair that comes with the threat of losing your home - the one safe space you can retreat to at the end of the day. The utter exhaustion of having to move and reset everything back to square one - new furnishings, new neighbors, new schools, savings drained to nothing.... The threat that is always hanging over your head. 

People in better circumstances imagine this kind of stress belongs only to the most marginal people - drug addicts, deadbeats, people who can’t hold down a job. But it’s the everyday reality for regular, hard-working, bill paying people. It takes one short-term job loss, or medical debt (the collectors go after your paycheck directly), or the landlord suddenly jacks the rent up by more than you make in a month, or they are going to “renovate” your place... You don’t know it, if you have not lived it. 

Well, income inequality keeps going as it has, and everyone will know this, sooner or later."

2. Renters are evicted.

3. Property owners cannot pay their mortgages as the renters are gone and there are few new renters who can afford rent.

4. Property owners are foreclosed. 

5. Lenders take the properties and then try to rapidly sell them to reduce their loses.

6. Hedge funds and others will buy the properties at a discount from their initial value, rent them out for lower rents in order to fill them, and make profits.

7. Evicted renters can move back into their former rentals, paying rent to the new owners. 

8. The previous owners and mortgage holders will have tax credits to apply.

As far as rentals go as a past mayoral candidate in New York City said “ the rent is too damn high.” Add the fact of low wages and an expensive health care system to the problem.

Make no mistake. They have found a new revenue stream that has paid off well since 08. They are looking at this new fresh hell as an investment opportunity to grab a larger chunk of the housing stock that generations of you Americans sunk your equity in.

The billionaire oligarchs who control our politicians are giddy with the increased profits they're raking in, meanwhile reducing their expenses for wages and jobs. And they can get rid of lower paying renters and mortgagees, and fill those dwellings with higher income people. Ain't capitalism grand?

While so many Trump and Republican voters continue to reward these vultures by electing them to office, they swallow up the lies told them that this is the ""Amurcan way of life"". In return for cheap goods at Wal-Mart and Dollar General, and $5.00 'Value meals"" at the fast food places, they're literally ""fat, dumb, and happy"".

And they are dumb. How is it that none of them have realized that the bungling of relations with China by Trump hasn't created more jobs here, and has interrupted the supply chains that provide those cheap goods? But they think King Donald is doing a great job! And how about those farmers and ranchers who can't sell their crops and meat to China, and worse, because Trumpty Dumpty completely screwed up the Covid-19 response, they can't sell to Canada either.

But, yes, through all this, the mortgage and taxes must be paid and the property maintained.

We began as landlords by treating our tenants as we would like to be treated ourselves - cordial,repcetful, and  responsive to property needs and maintenance concerns.  We ended it with a much harder approach.   The house - a $775,000 (conservative) beach access property.

The argument is even more compelling than unemployment benefits, though that is very compelling as well.

Some will think they are not responsible for their actions and debts.  Not paying rent while maintaining occupancy for any reason is fraud and theft by the tenant, plain and simple.  Non rent payment is now also sanctioned by the eviction moratoriums  by left winged city governments;  many of these tenants now believe they have a right not to pay for their debts and receive housing at the expense of someone  who does not and can not volunteer their support, but is forced into the situation.  The longer term outcome is a substantial number of landlords will decide to leave their rental investment and sell to a developer. because the rental is creating liability and not generating return in investment, just loss.  Poorer renters will be impacted the most by this.  The dysfunctional and convoluted logic by those in academics, exemplified by this editorial, and likely widely common, is disturbing.

While getting evicted for a few hundred dollars is not only cruel but also inefficient and more costly to the landlord, I wonder if this happens because the landlord thinks there is little chance for future rent to be paid.

With this logic laws should be passed that require restaurants to give away meals to anyone who is hungry but cannot pay. If laws like this are passed it will help low income people short term then landlord will sell off or allow repossession of houses and restaurants would simply close. It’s not sustainable.

We have ALL been hurt by COVID-19.  Yes, the US Congress does have a role to play in the recovery.  What Professor Desmond apparently CHOOSES TO NOT UNDERSTAND is that US Senate Majority Leader McConnell is NOT an unfeeling lout, rather it is that ANY legislation emerging from the US House is HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE LARDED UP with NON-ESSENTIAL SPENDING.

Although our federal government alone has never been the best housing supplier,  manager, and landlord, as witness the state of public housing projects, it yet has the power to coordinate local efforts on a national level to address this national problem of supplying affordable housing by making it profitable for private housing contractors to build low-income rental units. 
It’s time for mayors in cities with significant family homeless populations to push their state legislatures and city council governments to intervene by extending city authority over city construction contracts. Many cities  require owners of newly constructed apartment buildings to reserve a number of  rental units  for subsidized housing tenants. But all seized property and vacant land not already assigned for commercial development within the city limits ought to be designated for homeless and subsidized housing tenants. 
 Preferential bidding points, for example, ought to be added to construction company bids in responses to “ RFPs” (Request for Proposals) for city contracts based on their record in building rental property for subsidized rental units and low-rent housing.

The former CEO of Boeing, which killed hundreds of passengers in two avoidable crashes, departs nevertheless with a bonus worth millions of dollars.

Thank you for this story. 

Governor Newsom recently made a defective order permitting rental property owners to evict tenants who are allegedly nuisances, or just evict them, but for tenants who have not paid rent yet, there is a ban in place until February to begin eviction proceedings, and all tenants have extended periods of time with which to pay for rent.  

Governor Newsom's Calfiornia extension of the eviction moratorium violates the fourteenth amendment rights of tenants.   

If the rental property owner in Texas who moved to evict the tenant did not obtain a writ from the Sheriff enabling the Sheriff to remove the family from their rental dwelling, then he committed a fraud against the tenant. If he lied to the court and the Sheriff when obtaining a writ, he committed perjury. 

Why rental property owners are permitted to commit such criminal acts is beyond my belief."

Impoverished, middle-income, and upper-income people tend to cluster in similar rental housing.  Assuming Mr. Loaiza's rental was in a lower-middle income rental building and neighborhood, most of the other people renting in that area are also facing job losses, illness, and an end to their savings.  Most of the people who would rent from Mr. Acosta probably can't afford the rent. Further, I suspect many people in that neighborhood have the kind of jobs that are not suitable for telecommuting.  I do hope Mr. Acosta ends up with many, many vacant units.  I hope that the $3,000 Mr. Acosta fraudulently received for Mr. Loaiza's rent is the last income for a long, long time."
2020-08-30 18:28,"Renter rights are minimal at best.  We rented a house here in San Jose, at full market value ($4000/mo).  Our landlord decided he wanted to move back into the house and gave us 60 days notice, the minimum amount required by law and no compensation (not required by law).  We had paid our rent on time, every month, kept the house and property in excellent condition and when we were moving the owner told us we were great tenants.

Moving is not cheap.  Moving within 60 days is challenging.  The house is an income stream for the landlord but it is a home for the tenants.  There’s a basic imbalance there that goes beyond the simple business transaction of paying for a service.

We were fortunate to have a good income, good credit and to be able to find another house in the same neighborhood within the time frame.  It was an incredible amount of stress brought on for the landlord’s convenience nonetheless."

I went from paying over 80% of my income in rent to now paying 30% for a safe, clean, and secure apartment. I have been able to repay debts and donate to our local food bank as well as animal welfare causes dear to my heart. My old apartment had no heat and grave problems of mold. I was advised that I could be evicted if I reported these unsafe conditions to local code enforcement. My landlord's excuse would be that she needed to vacate my apartment to correct these illegal conditions. I felt trapped."
2020-08-30 18:36,"There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has sent everyone into a frenzy, especially concerning money. Jhon Loaiza is just one of the millions of renters that have been left devastated by the impact of the pandemic. The government hasn't done all that it can to help the American people -- even though that is quite literally what the government is for -- and this is made obvious with the exacerbation of the housing crisis as the pandemic continues to rear its ugly head. Offering the bare minimum to renters and landlords at a time when economic circulation is slowing down is troubling. It isn't like the US doesn't have the funds; our government just seems to care more about our ability to fight in meaningless wars than the public health crisis that we are currently in. 

The distribution of assistance, for one, is concerning to see. The $3,000 that Loaiza was supposed to receive had been handed over to his landlord, with no consent or agreement on Loaiza's part. Loaiza wasn't even told that this happened. There is absolutely no reason why there shouldn't have been some form of correspondence between the Neighborhood and Housing Service Department and Loaiza, who spent all of that time thinking that the check was just stalled. As disturbing as it was to read, I wasn't even a little surprised that Loaiza's landlord had cashed in the $3,000 check; it isn't difficult to grasp that our capitalistic economy fosters greed in people of all socioeconomic classes."
2020-08-30 18:23,"Landlords are telling us that evictions are hard, expensive, and no landlord would do it for minor reasons because the financial cost is too great, much less the human toll.

Yet here we have the hard facts: the majority of landlords are not missing a single day to throw people out for trivial sums or minor delays, pandemic and economy be damned. This is a failure of our society, but it is also a moral failing for these landlords individually.

I'll tell my story: I'm self employed and in March every job on my calendar evaporated. I had just gone through my slow winter and made investments for the upcoming season - I had commitments from clients, but not much cash. I told my landlord of 11 years, that I always paid on time, that I would be in trouble if I couldn't get my clients to honor the cancellation fees in my contract, or if I couldn't get approved for unemployment. That was my nightmare scenario. I asked if we could work something out short term. ""Hell no""

The nightmare became reality. I skipped rent so that I could meet my other obligations and feed myself, knowing that CA's moratorium protected me. I decided to cut my losses in June and left owing my landlord ~$5000. Not trivial, but after a decade I had cumulatively written him checks for over $250,000.

I did what I had to and lost my home in the process. But I'm OK.

My former landlord currently has 6 out of his 10 units listed, and I would imagine, 6 uncollectable ex-tenants who tried to negotiate like I did."

For example, the spreading pandemic, the dangerous changing weather, and the shrinking economy where there are no jobs for millions---all are big issues. Smaller issues include the riots and lootings in Kenosha and elsewhere or the question of building a local bridge or a nature center--  important to smaller segments of our people, but not impactful on the masses. The smaller issues can be handled by local authorities---if not interfered with, exacerbated by the president.   And so it should be, as smaller issues are best understood by the people there. But  what  can the  federal government, or the president, do when the bigger issues are just too big for an incompetent and ill-qualified government. What to do when the big things are overwhelming and way beyond the abilities of the federal government?  The answer  is the old trick of making the small become big --make it sound like the lives of all Americans hang in the balance.  Building the Wall will keep the throngs of murderers from flooding America in caravans  and murdering all Americans----and it's going to be paid for by Mexico.  And the lack of law, the growing  disorder will invade all America, including the suburbs, destroying land values and citizens' lives.  As far as the virus and weather and the economy---they are small, practically solved already.  Small becomes big and the distortion allows the big to keep killing"

Water heaters and roof repairs take precedence over pretty carpets and countertops."

It's just a mess. You help one person and there's fifty more and you only have money to help 5 of them. Do you give more people less money and hope they can make it work? Or less people 'enough' knowing that landlords can just add a 50$ fee and still evict.

Those lovely jobs dried up, the renter can't pay the rent, the landlord can't pay the mortgage, the bank executives, who we all bailed out in 2008, the brightest and the best who dreamed up the trickle down scam, have to figure out how on earth to get by on a measly million/year.

2020-08-30 18:59,It is astonishing the landlord took the money and still evicted the family. Shameful.
2020-08-30 19:06,"These comments about the landlords seem to ignore the fact that the central tenet of this proposal is that nobody be turned out of their home during the pandemic. Landlords who rely on rental income to pay their own rents couldn’t evict their tenants, but they couldn’t be evicted either. Similarly, landlords who rely on rental income to pay their living expenses— personal mortgages, utility bills— would be protected from foreclosure and utility turnoffs. 

The proposal is to forestall profiting from people who have lost their job through no fault of their own, who likely can’t get another one right now. 

Everybody should have a roof over their heads. The right of each family to have safe shelter has to come before landlords’ profits. I don’t know how to better explain that people, landlord and tenant alike, and their safety are more important than profits."
2020-08-30 19:10,"Giving the rent subsidy payments to landlords rather than to tenants is illogical and indicative of corrupt public practices that serve some citizens to the detriment of others. The government is not a party to the contractual rental agreement and the consideration in the form of rent is the obligation of tenant under the contract and is not property which belongs to the landlord until it is paid, so it should go to the tenant. 

In this situation the landlord saw an opportunity to get the unpaid rent whether the tenant stayed or not. In addition, the landlord could expect that the tenant might fall behind with his rent, again, so he was disinclined to notify the tenant if that meant the tenant would stay. Meanwhile, the tenant struggled to avoid being evicted without being informed that the grounds for the eviction had been addressed and was entitled to stay.

Cities across this country have been giving landlords dominance in the market in order to encourage more home ownership for half a century. It makes tenants feel like serfs."
2020-08-30 19:11,"Working together to build and sustain a cohesive society: a disposition that's in dire straits in the US.  But apparently not in Italy. This week's issue of the journal Science contains  the story of Italian microbiologist, Dr. Andrea Crisanti, who essentially used his understanding of asymptomatic carriers (in many diseases) to push back against his provincial politicians.  By independently initiating a large round of testing and isolation of asymptomatic folks to quell the pandemic in Veneto, he's credited with a significant impact on Italy's controlling the first outbreak. Somehow Italian society allowed for such altruism and courage by a scientist. In contrast, America hasn't seen much of that Jonas Salk–like behavior of late. And one wonders how vigorous and ruinous  would be the political attacks on such a heroic US scientist; worse than the anti-Fauci innuendo, I'd bet.

And that was before the coronavirus hit. We know landlords have their own bills to pay, but are people really lining up to take the apartments which they have forcefully vacated? And is everyone else in this country supposed to suffer and scramble as long as landlords don't have to worry about anyting?  Property owner's above all I guess. I cannot believe the Congress is doing essentially nothing while this happens. But then why should I be surprised, with Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump in charge.  Any steps that the compassionate in Congress take toward helping the average American are met with a screaming wall of members of the selfish right-wingers yelling socialism.

2020-08-30 19:18,"Landlords dream of retiring on the  proceeds from their rental properties and see tenants and nothing but cash cows who can easily be replaced. With the close difference between unoccupied housing and the need for people to live in affordable housing close to where they must live the rest of their lives, it's worked well for them.

But here is the situation, more people as a percent of our population have lost jobs on account of this  pandemic than for any reason since the Great Depression and the recovery is going to take years. So the people who might be evicted will be in the tens of millions and all of those vacant properties will flood the market and send rental prices diving as landlords are forced to rent or receive no income, and that is going to hurt them. In addition, a huge number of properties will not be rented but landlords will have to continue to maintain them and to pay bills on them like property taxes. So in the end, the landlords are going to have to suck it up one way or another."

2020-08-30 19:33,"Once again the NYT uses a few sad narratives to overly simply a very complicated situation.  Covid certainly created a terrible set of circumstances for the man and his family in San Antonio, but their financial situation was precarious at all times. They were always going to be an illness or job loss from homelessness.  It’s terrible what happened to him and the other family as well. However, though these problems were caused by Covid this time, the working poor and rent issues are always plaguing us.  

That said, to lay this on landlords is completely disingenuous.  Most landlords in this country are individuals who own between 1 and 5 properties and use this money to manage the property, pay their mortgage and other bills. They are not corporate giants rolling in cash. As a result, loss of rent puts them into a precarious financial situation. Also, since it’s personal to them and costly, the last thing they want to do is evict a tenant, especially a family. 

The solution is for government to assist these families not for landlords to absorb rent losses.   Landlords own businesses of real property and are not social agencies.  When people need food or medicines nobody says supermarkets or drug stores should be giving away their products.  The government provides vouchers.  Landlords shouldn’t be treated any differently."
2020-08-30 19:34,"Out of sight- out of mind. This was and is the Republican platform. The people losing their home or apartment are more likely than not people who weren't going to vote for Trump anyway. Just as most of the people who have died due to the COVID-19 virus- nursing home residents, brown and black people- are for the most part not Trump voters. 

The Democrats should have recognized that Republicans were willing to watch these evictions. The Democrats should have accepted their weakened bargaining point and taken the temporary funding offered by the Republicans. 

The media also needs to do its part and provide more balance in reporting. The shootings in Wisconsin are valid news stories for sure. But they do not reflect the majority of issues facing our nation. The millions being evicted and thousands dying from COVID-19 have taken a backseat to the more dramatic 'law and order' stories dominating the news."

They still have equity in the home that they're renting, many also own their own home aside, and most of the rest of us make income from working a job on top of paying the rent that is their income. They could find a job, too. Also -- landlords increase rent with market value although their mortgage costs stay constant. They literally increase profit year over year by asking for increasing money from renters, many of whose salaries are not increasing simultaneously. This is particularly egregious in college towns, but exists across the country. And landlords are completely shameless about it all."

The term used ""landlords"" sounds ugly.  They are often just regular people investing in a home in order to make a little extra money.  They have no more ability to pay the bank for the house payment than the renters do to pay the rent.  But, somehow, the solution is to make them be the ones to pay.

Conflating the actions of one immoral landlord with the statistical mass of small landlords in an impossible situation to generate an emotional response in the reader is neither good policy nor morally defensible. Food, utilities, shelter, transportation all come with costs, and to insinuate that costs and responsibilities for housing rest only on the property owner, not the tenant is a facile argument. I assume the author of this piece understands that, and chose an inflammatory, unbalanced example intentionally. I have been both a renter who couldn't afford the electric bill but paid rent, and a single property landlord. Neither of these anecdotal situations translate to a publication worthy view or opinion. But any basic understanding of economics clearly shows if you cost shift the burden to landlords to protect tenants, you simply screw someone else over under the guise of ""protecting the little guy"". If you want to ensure a pause in evictions, federally guarantee rent payments to landlords or directly to tenants and cost shift to the national level, just expect an increase in taxation or reduction in services. But stop publishing polarizing, overly simplistic cherry picked examples to create an emotional response to an incredible complicated situation."

2020-08-30 20:40,"Mr. Desmond ignores the fact that each eviction has two parties, the tenant and the landlord, and each have protection under the law.  Ultimately, the landlord may, through the housing court system, take action to remove a tenant.  This is an expensive and time-consuming process which has been set up to be even-handed.   It is not a mechanism to facilitate the collection of “the greediest of bills.”

 Mr. Desmond uses the case of Mr. Loaiza to illustrate the plight of a tenant who appears to have been treated unjustly.  In my case, as an unwilling landlord, I am dealing with an opportunistic squatter without a rental agreement whom I cannot remove by means other than eviction.  He is protected by Governor Lamont’s  statewide residential eviction moratorium which went into effect on  March 19, 2020. That moratorium was just extended  through October 1,2020.  It may be extended further in future.

I have not received payment of any kind for five months,  and am sure that no payment in any amount will ever be received.  I am looking only to recover possession and use of property owned by my family.  Governor Lamont violated my rights as a property owner to private contract, due process, equal protection under the law, and the right from having property taken for public use without just compensation.  HIs eviction moratorium removes my opportunity for redress by being allowed to employ the court system established to handle these cases."
2020-08-30 20:43,"I am a small landlord. I started investing thirty years ago in the stock and bond market while working three jobs to put myself through graduate school. I paid my own tuition and was granted a few scholarships based on grades. I saved no less than 20 percent of the meager pay from these jobs for these investments. I still cut corners at the grocery store, wear inexpensive clothes, rarely eat out, and haven't been on a vacation in ten years. Everyday is work day and I live a frugal life.  I made subsequent investments in housing after selling these stocks and bonds.  I take care of my tenants. I pay my dwelling property insurance, provide timely maintenance, pay property taxes (which increased 10% in so-called ""LOW"" tax Northwest Florida. I can't increase rents 10% out right), and federal income taxes based on these rentals. When all these large bills are due, no one gives me relief or a moratorium on paying.  And, I work with tenants who need extra time to pay. But, keep this in mind: This is a business. I don't ask for free maintenance or groceries or any other thing. Why are you advocating for free rent? I depend on this income to live. I am providing housing at affordable, below market rents according to my tax software. If the banks foreclose, their will be more  homeless and poorer landlords. No rent means we can't pay our bills either. So, no evictions is not the answer. Making good the landlords and tenants is. Otherwise, I'll invest elsewhere creatinf less housing."

2020-08-30 20:56,"The reality is that the rent is just too high. Everywhere. I think it's a multifaceted problem with slightly different roots in different places. But ultimately it comes down to greed and governments failing to protect renters. As an old Millennial (i.e. I'm almost 40), I've noticed that rents have skyrocketed during my adult life, along with house prices. I'm also an urban planner and when I was in planning school a decade ago, the professors drilled into us the idea that house ownership was over, as house prices were already out of reach for most back then in the west coast city where I live. They said my generation should get used to being renters forever (not that any of them were). Now in my city high income professionals struggle to afford to rent family sized apartments and there are massive and growing tent cities throughout the region. Oh and I live in Canada, and we have free healthcare, and rent stabilization, and a rent bank, and social housing, and much more generous social welfare policies than in the US. I wonder how anyone thinks this is remotely sustainable, and feel very sad for all the pain and suffering our dysfunctional housing system has caused, and continues to cause. I am also ashamed of my profession, which has largely parroted development industry excuses for the sad state we find ourselves in, while a small minority of people get filthy rich off of real estate. I fear this is becoming a new form of feudalism."
2020-08-30 20:56,"I'm the director of a small homeless shelter in Northern Wisconsin. During the late spring and early summer, when persons were still receiving the $600 a week unemployment assistance and there was a moratorium on evictions, as well as local and county assistance in the form of things like hotel vouchers, we were almost empty. 

Now all that help has disappeared, and in a weeks time the shelter has filled up.

 Homelessness is expensive. Not only does it cost a lot  to run a shelter, the collateral damage to the community is significant. The daily routines most of us take for granted become impossible. Try applying for a new job if you don't have internet access and a stable address. Medical and mental health problems are exacerbated and go untreated. Life quickly becomes a downhill tumble and some persons never recover. It's especially difficult on families with kids. 

Prevention of a problem, even when it's expensive, is cheaper than fixing things after they've fallen apart."
2020-08-30 21:03,"There is no housing crisis. Housing is not in crisis. Housing needs no trauma counselors. 
Housing needs no lawyers. Housing needs no friends. Housing needs no representatives. Housing needs no organizers.
When we call this crisis a housing crisis, it benefits the people who design housing, build housing, who profit from housing, not the people who live in it. 
It encourages us to think in abstractions, in numbers, in interchangeable “units,” and not about people or power.
We don’t have a housing crisis. We have a tenants’ rights crisis. 
A tenant can be harassed, evicted, displaced, broke, undocumented, fed up, or organized. A tenant can be in kindergarten, can be a teacher, or a teacher on strike. 
A tenant can be incarcerated or houseless.
Humans, unlike housing, have race, gender, families, history. Humans, unlike housing, have power.
I live in a “changing” neighborhood. This is called natural, inevitable, good. This is called gentrification and defined by those it benefits. On the edge of my neighborhood, my old building mates live in tents.
The city I live in has a “progressive” mayor. Here’s what we hear: the city expands its tax base not its services, nonprofits negotiate the terms of defeat, lawyers offer individualistic advice. 
Here’s what we learned: gentrification is purposeful and produced. Gentrification is “displacement and replacement of the poor for profit.” 
Solidarity of mayor, police, landlords, developers must be met by an equal solidarity among tenants."

2020-08-30 20:24,"It's not part of American political culture to support the type of housing assistance described here, including for most Democrats, nor to support universal healthcare and many basic social services.

The worry, even among most Democrats, is always that one might being a sucker for paying for someone who is ""lazy"" or in dire straits due to their ""own fault.""  What if this guy got diabetes through his own fault, why should I pay when I'm responsible about my health?  What if this guy wanting rental assistance lives beyond his means and is too lazy to look for a job? 

But paying some ""undeserving"" cases is the cost of a having a more equitable system overall, where everyone can have a baseline of security, which you will want too once you're in those circumstances. 

And as Krugman, this columnist, and many others in these pages are always pointing out, you don't even have to look at it in terms of altruism.  Having this security in terms of healthcare and housing will be better for the economy overall, even if there are abusers of the system.  The baseline security improves health, employment, the economy, crime rates, etc. in the long run, which is better for everyone, including landlords. 

But Americans are so self-righteousness when it comes to who deserves what that they'll cling to their libertarian system; and by the standards of the rest of the world, even your Democrats are libertarian (they are far to the right of the Canadian Conservative Party)."

2020-08-30 20:19,"How did morality get into it? Landlords are people good bad & indifferent just as tenants are people also good bad & indifferent. All of sudden according to the majority of my fellow commentators here, All landlords are come with cloven hooves horns and the smell of sulfur. And all tenants come with a halo and a set of white wings. I got news neither is true. 
But as I can see from the commentary here most people seem to believe a landlord has a duty to allow people to leech of him in the name of ...Compassion? For must landlords it's job it's what they do to pay their own bills. So I must ask my fellow commentators: Do You work for free?
I am curious?

The reality here folks Like it or dislike is NO ONE is entitled to live for free on someone else's money. No matter what you seem to think. You want people to make sacrifices because so many people can't be bothered to make sure of their rent? Why don't you people make them? Instead of expecting everyone else to sacrifice? 

Compassion is nice no doubt, a virtue possibly but compassion ends when I have to sacrifice MY families needs & interests to take of someone else's family. And my family isn't going to sacrifice it's home because someone feels entitled to use MY property for free. There is NO right anywhere in the world to live on someone else's  property for free.

2020-08-30 20:11,"I am a 5th generation landlord, and as always the underlying assumption here is that the greedy landlord is causing this problem, and all we need to do is make him let people live for free and the problem will be solved.  How can you possibly be so ignorant!!!  If my tenants don't pay the rent, I cannot pay the mortgage or the water/sewer bill or the taxes or the insurance or maintenance.  So I am expected to carry the weight of this problem on my back because I own the property.  Well guess what; in the aggregate, landlords across the nation simply won't do that.  Thousands of properties will simply be removed from the market and the problem will become worse.  In addition, your whining about the eviction process is misdirected.  Landlords are only following the prescribed legal process--that they did not write or create--but that they must follow under the law.  If you want people to live in houses for free, with free water, free sewer, free electricity, free maintenance, maybe a free cleaning service, then you should just say that--and have the government buy up all these houses and then try and run this program---how well do you think that will work?"

There is one person and one person only who is responsible for this and so many other Covid19 war crimes and it is Senator McConnell.
There is an easy solution to this unique housing problem and if the people with the power really represented all Americans it could be solved today. Rent should not be the first and last open mouth to be fed. All renters both residential and commercial should not have to pay rent. All mortgage payments should be put on hold. Impossible you say, but why. True, landlords have bills too and of course even banks have expenses but really? If all these payments were put on hold, and that's millions of payments, the number people and companies who collect them are equal to a small percentage of tenants. That would be a much easier group to sort out and for the government to make whole financially. The world also wouldn't come to a grinding halt they way it will if something doesn't stop all the pending evictions. With the Trillions of dollars all the banks have and the interest free money that is thrown at them what is the harm really if they have to wait a few weeks or months or even a year for relief from the government. Now compare that to a small businessman losing his workplace or a family of one or a dozen being made homeless. Where are those American values now?"

I'm a little suspicious; maybe don't do it then if it's such a losing proposition? Maybe millions wouldn't be doing it if they didn't see decent profits to be made??

2020-08-28 1:07,"As a massage therapist practicing in Brooklyn for nearly ten years I appreciate this. The profession took a huge pandemic hit. We were unable to practice for nearly four months. I feel a kinship with those in professions like food service, fitness, and salons in terms of impact. A sad and scary time feels even worse when you have no job.  It’s quite likely the massage field will need to halt again, and we’ll have more lean months ahead of us.

People are finding ways to get things done with serious limitations (I should probably say “challenges”, but won’t) and it’s amazing. I admire my colleagues who can make use of their massage therapy skills virtually, because not everyone can. 

I've resumed practice now that I’m legally able to do so, with an abundance of caution. Due to the lack of information on so many aspects of COVID-19 the decision sometimes felt agonizing. I found myself asking, “What’s the right thing to do?” Most massage therapists I know would not put their need to make money above the health of their clients, but I know some will. 

What would make it easier for many massage therapists to feel they could return to work without possibly endangering themselves or others? A robust and efficient testing program, not waiting 7+ days for results.

We're starved for human contact, becoming further apart and turning virtual. I think about people who live alone and have nobody with whom to share touch, which is essential. K Pendergrass"
2020-08-28 2:01,"Having been trained and licensed as a massage therapist and been in private practice for 15 years, my sense is that the very concept of massage concerns touch applied to the body. 

Granted that one can apply certain massage techniques to parts of the body, the greatest benefit comes from relaxation of muscles, thereby encouraging blood flow. It is difficult to achieve relaxation when one is busy with applying massage. 

Granted that a licensed massage therapist learns more about the body than actual massage techniques, so they can indeed share much of their professional knowledge and experience which may be helpful in today’s situation. 

Some clients may be open to this kind of help as a kind of seminar, but either unable or unwilling to accept it as useful to them. 

Is it a matter of “I can’t feel it”? Or is “better than nothing”? One thing is pertinent here - individual difference. 

Re-inventing one’s profession is not easy, as I have had to do several times,  but circumstance, that old tool of fate, doesn’t take well to resistance. Many people, whatever their limitations, have chosen determination to find their best way forward. 

The world we find ourselves in today is witnessing a major “circumstance” which may, if we make good choices, be the very corrective stimulus to a vast Earthwide renovation.

2020-08-28 12:47,"I know several MT's out of work. A few are looking to open their own locations ASAP...but among them, there is some recklessness. Rushing their efforts, etc. Its understandable, they went from doing pretty well working for a salon, and side work - to a complete halt and no revenue in a matter of a week. 

As for their clients...most people with any sense are wary. The whole process is ripe for a contagion. Even a mask isn't going to stop the virus escaping or entering when your face is nestled in that table hole. And having been closely associated with MT's when I was a PT, I know that many people seeking massage, are not as tuned in to their actual health as they want to claim. They often deliberately go for a massage when they are sick, because the industry has sold them a bill of goods that a good massage can quicken recovery and even stop a ""cold"" in its tracks. Which is wholly false. Same as people who think a good workout will sweat the germs out. Its just not true.

So they end up spreading their illness to the MT's,the staff, and/or others at the salon or gym. 

In other words; the usual selfishness of the American customer, who doesnt care about the staff in an establishment, but only that they the consumer can get what they want, when they want it. No one should stop them from a drink in a bar, slices of pie in a diner, artisinal burgers in a hipster pub, or dumping their kids into a ball pit for an afternoon.

Clients are masked, we're masked. I wear an additional plastic face shield over my mask for close supine work. It's a very physical job, under normal circumstances. It's often unbearably hot & suffocating to work as we do now. Many of the therapists I know are struggling with our energy levels - many of us are empaths by nature, & all the negative energy in the world right now can really affect what we bring to the table for our clients. I imagine most close personal service providers are struggling with this, as well. We do what we do because we love it, even though it takes such a toll on our bodies, & now our mental health, too. Most of my clients are now extra-appreciative of what we do and how positively bodywork affects their own wellbeing. Self-care is more important than ever right now, & not at all a selfish luxury. An hour on the floor with a tennis ball & some relaxing music is within everyone's budget, & can make such a big difference in how you feel. But if you're not the DIY type, go get a massage, (and tip well!). Be well, stay well!"
2020-08-28 17:51,"I have been a massage therapist since 2001. On March 12th, I called my clients and told them I would be taking a break from massage until the virus was under control. A few weeks later, I realized that we were probably a year out before things would be anywhere near back to normal. Another month later, it looked like eighteen months to two years. 

I have decided to move on and leave the massage industry. Because of clients often showing up with colds that they would tell me were just ""allergies,"" I was often sick, and seriously sick several times a year. I haven't been sick since January. Normally, I would have contracted two more colds by now. 

Viral and bacterial contagion aside, massage therapy has been a wonderful trade to have, and rewarding to help people who are in physical pain or experiencing mild anxiety and depressive symptoms. Massage helps calm the nervous system and it always felt good to see that dreamy relaxed look on a clients face at the end of their session. 

I agree that massage in some cases is not a luxury, however, in a pandemic, it is to a certain extent. Possibly, a person, with the right protocol, could get a ""medical massage,"" but you're still taking a risk. The contact is too prolonged to avoid a viral overload. 

Videos teaching your clients how to massage each other, assuming a person doesn't live alone, might be a good solution until there is mass vaccination."

It wouldn't be as serene as the massage studio, but it would be great for my aching shoulders.

It was the beginning of my journey becoming certified as a holistic health counselor after graduating from Skidmore College in Saratoga. If for whatever reason you can't get a massage right now, try dance or movement or restorative yoga or a barre or Pilates class. Then follow it up with a shower while you douse your shoulders, neck, & back with some peppermint oil (ginger if you need something more warming).

This situation should not have existed at all -- I don't know how the school got away with excluding her. I've never forgotten that lonely sad look on her face. Sometimes a few of us would go over and talk to her.

I made some casual friends, I had lovely colleagues I'd catch drinks with, language classes, sports, the occasional pub quiz. It takes time to settle into a new city, so the social calendar wasn't packed. Then in December, the relationship ended, and by late Feb everyone was in quarantine. And for those 3-4 months, I was totally fine! People from all over the world connected virtually and the friends I left behind abroad were suddenly just as accessible to me as to everyone else. The real trouble started when the lockdown was lifted and some activities with a small group of people were allowed again. Friends would meet for a socially distanced glass of wine in the park. Families would visit each other again. People cautiously reconnected with their closest friends. Except me...I had no ""best friend"" who had me on their ""top 5 to see post-lockdown list"" because I hadn't managed to find a bestie in the months I had been here. The casual friendships pre-COVID had become frail after those months, and calling people felt awkward. My family was far away, still separated by a closed border. Larger groups were still banned, so no clubs, classes, courses or social activities. All I could do was sit at home, listen to the groups of people drinking and laughing in the park underneath my window. I have never felt so lonely."

Take for example private clubs, you may wish to belong but if you have not enough connections or enough money you will not be welcome.  Life isn't fair in certain ways people to accept that and look for their own solutions.  It probably is harder for certain families especially those who were new to an area right before the pandemic.  They will have to be strong and navigate the situation the best they can.

Groups like Newcomers, Nextdoor, church groups, YMCA/YWCA and even your PTO, can help one make connections, even in this time of COVID, but one has to take the first step and reach out to join these groups.  That is often difficult, I know, but worth the risk. Last thought, many community organizations need volunteers who can help out, wearing masks and socially distancing.  This is another way to meet people, get out of the house and feel good that one is helping the community."
2020-08-29 13:05,"All I can say is, thank god we're a family of introverts."
2020-08-29 18:12,"Yes, it's hard not to be invited to a childhood pod.  But I think it's worse to be an older adult who lives alone than a child in a family.  The social isolation gets very old."
2020-08-29 20:02,"People need to think more creatively when constructing pods.  I certainly sympathize with the Ryberg's not wanting to sacrifice the holiday season with the grandparents, and the husband's desire not to become the ongoing supervisor to a gaggle of children.  But what if there were two families in the pod, with each family hosting the group two days a week.  On the fifth day, each family spends some quality time on their own, like a pre-weekend.  By prior agreement, the pod ends two weeks prior to the holidays, so that each family can self-isolate in preparation to see their grandparents.  This would also allow the two supervising adults to at least work part time, likely remotely, or just two blissful days of relaxation from the relentless demands of children and the opportunity to do tasks unencumbered.  No one's needs are met perfectly, but everyone's needs are at least partially addressed."
2020-08-30 0:11,"I would think that staying away from Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media platform that causes feelings of isolation, jealousy, or feelings of missing out should be avoided. The article states: “So instead, she spends her hours eyeing the social lives of other people”. This does not sound healthy to me and would of course lead to the very feelings of isolation that she experiences. I have never had an account on any social media platform and I am glad if this is what it does to you. Delete your accounts, stop looking, and concentrate on cultivating some companions for your children instead of comparing yourself to others and waiting for an invitation."
2020-08-30 0:45,"Thank goodness my children are in college. I was an older mom, with a quiet not-very-social second child, and a full time job which made me an oddity in our wealthy community where the highly educated wives mostly stay home by choice. My first thought when I heard about learning pods was, “oh my god, we never would’ve been invited to one!” 

For those of you dismissing feelings of isolation and missing out (or worse, your kid missing out) as trivial, I don’t agree. I think being excluded from these small social bubbles would be very painful."
2020-08-30 1:30,"Most families we know are not in pods, despite the media coverage.  Pods are complicated.  Do I want to be in charge of other kids during this time?  I do not.  Do I want the additional health risks?  Nope again.  There is no data on how widespread this phenomenon is.  I suspect maybe 25% of families, tops.

It’s just fine not to pod!"
2020-08-30 1:37,"My kids are part of a learning ‘pod’ and it doesn’t mean we’re ‘popular.’ In fact, we didn’t even know the two other families that well before deciding to join forces, and had not spent time together socially outside of school and kids sports events. The things we had in common were that all parents had demanding full time jobs and limited ability to help with virtual school, similar age kids (grades 1-3), lived in the same neighborhood, and had similar social distancing behaviors/comfort levels. Many much more ‘popular’ families didn’t join pods because there was a parent who had some flexibility to help with school. So I agree with the author that not being a part of something like that this doesn’t say much about popularity or connections."
2020-08-30 1:51,"My son will be entering kindergarten this year.  It is starting as all remote and we will likely keep him home if it does actually switch to in person.  We have  set up a small pod oftwo other families in their neighborhood who also have kids going into kindergarten.  We have a covered outdoor space for them to work in the backyard with a few tables and some chairs.  The pod will meet three days a week; each family does one day a week each of a parent supervising/teaching the pod.  My wife and I plan to each cover half of our family’s day.

Compare this to the spring, where my wife and I spent every single day trying to give our son a quality experience while also working full time jobs and caring for his two year old sister.  The pod will be such a relief when it starts this fall, both because we’ll be able to function a bit at our jobs, but also - and most importantly - because our son will have a social/emotional learning environment.

It has taken months of communication, working on the outdoor learning space, and negotiating with other families to find a good fit for everyone.  I feel terribly for those who don’t have access to a pod, for us it is one of the brighter spots of this horrible situation. I wish schools were spending less time converting their classrooms for social distancing and more time helping families coordinate in small groups or pods.  It is too much for many families to navigate on their own and many are going to be left out."
2020-08-30 1:44,"One of the best skills one can learn as a child, or any age really, is to not yearn for a pod that doesn't want you. Only spend energy on those that value you."
2020-08-30 2:01,"Pods are not ubiquitous. We socialize with a group of families that have kids in the same grade as ours and no one is in a pod, nor is there much interest in setting any up. It’s hard enough to look after your own kids, let alone someone else’s, even in shifts. Don’t feel bad if you’re kids are not in a pod, I think the perceived proliferation of pods is more a product of media hype than reality."
2020-08-30 3:03,"I understand why people are doing the ""pod"" thing. To be honest though, the only thing that would make working from home and monitoring remote schooling more stressful is adding other people's kids into the mix. Seemingly normal people will lose their minds over feeling their child has been even slightly inconvenienced or made mildly uncomfortable. COVID has made this even more pronounced, in my experience."
2020-08-30 5:11,"My family for years has been close to two other families.  Ski trips, vacations, kids in Same classes dating back to preschool. They ended up living next door to one another, formed a bubble, a pod etc. this pandemic has been difficult for a lot of people for many reasons.. but for us the emotional pain has been almost unbearable."
2020-08-30 7:19,I believe most people who create a bubble were already good friends before. We were a group of seven Franco American  friends over 65 and meeting for a diversity of activities and short trips  before the pandemic. During confinement we had zoom meetings. After confinement we organized a picnic and walk in the forest of Fontainebleau and picnics in the Luxembourg garden. One of us is stuck in the US were she was at the time. So far everything we did was outdoors but we have started to think of winter and creating a bubble to get through the winter. I’m counting on it. This pandemic made me more than ever appreciative of friendship.
2020-08-30 8:49,"l live alone and work from home. I have formed a bubble with my sister but limit my interactions with her because she has high-risk  family members. I've met some friends in the park a couple of times but otherwise I rarely meet up with people. 
I'm used to spending quite a bit of time of my own but in the last couple of weeks it's started to wear a little thin. I'm starting to get less focused on routine and really need to do more exercise. 
While it's understandable to be a little envious of people who have bubbles within which they can visit bars and restaurants, I try to bear in mind that those same bubbles are helping to push up the infection rates in every country where restrictions have eased, so I tell myself that for now it's not a bad thing at all to have a very limited circle.
I hope that we will be able to look back on this as an unusually quiet 12-18 months after which we can start to move on with our lives. It's easier to have that perspective when you're older (I'm late 50s) but I understand how difficult it must be right now for younger people who were used to active social lives. 
 This too shall pass."
2020-08-30 9:21,"The proliferation of internet platforms for social purposes can cause a feeling of isolation, but who has pushed this need for constant contact outside the family to make one a person,   We conditioned ourselves and our children to constantly seek connections to feel important.  Think back to the halcyon days when we didn’t need the society of others to make us feel important or popular.
We have been an over programmed society for far too long.  When this country was founded families looked for places where we could have physical space but really we can feel comfortable by and in ourselves.   We are able to connect with libraries for free ebooks to read, even to read to our children,    We can access newspapers for information  about the whole world and initiate discussions even with younger children and teach them the values you treasure most.   Even working from home one can take time to seek knowledge about things we didn’t know that we want.   We can encourage our children to be self reliant and not depend on others for amusement and entertainment.  Each man is an island .  Use it wisely to save it for when we can resume the way it was but realize this is not a necessity .  We over value socialization......think what loners have contributed to us and our world."
2020-08-30 11:56,"Parents whose children are not included in pods can try to connect with parents of other children who are left out too and schedule daily Facetime or Skype sessions for children to interact - it may be only 15 or 30 minutes long but a well structured schedule such as 4 30 to 5 pm or whatever works for both sets of children would give the kids something to look forward to and and even prepare for by getting something to show/share on the screen - happy hour for the kids. Having a structure/schedule helps everyone. And daily walks with kids is another activity parents can follow and get outside and people/dogs one meets along the way enrich the time spent outdoors. Are parents of children in the same class/section communicating with each other on their progress under the online learning programs, in addition to communicating with the teachers? It would help, provided the parents are careful to avoid being considered aggressive/pushy. Not easy, but with a little patience, one can find solutions."
2020-08-30 14:56,"Not being able to join a pod is possibly safer, if lonelier. My friends and family all formed 'bubbles' (= pods) early this summer. All of these bubbles have already been broken. Once people resume socializing with a larger group, the temptation to make an exception 'just this once' to meet with more people outside the 'bubble' seems to be just too strong...especially for teenagers. 
Think carefully before you join or form bubbles/pods with anybody else."
2020-08-31 2:22,"This has been difficult for our family, since our 1st grader is an only child and we don’t have family nearby to visit with. My closest friends with kids our son’s age are either high-risk themselves or live with someone who is. We’ve seen neighbors who’ve podded up and it hurts to see the kids playing and laughing while we cannot join. I don’t take it personally, but it is a real jab in the heart seeing others get to enjoy companionship, then dealing with feelings of loneliness and isolation alone. I’m mostly an extrovert, but enjoy my solitude. If it were just me and my husband, I’d be fine with the occasional outdoor visit with a girlfriend. Add a high-energy 6yo only child boy to the mix and things get reallllllly lonely! It’s not just wishing my kid had another kid to simply “be kids” with (mom and dad can only do so much!), but rather be able to commiserate about all the challenges of parenting, especially with schools closed, etc.. While I wish we were in a pod at times I also see the downside to having to deal closely with other families, their quirks and kids, and germs. This is a tough time for parents. Pod or not!"
2020-08-31 3:51,"I have older kids in HS and college and can only imagine how hard this pandemic is on families with younger kids who face the creation of pods and social challenges. I have struggled as I witness various friends socializing in groups over dinner or drinks - yes, outdoors, but sitting shoulder to shoulder unmasked, of course, as they eat and sip their wine. These aren’t pods, and each of them have their own social circles they appear to maintain on their own, behaving as potentials vectors. I’ve found as I politely decline the invites to join them, those invites become scarce. I think I’m perceived as too cautious, and they now assume I won’t come along so why bother. It stinks trying to be responsible, knowing these friends aren’t making the same sacrifices. In addition to being lonely, I’ve really struggled with not being judgmental about others’ choices in how to safely interact. One thing I have learned - we’re certainly not all in this together."
2020-08-31 10:24,"I have been going to various stores, wearing a mask. I try to limit it but there are times when I take the risk.  I have friends who consider me to be part of their pod, but I know that their family also occasionally interacts with other people. So if I have a 1% risk of catching it outside and they have a 1% risk outside, then the combined risk is closer to 2%. So even if I don't put on a mask when they are over, I still don't want to sit right next to them...."
2020-08-31 12:20,I'm not sure why the person who 'is not invited' does not take the initiative to start a pod with friends.   This seems a little childish and a touch 'poor me.'
2020-08-29 23:51,I can't for the life of me figure out how there isn't an app for pod formation yet.
2020-08-30 5:14,61 percent of us were lonely before the virus.
2020-08-31 13:23,"LOL.  If you can't handle your time being alone, and get upset about what others are doing, you need a life or a hobby, or maybe some books to read, or all of those things.  And it's good for everyone to feel what exclusion means, because a lot of people in our country have been excluded from all kinds of stuff for far too long."
2020-08-30 8:09,"Mixing households in a pandemic?  Very, very risky behavior. 

I am stunned that people actual yearn to be in a pod. When it comes to disease, no one is invincible."
2020-08-31 2:42,"And then you have parents of high schoolers setting up virtual pods for the entire grade because, well, they’re micromanagers. I’m not sure what these children will do in college without mommy to schedule their lives for them!"
2020-08-30 14:10,"As sorry as one should be for the ""excluded"" family, the root of the problem is many people's need to feel socially accepted. Those whose attitude is ""May all others go to the Devil"" are much less likely to miss the umbilical cord to others."

I'm a little unclear on the problem beyond quarantine is hard, making the right choices for our families is hard, and feelings of loneliness are hard."
2020-08-26 23:36,"Trump still relishes in using terms like the ""Chinese Virus"" and the pointedly offensive ""Kung Flu.""  
Trump still carries on that the Chinese should never have let coronavirus move beyond its borders.
Well, whatever faults can be found with China for the pandemic, the fact is that the horse has long since left the stable.
The entire world has been dealing with Covid 19 for months now, some with better strategies than others.  But this virus has been a global pandemic all year, and no other leaders are doing like Trump and whining about China.  
The only responsible path today is to take it seriously, honestly and as every nation's crisis; or else, even more people will die senselessly of this merciless disease that will not abate on its own."
2020-08-26 23:50,"""He [Trump] has suggested that his aim is to “slow the testing down,” so that fewer people will test positive ...""

When Biden and Harris take over in January and their fellow Democrats regain control next year, testing for the virus will be done robustly.  We will then likely discover that we have underestimated infections in the US by an order of magnitude, that is, that *tens of millions* of Americans have actually contracted the virus.  That revelation will force more lockdowns and economic turmoil, all rooted in the incompetent and willfully negligent behavior of Trump and his enablers.  Assuming a vaccine is developed by early next year, and allowing time for its manufacture and distribution as well as getting enough people vaccinated, we in the US are probably looking at another year of completely avoidable sickness and death due to the virus.  That's simply unconscionable.  And so is even the thought of re-electing Trump and his fellow Republicans, the ones who are almost wholly responsible for getting us into this unmitigated disaster in the first place."
2020-08-27 0:00,"We have the President and party for ''personal freedom'' essentially ''trumping'' the ''common good''. 

It doesn't just extend to this pandemic which has needlessly costed lives and still leaves destruction in its wake. It is a matter of ''principle'' (never back down or look weak in all respects all the time) 

Really what it means (and boils down to) is that it is about one set of rules for them and another set of rules for us. The republican party is JUST a vehicle for this premise, whereas the philosophy is two fold: money and power.

If the appearance of money is to have power, then this President has been a master at that portrayal. If power truly doesn't depend on money, then we can elect whomever we want, at any time to implement laws that reflect us. 

We don't however, so the veil continues to not be lifted, and the President still hovers around 40% while the bodies pile up.

I pray that everyone who is registered to vote will do so in November!  Our country cannot survive four more years of trump!"
2020-08-27 1:01,"When Trump says “We did the exact right thing,” he’s referring to tilting government business to the Trump family properties, even in the face of the emolument act.   As for the pandemic, his measure is the stock market which’s is breaking record highs . Why?  Because corporations have figured out that they can function well with a smaller workforce, thereby exacting savings.  Many jobs will be eliminated permanently.  In addition, now that we can work from any place, H1B visas aren’t even needed.  Then, there’s AI which will also eliminate many jobs.   Truckers are an endangered species right now, for one.  So, yes, for corporations Trump has been a miracle worker.   And on we move to nationalistic confrontations and border rearrangements as it happen on the run up to WWI.

Not wanting a long conversation I said, ""170,000 dead.""  His reply, ""you can't blame that on Trump, it's was sent by the Chinese.""
I few hours later a man saw my Biden sticker and said you can't be serious!  I said, ""Yes, I am.  Too many people have died that should not have because of Trump's inaction.""  The reply:  ""He did everything he could.  He's our savior.""

Remember the members of the US Senate who, given the chance, failed to eject Trump from the presidency.  Any other president could probably have been counted on to limit US losses to about the world average of COVID deaths per million residents.  Thus each derelict Senator carries the burden of over 2700 excess American deaths on his shoulders, if not his conscience."

From the outset, the handful of oligarchs who fund the Republican party, have insisted that the widgets get back to work, reminding me of the armchair generals at the beginning of WWI who hurled hundreds of thousands of troops at each other, to be instantly slaughtered.  It's no coincidence that in Europe, where unions still play a large role, the response has been different. Here, you're on your own.

I can only wonder what kind of cognitive dissonance must be going on in the mind of a GOP viewer, who's been out of work for months, has waited for hours on a food pantry line to feed their family, and has waited in vain for relief, can reconcile the vile lies spewed out at the convention with the stark realities of their own lives. I don't know, maybe it's easier than i think."
2020-08-27 1:36,"Despite all the handwringing, the truth is this. Science was clear. This new virus was overwhemingly contagious and no one had immunity to it. The best way to avoid it was to quarantine, limit human contact, wear a mask, wash hands often.

People who value science did these things. People who listened to Trump and Fox pretended that science wasn't important, that magic would protect them, and they chose to rebel against common sense precautions selfishly in the name of economics.

By breaking out of safety precautions, much heartache, many deaths, horrible illness was left to grow. Trump did all the wrong things. He pretended we could be safe and get quickly to business as usual. He killed many without so much as a glance in the mirror. And he could not care less whether they lived or died."

Documented and Un-Documented -
would a Federal Judge from Hawaii 
have ruled he could not do so.

Does anyone think that if Trump did seal the borders that the virus would not have already found its way into the US or would ?

We need a National Health Board that has the right and power to declare National Emergencies that can order Governors/Mayors to carry out Quarantines, to make sure people wear their Masks, to order Schools and Colleges closed, to close Beaches and Bars
to stockpile and order more ventilators, drugs produced, to authorize the search for Vaccines, to distribute public funds to those who become unemployed due to the ""lockdown"".

Even Melania managed to do that much last night.  It's bad enough to decline to apologize for the deaths of so many on his watch. Worse yet to take no responsibility for those deaths.  But to say nothing (and, no doubt, feel nothing) on behalf of the dead?  Intolerable.  (And reminiscent, by the way, of his response to the news that a fire had taken the life of a tenant at Trump Tower a couple of years back.  Our ""president"" made sure to thank the fire department for limiting the damage to his building- which just barely measured up to New York's established fire codes- but he never once even mentioned the name of the deceased tenant.)"
2020-08-27 1:57,"Nicholas,

Of all the columnists i relate to you the most. Because of all the writers you have a perspective of human beings being one amongst many living things on the planet.

Others wrangle over the 'unborn' but you also wrestle with the issues of other living things. I will never forget your mentioning  how growing up on a farm when selecting a duck for the pot, its mate always stepped forward to protest.

And you are spot on with your criticizing Trumps handling of the pandemic. He should be fired for it.

But i have posted numerous comments I have about Dem positions.  Some had few recommendations and others quite a few recommendations.

Regardless all have been cancelled/removed, along with the many people who responded. Some in agreement, some in disagreement.

so for me it is really a tough decision. Trumps  troubling, puzzling response to the pandemic or the Dems cancel culture. 

 Which would cause more death and harm in the long run is not clear. The pandemic will end, but the suppression of honest educated view points is potentially more harmful.

Both sides seem to pick the science  that complements their political position. The Dems feel more dangerous than the pandemic is climate change. yet, they never mention population.

I would love for you to weigh in on these things.

thanks,
Ben"
2020-08-27 1:57,"One thing, Nick, that you have failed to mention is that America sat on its hand while NYC had to get its act together. What the left seems to be asking of Trump is to have him ask Americans to sit out longer than the Germans.  And I’m not sure that’s a sign of failure from American leadership. 

The other thing that Nick seems to conveniently leave out of this discussion is that the American GDP losses are less severe than our Euro counterparts.  Thus, there seems to be a confirmation bias in the reporting here."

2020-08-27 2:12,many Trump supporters did not vote FOR Trump but AGAINST the Washington DC establishment they feel has betrayed them.   They WANTE Trump to 'burn things down'.  They wanted an outsider who promised to change things because neither party establishment has helped THEM over the las 50 years.  Both parties supported globalization and the export of jobs and industry.  In their eyes the existing political establishment pandered to Wall Street while killing Main Street.  The rich got very rich and the rest got poorer.   Trump pandered to  these voters.   They have not changed their minds - and it matters little if they believe Trump.  They think he's doing a great job bringing the DC establishment down.  Unfortunately they really have no idea what they're supporting.   They want the current system destroyed without knowing what will result.

How can a seven day average in the low teens be a 1/32 of that of the US, which is around (over?) a 1000 a day? There is at least a factor 2 missing here, and beyond the cold math that means that twice as many people lives have been lost or, for those of their relatives, friends, neighbors, affected forever. Statistics is heartless, but even more so without accuracy."
2020-08-27 2:26,"I don't believe Trump used the right word in his sentence when he said ""We did the exact right thing."" He should have said ""We did the exact predictable thing by blaming someone else."" 

When he blames someone else, he then can say that  he takes  no responsibility for the problem. And that...he readily admits."
2020-08-27 2:44,"You just can't forget to mention China suppressing the virus, but intentionally neglected to acknowledge the fact China has done everything right to control the spread of the virus in a nation with the largest population in the world. I wonder why. The U.S., the most advanced and developed country in the world in terms of tech, medicine, becomes the epicenter of the pandemic. 

No one knows the nature of the virus at the beginning of the stage. Everyone was trying to learn about the virus, even now. Let's focus on the US and the current administration, and we call the free society, people refuse to wear masks for the claim of civil rights. But Chinese people understand what comes first when under crisis, your obligation for the society and other people not some kind of rights."
2020-08-27 2:51,"I am not defending Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, which has been atrocious. While not religious, I would even depict his refusal to wear a mask or advocate mask wearing as sinful. People have died because of Trump’s deficient and cruel management.

This does not justify misleading facts such as:

Why does the United States have 4 percent of the world’s population and 22 percent of coronavirus deaths?

Well in addition to President Trump’s failures, we are also a densely populated international destination with various freedoms that preclude a massive lockdown. America also has  comparatively robust testing and tracking capacity. 

Do you really think India, population 1 billion, has had fewer deaths from COVID? Don’t you think maybe it’s because their testing and hospitals are substandard. The United States also can’t just force people to stay home like China, which has doubtless underreported their death toll. Finally, our cities teem with people from all over the world. No one wants to go to sub-Saharan Africa, which is why they have so few cases—not due to superior leadership. 

Trump deserves blame for the coronavirus response. Misleading stats are not necessary to convey that."
2020-08-27 2:55,"The president treated the pandemic as a public relations challenge, instead of a public health challenge. 176,000 dead and counting.  Most of the world will not allow travelers from the US.  Millions out of work, not knowing how to pay the rent or put food on the table. If this was a successful handling of a public health crisis, I'd hate to see a failure."

As always, Trump deflects the news cycle, but unfortunately  the preoccupation with the coronavirus totally diminished the dire climate change issue facing the entire planet.

2020-08-27 3:01,"Here is clever and elegant reason that falls on deaf ears of Trump voters.  Remember that hypothetical shooting on 5th Avenue?  Trump seemingly eternally says whatever he wants that will benefit him, and he gets away with it from his seemingly eternal support/ enabling networks of various kinds.  The biggest one in recent years is comprised of those voters.  Edsall's current piece in the NY Times is one discussion of that factor.  Mary Trump's book goes back to the family--the Trump family, although maybe there's another ""family,"" too.  There's yet another group that's been waiting for nearly four years--the popular majority that never wanted Trump.  This year, we in even larger numbers all across the country must vote OUT Trump and all of his Republican enablers."

All the misfortunes and injustices invited onto us these four years are nothing compared to what could have happened had our great leader not been in charge.  For if this wasn't the best of all possible world's then that must mean Trump isn't a good leader, and possible a no good very bad leader indeed.

Somehow a large segment of the country still believes this Panglossian optimism.  Perhaps we should be reading Candide now, just like we should have been reading Poe's The Masque of the Red Death during the spring when Trump was going to keep the disease in foreign countries by closing us off."
2020-08-27 3:33,"Mass delusions have a tendency to propagate their own existences, swollen on their own momentum, well beyond the time when the purposes they initially serve are gone and forgotten--whatever those may be.

But they don't tend to diffuse and peter out.  Usually, they collapse quickly and all at once, due to some unforeseen, unexpected occurrence or trigger, meaning it's well nigh impossible to predict.  And all too often that occurrence or trigger is something disastrous.

2020-08-27 3:55,"It took 14 years for the United States to accumulate 58,220 deaths from the Vietnam War, a conflict that divided the nation and placed it on a course that most of us regret.  
Nicholas Kristof's analysis across his column is excellent.  He makes crystal clear sense, adding data, interpretation, and comes to sound conclusions.  If we could rely on a gathering of Kristof's that would lead to a consensus and assure us of defeating Trump in November, we would be better off.  
We would be better off if we could be assured that there were voters on Trump's see who might lean in Biden's direction, who would be amenable to rational argument, and who would consider changing their votes.  
I would argue that Trump has nearly accomplished what we all fear: the destruction of verifiable facts that build rational arguments in favor of effective policies.  Trump has brought a significant percentage of our fellow citizens to see little difference between facts and opinions.  The fact that a sitting president can suggest ludicrous remedies for a pandemic was unthinkable until this summer.  Ingesting disinfectant and infusing light in the human body might be effective, or that taking snake oil remedies like oleandrin are realistic therapies?  Amazing!!
In effect, Trump is responsible for nearly three times the number of Vietnam War dead (177,759), a death toll that took took 14 years to amass.  Does that sound like ""the right thing""?  Apparently to his supporters.  And yet he is a candidate!"
2020-08-27 3:56,"I am sitting having lunch today, a TV broadcasting a news program run by the cable company.  Several representatives from Orlando theme parks are discussing why it is a good thing they are reopened and how safe it is to visit them, and blah, blah.  I shake my head in disbelief.  A woman standing (I'm seated) says ""I'm a Republican"" and proceeds to explain all the reasons that it is right to reopen the parks, basically that they employ 1000s and now those people can pay their mortgages etc, as if people working in those theme parks make enough to qualify for mortgages in and around Orlando, but that's another story.  We are blessed to have a Trump sycophant as Governor with little or no coherent Covid policy other than get everything open, including schools despite the fact that just a month ago were were registering over 5000 new cases EACH AND EVERY DAY.  Not only suggesting school openings but threatening withholding state Education funding to schools that don't open."

And that can happen when Americans have the discipline at all levels, government to self-discipline, that the Germans have. 

Blunders from president down abound, but the de-centralized US form of government as well as the personality traits that used to be touted as being positive, make it difficult for the US to prevail here.

I also suggest that op-ed columnists avoid comparisons with other countries, as when one examines local newspapers, it turns out that even those countries with successes have less than is portrayed in a capsulized version in the US press.

Speak to some of the people in those countries you cite Mr. Kristof. They paint a far less rosy picture than you have in your comparison."
2020-08-27 4:05,"This country is done. It is irretrievably split and the two conventions have encapsulated that perfectly.

Now we will stumble along for another several decades until the decision to form two countries is made, Red and Blue. It will be a good decision. Both sides will be the better for it.

I will be quite happy to never have Iowa or Arkansas or West Virginia impact an important governmental decision and I am sure those states feel the same way about New England or New York or California.

2020-08-27 4:06,"Nicholas Kristof has presented some statistics that raise questions, but we still must dig deeper to understand the outcomes in different countries.
If New Jersey had the same rate of deaths as China, 30 would have died instead of 16,020, while if New York had the same outcomes as China, 65 would have died instead of 32,987.
Kristof's article does not explain these statistics.
In terms of deaths per million, Germany is at over 110, while China is at less than 3.5, and China does not have the best record.
Shouldn't we question why the German government failed although China was slammed first by the new virus, and Chinese scientists sounded the alarm about symptom-less transmission in January, before the CDC and the Surgeon General advised against masking by ordinary people?
Kristof does not explain these differences. Hyper-partisanship aside, historians and other intellectuals might generate the answers."
2020-08-27 4:07,"There is only one statistic that matters here.  The USA has 5% of the world's population.  The USA has 25% of the world's COVID-19 deaths.

Number of tests, rates of positive tests, percentages of deaths per percentage of positive tests are irrelevant.

5% and 25% are the only important figures.  And the reason can be laid squarely at the feet of Donald Trump and his chaotic and dangerous response, aided by his feckless son-in-law and enabled by the GOP.

And now Pence is claiming that the USA will have the world's first safe and effective vaccine by year's end?  In your dreams."

This is both satirical and a statement of fact."
2020-08-27 4:35,I have in years past had a side effect from a drug that was prescribed which damaged my body and after a conversation with the makers of the drug they said to get FDA approval they tested 1000 people and 40 had side effects that was a major problem so it was approved to a majorty that it would help. That would be .004 percent that had issues and like the commercials there can be bad side effects. So does that mean with a .004. Approval if a vaccine for covid comes out maybe 15 million Americans my suffer from major health issues or more since it will be a rapid turnaround. We all know this whole thing was new and all had no Idea on how to deal with it and are at the point to its a guessing game and all are critics and the experts are at their best only to say we will try to find out but it changes daily.So its sad as the toll grows maybe we may do more harm fighting it as it has done to us. As well how many of the toll had underlying conditions that may of run up the numbers.

One statistic from the War that seemed appropriate to mention when the U. S.  death toll from Covid-19 passed an astonishing 180,000 souls earlier this week.   

It reminded me that it took 11 years (1964-1975) for the War to take the lives 58, 200 servicewomen and men. The current occupant of the White House tripled the death toll from the War in less than six months!   

Thus, and on this failure alone, no reasonable person could consider keeping him in the White House for another four  years."
2020-08-27 4:51,"Trump has now strong-armed the CDC into changing it's rules about Covid testing by claiming it's not necessary to test people who have been exposed but are asymptomatic.  As a result of reduced testing and the resulting under-count of people testing positive, Trump can then claim that positive cases in the U.S. are dropping (right before the election, by coincidence).

I used to think the CDC was one of the more respected federal agencies -- not any more.  Then again, why should the CDC be any different from any of the other agencies led by Trump cronies.  Welcome to the banana republic of the United States of America."
2020-08-27 4:59,"While everything you write is true, the map to Trump's reelection goes via Kenosha, not the RNC, and he will exploit it to four more years of grifting, dividing and bleeding the US dry, unless the Joe and Kamala can respond quickly and forcefully to the challenge.

2020-08-27 5:00,"The biased and altered reality of the liberal media focusing on the failings of the president has the effect of adding to the death toll. 
So why does the Western Europe have 3 percent of the world’s population and 19 percent of coronavirus deaths?
If columnists at the Times read the stories printed in their own paper, they might actually be able to inform the public instead of constantly spouting propaganda 
""It’s not surprising that Germany — led by a disciplined scientist, Angela Merkel — has done particularly well, with a death rate now only one forty-eighth that of the United States."" 
The story on Germany, as printed in this paper, is that it is primarily the states and localities that handle the response to the crisis. Sure, Merkel helped by adding some funds, and encouraging public cooperation, but in some cases, she was actually late in implementing measures or calling the country to task. Not only did states and localities lead, but they didn't have a bunch scientists and experts at the federal level preventing them from testing in February. The story in the US is that the biggest blunder of the pandemic which created extra deaths was the fault of trained scientists, and Federal control of the response, disallowing state tests. Furthermore, Germany has more deaths per million than nationalist Poland, Hungary, and Belarus. So?
""If Trump had managed the pandemic as well as Merkel, some 143,000 American lives could have been saved.""

As interesting as herd immunity looks, I'd want to know why these trends correlate. Why does bad political leadership on a global scale almost always produce disease on a global scale? If you look back through history, and UConn's and the Seshat Project's Peter Turchin has done so painstakingly, these trends persist. It's almost like nature is applying a braking mechanism or something."

In fact cancer screenings can increase fatalities due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, particularly if the treatments are ineffective and dangerous, as many cancer treatments are.

Thus there has been a legitimate debate about whether PSA screenings for prostate cancer are effective or simply result in maiming thousands of men unnecessarily. If you eliminated radical prostatectomies the balance might be more favorable (radiotherapy has fewer side effects and is equally effective).

Rudolf Giuliani is a typical victim of the fallacy that longer survival after early diagnosis proves that screening saves lives (called lead-in bias). In fact, age specific mortality for prostate cancer has hardly declined despite decades of screening and aggressive treatment."
2020-08-27 5:34,"We may be on course to top the Civil War for deaths by Jan. 20, largely because 51 Republican senators didn't have a problem with Trump putting his own political fate above the security of our country (Ukraine). 

He's prioritized his re-election over the lives of hundreds of thousands of us. The nation will be paying for decades, not just in mortality and other physical health effects but our mental health as well. 

The celebration of himself he's producing this week is terrifying because participants are telling us the problem is over, Trump handled it perfectly, and it's time to get back on the economic rocket they believe he created.

None of it's true, and the only way to stop the gaslighting is to hook Trump offstage."
2020-08-27 6:05,"New Zealand is also going through an election campaign. The government of Jacinda Ardern is facing heavy criticism over its handling of the Covid virus.
No NZ deaths for months. A resurgence of cases of 2 per million of population per day,  with everyone infected and close contact in managed isolation. Equivalent to around 660 cases per day in the entire US.

2020-08-27 6:20,"America's greatness, and its achilles heel, is freedom. The US does not have mandatory ID cards for its citizens. It allows freedom of speech way beyond what is tolerated in most democratic countries. it will stare violent protests in the face and call them peaceful. American citizens will not be controlled as they are elsewhere. Hence it is hardly surprising that Americans are far less disciplined in their behavior and vastly more likely to ignore guidelines, even common sense. As well, the often murky boundaries between state and federal responsibilities make it nearly impossible to pursue, let alone, enforce, a common policy that might mitigate the spread of a virus like COVID-19.    Yes, America has 22 percent of coronavirus deaths for only 4 percent of the world's population. It also has 30% of the world's wealth. Freedom has its pluses and its minuses."

From the very beginning, the mantra of  Trump and his appalling administration has been “When we make a mistake, we do not learn from it, we double down.” And that “guiding principle” has resulted in the deaths of 180,000+ Americans. There are no words."
2020-08-27 7:49,"Nicholas Kristof is a fabulous columnist. This piece is superb--with one notable exception.

Mr. Kristof compares Donald Trump to Angela Merkel, and writes that ""143,000 American lives could have been saved.""

Let's be clear: that's a nice way of saying that 143,000 people died because of Trump's ineffectiveness.

In all candor, I don't know if it's fair to compare Trump to Merkel. However, people have died because Trump and his administration weren't prepared to handle this pandemic. They've mishandled things for months.

People have died as a result of Donald Trump's failures. I'm a firm believer in the 80-20 rule, so I'd say that 20% of the death are directly attributable to Trump. That's about 36,000 people, and that number will continue to rise."
2020-08-27 8:16,"Merkel gets a bit too much praise here.
Firstly, she let her health minister take charge and intervened only sporadically.
Secondly, health issues are not a federal responsibility in Germany. The regions call the shots.
And as Germany is rather tribal the regions made quite a mess of the Covid response. Merkel at best moderated and finally actually gave that up.
Germany did well because it has an excellent health care system, it prepared early, Germans are generally rational people who follow rules (unlike for example Italians) and the major hotspots were in Bavaria which is led by a politician who wants to be decisive and lead from the front.
Merkel was, as almost always, a bystander waiting for others to make mistakes."
2020-08-27 8:34,"One should not forget the role of Trump's supporters. Republicans like Trump who place political expediency and the retention of

The rise of cases in June in states such as Florida are a direct
result of reopening too soon -- Trump supporters acting as
Trump egged them to.

 Why? Trump's only lens is that of re-election and this seen  by opening the economy no matter what the cost. As for  supporters 
like deSantis political elevation.

This is not about conservative versus liberal thinking, nor is it

Why are Americans being denied entry in many countries who have their COVID fairly controlled? Why is the US still in the first wave when others have moved on and are waiting and preparing for a catastrophic fall season. Could any of it be due to a Trump/Pence incompetency?

Less than four years, and this country has deteriorated to a point that many of us can no longer recognize it as our home, the nation where we were born, raised, educated; where we worked for decades and watched as it made progress towards a more just society. There surely have been setbacks: since the Reagan era, income inequality has become toxic and debilitating. Our police have become more akin to an occupying military force than a keeper of domestic peace and safety. Racial inequality is still baked in.

But we are a long way from the America of George Wallace and Lester Maddox of the ‘60s. Or at least we were until Trump and his minions seized power in 2016.

Four more years of this and it seems plain our experiment in democracy will be near the end. Anyone with eyes and ears open knows: this is not ‘the greatest country on Earth.’ It is failing to meet the needs of its people in so many ways: affordable housing, education, child care, health care, transportation, secure retirement. We are not safe, because the country is awash in hundreds of millions of guns. Our wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few; their wealth buys political power. Our current government is headed back to the 19th century.

- There is one cure for cancer
- Antibiotics will make infectious disease go away
- America is and will forever be exceptional
- Alcohol will help me be less depressed
- The right president will restore America, fix the economy, solve homelessness, poverty and a worsening environment

Things are never this simple.  The only guarantee we have is the Second Law of Thermodynamics: everything which can happen does so with an increase in entropy.  Less scientific readers might prefer Murphy's Law: whatever can go wrong will go wrong.

When Trump was asked at a press conference about the lie he told 150 times, he couldn't handle it and left the stage.  Let's see him walk out of a debate!"

But how to conduct a dialogue with 57% of Republicans who feel that 170,000 deaths (when the poll was taken) is a reasonable number? 

The staggering inhumanity of one man has pushed us to the brink. It seems that a mass of his followers have already taken the leap. 

Where, when, and how did these people abdicate any shred of humanity?"

This edition of the quadrennial Republican National Convention will be the object of profound curiosity and derision and jaw-dropping perplexity fifty years from now. That is, if there's an America that has something like a two party system and an engaged, intellectual coterie of doctors, scientists, and other medical professionals who will perhaps, by then, had to deal with offshoots of the Covid-19 that has so violently (and maybe permanently) altered our lives.

But this president can hog the stage and the lies and have the entire Republican Party behind him, singing hosannas and strewing roses in his path towards another four years. Not once, in the first two nights, has the death count been mentioned, nor the number of infections.

I cannot imagine even Richard Nixon, were he the steward overseeing a pandemic, dodging responsibility for the thing that unceremoniously landed on his doorstep. Nor (gulp!) Ronald Reagan.

In Donald Trump, we truly have sui generis. 

We've not heard, from him, ""I'm sorry."""
2020-08-27 11:36,What’s fascinating is that the Trump team can’t seem to simply do what would be best. They have to employ a sort of hocus pocus to delude people into believe everything is in control. It’s just not in their nature to be honest. A con or be conned approach to everything.
2020-08-27 11:07,"You’re looking at this the wrong way. America leads the western world in Covid deaths per capita. Leading is winning isn’t it? Trump has championed small government, which turns out to still cost a lot of money but that’s not his fault. Who knew? Trump’s supporters (some call them marks) know they he’ll defend their God-given right to opt out of contributing to pandemic defense by wearing masks. We got rid of the draft so only pros populate the military. It follows that only medical workers need masks. I am confident that America will achieve herd immunity in Trump’s second or third term with no more than one million deaths. Maybe  two, or a few more, but anyway far fewer than died of flu under Obama or would have died if left wing pencil neck medical “experts” were calling the shots in a Hillary administration."
2020-08-27 12:20,"In France, Denmark or Holland a vast public health system exists that assembles the best expertise available and is able to create some centralised policy response to e.g Covid. It is far from perfect but the systems learn fast. Trying to avoid chaotic and contradictory responses is the product of a health infrastructure that many Nations do not (yet) have, the USA included.Accessible health care for the masses is vital, as is some central authority that assures a fair distribution of health services. No US President can take the place of such a complex infrastructure. Look at structural defects that prevent solid policies in the USA ; projecting infrastructure capacity on one functionary seems naive to me."
2020-08-27 0:44,"“So why does the United States have 4 percent of the world’s population and 22 percent of coronavirus deaths?”


Because even the coronavirus knows how great the USA is and wants to be here more than anywhere else in the world."

America's loss and Scotland's gain. 

So if you want medical information take it from Devi, not Trump."
2020-08-27 2:54,"The sad fact is that many American citizens will be fooled by these misrepresentations because too few of them understand basic algebra and statistics. 

For example, when an official says something like ""we're getting this virus under control because the rate of increase is coming down"", how many people realize that this means the count is still going up? 

Or when the president says that the virus is harmless to 99% of the people who catch it, when we know that 3% of them die? How on earth can anyone believe that?

We shouldn't teach arithmetic in school any more. We have phones and computers for that. Instead we should give students just a taste of algebra and statistics, then our politicians wouldn't get away with this kind of chicanery any more."
2020-08-27 12:24,"Mr. Kristof,   Trump's conscious ego may distort the facts and be self-deceived by desires to remain the President, self-esteem, etc.  He has not developed an individual life apart from an image of a deal-maker,  a guy that gets things done.  He has not achieved a satisfactory personal life, but is still ""trailing clouds of glory.""  What he (and he is definitely not alone) is lacking is a personal relation to the world.   No human life consists in only in the personal.  To earn a living, have children, and take one's place in the society is not enough.  Every one of us, men and women must attain a broader understanding of life, if he/she is not be suffocated in the childishly personal."
2020-08-27 1:19,"Mr. Kristof: You rightfully claim to come from a predominantly white rural part of America.

How would your column convince neighbors as the once you just visited in Oregon to vote for Biden-Harris?

You need to use the power of your pen to effect a change. This case, as terrible as it is, is dismissed by too many of Trump Voters. This case will not effect any change.

I say all this with a sense of urgency. The clock is ticking, somebody must deactivate the bomb. You and your writing won't. Too little, too late."
2020-08-27 7:39,"It's gotten beyond the point where anything Trump does will not change his base support because they see him as a vehicle to get to the ""libs"" and the ""media.""  The lower he goes the more they like him.  And because of the outdated electoral college, these folks will be running America for the foreseeable future."
2020-08-27 10:10,"If Mr Kristof wants to make the point that the United States has handled the pandemic badly, he should compare the American response to that of a neighboring country very similar to the United States. Canada has a an average daily case rate of 418 (about 4000 adjusted for population) 1.1 per 100,000 of population compared with a 42,345 average daily case rate and 13 per 100,000 of population. Truly an astounding difference as Canadian school children get ready to go back to school. So the answer to controlling the virus, Americans, is on your doorstep, no need to look to Europe and Asia. Oh I forget, Americans are presently barred from entering Canada but there is always the internet."
2020-08-27 1:22,"What is it with the Grand Old Party and those that believe that Trump is the anointed one? If one cares to look down under, our conservative side of Australian politics is arguing for a relaxation in the requirements that have been proven to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and, in the process, saved many from the ravages of this disease, even for those that survive it. I live in Western Australia where our lives are lived to near 'normality' whereas in our Eastern States, particularly Victoria, it has spread at an alarming rate due to an easing in restrictions and what appears to be poor decision making by both government, bureaucrats and selfish individuals. This disease knows no political allegiance and kills or harms too many to not be taken as a serious threat. The fact that Trump and those other sycophants who have become afflicted with the real Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome failed to respect and deal with COCVID-19 as the enemy to all, illustrates how the Republicans have lost their way and are no longer fit for office."

Now we watch in horror, as four to five times as many Americans have died as most other industrialized nations. This is criminal negligence of the highest order. Yet almost every elected Republican official in the USA has not only stood by, they have not had the courage to act against what any patriot would know is criminality and negligence of the highest order. I feel like I'm watching a beloved relative self-destruct before my eyes."

What the fact checkers do is important, but I have a sad feeling, that the people who will read the corrections, are those of us, who could have already done an at least fair job of writing them ourselves, because we read, and study factual information. 

Like many, I get angry at the media because their language can seem so artful when they describe lies and distortions. They have a hard job to get it right in these horrible times where wholesale propaganda and the attempted erasure of reality in what they face.

Not buying your spin. Not buying your fatalism."

Today, one of my students emailed me to say she had tested positive for the virus and had been instructed to leave campus and quarantine for 14 days. She won’t fall behind in my class because I opted to teach virtually, but she’s frantic about keeping up in her face-to-face classes. This academic year, she will doubtless be among many dismayed, tearful, desperate students, whose predicament I lay entirely at trump’s careless feet. But as long as he can wade through the corpses—whose number increases by one more every 90 seconds—to stand in front of a schoolhouse and hold up a math book, he is happy. What a terrible excuse for a leader. What an even worse excuse for a human being."
2020-08-27 12:33,"A sad reality.  We see the disclaimer often--not a true story,  based on actual events.  But how do we get people who don't want to see or acknowledge or examine reality to at least have a dialogue?  Because if we don't talk about it there is certainly no viable path forward."
2020-08-27 12:33,"To our credit, Americans enjoy so many safety nets that many of us believe just being an American protects us and keeps our physical health nearly as impregnable as the unprecedented number of freedoms we enjoy. In particular, the right to bear arms, rooted in the colonists' militancy against all those coveting stakes in the New World, exaggerates and insulates an American's sense of his individual power from the reality of his mortality. Those Americans farthest removed from their families' roots in Europe and elsewhere--now concentrated in red states--share the fantasy of American exceptionalism and absolute freedom most frequently of all. Contradicting the recommendations of the world's leading experts, even to the extent of endangering the lives of you and your family (i.e., not wearing masks, hosting parties, etc.), is the height of insanity, but so is handing headstrong, impulsive, poorly-educated man-beasts the right to contemplate going out of this vale of tears in a haze of bullets. Too many reach the same conclusion: since they are free to contemplate such a deed, they HAVE NOTHING to lose, a conclusion that can tragically render their lives and those of their fellow Americans worthless."

 And, unfortunately for us, which political candidate markets best?  This marketing mindset reaches deeply into every crevice of our society.  Additionally, there has been a systemic ""dumbing down"" of American education for the past 40 years.  Did we think this wasn't going to have an impact on our zeitgeist?  That effect is huge.  So many people get their knowledge from Facebook, etc.  So many people simply cannot SYNTHESIZE information critically.  While some people will say this is elitist, it amazes me that this is what a basic education USED to offer.  And now it is considered elitist.  Our newfangled society has led us to this administration, all seductively wrapped up in glitzy marketing, and smoke and mirrors.  It has taken years to get here, and we were led here by the Kardashians, Facebook, Twitter and a distaste for serious and deep education.  Why are so many people satisfied with not wanting to pursue actual knowledge, and DO THE WORK of real learning?  The present state of our country has cut me to the core.  It is the disappointment of my life."

2020-08-27 4:29,"After reading Mr. Kristof’s article,  I am still waiting for someone to explain why Trump is responsible for the death of almost 180,000 Americans.  The virus came from China, not Trump Towers.  Democrats failed with the Russia conspiracy,  Ukraine and impeachment.  This is yet another attempt to place blame on Trump.  This better work, as the Democrats are running out of ideas.  

Kristof,  you understand that 180,000 Americans result in less than 1 percent of the US population? For this fraction we have closed down our schools, businesses and churches.  Children, the most innocent victims of this political battle will suffer  greatly.   Please check the guidance issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Some sobering  statistics for  Mr. Kristof.  USNews reported in September 2019 that obesity causes  “one in five deaths in the U.S. each year”.  Who do we blame for that?  Michelle Obama for her failed Let’s Move campaign?  The CDC tells us that in 2018, more than 67,300 Americans died from drug overdose.  Yes, a small number by comparison. However, unlike Covid, the opioid crisis stems from the US.  Maybe it’s time to rein in the medical industry, known for handing  out drugs in exchange for kickbacks from the pharmaceutical firms.  Finally, the American Cancer Society cites more than 606,000 deaths in 2019.  While the types of Cancer range, we can pin definite blame on certain industries.  Big tobacco for one.  There must be a Republican there somewhere to blame!"
2020-08-27 5:15,"I truly don’t understand why not a single person in the administration has not quit in protest or shame over the pandemic response and the latest CDC testing proclamation that asymptomatic people don’t need to be tested.  You don’t have to be a doctor to know that if you have been near an infected person you should be tested.  We are not stupid.  We cannot reopen work or school without testing.  Do the individuals working in the administration realize they are killing people?

Instead of removing funding from schools that won’t go back in person and forcing workers to go back without protection, Trump could have helped establish a national testing strategy so that business and schools had security to return.  Instead, he is doing all he can to limit testing.  Some day people will believe the things he says out loud.  It is too horrible to think that a President would accelerate the killing of Americans but that is what he is doing to get re-elected.  

Maybe when he talks about cutting Social Security and Medicare, people ought to believe him.  He certainly intends to take away health care."

I guess people believe the pandemic is a hoax because they haven't seen anyone die, its like saying WWII was a hoax because they didn't see any German soldiers!"

He gas lights in saying the only way he loses if the election is rigged, but his position of power has allowed him to manipulate CDC guidelines for testing, get a lackey to run the USPS, coerce people in his administration to violate the Hatch Act, and who knows what else.  The truth is its a no-win situation.  If Joe Biden wins, Trump and his supporters are going to burn the country down in short time before he departs , if Trump wins he and those he is most influenced by (ie Hannity and Carlson) will burn it down over four more years.

That 35-40% of the country is more or less satisfied with Donald Trump's anti-leadership -- when the United States has 5 times the deaths of the World's per capita average -- is the best measure of the effectiveness of the three-headed propaganda machine: Fox News; Talk Radio and the Trump's never-ending tweetstorm.

OSHA spent 6 years putting together airborne infectious disease regulations that would make hospitals and nursing homes safer in preparation for future pandemics. The Obama administration ordered these to be implemented in 2017. Then the Trump administration eliminated them as part of wide sweeping deregulations. (NPR article from May 26, 2020, ""Trump team killed rule designed to protect health workers from pandemic like Covid-19)

Now, the Trump administration is shamelessly trying to take credit for helping nursing homes. The latest press release from the CMS .gov website on August 25 is appalling, including statements like, “From the beginning of this pandemic, President Trump has worked tirelessly to protect our vulnerable elderly in nursing homes. The provisions in today’s rule on nursing homes represent his expectation that CMS pull every available regulatory lever to maximize nursing home residents’ safety and quality of life. These Americans and their families, who have already gone through so much, deserve nothing less.”"

The Trump administration on the other hand is a banana-republic kind of autocracy, incompetent, corrupt and greedy to pathological levels. It exists in a parallel universe made of lies, fantasies, delusions and propaganda that is nothing like anything coming out of China."

But I don't pity the guy when he's caused such mayhem."

At least that's what one would expect to be the case. But I'd like to hear from a Trump-supporter who has lost someone to Covid-19. Maybe they still don't believe it was from the pandemic or partly due to Trump's inadequate response? Or maybe they still wouldn't care that going on 200K people have died?

Pence spoke today about law and order, when in perspective this is the most lawless administration. The protests in the streets and in sports venues, tell us that we have lost control.

2020-08-27 12:18,"The RNC convention isn't about addressing any truths that is the enemy of the Trump administration.  It is about selling themselves by solidifying their base by telling them what they want to hear.  That beyond everything else, Trump will protect their protected status as white Christians.  It is a completely coded event.  ""Law and order"" isn't about maintaining law and order it is about who controls who.  They don't mention what people are  protesting.  We had the greatest economy before the pandemic.  We borrowed a trillion dollars to have the economy before any of the covid relief bills.  If we are borrowing a trillion to pump into the economy it better pick up. That is until you have to start paying that loan back. This by the party who when a democrat is elected can't stop taking about deficits.  I hope the democrats can both educate the voters they need to persuade.  Republican hypocrisy is glaring and should be exposed at every turn.  One because it isn't for the benefit of the great majority of people in this country and second it is just cruelty."
2020-08-27 12:52,"At the start of Covid, WHO and the CDC gave out bad information about the seriousness of the disease. There were plenty of conflicting opinions including dr Fauci’s regarding the usage of the masks and the ways to avoid getting infected. 
Like other politicians, Palosi and Cuomo also followed their advice yet took no blame for it

Trump did a good job replenishing of supplies, helping to retool factories to do so. It helped  lower the death rate. You are comparing apples and oranges when comparing the entire worlds population to that of the USA. 
The main reason for our high infection rate is that we are a very mobile society we cherish our freedom of choice and we have the money and means to travel. 

Trump at times uses wrong words to express himself, but when it came to actions he did all the right things. It is unfair to blame him for the death of our citizens"
2020-08-27 12:58,"It pains me to see what is happening to my beloved country. All the Corona virus deaths are only a symptom of what has been happening these last 40 years. It is the ultimate result. When a society doesn't pay attention to the needs of all members of a society, dissension is the result. Usually when countries go into swift decline, it is the result of inner divisions. I don't need to go into all the details. Nicholas Kristof has already mentioned most of them in his prior columns. The election campaign of the current party in power is only greatly intensifying an already volatile situation. I pray that we can keep our democracy."
2020-08-27 12:59,"The challenge of a free society is that people are allowed to act stupidly.  Further, that challenge is increased in a multi-cultural society, where people's opinions vary greatly and there is no uniformity of actions.  It is impossible to force the citizens in the US to march lock-stock-and barrel to any decree, and regardless of who was president our numbers would likely have been worse than for any other country.  On the other hand, it is our country, and that horrible system called capitalism, that has responded most vigorously to the material needs to fight the pandemic; masks, gloves, shields, ventilators, and a vaccine.  The president can not create those products, but our government's financial support of such efforts will likely lead the world to a cure and ending of the pandemic.  NONE of the countries that are purportedly doing better in handling COVID will provide such a positive outcome."
2020-08-27 13:00,"Yes, the subhead of this column asks exactly the right question. Why does the United States have 4 percent of the world’s population and 22 percent of the world’s confirmed coronavirus deaths? 

I've been waiting for months for one single reporter to ask this of the president or anyone in the administration. This question punctures the entire administration narrative about their disastrous response to this crisis."
2020-08-27 13:02,"One thing that makes me smile is that Trump likes to boast about the number of deaths per confirmed cases - and then he wants to reduced then number of tests. He does not even understand that confirming fewer cases will cause that particular death ratio to rise.

The figures we should be proclaiming is the simple deaths per 100k. <a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality"" target=""_blank"">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</a> is a good source. America (54.93), Canada (24.67), Germany (11.20). It is not quite ""America First"" in the world, but we are very far from being best."
2020-08-27 13:08,"One other ""enemy"" that Donald Trump has suddenly forgotten to blame for everything wrong in the economy and stock markets is the Fed.
He and his minions have gone radio silence on his appointee to head the Federal Reserve.  Why?
It is because the only reason the stock market has jumped back, during a pandemic recession, is the Fed supporting the financial markets.  There is no other valid explanation for stocks to be flying higher...other than they are flushing cash into stocks by way of the banks, and buying private investments themselves.
What used to be the enemy of the republic, the unregulated Fed, the secret banking cabal that was working against all good republican party positions, is now effectively giving them a fighting chance in the election because the markets have not fallen 50% from their artificial highs in March.
No, the stock market is only doing well because of Donald Trump.  Just ask him!"

Not that the RNC we are witnessing is ""reality television."" Far from it. What the RNC has achieved goes beyond science fiction.  The Trump Follies have achieved a complete reversal of reality, a distorted mirror image of the world where everything you see is the reverse of what it actually is.  It's a skill that has nothing to do with governing and one that will lead to America's complete and utter destruction, but at least they will have ""owned the libs."""
2020-08-27 13:23,"Trump’s positive responses to the pandemic are few, but are typical of his governing style. For example, his banning travel from China is supposedly “courageous.” I have a hard time understanding why. But it was certainly easy: just say no. Toddlers just say no! Anytime Trump takes action, it’s like that. It’s separate, independent, short-lived and an order of sorts. Merkel, Arden, and leaders like them show that the art of governing is about building things. It’s about building coalitions, and cajoling rather than coercing. These are skills that Trump not only lacks, but can’t even comprehend. Even if you accept the drivel coming from the Infomercial/Convention, I defy you to identify anything Trump has built. Remember, even the Trump Organization doesn’t really build anything. It simply brands stuff."
2020-08-27 13:24,"I don’t think it’s trump. He’s only one man. He would have no power, no control over this situation were it not for the Republicans and the hordes of MAGA hats and flag wavers who continue to raise his pedestal high. The Republican convention is exhibit A. It’s like a different kind of pandemic: the same pathology that blinds from seeing climate change, and the other tragic pitfalls of capitalism. The fear of of socialistic programs such as national health care that we desperately need is yet another aspect of this pathology. It’s not trump."
2020-08-27 13:24,"I'll be a critic and say that the majority of those deaths were in the earlier wave of the virus that hit the northeast, and that there was an outsized proportion of them (a majority in many states actually) that occurred in nursing homes, which was something that the governors have control over, not the President (looking at you, Cuomo).

That said, yes, a national strategy has been lacking, and we are that much worse off for that. I think it was right that Trump closed the borders to the contestation of many calling him xenophobic at the time (which was a patently absurd response, parituclarly now that the same people are saying we should've done more earlier), then he squandered that time he bought by failing to organize resources. The lockdowns and the masks? Idk- those don't seem like a total panacea, and there is realistically no reason rural Oklahoma should've shut down when we were in the midst of the thing in NYC. The masks may help some but there are countries with lower masking rates than us in Europe faring better, so it's not an end all be all. Really the strongest point I have against the administration's response was failure to get rapid testing, get it early, and isolate."
2020-08-27 13:36,"All too true , Mr. Kristoff. But I wouldn't count out the Trump-Putin ticket just yet. In concert with the Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party, it will go to any lengths to stay in the White House. ( Notice I did not say win the Electoral College)."

The same is true of climate change impacts.  Corporations are feeling no heat, no flooding, no smoke, nothing.  In fact, many corporations are profiting during the climate crisis. 

The fact that corporations have no emotions, no family, are immune to diseases, and can always just seek bankruptcy protection if anything like a sickness hits them....well, that just means they are the kind of people we like.  We like people who don’t need health insurance.

This is such a hard fight.  But I’ll keep trying.  We need carbon pricing Mr. Kristoff."

2020-08-27 13:55,"Way back at the beginning of the pandemic they changed procedures at US airports forcing everyone to stand around in lines next to the people who’d just flown in from Europe and Asia.  Was that on purpose?  Trump seems to repeatedly cultivate the chaos and collapse that will allow him to steal the election— the pandemic, the evictions, the collapse of the postal service?"

2020-08-27 1:36,"I’m sure there are many of us, myself included, that lost loved ones during the pandemic due to other causes and have not been able to grieve with friends and family.

Plus all those whose life events have been disrupted and will never be the same. We’ve had two events (a wedding in Maine and a bachelorette party in Rhode Island) in New England recently that have turned into spreader events. One person from the wedding has died of COVID-19. This weekend would be Allston Christmas, that’s when all the college kids come back and most leases turn over so the streets in many parts of Boston are littered with all kinds of free stuff.

Even with excellent leadership the pandemic would be difficult, but Trump delusional and incompetent handling of it is taking all the interesting and joyful experiences from our lives. Now it is just a grim march to the chaos of the election, the only certainty being is that Trump will make that another horror show.

2020-08-27 14:14,"Before Covid our economy was great. Ignore what it is today. The fact we bungled the virus response and that caused the economic  crash is a minor point that should be ignored. 4 or 5% of the worlds population 22% of the worlds death by covid is a absolute fact. Not an opinion, not a ""well it depends on how you interpret the facts, no that is absolute reality.' Well that is not trumps fault, it is a deadly virus, what more could he have done? Well, maybe not pretend it was the flu and telling everyone that it would ""go away soon"" so we spent two months twiddling our thumbs instead of preparing.
     By January 2021 it looks like we will have 225k to 300k deaths from the virus.In one year. In the five years of WWII we had 416k deaths. Over 5 years. Trump is claiming he has done the best job ever in the response to the virus.You can't make this up, it is not a SNL skit, this is Trump's America."
2020-08-27 14:17,"The author asks, ""So why does the United States have 4 percent of the world’s population and 22 percent of coronavirus deaths?""

It should be also noted that the US has 4% of the world's population and 33% of it's Nobel laureates.

See ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country</a>""

The reasons for both: the US is a vast, complex and federally governed society with a deep tradition of civil liberties, entrepreneurship and law and order. This type of society produces may positives, such as great wealth and achievement, but also has costs, like managing a complicated pandemic. Beyond the initial missteps of failed CDC testing kits in February and the NY/NJ delay in stopping the runaway spread, the US response has been better managed."
2020-08-27 14:17,"Trump cannot chew gum and fix his hair at the same time. But Mitch McConnell helped in every way---except that he couldn't change how the White House operated internally. CDC had dozens of experts embedded with the WHO in Geneva; those experts sent back warnings, which were ignored. Nevertheless, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the pandemic, and hurricane Laura and the California fires, are working out well for the wealthy wing of Trump supporters. After all, those who can work at home can buy bigger homes and write off their office expenses. And the stock markets are just dandy for Trump family investors and their ilk. Can we name a cabinet member who hasn't become richer in 2020?"

The tricky terrain of presidential politics and the roads coursing thru it can be treacherous, tortuous, tenuous, trepidatious, torturous, and the conditions of travel can be tempestuous. For a US presidential aspirant, everything that moves can act as a bargaining chip, in one way or the other. 

Facts and figures apart, personal stories abounding in medical tragedies, bedsides creating lugubrious moments in the hearts of the listeners, can earn the rightful sympathies from the righteous. If those are harnessed in garnering votes for the incumbent POTUS, who is frequently portrayed as the savior of the Americans from the Stygian era by the right wingnuts, controversies can erupt like the Old Faithful Geyser of the Yellowstone. 

While many took to contumelious criticisms of the Dems in general, some were quite surprisingly equitable, in their approaches, at the lectern. Sugar-coated words were used by a few, nonetheless, but a goodwill gesture, for obvious reasons, can not be expected in this polemical place. 

Whatever said done, God bless those who had personal medical mishaps, but a healthy dose of skepticism from the opposite party might not be totally out of place. Or so it seems."

The reason that we never saw a ""self correction"" is that we never had a strategy.   While Trump attempt to rewrite history with this hilarious convention,  nothing has changed.   The Covid 19 death toll has risen and so have the future estimates.   

While Trump and his administration have testing and tracing the rest of us have nothing.   If he had just used the War Powers Act and unleashed the competency that exists in the United State a lot of lives would have been saved.

After all, the logic for the ignorant who believe this fool is that with less testing means there will be less of an infection rate.  That make sense, does it not?  As Nicholas points out, this maneuver is akin to the absurd theory that we can ""reduce cancer fatalities by ending cancer screening.""  If it weren't for a mammogram, I would be dead by now.  If it weren't for a PSA test, likewise for my husband.  

On NPR today, a pundit was opining what Pence will say this evening.  (I refuse to watch the convention, relying on the Times' writers to critique it.)  Re Covid-19, it appears that the go-to defense of Mr. Trump's woeful and failed handling of this pandemic is to ""just"" think how many more Americans would have died if it were not for him and his Czar Pence.  The sad and disgraceful truth is that Trump's base buys into all this.  Its fraudulent ""savior"" will take care of us all, from the unborn to, well, those White men and women who are corruptly greedy, bigots, racists, and/or Christian evangelicals."

Or the hottest years on record.  The things you mention derive from those two things.  As to Covid deaths:  You have to remember Trump supporters don't care about that.  He is the ""I could shoot 180,000 people on Fifth Ave"" president.  Because there is nothing Trump could do at this point that would turn them away from him.  He could walk in their front door, steal their valuables, rape their wives and children and on the way out say I was never here.  Obama did all this.

 Into that stepped a con man whose only talent is recognizing con games and exploitable situations when he sees them.  That's all Trump did and all he has ever done.  He recognized this country was just a big scam, and he was going to scam it for all it was worth.

Expecting Trump to do battle with Coronavirus, enlist science in the battle, or do anything to help the public or anyone other than himself, shows that after all these years, the editorialists of the NYT's still do not know what Trump is, or what he has done, or how it happened.

I dearly wish that the parallels of Trump's lies, his knowing enablers, his creeping madness, and the craven greed of his corporate and oligarch supporters were not such a polished mirror of 1930's Germany, cheered on by a mob of nincompoops who find the strutting of a strongman salves their inferiority complex.

The scary part of all of this is that Trump's approval rating remains in the mid-40's and right now polling suggests only 180 electoral votes are securely for Biden. As with the last election, polling was inaccurate as people did not disclose their intention to vote for Trump.  I hope Joe can get to 270, but until it happens, I view the forecasts of Trump's coming defeat as wishful."

Our only hope in this insane world is to do what healthcare workers did and do in the world of AIDS - universal precautions.  If you assume that everyone around you has the virus, you will mask, socially distance, and wash your hands until the threat of disease is gone, or we have appropriate testing and contact tracing."

He can say to his base ""we defeated the virus"" even as 40,000 Americans a day are reported infected.

But if 180,000 Americans are dead with 300,000 projected by the election ... and Trump still says ""we're winning!"" and his fawning toadies of a Republican party without a platform cheer ... and he gets away with it ...

From Psychology Today: ""How we respond to such people is up to us. The one mistake we should not make is to consider their persistent and rigid refusal to admit they’re wrong as a sign of strength or conviction, because it is the absolute opposite — psychological weakness and fragility.""

It is hard not to disparage those with whom we passionately disagree, especially the way those of us who despise Trump feel about his supporters, but maybe recognizing that their vehemence comes from a place of weakness, and not strength, will give us pause before vilifying them."

Two more cases reported
10 March: ‘It will go away’

But as spectacularly false as his statement is, it is emblematic of his entire presidency, and the sycophantic qualities of his voters. Americans have watched the same picture of their country these past four years. One group is horrified by what we've seen. The other group is thrilled.

And what drives Trump's (and I daresay his voters') view that ""we did everything right"" is the notion that they are the only ""real"" Americans. That  they may do whatever they want to do, no matter how dangerous the action, no matter how reckless the conduct, no matter how much they harm others. 

Trump voters have remained in lockstep with this mentally disturbed, willfully ignorant man for only one reason - he has given them the America they want. An America where he tells them they are favored and that laws don't apply to them.

And a nation cannot continue in this manner, when nearly half of us believe as Trump voters do. So the rest of us are left with a veritable Hobson's choice. We, the majority, may either continue to live under minority rule indefinitely, and be forced to live in a nation clearly sliding into fascism, or we may begin actions to partition this country, so that the majority of us can live in a true democracy. 

And I guarantee you, the former will be much more painful for us in the long run, than the latter."

At least ""Get Smart"" was a comedy.  This is not and it's frightening how many Republicans believe in Trump and the lies he tells.  

Trump and his administration have failed to rise to the occasion(s).  What do we have to show for the last 3.5 years?  No infrastructure project.  No improvement in health care or access to it.

Another point of comparison with the US is that we have a reasonably performant health system, whereas the US has an almost non existing health system (unless you have  private insurance or money in the bank).

Making sense is not the point.

Currently, the US death rate is about 555/1M, while Spain, the UK and Italy are slightly higher at around 600/1M (Belgium's is the highest at about 850).

Maybe scientists overestimate the fraction of the general population that is actually vulnerable to significant infection.  A few days ago in Wuhan there were pictures of people communally bathing and hugging each other and showing off to the world that they are not afraid of the virus anymore.  Maybe their first wave was so bad the virus has already harmed everybody it will.  Italy has good control now after their terrible experience in March.  The NY area seems good now which mystifies me a bit.   MAYBE the places that had bad first waves are not very vulnerable to later waves.  It would be great if my idea is correct.

For American voters who are weighing the option of who to vote for in November – who will Trump blame if he is given a second term, the death toll mounts ever more and turmoil continues to reign?

2020-08-27 15:41,"Short answer? Because we're prosperous enough to live to 90 in our country. Old people die from this disease disproportionately Nicholas. In one study of 50,000 COVID deaths, the median age of the deceased was 78. That's a longer life expectancy than about 150 countries around the globe. Many other rich nations are having high number of deaths as well. If people if your country die from malaria when they're 15, then they never live long enough to die from COVID at 85. Also - since COVID means dollars right now, many hospitals will list COVID as the cause of death even if it was tangentially related. Bacterial infections don't get you paid carte blanche. Put COVID on the medical bill and everything gets paid no questions asked. And the statistics can be easily massaged depending on your motivation. The bottom line is that the media needs to stop with the histrionics. I know it sells papers, and it is en vogue right now. But we need to resume working. Kids need to learn in the classroom. Lower income kids especially, whose parents can't afford private tutors. There is a very small subset which is truly in danger.

Finally, which scientists do you trust?  The ones in March who said no need for a mask?  Or the oncologists who now report the shut down has caused a spike in diagnoses of cancer?

Let's take Germany
""It’s not surprising that Germany — led by a disciplined scientist, Angela Merkel — has done particularly well, with a death rate now only one forty-eighth that of the United States.""
Yeah right. The story on Germany, as printed in this paper, is that it was up to the states and localities to handle the response to the crisis. Sure, Merkel helped by adding some funds, and encouraging cooperation of the public, but in some cases, she was actually late in implementing measures or calling the country to task. Not only did states and localities lead, but they didn't have a bunch scientists and experts at the federal level preventing them from testing in February. The story in the US is that biggest blunder of the pandemic that created extra deaths was the fault of trained scientists, and Federal control of the response, instead of allowing states to lead. 
Furthermore, Germany has more deaths per million than nationalist Poland, Hungary, and Belarus.

Are so many Americans that stupid?  Or, is there another reason they support a President that causes them great pain.  Why?  Why? Why?  I keep puzzling.  And no explanation I have read seems to explain it in a credible way.  Anyone have any ideas?"

2020-08-27 15:06,"Trump does not care how many Americans die from the virus, except as it affects his chances to hold on to power.  He is impervious to the suffering of others and feels no sense of responsibility to govern this country in times of crisis. Remember his paper towel toss in Puerto Rico? What responsible leader would demand that testing be reduced because testing would result in more cases being counted? Or suggest that the virus would just fade away? Or propose crackpot dangerous treatments? To Trump we are all just props in his never ending drama of self glorification. Why does his base hang on? Because they live in an echo chamber of Fox News, talk radio and social media. Trump once said he would run for president as a republican because republicans are dumb. He has also said he loves the ""uneducated"". He and his enablers know exactly what they are doing. Give the masses bread and circuses and they won't notice how much they are losing. Hence the denial of reality at the republican convention. Unfortunately, the stakes for this election are much higher than Trump's base realizes. This country cannot afford another 4 years of Trump. The coming  crises we will face as a county and world could be much worse than Covid19 and will require real leadership, not a carnival barker selling hate and lies."
2020-08-27 13:04,"Yes, Trump is a woeful leader who severely damaged our governmental infrastructure, and mismanaged a  deadly virus pandemic, resulting in his responsibility for tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. Those facts, on there own are frightening, but what is equally disturbing is our society's response to this virus.

Sturgis rally: 250k congregated in a small town, completely ignoring a raging pandemic. The results of this meeting are yet to be measured. A mega-church in California holds  sev- vices for 1500 people who ignore masks and distancing guidelines. College students--our supposed future leaders-- party with little concern for contamination of selves or others. Active Governors who are irresponsibly perpetuating a killer virus.

What kind of sick society have we wrought? What forces compels a large segment of our populace to keep shooting themselves in the foot? When did partisan politics overwhelm commonsense, common considerations and common decency?

We've a burden to carry with a man-- as dangerous as Trump--  president of our nation. However, what  can we do about our society? A society steeped in ignorance, irresponsible religious fervor, and rampant self indulgence?

Those societal problems will exist long after Trump is just an ugly smirch in our history."
2020-08-27 13:09,"Most world leaders crafted their responses to the pandemic based on strategies that could mitigate spread, save lives, and restore economic stability. Trump is not a leader, or a President. He is a grifter, a bigot, and a fraud. His strategy is, and always has been, to craft a strategy that would maintain absolute power, and continue to allow him to continue to make money by swindling tax payers and selling the influence of his office to the highest bidders. Americans sick and dying? Just a hoax by corrupt Democrats. This country never had a chance to control the virus, because we never had a President. We just had Trump."

In Trumplandia, black is white, up is down, and if you don't believe - and adore - every single word that comes out of the mouth of the Great Leader, you're a lousy, Trump-hating lib who wants to destroy America and everything that is great about it. 

This is the sort of garbage I see every day from some of my friends & relatives. They parrot his words as if they were indisputable fact, and any attempt I make to offer proof to the contrary is met with derision, no matter how authoritative the source. They post criticisms of Obama that supposedly illustrate how much better Trump is doing. I think it was just yesterday when I read a comment that said Obama was terrible at foreign policy, and that the world didn't fear us during his 8 years but now they do. 

I know teachers and citizens in several other nations - their attitude is far different than what we are hearing from the Trumpsters. Most are absolutely amazed that America has deteriorated to the extent it has, where we would choose this wannabe dictator to lead us - and are actually contemplating doing it again. 

170,000 dead is just the beginning. If this country validates his behavior by giving him another 4 years, I'm terrified at what might happen next."

And, in the best interests of all of us, I will not follow the latest mandate from the CDC which they published only after they were ordered to do so by political appointees. That mandate--to not get tested if I don't have symptoms--has one purpose. To falsely lower the reported numbers in order help what's-his-name get re-elected, at the direct expense of who knows how many more thousands of innocent lives. My goodness--"

The second symptom of that awful disease in the form of a debilitating deep recession that will ebb and flow as enabler states cut corners on safety and compassion as they try to gain favor with the Chief Pandemic Enabler.

And the juggernaut of Civil unrest that instead of being understood, listened to and worked with, has an anti-cheerleader tweeting out a wealthy White pair yelling out, ""White Power"".   The same president dodging questions about racist militias and QAnon, but more than willing to blame phantom menaces and align them with Democrats.

American Carnage has not been this carnivorous since the Civil War but there are no better angels now in charge, only the dark specter of a damaged soul who resides in darkness reaching out for more darkness.   And to bring us all down with him."
2020-08-27 5:35,"Further perspective:
As of the start of August, the USA had the world's highest per capita COVID-19 case rate at 1365 cases per hundred thousand residents.  This USA case rate may be compared to that of Germany at 260 cases per 100K residents, and to those of South Korea and Japan each at ""only"" 28 cases per 100K residents; (these figures consider the thirty highest population countries).  

Furthermore, the USA had the fourth-highest COVID-19 mortality rate.

We would have much less death and disease if we didn't have a president who doesn't accept the advice of experts, and who foolishly thinks the virus will ""magically disappear!"""

Take a person who didn't qualify for an unemployment extension who hasn't paid his rent in 4 months what do you if they don't wear a mask? Fine them $2500 or toss them in county lockup. Their lives aren't messed up enough?

Vietnam and New Zealand went unscathed for months. They took two very different approaches to the pandemic and still are. Look it up. No doubt it effects some people more than others, like people in their seventies. Otherwise, like any pandemic, it's random.

The nightly faux-religious invocations to the political conventions are unconvincing. Shouldn't we close our eyes and bow our heads when we address God? Can sincere prayers be read from a teleprompter?

Think about this when you are captive to a Christian priest or preacher delivering a tedious sermon disguised as a prayer. The reverend is either ignorant or showing contempt for Jesus' clear teaching on prayer. Christians should pray in private, ""in the innermost room with the door shut"", not ""in synagogues and at street corners that they may be seen by others"".  How merciful it would be to be spared somebody else's vacuous prayer!

Trump’s handling of COVID is the worst in the developed world.  Some other corrupt dictators (such as Bolsonaro in Brazil) have done just as bad, but that is hardly consolation.

The American people are no longer fooled by Trump’s lies and distractions.

There can be no progress in either health or economics until Trump leaves the White House.

It broke my heart that we as a nation could not contain this deadly virus enough to satisfy a South Korean whose Government managed to hold it off. I am so embarrassed for my country that we could not keep this man unemployed but got him elected to a job that he is unqualified to solve.

We paid the price as more than 200,000 (unofficial estimate) of our fellow citizen lie dead. Sadly more will die by the time leaves office...at least I hope Biden prevails. If Trump is reelected against all our hopes what will happen?"
2020-08-27 5:16,"I cannot imagine why Trump would want to be responsible for even more deaths.  Goes to the heart of his immorality and greed.  His administration has been historically tragic to a great magnitude and both he and his followers won't see it - the hubris he possesses is unbelievable.  The man is just insane, the GOP is insane and his dwindling supply of followers - and they are shrinking, not growing - are insane.  I equate them on the same level as Jim Jones and his kool-aide drinking followers.  

I wonder what it will be like for those Trump voters that survive, when they wake up, and they will.  I have a hard time wrapping my head around the number of deaths from this virus and I think I'm fairly realistic.  They have no empathy, no sympathy, no compassion, no feeling of humanity, absolutely nothing for anyone other than themselves.  

I need this to be over so we can have a national day of mourning, and we need to make it an annual, national occurrence, a reminder that greed, hatred, ignorance and racism (and possibly Republicans) have no place in the leadership of a democratic country.

It works on everything except reality. To deal with that, supply Scapegoats to take the blame.

This is the business model of the former Republican Party that is now the Trump Party. They are post-policy; they have and need nothing more than Big Lies and Scapegoats to win elections - and winning elections is all they care about. They no longer know how to govern - just loot.

It is espoused by pointed headed liberals who don't adhere to the Book of Genesis when explaining the beginning of earth, ignore climate change and don't know much about history or how our country was designed to work.  Thus we have a country lead by a man who doesn't read, watches too much TV and spends most of his time on ways to place himself front and center without taking any responsibility.  ""He tells it like it is"" is a favorite among  his supporters.  He hides nothing from the American people and his corruption it there for all to see.  Yet his popularity goes on.  My state, NC, is right now a toss up.  We learned nothing from supporting Trump in 2016.  If one has a brain tumor one would want a specialist to do the operation not someone who just walked into the hospital with no experience.  But it is OK to give the keys to a powerful nuclear nation to a failed businessman who never was elected to even a school committee.  This is sane?  Believing lies and conspiracies is sane?

Which is worse censorship or the pandemic?

Why should censorship compare to 180,000 deaths? A fair question - but one which has been removed from the comments section.

 But  here is why: Because without freedom of expression, you would never know that we are in the midst of a pandemic. I don't doubt for one second if not for free press, Trumps gvt. would shut down any mention of the pandemic and the death toll bad as it is would be 10 times worse.

You might like to see censorship when it blocks thoughts you disagree with it, but you have to ask yourself what happens when the other side has the power. 

The church at one time wanted to block Galileo from speaking about the earth revolving around the sun and on and on it goes. it is for this freedom why so many have laid down their lives.

Which is why it is worth considering why, giving up the freedom to express different views, is worth measuring against the cost of the terrible losses to this horrible pandemic. The deaths could be much worse without freedom of expression."

That was only one of the  reasons that have made him the most corrupt  president in US history and why he should not be re-elected. I think it's an error to overemphasize his incompetence with regard to the pandemic, since  his followers may believe and others speculate that a Democrat president would do no better.  Perhaps Biden and  Democrats should emphasize what won them the House in 2018, namely the Trump administration's continuing threat to repeal the ACA, and now to undermine Medicare and Social Security."

Worse, he's still willing for the American people to die to that end and is doing everything in his power to deny and distract from that, including corrupting CDC guidance, putting more Americans at risk, to reduce testing and reported infection rates, corrupting the FDA approval process to paint false dawns, and choreographing a political beauty pageant in which the pandemic is deliberately and cynically referred to in the past tense.

I've long realized that humans live in a status quo comfort zone that takes a substantial emotional whack to break loose from.

The Covid19 death numbers should provide that emotional whack. And they obviously don't, with a huge minority of American voters just sure that Trump has handled the coronavirus better than anyone else in the world.

Mr. Kristof, like others, has quoted the facts that have obviously been read by at least 1000 NYT readers. But what good are facts if only 0.0003% of the voters bother to read them? (An exaggeration, but if wrong by a factor of 10,000 it is still only 3%)

If people don't read the facts or just don't believe the facts when presented, what conclusion can we reach about the literacy of the average American?

Can't read, don't read, can't comprehend facts, too busy to read, that is the average American. Now tell me just exactly how that differs from an utterly illiterate population. Just because you can read, but don't ever bother is not an excuse.

Others wrangle over the 'unborn' but you also wrestle with the issues of other living things. I will never forget your mentioning how growing up on a farm when selecting a duck for the pot, its mate always stepped forward to protest. 

And you are spot on with your criticizing Trumps handling of the pandemic. He should be fired for it. But i have posted numerous comments I have about Dem positions. Some had few recommendations and others quite a few recommendations. Regardless all have been cancelled/removed, along with the many people who responded

Trumps troubling, puzzling response to the pandemic or the Dems cancel culture. Which would cause more death and harm in the long run is not clear. 

The pandemic will end, but the suppression of honest educated view points is potentially more harmful. Both sides seem to pick the science that complements their political position.

The R's say they've done all they could, so people who have no personal experience with the virus believe them. Many of the deceased had pre-existing conditions or were elderly, so their deaths were inevitable, goes their thought process. If the pandemic was real, there would be a parade of undertakers going door-to-door to collect the bodies of the dead, just as in the days of cholera, smallpox or Ebola. Most Americans simply do not care that more than 170,000 people have died - they are just statistics - and I fear that these uncaring, unconcerned individuals will let our democracy slip away.

And of course his observational skills in seeing what other countries have successfully done to defeat the virus are non-existent.

2020-08-27 15:56,"It is at first puzzling why Republicans deny both climate change  and the pandemic. Denial of climate change obviously protects the profits of fossil-fuel industrialists, but whose interests does it protect to deny the pandemic? While it is more diffuse and more subtle, it is the interest of business, more broadly. 

It was business who clamored to reopen society before the virus had been contained. It was business like meat-packing plants who continued working even when they were hotbeds of contamination. It was business of funeral homes to hide outbreaks. It is the business of bars to stay open. And it is the business of Fox News and Republicans to represent the interest of business. To that end it is okay with Republicans that 180,000 people have died.

Democrats were more willing to stay closed longer and take the short-term knocks for the long-term benefits because their interests are not limited to business profit; they also care about people and the environment. They knew in the long run business would do better if the virus was killed. Democrats are the party of ""A stitch in time saves nine.""

Republican are the party of, ""A stitch is a job-killing regulation!""

Angela Merkel, to her enormous credit, succeeded in achieving an early universal lockdown agreement that was bolstered by an effective federal public health strategy and economic relief for furloughed workers. Trump, in contrast pulled a Pontius Pilate whitewash, left all virus-fighting strategies to largely clueless governors and with it dereliction of his duty as president, in order to bask in his perceived economic success  as springboard to his reelection. When the economy soured due to the virus, instead of taking command, he blamed China, the democratic governors and, of course Barak Obama for the national failure. The end result, as all know, is the worst public health response among leading economies and a lot of lesser economic powerhouses. At this point only his propensity for deception and lies may convince many of his supporters that he indeed saved millions of lives.

It’s true that Trump and his administration made huge mistakes at the beginning.   But the grotesque mishandling of the pandemic – with politics subverting science - continues to this day.  A recent example is the administration strong-arming the CDC into recommending that people who have been exposed to the virus not be tested unless they are showing symptoms of the disease. 

The science is clear that asymptomatic carriers can and do spread the virus.  That’s one of the major reasons that the virus was so widespread before anyone in the administration took it seriously back in February and March.  Despite Trump’s assurances that the pandemic is behind us, nothing has changed.  Forcing the CDC to recommend that people who are likely to be asymptomatic carriers just get on with their lives is a certain recipe for disaster.  

Some current projections say over 300,000 deaths by December.  But there’s nothing magical about December.  If this administration stays in power, I don’t see any reason why the U.S. pandemic won’t continue for at least another year.

But at least we're seeing a near term reduction in the number of reported cases."

2020-08-27 16:57,"I count myself to be fortunate in not being in the USA.  i used to think myself unfortunate to not being there.  
From the right bank of the Atlantic, I see the entire world laughing at the President, and at all citizens of the USA for electing him - or not electing him, if actual votes for and against are reckoned.  

I hear stories about snake oil salesmen and the gullibility of Americans.  
I hear amazement and disbelief that anyone capable of suggesting taking bleach as a cure could be elected.  
I hear incredulity at a Statesman - the President, suggesting that less testing will reduce the number of cases.  

And it is truly scary to hear comments from the convention and from commenters here that can actually hold a view that he is somehow doing a good job - in anything.  

History will judge his time in office to be when the world lost interest in the USA.  Like the Romans, like the Mongols, like the british - the days of world domination and respect have now departed.  Even the broken USSR now manages US elections with impunity,  China is undoubtedly the next world power.  And it happened on Trump's watch."
2020-08-27 17:00,"Many years ago, a friend gave me a copy of ""The Death of Outrage"" by William Bennett.  She presented it to me not because of the actual subject matter (why isn't everyone up in arms over Bill Clinton lying about the Monica Lewinsky scandal) but because we were among the few people at our workplace that spoke up when seeing something that was not correct.  That gift still resonates with me as I watch Americans become more accepting of lying from our public officials as well as those officials not being held responsible for what occurs under their watch.  

We spent years hearing about Benghazi and the Congressional outrage over that attack.  How many Congressional investigations were there, how many hearings?  And, not to downplay this, four Americans were killed in that attack.  We have now surpassed 180,000 deaths in the US due to Covid-19, the vast majority of which were preventable.  Had our President kept his mouth shut and let his experts determine the course of action, this would have been a very different story.  But our President did get involved, overruled his experts, and the death toll is astonishing.  Where is the outrage over this?  Where is the accountability?  If Benghazi was so bad, why is a situation that has cost us 45,000 times more lives than Benghazi not even mentioned by the administration.  The incompetence and corruption being displayed by this administration is so shocking, yet it is now accepted as normal.  Where is the outrage?"

Ask any Canadian, and they will tell you without hesitation, ""keep the border to closed"" (both ways) to anything but highly controlled commercial products. 
It's not that Canadians dislike Americans, it's just that Canadians don't want the ""US virus."" 
Studies on the generic variations of the SARS-CoV-2 show that the variations that hit the USA did not come directly from China. They were variations of the original which started in China.
Secondly, it is well-established that folks of Chinese origin  who came back to the US and Canada went into immediate self-isolation. It's a cultural thing. Asians know much better how to protect themselves from epidemics than other cultures."

For many of us, the question is how could so many people, in spite of Trump's many failures as President--including his reprehensible response to the Coronoa virus--continue to follow him.

John McCain had a simple explanation for that unwavering support:  ""What he (Trump) did was he fired up the crazies"".  

It's not a stretch to see a comparison to the followers of the Rev. Jim Jones, who was able to convince more than 900 people to take cyanide.  Trump's followers, knowing that his inaction is responsible for tens of thousands more deaths from Covid-19 than there would have been had he taken appropriate action, doesn't seem to shake the faith of these literally fanatical voters. 

While the Dunning-Kruger effect may explain that the problem isn't just that Trump's followers are misinformed; it's that they are completely unaware that they are misinformed.  There's no fix for these people, so the focus should concentrate on making sure everyone else votes."

When you get to the point that a pandemic is killing Americans with almost unfettered impunity, and yet Fox News viewers still think the President is doing a good job, you realize that the problem is not the President, but the disinformation peddled daily, and seductively, by Fox News.  If our country and its Constitution actually manage to survive this sad section of our history, I wonder if we need to take a page out of Germany's post-WWII playbook, and ban certain types of inciting speech from the public domain.

But think about the period of Bush 2 when our country was last like this. Disaster after disaster. Trump hasn't started any wars but he has been thrown into others and has failed miserably. 

The RNC convention is basically the Trump family convention. How can Republicans stand for this nepotism and complain about Hunter Biden?

This popularity is not accidental: (a) he knows what he is doing, and (b) center left patiently awaits a disaster to attain the victim status they crave and want to cry about for the next four years.

Now, to the issue of doing the right thing.  

Trump has a clear mandate; destroy everything that helps center left of America to create a charred landscape in which only white christian (males) are dominant; the rest are either gone or too weakened to do anything.  

To that end, his move on the Corona pandemic was perfect.  He let populated zip codes suffer (all of them big city blue dots on a red map), and in the best traditions of eugenicists, let weak and old die.  He focused on figuring out how he (and Kushner) could personally profit.  If he failed, it is only to deny healthcare to blacks, brown, and immigrants completely; some are receiving care.  

Democrats think this triggers repulsion; instead it has triggered cloying sycophancy. He is the tobacco peddler who has doctors encouraging their children to chain smoke while pledging allegiance to him (see FL, GA, TX). If he needs a kidney tomorrow, half of America will rip both of the ones they have for him, and apologize for the delay.

Back on January 27, Joe Biden wrote an Op-Ed piece exhorting Trump to take action. Instead, Trump chose to deny, ignore, & minimize its threat. By squandering precious time, our delayed response enabled Americans to face a greater risk of infection & greatly worsened both the prevalence of illness & the associated economic damage entailed by the lockdown required to suppress the virus' spread.

And some of us understand that we've been fed lies and misdirection, that changing policy on testing to fudge the numbers leads to more infection and death, and that Trump and the sociopaths he surrounds himself with don't care if any of us die.

They have told us for decades that we just have to accept gun deaths in America. 40,000 deaths from guns a year is astronomically higher than any other developed country in the world, but as long as the gun lobby and gun manufacturers line their pockets, Republicans say about guns: it is what it is.

Similarly, no peer country has bungled the COVID19 responses and suffered the unnecessary levels of suffering, deaths, and consequences of disease that the U.S. has. 

It's almost as if Republicans are running on a platform of ""Acceptable Death.""  We must accept gun deaths. We must accept tens of thousands of avoidable COVID19 deaths. We must accept deaths from poverty and lack of health insurance. We must accept higher maternal mortality rates than other wealthy nations.

We have become numb to Trump to the point of normalizing his behavior.     Trump also knows this intuitively.
It took Hitler only 100 days to create the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany. American's are slow learners so its taken nearly four years for Trump to do the same here."

This smiling buffoon and his cronies Azar and Redfield did not do their job in protecting the country by not preparing for a pandemic by keeping the CDC SNS stocked as mandated by congress.
His self adoring smirks just make my blood pressure go through the roof.
